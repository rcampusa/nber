On the Global Financial Market Integration “Swoosh” and the Trilemma

                                         ABSTRACT

We propose a simple measure of de facto financial market integration based on a factor model of
monthly equity returns, which can be computed back to the first era of financial globalization for
17 countries. Global financial market integration follows a “swoosh” shape – i.e. high pre-1913,
still higher post-1990, low in the interwar period – rather than the other shapes hypothesized in
earlier literature. We find no evidence of financial globalization reversing since the Great
Recession as claimed in other recent studies. De jure capital account openness and global growth
uncertainty are the two main determinants of long-run global financial market integration. We use
our measure to revisit the debate on the trilemma between financial openness, the exchange rate
regime, and monetary policy autonomy, and on whether the trilemma has recently morphed into a
dilemma due to global financial cycles. We find evidence consistent with the trilemma and
inconsistent with the dilemma hypothesis, both throughout history and for the recent decades;
non-US central banks still exert more control over domestic interest rates when exchange rates
are flexible in economies open to global finance.

        The process of international financial integration is not a gentle climb towards ever higher

peaks. This is true both from a short-run and from a long-run perspective. Bekaert and Harvey (1995),

focusing on the post-1990 financial globalization wave in emerging equity markets, suggested that de

facto integration may exhibit reversals and does not become necessarily stronger over time. Evidence

that financial globalization might have partly reversed has resurfaced in the wake of the Great

Recession (see e.g. Rose and Wieladek (2014), van Rijckeghem and Weder (2014), Giannetti and

Laeven (2012, 2016)). These recent papers have focussed on banks, or bonds, but not on equity

markets. There is also a thriving literature documenting the recent surge in capital controls in

emerging markets, along with their economic effects (see e.g. Jeanne and Korinek (2010), Ostry et al.

(2012), Forbes, Fratzscher and Straub (2013), Pasricha et al. (2015), among many others).

        From a long-run perspective, there is an old-standing debate among macroeconomists and

economic historians as to whether international financial integration was, in fact, “stronger” pre-1913,

a period also known as the first era of financial globalization, compared to the globalization wave

which started with capital account liberalizations in advanced economies in the 1980s and in

emerging markets in the 1990s, a period also referred to as the modern era of financial globalization.

Bordo and Flandreau (2003), Bordo and Murshid (2006) and Quinn (2003) deem the early period

more globalized. Bordo, Eichengreen and Irwin (1999), Mauro et al. (2002), and Quinn and Voth

(2008) claim the opposite is true. Bordo and Flandreau (2003), Obstfeld and Taylor (2003, 2004), and

Goetzmann et al. (2005) argue that global financial integration follows a U-shape pattern with equal

degrees of integration before 1914 and after 1970. Volosovych (2011), focusing on sovereign bond

markets, claims that global financial integration is rather characterised by a J-shape pattern, with a

trough in the 1920s. Rangvid et al. (2016) look at equity market integration over 1875-2012 and find

that financial integration in the later part of their sample is “very high” relative to earlier periods.

        The interest from macroeconomists in measuring international financial market integration

over long time periods has been spurred by recent policy debates on the trilemma, the trade-offs

between the exchange rate regime, financial openness and monetary policy autonomy (see e.g.

Shambaugh (2004), Obstfeld, Shambaugh, and Taylor (2005), Miniane and Rogers (2007), Bluedorn

                                                                                                           2
and Bowdler (2010), Klein and Shambaugh (2013), Aizenmann, Chinn and Ito (2014), Pasricha et al.

(2015)). In particular, several articles (e.g. Rey (2013), Miranda-Agrippino and Rey (2014), Bruno

and Shin (2015a, 2015b), Passari and Rey (2015) as well as Obstfeld (2015) for a discussion) stress

the critical role played by the US dollar and US monetary policy in setting global liquidity and credit

conditions. They suggest that non-US central banks have lost their ability to influence domestic long-

term interest rates, even in the presence of flexible exchange rates, due to the existence of “US-

driven” global financial cycles in liquidity and credit. As a result, the trilemma may have morphed

into a dilemma between financial openness and monetary policy autonomy.

        In this paper, we propose a simple measure of equity market integration which can be

computed back to the first era of financial globalization for 17 countries. The key strengths of our

measure are that it describes integration at relatively high monthly frequencies; captures de facto, and

not simply de jure, integration; and provides a framework to test formally for the various shapes of the

temporal pattern of integration hypothesized in earlier literature. We can also use our measure to

distinguish global from regional patterns of integration and to uncover the economic sources of

financial integration, both at the global and regional level.

        The measure employs conditional betas of a country’s stock return with respect to global and

regional equity market returns. While betas may be affected by both cash flow comovements and

discount rates, they provide an economically meaningful measurement of the sensitivity of a country’s

equity market to global and regional shocks. Moreover, they do not suffer from the volatility bias

plaguing simple correlation statistics, which arises because much of the time-variation in correlations

is accounted for by changes in factor volatilities (see e.g. Forbes and Rigobon (2002), Dungey et al.

(2004), Bekaert, Harvey and Ng (2005), Bekaert et al. (2014)). In contrast, the fundamental change in

risk occurring upon capital market liberalization naturally increases dynamic betas (see Chari and

Henry (2004) for a simple model). Empirical studies focusing on liberalizations in emerging markets,

such as Bekaert and Harvey (1997), European equity markets, such as Baele (2005) and American

Depository Receipt introductions (a firm-specific liberalization), such as Lewis (2015), show jumps in

betas around these events.

                                                                                                      3
        We use this measure to test several hypotheses.

        First, we assess which factors explain the time series and cross-country variation in de facto

financial market integration over the long run. We find that de jure financial openness is a statistically

significant determinant of de facto integration, while trade openness and financial development are

not, which confirms the results of Bekaert et al. (2011) for the modern era of financial globalization.

In terms of explained variation, however, we find that global growth uncertainty explains an equally

important share of global financial market integration, while a third significant determinant, namely a

variable measuring the incidence of high volatility across markets, explains only a minuscule share.

        Second, we formally test whether the long-run temporal pattern of de facto financial market

integration follows a flat line, a U shape, a J shape or even a “swoosh” shape (i.e. the trademark logo

of a famous athletic shoe and clothing manufacturer). In so doing, we distinguish explicitly between

global and regional financial market integration patterns. We fail to reject the presence of a swoosh

pattern for de facto global financial market integration, i.e. high pre-1913, still higher post-1990, low

in the interwar period, but statistically reject the other shapes previously hypothesized. We do not find

a clear regional financial market integration pattern.

        Third, we use the measure to test whether the Great Recession has been associated with a

reversal in the process of de facto financial globalization, as claimed by recent studies, and do not find

evidence in support of this claim.

        Fourth, we use our measure of de facto global financial market integration to revisit the

debate on the existence of a monetary policy trilemma in history. We find evidence that pass-through

from base country to domestic interest rates – at both short and long maturities – depends on whether

an economy is open to global finance or closed, and on whether it has pegged or flexible exchange

rates, in line with the trilemma hypothesis. For the recent period, the evidence also points on balance

more toward the trilemma than the dilemma, even though it is difficult to conduct inference in an

increasingly globalized world.

        The paper is organized as follows. Section I presents the empirical framework which we use

to measure global financial market integration over the long run and discusses how de facto

                                                                                                        4
integration evolves over time. Section II presents our formal test of the long-run temporal pattern of

financial market integration and provides evidence consistent with a swoosh shape. Section III

employs our measure to revisit the debate on the trilemma versus dilemma hypothesis.



                  I. Measuring Global Financial Market Integration over the Long Run



         This section outlines the model we estimate, elaborates on the concept of time-varying de

facto financial market integration, and discusses how integration evolves over time.



A. The Factor Model



                                                              A.1. General Specification

         We formulate an international factor model with two factors – a global market factor, and a

regional market factor, Ft ' = [ Ft , Ft ] . The two factors are value-weighted market indices, so
                                   Glob Reg



that the model potentially embeds different conditional CAPMs as special cases. When the beta on the

first factor is zero, the model becomes a regional CAPM; when the beta of the regional factor is set to

zero, the model can act as a world CAPM. As in any factor model, the correlation between portfolios

is increasing in the factor exposures of the portfolios and the magnitude of the factor volatilities. The

use of these two factors ensures that the model satisfactorily fits comovements across countries. 1

         The full model is:

             Ri ,t = α i + lt + βi,tglo Ft glo ,\ i + βi,treg Ft reg ,\ i + γ glo      glo          reg      reg                 (1)
                                                                              i, t ' X i, t − k + γ i, t ' X i, t − k + e i ,t



                                                   βi,tglo = b0glo + b 1glo'X glo                                                (2)
                                                                              i, t − k



                                                  βi,treg = b0reg + b 1reg'X reg                                                 (3)
                                                                             i, t − k ,

  The analysis in Bekaert, Hodrick, and Zhang (2009), Bodnar, Dumas, and Marston (2003), and Brooks and Del Negro
(2006) motivates the use of both global/international and domestic factors from a statistical perspective, even for developed
markets. Rangvid et al. (2016) use the cross-country dispersion of stock returns as their main measure of global financial
market integration but they also calculate a measure based on a world-CAPM in robustness checks.
                                                                                                                                       5
where Ri,t is the excess return on the local equity index in country i during month t, expressed in

dollars (i.e., the dollar equity return minus the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield in monthly units), α is a

country fixed effect, λ is a year effect, Ftglo is the global market factor, Ftreg is the regional market

factor and X is a vector of control variables designed to capture time and cross-sectional variation in

factor exposures. These variables are country-specific, and are typically lagged by one year. If the

dimension of X is k, the vectors b1glo and b1reg are k × 1. When the model includes control variables X,

the conditional mean also depends automatically on lagged Xs. The sample period is January 1885 to

June 2014. It contains up to 1,554 monthly observations for each of 17 country-equity portfolios,

which are split into three regions (Europe, Northern America and Asia-Pacific).2

         To avoid adding-up constraints and spurious correlations, the factors are value-weighted

across countries, but exclude returns of country i itself. To obtain an intuitive interpretation of the

estimates of the factor loadings, we orthogonalize the two factors as in Bekaert, Harvey and Ng

(2005), Bekaert, Hodrick, and Zhang (2009) and Bekaert et al. (2014). The regional market factor is

orthogonalized by regressing regional market returns on global market returns over the full sample

period and then using the residuals of this regression as the regional market factor. The

orthogonalized factors are estimated for each country individually as country i itself is excluded from

the market factors. This enables us to distinguish global from regional patterns of financial market

integration. Table I contains an overview of the data and selected descriptive statistics. Further details

on the sources of the data and on the methodology used to assemble them are provided in Appendix

A.

cross-sectional and time variation in the factor loadings βi,tglo and βi,treg. This practice has a long

tradition in finance; see, for example, Ferson and Harvey (1991) and Dumas and Solnik (1995). 3 We

entertain seven potential instruments, which are listed in Table I, to distinguish between different

channels and hypotheses regarding the sources of financial market integration, both at the global and

regional level. 4

          The first three channels include measures of external exposures through trade and financial

openness. Several studies have suggested that equity return comovements increase with financial and

economic integration (see e.g. Mendoza and Quadrini (2010), Brière, Chapelle, and Szafarz (2012),

Fratzscher (2012)). The trade channel in particular has often been associated with international

spillovers and, in some cases, contagion (see e.g. Kaminsky and Reinhart (2000), Forbes (2004),

Caramazza, Ricci and Salgano (2004), and Baele and Inghelbrecht (2009)). Hence, we use trade

openness, measured as exports plus imports scaled by GDP in country i and year t, as a first potential

determinant of the cross-sectional and time variation in factor exposures. Another potential

determinant, specific to regional financial integration, is regional trade openness, which is defined as

the sum of country i’s exports and imports of goods to/from its neighbours, that is the countries

belonging to the country i’s region, scaled by total trade in year t.

          A third potential determinant is de jure capital account openness, a natural determinant of de

facto financial integration (see Kose et al. (2006), Bekaert et al. (2011)). We use the indices of capital

account openness assembled by Quinn and Voth (2008) and Quinn and Toyoda (2008). These indices

measure the extent of restrictions to capital outflows and inflows by residents and nonresidents in

country i and year t.

          Domestic financial development is the fourth potential determinant of the cross-sectional and

time variation in factor exposures we consider. Several researchers have stressed that poorly

developed financial systems may impair financial integration (see Bekaert and Harvey, (1995);

Bekaert et al. (2011)). Equity market illiquidity is one reason preventing foreign institutional investors

3
  Note that we do not mean to suggest that these “instruments” are “exogenous” in the strict sense of econometric
identification. In the asset pricing literature, as discussed in Ferson and Harvey (1991) for instance, this term is simply used
for variables that are not returns, are pre-determined (in a temporal sense) and are used to model time-variation in factor
exposures or prices of risk. Also, the instruments are too slow-moving to reflect public information that may instantaneously
change prices and potentially cause contagion (see Connolly and Wang (2003)).

  We use annual observations to fill in for monthly observations.
                                                                                                                              7
from investing in emerging markets according to some surveys (see e.g. Chuhan (1994)). Poor

liquidity as a priced local factor may also lead to valuation differentials and different betas relative to

global benchmarks (see Acharya and Pedersen (2005) or Bekaert, Harvey and Lundblad (2007) for

models incorporating liquidity risks). The metric of financial development we use is the ratio of

equity market capitalization to output, which we obtained from Rajan and Zingales (2003) and Beck,

Demirgüç-Kunt, and Levine (2010).

        Factor exposures may also vary over time with global shocks, such as oil and other

commodity price shocks or shifts in global risk aversion. Data limitations prevent us from casting a

wide net in terms of variables. We consider just two specific variables. The first one is a measure of

global oil price spikes, defined as the deviation (in logarithms) between the current oil price and its

five-year moving average. Hamilton (2005) shows that 9 out of 10 U.S. recessions since World War II

were preceded by a sudden increase in oil prices. A global recessionary shock induced by changes in

oil prices is likely to increase global factor exposures. Increases in (global) risk aversion may generate

the opposite effect. Higher risk aversion may lead investors to retreat away from foreign equity

markets considered as risky towards domestic equity markets or other financial assets considered as

safe, leading to a divergence in valuations and increased segmentation (see the discussion in Bekaert

et al. (2011), for instance). In almost any model, high risk aversion should increase the volatility of

stock returns (see e.g. Bekaert, Engstrom and Xing (2009)) so we measure risk aversion indirectly

through volatility. Specifically, we measure the share of countries in the sample with high equity

market volatility in a given month. We estimate the conditional volatility of stock returns for each

country of our sample using a GARCH(1,1) model. We normalise the conditional volatilities of each

country’s stock returns and define the high market volatility variable as the proportion of the 17

country-specific volatilities in excess of 1.65 in a given month. This yields a global “volatility spike”

time series with monthly observations over January 1885-June 2014. Note that high return volatility

itself may lead to higher return correlations not associated with financial integration, which is

captured in our model through the factor volatilities and does not affect our integration measure (see

section B.5 for further discussion).

                                                                                                         8
          The last potential determinant of the time variation in factor loadings is uncertainty in

earnings growth, which is another possible source of financial market segmentation. For instance, in a

pricing model with stochastic growth opportunities and discount rates, Bekaert et al. (2011) show that

under a strong notion of integration, encompassing both financial and economic integration, the time-

varying components of industry price-to-earnings ratios are identical across countries, and are

determined entirely by variation in the world discount rate and world growth opportunities. However,

even under the null hypothesis of full financial and economic integration, industry earnings yield

differentials between a country and the world market can still arise because of differences in earnings

growth volatility. Because harmonised and consistent data on earnings growth are not directly

available for our century-long panel, we use real GDP growth instead. Measuring a conditional

volatility is challenging and we use three different measures. The first is the logarithm of the standard

deviation of real GDP growth in each country over non-overlapping windows of 5 years, which yields

17 country-specific times series of annual observations on local growth uncertainty which are kept

constant over 5-year intervals.5 Analogously, we use the logarithm of the standard deviation of real

GDP growth in each country over overlapping windows of 5 years centred around the current

observation (with one year increments), which yields for each country local growth uncertainty

measures varying in each year. These two measures are imperfect indictors of country-specific real

uncertainty both requiring a number of time series observations to obtain a proxy for an estimate at

time t. An alternative metric we employ is the natural logarithm of the cross-sectional dispersion of

real GDP growth for the 17 countries of our sample in a given year. This yields a global time series

with annual observations over 1885-2014. The cross-sectional variance can be decomposed into an

estimate of the country-specific variance (the average country-specific volatility minus the “world”

variance) and an estimate of the variance of the country averages (see Bekaert, Harvey, Kiguel and

Wang (2016)). It is therefore correlated with the times series uncertainty of growth opportunities

worldwide. Because of its second component, it also measures the divergence of growth opportunities


5
  The rationale for using logs rather than levels is that the distribution of real GDP growth is heavily fat-tailed because of
two observations in 1945 and 1946, when output collapsed (or jumped from an extremely low base) in several countries in
the wake of the end of World War II and the move to a postwar economy.
                                                                                                                            9
across countries at a given point in time. Increases in both components of this global growth

uncertainty measure would tend to decrease de facto integration.



B. Model Estimation and Measuring Time-Varying Financial Market Integration



                                                     B.1. Model Estimation

    We estimate our model for all countries jointly by means of pooled OLS. Standard errors account

for heteroskedasticity and are clustered by country. Note that the instruments Xi,t-k are lagged by one

year to prevent an unobserved factor from simultaneously influencing both returns and the

fundamental X in a given period and thereby generating a spurious relationship between both.6

         When estimating the full model in equations (1) to (3), we consider two different model

specifications. In a first step, we include each of the instruments individually. In a second step, we

build on the work of David Hendry (see, for instance, Hendry and Krolzig (2005)) to pare down the

regression to a more manageable number of independent variables. We start out with the full model

including all instruments simultaneously, and then step-by-step reduce the model by excluding the

interaction variables with insignificant parameters. If all interaction effects are insignificant, the

variable is dropped from the regression. This approach aims to reduce the dimension of the model and

to arrive at a model that can be interpreted in an economically meaningful way. Convergence was

            B.2. Measuring Time-Varying Global and Regional Financial Market Integration

         We define a benchmark, β           glo
                                                  , for global market integration as the (weighted) average across

countries and time of the βi,tglo estimates, i.e.

                                                  1 1 N T                                                              (4)
                                     β glo =         ∑ ∑ wi,t βiglo,t ,
                                                  N T i =1 t =1

(weighted) average across countries and time of the βi,treg estimates, i.e.

and the relative regional market integration of country i at time t is defined as β ireg

                      B.3. The Temporal Pattern of Financial Market Integration

        Table II reports pairwise correlations of the instruments in vector X. The correlations, albeit

statistically significant, are generally low in terms of economic magnitude (at around 15-20% or less

in absolute value in most cases, and close to 40% for only a few pairs of variables). This suggests that

each instrument has the potential to contribute specific information regarding the underlying

determinants of the cross-sectional and temporal variation in global and regional financial market

integration. The only exception, unsurprisingly, is the correlation between global and local growth

uncertainty measures, which reaches almost 60%.

                                                  Table II

        Next, Table III reports the estimates of the conditional global and regional beta estimates

from the full model equations (1) to (3). Each instrument is included individually in the estimates

reported in columns 2 to 7, while all seven instruments are included in column 8. Note that we do not

report estimates including the local growth uncertainty measures, which are never significant in

multivariate specifications. Moreover, in univariate specifications only the interactions with the global

factor were significant – albeit with the expected (negative) sign – which suggests that our results are

driven primarily by global growth uncertainty.

        We obtain a parsimonious model in column 9 by excluding the variables with insignificant

parameters. All the estimates control for country fixed effects, year effects and for the direct effects of

the instruments included in vector X (whose coefficients are not reported to save space). In column

(1), we report a specification without instruments; the global factor beta is 0.68 and the regional factor
                                                                                                        11
beta is 0.29, both significantly different from zero. The model estimates suggest that de jure capital

account openness exerts a positive and statistically significant effect on global betas, an effect that is

preserved in the multivariate specifications. Trade openness and financial development are

statistically significant determinants of global betas individually, but not in the multivariate

specification, which confirms earlier results in Bekaert et al. (2011) for the modern era of financial

globalization. The global oil price variable is statistically significant individually, but it is not in the

multivariate specification. Higher uncertainty in real earnings growth reduces global betas

significantly, in line with the model predictions of Bekaert at al. (2011). Global betas tend to increase

significantly in periods of heightened market volatility, although the economic magnitude of the effect

is economically very small (more on this below). Finally, while there are some significant univariate

results, among all the instruments only de jure capital account openness exerts a statistically

significant – and positive – effect on regional betas, both in the univariate and multivariate

specifications. Therefore, the final specification reported in column (9) contains capital openness (for

both regional and global betas), growth uncertainty and the market volatility variable (the latter two

only for global betas). We now further analyse the implications of this model for the time-variation in

financial market integration.

                                                 Table III

        Figure 1 shows the evolution between 1885 and 2014 of the unweighted (thick grey lines) and

value-weighted (light grey lines) cross-country averages of the measures of financial market

integration along with the corresponding conditional beta estimates. Global measures are shown in

Panel A, while regional measures are in Panel B.

                                                 Figure 1

        That the temporal pattern of global financial market integration follows a swoosh shape is

apparent from the figure. During the first era of financial globalization, de facto global financial

market integration was close to its century-long average. It then decreased significantly in the wake of

World War I, but recovered temporarily until the early 1930s. A nadir was reached immediately after

World War II, when de facto global financial market integration stood at roughly 90% below its

                                                                                                         12
century-long average. Since the 1950s, de facto global financial market integration has increased

steadily. However, it exceeded pre-1913 levels only after 1990. De facto global financial market

integration has remained at historically high levels since the global financial crisis broke out in 2007,

at about 30% above its century-long average in 2014, notwithstanding the capital controls and other

financial protectionist measures taken in some countries, recently. The temporal pattern of regional

financial market integration seems less clear, being in-between a swoosh and a U-shaped pattern.

        A complementary perspective is provided by Figures 2 and 3 which show the conditional

global and regional beta estimates for each country and for selected years, namely: 1913, 1928, 1945,

1973, 1990, and 2008. The temporal pattern of global financial market integration is nicely swoosh-

shaped in all countries, which suggests that it is not only a broad overall trend but also a country-level

phenomenon. The temporal pattern of regional financial market integration is less clear.

                                              Figures 2, 3



                    B.4. Determinants of Variation in Financial Market Integration

        What is the relative economic importance of the determinants of global financial market

integration? Figure 4 gets at the issue by showing the evolution between January 1885 and June 2014

of the value-weighted averages of the conditional global beta estimates of our 17 countries when only

one of each of the three significant instruments of vector X remains active, in turn. This is achieved

by setting the loadings on the other significant instruments at their respective means. The figure

makes clear that de jure capital account openness and effective global financial market integration go

hand in hand. It also makes clear that heightened global growth uncertainty pulls in the opposite

direction, reducing global financial market integration in an economically meaningful way. In

contrast, the economic importance of high market volatility periods on financial market integration is

comparably much smaller, as is evident from the figure.

                                                Figure 4

        That de jure capital account openness and global growth uncertainty opportunities explain the

lion’s share of the predictable variation in global equity returns is confirmed more directly by the

                                                                                                       13
variance ratio analysis of Table IV. For each of the three statistically significant instruments j (i.e. de

capital account openness, global growth uncertainty and high market volatility periods) of the

parsimonious specification, we calculate the variance ratio for the conditional global beta estimates as

                                        cov[bˆ 1glo'X glo        ˆ glo glo
                                        j             i, t − k , b1, j X i ,t − k ]
                                   VR =
                                              var[bˆ glo'X glo ]
                                                             1      i, t − k


        By definition, these variance ratios sum to one. The analysis confirms our earlier

observations. De jure capital account openness explains 53% of global financial market integration,

against 47% for global growth uncertainty. The proportions are statistically significantly different

from zero but we cannot reject that they are equal. In contrast, high market volatility periods explain a

negligible part of global financial market integration, which is statistically insignificant. As for

regional equity returns, recall that their predictable variation is fully explained by de jure capital

account openness.

                                                    Table IV



                                            B.5. Model Validation

    As stressed e.g. by Cochrane (2001), Lewellen and Nagel (2006) and Brusa, Ramadorai and

Verdelhan (2014), a challenge to our conditional factor model is that it requires the econometrician to

know the ‘‘true’’ state variables. Lewellen and Nagel (2006) propose a methodology to circumvent

this problem which does not require specifying the set of conditioning information. As long as betas

are relatively stable within a certain period, simple factor regressions estimated over a short window –

using no conditioning variables – provide direct estimates of assets’ conditional betas. Using rolling

5-year windows of observations, it is possible to obtain time series of time-varying betas. In

particular, the windows are “forward” and non-overlapping. That is, we split the sample in 5-year

periods and compute the betas over these 5 years. For each starting point of a 5 year period, the beta

is set equal to that rolling beta; for periods in-between the beta is a linearly interpolated number

between the previous and next beta. The choice of a forward window is consistent with the idea that



                                                                                                        14
our factor model produces conditional betas. A well specified factor model should then produce beta

estimates that are insignificantly different from the rolling beta estimates.

    Figure 5 shows the evolution between 1885 and 2014 of the conditional global (Panel A) and

regional (Panel B) betas (both shown as thick grey lines) together with 90% confidence bands

obtained from the corresponding pooled rolling beta estimates (shown as light grey lines) and the

point estimates (shown as black dashed lines). Our factor model does, in fact, pretty well. The simple

rolling global beta estimates also follow a swoosh shape. The conditional betas fall mostly well within

the confidence bands of the simple rolling beta estimates. The conditional global (regional) betas fall

within the bands 81% (82%) of the time. When conditional betas are outside the bands, they tend to

be quite close to them. The conditional betas overestimate the extent of global financial market

integration relative to what rolling betas would predict during World War I a bit, which might suggest

that the conflict led to a reversal in financial globalization that was partially unexpected, but they do a

good job during World War II. Excluding the two world wars, the conditional global and regional

betas fall within the bands 82% and 84% of the time, respectively, which is a marginal improvement

relative to the full sample. It is only starting from the early 2000s that the conditional betas

underestimate systematically the extent of global financial market integration relative to what rolling

betas would predict. Because this is indirect evidence that financial globalization did not reverse since

the Great Recession in 2007-2009, as claimed in other studies, we come back to this finding below.

                                                 Figure 5

        Figures B1 and B2 in Appendix B show the corresponding betas and confidence bands broken

down by country. The figures confirm that the country-specific conditional betas mostly fall well

within the confidence bands of the simple rolling beta estimates.

        A simpler measure to quantify de facto integration is the average correlation between equity

markets (see Quinn and Voth (2008)). However, correlations suffer from the volatility bias described

in the seminal work of Forbes and Rigobon (2002). As volatilities tend to dramatically increase during

crises, increased correlations are not necessarily indicative of higher interdependence between equity

markets. Under the null of our model, the comovement between equity markets is determined by the

                                                                                                        15
factor exposures (the betas) and the variance-covariance matrix of the factors. Such a model can

potentially fit the observed increase in correlations during a crisis through an increase in factor

volatilities, while betas – the true measure of interdependence – remain stable. Assuming uncorrelated

factors, this is true because the correlation between a particular equity market and a factor is then the

beta with respect to that factor, times the ratio of factor to equity market volatility, which can be

shown to be increasing in the factor’s volatility (see also the discussion in Bekaert et al. (2014) for

further details). This is of particular importance during the global financial crisis of 2007-2008 when

volatility reached exceptionally high levels, which could have biased upwards correlations in

international equity markets. As a result, if the conditional betas of our reduced-form factor model did

not increase during the global financial crisis, while unconditional correlations did, this is additional

evidence that the model is well specified.

        We examine the difference between our beta measures and a correlation measure in Figure 6.

It shows the evolution between 1885 and 2014 of the unweighted averages of the conditional global

and regional beta estimates (shown as thick grey lines) together with 1-year forward rolling (non-

overlapping) pooled correlations between the equity excess returns Ri,t and the global and regional

market factors, respectively. The correlation between the two global measures is relatively high, at

0.80, but it is a paltry 0.15 for the two regional measures, suggesting that betas and correlations may

produce different inferences. The differences are indeed pronounced during the recent global crisis.

Consider Panel B of Figure 6 first. Bilateral correlations between country returns and the regional

market factor peak at the time of the collapse of Lehman Brothers, which is suggestive of a possible

volatility bias. In contrast, the conditional regional betas remain more stable. For global market

integration, the correlation between the beta and correlation measures varies substantially over time.

For the recent globalization period (2001-2014) it is in fact zero, but even that number hides very

different sub-sample behaviour. Over the 2001-2007 pre-crisis period, the correlation is -0.67,

whereas over the recent crisis period (2008-2014) it is 0.44. Thus, while a correlation measure may

reproduce some of the long-run patterns of long-run financial integration as Figure 6 demonstrates, it

cannot really be used to make precise inferences.

                                                                                                      16

                             II. The Swoosh in Financial Market Integration



        While the swoosh pattern in de facto financial market integration is apparent in our full model

estimates, we here attempt to formally test for it. This section sets out a framework to do so and

reports the results.



A. Testing for a Swoosh Pattern

        To test for the swoosh pattern, we start by estimating the following simple variant of our two-

factor model:

                   Ri ,t = α i + lt + (β glo                   + (β reg                   + e i ,t   (6)
                                         j ' D j ) Ft               j ' D j ) Ft
                                                      glo ,\ i                   reg ,\ i



where j =1, 2, … k; and Dk denotes a dummy variable which equals one over time period k and zero

otherwise. All variables are defined similarly as before, and we include the same two factors – a

global market factor, and a regional market factor. In practice, we set k = 3 and focus on three

subperiods of interest, namely: 1885-1913 (which is often referred to as the first era of financial

globalization; see e.g. Bordo, Cavallo, and Meissner (2010)); 1914-1990, which includes the interwar

period (when several countries adopted protectionist and capital control measures in the run-up to

World War II), the Bretton Woods period (when capital controls, albeit possibly leaky, were still

prevalent), and its immediate aftermath; the third subperiod is 1990-2014, which is often referred to as

the second era of financial globalization, despite the alleged reversal since the Great Recession. This

model embeds a simple constant-beta model, which can be straightforwardly tested through a simple

Wald test.

        However, we can also formally test whether the temporal pattern of de facto international

financial integration follows a U shape, as hypothesised by e.g. Bordo and Flandreau (2003), Obstfeld

and Taylor (2003, 2004), and Goetzmann et al. (2005); a J (or L-inverted) shape, as argued by

Volosovych (2011); or a swoosh shape, as we posit. All tests can formally distinguish between global
                                                                                                       17
and regional financial integration patterns. Considering again the three aforementioned subperiods

(i.e. pre-1913, 1914-1990 and 1990-2014) and three dummy variables Dk, j =1, 2, 3, the corresponding

Wald restriction tests are, respectively

                                H 0 : β1f = β 3f , β1f > β 2f , β 3f > β 2f

for the U shape hypothesis,

                                H 0 : β1f = β 2f , β 3f > β1f , β 3f > β 2f

for the J (or L-inverted) shape hypothesis, and

                                H 0 : β1f > β 2f , β 3f > β1f , β 3f > β 2f

for the swoosh shape hypothesis, with f = glo, reg.



B. Empirical Results



                              B.1. Simple Constant-Beta Model Estimates

        Table V reports the unconditional beta estimates from the constant-beta version of the model

in equation (6) obtained by OLS in columns 1 to 3. Estimates obtained by excluding outliers from the

sample (i.e. excess equity returns larger than 30% within a month in absolute value) are reported in

column 4. Those obtained with a random-effect estimator are reported in column 5. The estimates of

columns 3 to 5 control for both country and year effects. The unconditional global beta is about 0.7,

while the regional market factor beta is estimated to be about 0.3. The economic magnitude of these

estimates is not too far off those obtained over much shorter samples. For instance, Bekaert et al.

(2014) obtain unconditional beta estimates for a sample of 415 country-sector portfolios over the

period January 1995-March 2009 of about 0.4 for both their global financial and US equity market

factors, as well as about 0.5 for their domestic market factor. However, their portfolios included many

emerging market portfolios. The R-squared of the regression is on the order of 20%-30%, which is in

the same ballpark as the goodness of fit of the models estimated by e.g. Bekaert et al. (2014). What is

also striking is that the estimates remain remarkably robust across estimation methods. The rho

                                                                                                    18
statistic indicates that the country fixed effects are in fact not that important, which is also obvious

comparing the results in columns (1) and (2) with the rest.

                                               Table V

        In Table C1 in Appendix C. we report estimates of the constant-beta model in which factors

are GDP-weighted rather than value-weighted. The estimated betas remain largely unaltered in terms

of sign, statistical significance and economic magnitude relative to our base estimates, suggesting that

our results do not hinge upon a particular weighting scheme.

        Table VI reports estimates of the constant-beta model obtained by OLS on the full sample (in

column 1) together with estimates obtained on alternative subperiods, namely: pre-1913, 1914-1990,

1990-2014, 1990-2006 and 2007-2014 (in columns 2 to 6). The time variation in betas confirm the

swoosh pattern we detected with our dynamic model. The estimate for the unconditional global beta

prior to 1913 is close to the full sample estimate, at about 0.7. It is 25% larger than the estimate for

the period between 1914 and 1945 (i.e. roughly 0.5), which is consistent with the decline in global

financial market integration in the interwar period noted by previous scholars, and the adoption by

several countries of protectionist and capital control measures then. Global financial market

integration picks up between 1945 and 1990, with the estimated global beta increasing to 0.6, albeit

still remaining lower than prior to World War I. It is only after 1990 that global financial market

integration exceeds pre-1913 levels. Our global beta estimate reaches indeed about 0.9 for the 1990-

2006 period, and 1.1 for the 2007-2014 period. Regional betas decrease from 0.36 in the pre-war

period to 0.21 in the 1914-1990 period, but then increase again to exceed 0.50 in the post-1990 period.

                                               Table VI

        A formal test of the constant-parameter model is in Table VII, which presents estimates of

model equation (6) with three period dummies (pre-1913, 1914-1990 and 1990-2014). A Wald test

overwhelmingly rejects the null of equality of the global and regional beta coefficients over the three

subperiods (see the first row of Panel C in Table VII). Parenthetically, there is not only substantial

heterogeneity in betas over time, but also across countries. This is suggested in Figure B3 in

Appendix B which shows country-by-country estimates over the full sample of the global and

regional market factor betas obtained from the simple constant-beta model. Global betas are as low as

0.4 in Austria and Japan, and as high as over 0.8 in the Netherlands, Germany and Canada. Regional

betas are as low as almost zero for Australia and as high as 0.6 for the US or Germany.



                    B.2. Testing Temporal Patterns of Financial Market Integration

        We now test formally whether financial market integration follows a U shape, a J (or L-

inverted) shape, or a swoosh shape, along the lines described in Section II.A, which requires the

testing of equality and inequality restrictions.

        The results of the corresponding Wald restriction tests, based on the estimates of model

equation (6) on the full sample, are in Table VII (see the second to fourth row of Panel C). We can

reject the null hypotheses that de facto global financial market integration over the last century is

characterised by a U-shape process, as hypothesised by e.g. Bordo and Flandreau (2003), Obstfeld

and Taylor (2003, 2004), and Goetzmann et al. (2005), or by a J-shape process, as posited by

Volosovych (2011). However, we cannot reject the hypothesis that the temporal pattern follows a

swoosh shape. In other words, de facto global financial market integration was high in the first era of

financial globalization before World War I, but not as high as during the second era after 1990. Still,

de facto global financial market integration in both eras was substantially stronger than during most of

the twentieth century, namely between 1914 and 1990.

        Interestingly, the results for de facto regional financial market integration are different.

Although we can clearly reject the hypothesis that its temporal pattern follows a flat line, we fail to

reject either the U, J or swoosh shapes. Nevertheless, the coefficient pattern is numerically consistent

with a “swoosh”. It is also possible that the temporal pattern followed by regional financial market

integration in the last century is different from the global pattern, but we lack statistical precision and

power to distinguish different shapes.

                                                   Table VII

        We also formally test whether effective financial market integration has partly reversed since

the onset of the global financial crisis in 2007, as some observers have argued recently in the face of

                                                                                                        20
the capital controls and other financial protectionist measures taken by advanced and emerging market

economies (in line with evidence in e.g. by Ostry et al. (2012), Forbes, Fratzscher and Straub (2013),

Pasricha et al. (2015), and many others) and lingering public interventions in the financial sector of

advanced economies, such as bank nationalizations, aimed at influencing the quantity and/or price of

loans that banks from one country make to borrowers resident in another country (as stressed e.g. by

Rose and Wieladek (2014)). This question is addressed in Table VIII which presents estimates of

model equation (6) with two period dummies (1990-2007 and 2007-2014). Wald tests

overwhelmingly reject the hypothesis that the global betas in the two subperiods are equal. They also

reject the hypothesis that the precrisis beta is higher than the postcrisis beta. The converse hypothesis

is not rejected. This evidence suggests that the process of de facto global financial market integration

has not reversed since the Great Recession, despite claims made in recent studies. Because the

subperiod 2007-2009 coincided with the acute phase of the global financial crisis it may be

contaminated by contagion effects (see Bekaert et al. (2014)). We therefore obtained estimates of

model equation (6) with three period dummies (1990-2006, 2007-2009 and 2010-2014) reported in

Table C2 in Appendix C. The hypothesis that the global betas in subperiods 2007-2009 and 2010-

2014 are equal is not rejected, however.

                     III. Revisiting the Monetary Policy Trilemma in History



        We now use our benchmark measure of de facto financial market integration over 130 years

to revisit the debate on the monetary policy trilemma in history. Standard macroeconomic theory

posits that an economy can have at most two out of an open capital account, a fixed exchange rate and

an independent monetary policy. Specifically, if capital is allowed to move freely across borders,

domestic interest rates can deviate from interest rates abroad only if the exchange rate is flexible.

Alternatively, if policy-makers seek to stabilise the exchange rate under free capital mobility,



                                                                                                      21
domestic interest rates have to shadow foreign interest rates. This is the classic Mundell-Flemming’s

“trilemma” or “impossible trinity”.

         Early empirical tests of the trilemma suggest that it describes reasonably well the trade-offs

between international capital mobility, the choice of the exchange rate regime and monetary policy

autonomy over the last century or so (e.g. Obstfeld, Shambaugh and Taylor (2005)). More recently,

however, it has been argued that the classic trilemma had morphed into a “dilemma” and the

impossible trinity into an “irreconcilable duo”. Central banks outside the U.S., the world’s foremost

financial centre, would have lost their ability to influence domestic long-term interest rates, even in

the presence of flexible exchange rates, due to the existence of global financial cycles that are set in

motion by US monetary policy impulses (see Rey (2013), Miranda-Agrippino and Rey (2014), and

Passari and Rey (2015)). 7 There is related evidence that bank leverage cycles are key determinants of

the global transmission of US financial conditions across borders through banking sector capital flows

Bruno and Shin (2015a) and that spillovers between US monetary policy, cross-border capital flows,

and the US dollar exchange rate through the banking sector are substantial (Bruno and Shin (2015b)).

This has triggered strong interest in testing for the trilemma empirically (see e.g. Miniane and Rogers

(2007), Bluedorn and Bowdler (2010), Klein and Shambaugh (2013), Aizenmann, Chinn and Ito

(2014), Pasricha et al. (2015), Obstfeld (2015)).

         Note that the trilemma hypothesis regards general capital mobility, which includes bond and

equity flows, whereas our measure of financial market integration is based on equity market data only.

While equity and bond flows may not be perfectly correlated, it is typically the case that international

capital restrictions are comprehensive and apply uniformly to bond and equity markets (see

Fernández, Klein, Rebucci, Schindler and Uribe (2015) for an analysis of recent data). In fact, many

countries were either largely open or closed in terms of de jure capital market openness over several

periods. We use this information in computing our de facto integration measure. It would be

interesting to investigate bond market integration as well, but government bond markets were in

controls are desirable even when the exchange rate is flexible as they help to lean against the wind and smooth out capital
flows.

several cases less well developed and liquid in the early part of our sample than were equity markets

(although corporate debt markets were in some cases quite developed).



A. Testing the Trilemma Hypothesis



         As a starting point, we rely on Obstfeld, Shambaugh and Taylor’s benchmark regression

model (which is also in the spirit of the specification used by Shambaugh (2004), Klein and

Shambaugh (2013), and Obstfeld (2015))

                                        ∆Ri ,t = a0 + b∆Ribase + u i ,t ,                                             (7)
                                                          ,t


where Ri,t is the domestic interest rate at time t, Rbasei,t is the base interest rate at time t in the anchor

country; and ∆ is the difference operator (see Obstfeld, Shambaugh and Taylor (2005), p. 427). Under

full capital mobility and a credible peg, it is expected that b = 1, i.e. domestic and base-country

interest rates move one for one, which implies that monetary policy in the pegging country is fully

dependent on monetary policy in the base country. In contrast, b = 0 implies full independence from

monetary policy in the base country, which is to be expected if the exchange rate is floating, or if

capital does not move freely across borders.

         First, we seek to replicate Obstfeld, Shambaugh and Taylor’s results by estimating equation

(7) using similar yearly averages of monthly data, similar time periods and similar country groups as

they have. 8 We take the U.K. as the base country prior to 1914 (classical gold standard); the mean of

the U.K. and the U.S. as the base for the 1920s (gold exchange standard); the U.K., U.S. and Germany

as base countries for the sterling bloc, U.S. dollar bloc and Reichsmark bloc, respectively, for the

1930s; the U.S. as the base country for the Bretton Woods period (1959-1970); Germany as the base

country for European countries (in the European Monetary System) and the U.S. for the remaining


8
  Specifically, the time periods and country groups we consider for the replications are: 1885-1914 (gold standard), 1959-
1970 (Bretton Woods), and 1973-2000 (post-Bretton Woods), peggers vs. nonpeggers, countries highly integrated into
global finance vs. countries highly segmented from global finance. Nonpeggers are defined as countries having floating or
freely falling exchange rates according to the updated classification of Ilzetzki, Reinhart, and Rogoff (2004). Peggers are
defined as the remaining countries, including those which were on the classical gold standard or gold exchange standard
prior to World War II according to the classification of Reinhart and Rogoff (2011). Countries with high (low, respectively)
global financial market integration in period t are defined as those for which β i ,glo
                                                                                    t > 1 β i ,t ≤ 1
                                                                                         ( glo       , respectively).

                                                                                                                        23
countries, respectively, for the period 1973-1999; and the U.S. for all countries for the period 1999-

2014. 9 As measures of interest rates we use both short-term policy rates and long-term government

bond yields. See Appendix A for details on the data.

         Next we modify equation model (7) to the form

            ∆Ri ,t = a0 + b1∆Ribase + b2 peg i ,t + b3 b i ,glo                                                     (8)

to test explicitly for the monetary policy trilemma hypothesis conditionally on the exchange rate

regime and the degree of de facto global financial market integration, where peg is a binary dummy

variable which equals one if country i in period t is a pegger and zero otherwise. In so doing, we

extend Obstfeld, Shambaugh and Taylor’s study in three ways. First, we investigate both short-term

and long-term interest rates whereas Obstfeld, Shambaugh and Taylor focused on short-term interest

rates. Second, we extend the time dimension of their sample, insofar as we consider almost half a

century of additional data by looking at the periods 1914-1945 and 2001-2014 as well. Third, in terms

of data measurement, we employ a measure of de facto global financial market integration over the

full sample period.10 From equation (8) one can derive the elasticity of the domestic interest rate with

respect to the base interest rate for both peggers and nonpeggers, respectively, conditional on the

degree of global financial market integration, namely:

                                   ∂∆Ri ,t
                                             = b1 + (c2 × b i ,glo
                                                               t ) if peg i , t = 0 , and
                                  ∂∆Ribase
                                      ,t




9
   Our base countries are the same as those of Obstfeld, Shambaugh and Taylor for the pre-1914 period, Bretton Woods
period and 1973-1999 period (they did not consider the interwar period and the period 1999-2014; more on this below). That
Germany is considered as the base country for European countries for the period 1973-1999 is motivated by the “German
dominance hypothesis” (see e.g. Giavazzi et al. (1986); Giavazzi and Pagano (1988); von Hagen and Frattiani (1990)).
Germany’s monetary policy was so central in the E.M.S. that many European countries simply shadowed the Bundesbank’s
interest rates. In fact, one reason why some countries pushed for the creation of the euro was to end the dominance of
Germany’s monetary policy by sharing Germany’s influence and credibility through the single currency.
10
   Obstfeld, Shambaugh and Taylor (2005) relied on more limited data on capital market openness and assumed that all
countries had open capital markets during the gold standard era, that none did during Bretton Woods, and that the official
I.M.F. coding from the Exchange Rate Arrangements yearbooks was a reasonable approximation for measuring the use of
capital controls during the post-Bretton Woods era. Our metric of global financial market integration provides a direct
measure for 17 countries over the full sample period. The cross-sectional dimension of Obstfeld, Shambaugh and Taylor
(2005)’s panel is larger than ours for the Bretton Woods and post-Bretton Woods periods, however.
                                                                                                                      24

If a country maintains a peg, capital controls are necessary to maintain monetary policy independence.

That is, we expect d1 > 0. When the exchange rate is fully floating, capital controls are not a necessary

condition for monetary policy independence. That is, b1 = 0 no matter what the degree of financial

market integration is. However, it is conceivable that increased capital market integration increases

international interest rate dependence (that is c2 > 0). A pegged exchange rate should only constrain

monetary policy independence when markets are integrated, so the sign of c1 is not necessarily clear

ex-ante. If β i,glo
                t   = 0 represents fully binding capital controls, then c1 may in fact be zero and pass-

through only increases when β i,glo
                                t increases and capital is more mobile.




B. Empirical Results



           We first review unconditional estimates of our test of the trilemma hypothesis in Section

III.B.1., then condition the estimates on our measure of de facto global financial market integration in

Section III.B.2., and finally test the trilemma hypothesis against the dilemma hypothesis in Section

III.B.3.



                                       B.1. Unconditional estimates

           As a starting point, Table IX reports the estimates of the parameters of the unconditional

model in equation (7) using short-term policy interest rates, in the spirit of Obstfeld, Shambaugh and

Taylor (2005). Column 1 reports pooled estimates, Columns 2 to 4 report estimates over three

subperiods, namely: the classical gold standard era (pre-1914); the Bretton Woods regime (1959-

1970); and the post-Bretton Woods era (1973-2000) (these subperiods match those of Obstfeld,

Shambaugh and Taylor). Columns 5 to 8 report estimates by country groups (peggers vs. nonpeggers;

high vs. low global financial market integration). Our estimate of b, the degree of pass-through from


                                                                                                      25
base country to domestic policy interest rates, for the full sample is about 0.30. 11 Our estimates by

subperiod are qualitatively consistent with those of Obstfeld, Shambaugh and Taylor. Interest rate

pass-through is found to be higher during the classical gold standard and post-Bretton Woods era,

with estimates for the coefficient b of 0.19 and 0.57, respectively, than during the Bretton Woods

regime, with a b-estimate of 0.10. Obstfeld, Shambaugh and Taylor’s estimates are 0.42 (gold

standard), -0.20 (Bretton Woods) and 0.36 (post-Bretton Woods), respectively. The country group

estimates suggest that there are no discernible differences in the extent of interest rate pass-through

between peggers and nonpeggers, insofar as the b-estimate, at about 0.30, is virtually identical for

both groups of countries. 12 Of course, this result may reflect differences in the extent of de facto

global financial market integration between and within groups. Indeed, when the sample is restricted

to countries highly integrated into global finance, the b-coefficient is close to 0.40, but when it is

restricted to countries segmented from global finance, it drops to 0.14 only, a finding consistent with

that of Obstfeld, Shambaugh and Taylor whose estimates are 0.56 (no capital controls) and 0.26

(capital controls).

                                                       Table IX

         The results for long-term interest rates are in line with those for short-term policy rates. The

estimates are somewhat larger in economic magnitude, which points to a stronger degree of

transmission of base interest rate movements to domestic interest rates at the long end of the yield

curve relative to the short end, a finding consistent with Obstfeld (2015). Our estimate of b for the full

sample is about 0.43. 13 We again find that interest rate pass-through is higher during the classical gold

standard and post-Bretton Woods era, with b-estimates of 0.25 and 0.53, respectively, than during the

Bretton Woods regime, with a b-estimate of about 0.12. The magnitude of the differences in interest

rate pass-through between peggers and nonpeggers (0.46 vs. 0.40) is economically small for long-



11
   This is remarkably close to Hofmann and Takáts (2015)’s estimate of 0.34 for a panel of 30 emerging market and
advanced economies over the period 2000-2014.
12
   This is unlike Obstfeld, Shambaugh and Taylor’s estimates, which point to differences between peggers (0.43) and
nonpeggers (0.26).
13
   This is somewhat lower than estimates for the recent period. For instance Hofmann and Takáts (2015) find an estimate of
0.59 in a panel of 30 emerging market and advanced economies over the period 2000-2014.
                                                                                                                      26
term interest rates, too. Again, a higher degree of global financial market integration results in higher

pass-through estimates, i.e. 0.50 for integrated countries relative to 0.29 for segmented countries.



                                       B.2. Conditional estimates

        How does interest rate pass-through change if we condition on global financial market

integration and the exchange rate regime? We now turn to the estimation of the parameters of the

conditional model in equation (8). The estimates for short-term policy interest rates are reported in

columns (9) to (10) of Table IX (where the latter column considers a specification excluding the

world war periods). The estimates for long-term interest rates are reported in the corresponding

columns of Table X.

                                                Table X

        Consider short-term interest rates first. The full sample estimate for the direct pass-through

effect of base-country policy interest rates to domestic policy interest rates, b1, is about half the

economic magnitude of the unconditional estimate, i.e. 0.18 (0.16 excluding World War I and II)

versus 0.30 (see column 9 (10) of Table IX). It is still significantly different from zero at the 10%

level, however. Moreover, interaction effects between interest rates, global financial market

integration, and the exchange rate regime are statistically significant and strong in economic

magnitude. This suggests that pass-through from base to domestic policy interest rates depends on

whether an economy is open to global finance or closed, and on whether it has pegged or flexible

exchange rates, potentially in line with the trilemma hypothesis. The c1 coefficient is negative

suggesting that a pegged exchange rate system can decrease pass-through. However, we also find that

c2 is positive (only significant at the 15% level), that is, financially open countries experience more

pass-through, and d1 is positive and statistically significant at the 5% level, suggesting that

dependence on openness is more pronounced for countries with pegged exchange rate systems.

        How large are these effects economically? Figure 7 plots the estimated pass-through from

base short-term policy interest rates to domestic policy interest rates against the extent of de facto

global financial market integration for both peggers and nonpeggers, as implied by the full sample

                                                                                                       27
estimates reported in column (10) of Table IX (see Panel A of Figure 7). First, the extent of financial

market integration has little effect on pass-through coefficients for nonpeggers; pass-through is

relatively low, increasing from about 0.10 for fully segmented countries to about 0.30 for fully

integrated countries. This is largely consistent with the trilemma hypothesis, as floating exchange

rates should suffice to guarantee monetary policy independence. Second, for peggers financial market

integration dependence is much more pronounced. Specifically, pass-through of peggers well

integrated into global finance is high, at about 0.60. Segmentation from global finance should protect

domestic policy interest rates from movements in base-country policy interest rates. Indeed, pass-

through is nil or even negative for peggers with integration levels lower than 0.5, which suggests that

they can decouple from movements in base-country policy interest rates, or even lean against them.

These findings again support the trilemma hypothesis, and are statistically significant. The positive

estimate for the triple interaction coefficient d1, which is significant at the 1% level, shows that

financial integration dependence is stronger for peggers than nonpeggers in a statistically significant

manner. Third, pass-through of nonpeggers well integrated into global finance is only half as large as

that of peggers. This again suggests that a flexible exchange rate acts as a shock absorber of

movements to base-country policy interest rates, in line with the trilemma hypothesis. The difference

is positive and statistically significant for values of global financial market integration above 1.17 (i.e.

17% above the average across countries and time). 14 This comprises roughly 30% of the observations

in our sample, i.e. those mainly immediately before World War I and after 1985 (basically the two

to global finance or closed, and on whether it has pegged or flexible exchange rates, in line with the

trilemma hypothesis, as evidenced by the statistically significant interaction effects. The only

exception is the interaction between interest rates and de facto global financial market integration.

Panel B of Figure 7 sheds light on the economic magnitude of these effects. First, the extent of

financial market integration has no effect on pass-through coefficients for nonpeggers; pass-through

remains constant, at 0.45, and does not depend on the extent of de facto global financial market

integration. This is again consistent with the trilemma hypothesis, as floating exchange rates should

suffice to guarantee monetary policy independence although the degree of pass-through remains

relatively high. Second, for peggers financial market integration dependence is again much more

pronounced in a statistically significant manner as evidenced by the estimate for the triple interaction

coefficient d1. Pass-through to domestic long-term interest rates of peggers well integrated into global

finance is even higher than for short-term policy rates, at about 0.75. Segmentation from global

finance again dampens pass-through: for peggers which are largely or fully closed to global finance,

pass-through is nil or even negative, as predicted by the trilemma hypothesis. The difference is

positive and statistically significant for values of global financial market integration above 1.26 (i.e.

26% above the average across countries and time). This comprises roughly 20% of the observations in

our sample. The observations featuring such high degrees of freedom correspond mostly to the second

wave of globalization, post-1985.

         How has interest rate pass-through evolved over the last century? Figure 8 shows the

evolution between 1885 and 2014 of the average pass-through estimates from base to short-term

(Panel A) and long-term (Panel B) interest rates for peggers and nonpeggers, respectively, as

predicted by the full sample estimates reported in column (10) of Table IX and X. 15 Pass-through on

the short end of the yield curve for peggers follows a nice swoosh shape, which largely reflects the

temporal pattern of de facto global financial market integration over the last century. Pass-through for

nonpeggers is more stable over time, in contrast. Interestingly, short-term interest rate pass-through

  There are no estimates for peggers during World War I because only the U.S. had stuck to the gold standard in this period.
The 14 countries shown in the figure were all nonpeggers as they had either suspended gold convertibility or, in the case of
Spain, were previously not on gold.

remains appreciably higher for peggers than for nonpeggers in the modern era of financial

globalization, at about 0.50 and 0.30, respectively, on average in the 2000s (see Panel A of Figure 8).

This suggests that central banks outside the U.S. still exert more control on their domestic short-term

interest rates in the presence of flexible exchange rates, which can act as a shock absorber, despite the

potential existence of global financial cycles set in motion by US monetary policy impulses. This

finding is consistent with the trilemma hypothesis, but not with the dilemma hypothesis. Long-term

interest rate pass-through for nonpeggers follows a nice swoosh shape, too, while pass-through for

nonpeggers is stable over time. In addition, long-term interest rate pass-through is also much higher

for peggers than for nonpeggers in the modern era of financial globalization, at about 0.70 versus

0.45, respectively, on average in the 2000s (see Panel B of Figure 8).

                                B.3. Trilemma vs. dilemma hypotheses

        While our full sample results do not point to evidence in favour of a “dilemma,” this

hypothesis has surfaced only recently emphasizing the increasing importance of U.S. financial cycles

in the world economy.

        It is important to qualify what our results indicate about the recent dilemma/trilemma debate.

The results in the extant studies (e.g. Rey (2013), Miranda-Agrippino and Rey (2014), Passari and

Rey (2015)) concern the worldwide transmission of global financial cycle shocks which seem to be

correlated with the VIX, an indicator of option implied volatility on the S&P500 stock index. The

period considered is post-1990. Here we narrowly focus on the transmission of short-term and long-

term interest shocks over a very long historical period. Yet, it remains interesting to translate the

dilemma/trilemma debate more precisely to our setting. Essentially, the dilemma hypothesis would

suggest that pass-through is now large, irrespective of the exchange rate regime. That is, peggers can

no longer as easily escape the global financial or interest rate cycle by introducing capital controls.

Also, presumably, even countries with a floating exchange rate should experience pass-through, as the

exchange rate no longer plays the role of a shock absorber in increasingly globalized markets.

                                                                                                      30
        With this translation in hand, what do our results really contribute to the debate?

        First, our results are overall certainly inconsistent with the dilemma hypothesis: peggers can

achieve a high degree of monetary autonomy when global financial integration is low and are less

exposed to foreign interest rate shocks; and countries with floating exchange rate regimes are subject

to much less-pass through than pegged currency countries when capital markets are financially

integrated globally, and significantly so when the degree of financial integration is very high (see

Figure 7).

        However, in interpreting these findings, it is important to recall our results on the “integration

swoosh.” These results strongly suggest that the degree of global financial integration is very high for

the countries in our sample post-1990, and higher than in the earlier globalization wave. As Figure 7

further shows, we therefore do observe a positive non-negligible pass-through for floating-exchange-

rate countries for both short and long-term interest rates, consistent with the dilemma hypothesis. 16

However, for the most integrated countries and the largest part of our sample period, our model

predicts significantly more pass-through for peggers than for non-peggers, which remains inconsistent

with the dilemma hypothesis.

        Second, our results may be erroneous if the model parameters are unstable. Perhaps the model

parameters have changed recently and become more consistent with the dilemma hypothesis. Upon

reflection, examining this is fraught with difficulty, exactly because of the previous point we made.

The identification of our conditional model relies on substantial time and cross-country variation in

the degree of financial integration and exchange rate regimes. However, post-1990 this heterogeneity

has diminished, which challenges the identification of the model.17 This also makes it conceivable that

the significance results at high levels of integration is based on full sample observations rather than on

recent data. To examine this a bit more formally, we re-estimated the model allowing all parameters

to break in 1990 (see Table XI). We do find that a likelihood ratio test rejects the null of no break at

the 5% level for both short and long-term rates. However, the parameter changes do not support the

16
  For short-term interest rates, this is purely as an artefact of the higher degree of financial globalization.
17
  In particular, 38% of the observations are peggers post-1990, against 74% pre-1990; for instance in Europe
peggers comprise EU currencies managed within the Exchange Rate Mechanism in the 1990s, versus only
Denmark and Switzerland in the 2000s.
                                                                                                            31
dilemma hypothesis and very much confirm the identification problems discussed above. For

example, for short-term interest rates, only one parameter change is significant at the 10% level. But

the change indicates that for countries with pegged exchange rates, financial integration decreases

pass-through, which makes little sense. For both short and long term interest rates, we find that the b1

coefficient increases (overall pass-through), which is true in a statistically significant manner for long-

term interest rates, but that global financial integration reduces pass-through and more considerably so

for countries with pegged exchange rate systems. This model would imply that pass-through is lower

than before for reasonably integrated countries. Although this is not very plausible, it is surely

inconsistent with the dilemma hypothesis.

                                                         Table XI

          Finally, it is conceivable that the recent dilemma results are heavily influenced by the Great

Recession, where economic conditions in the US spilled over into other countries. Of course, trying to

estimate the conditional model over such a short period with even more homogenous integration and

currency regimes is likely to be even less advisable. We therefore propose a simpler methodology to

provide an alternative test of the implications of our conditional model for the dilemma/trilemma

hypotheses. We divide the data post 1990 in four compartments, analogously to the aggregate results

in Tables IX-X, namely peggers versus non-peggers and high versus low financial integration. 18 This

immediately reveals the problem with the analysis. We have only four observations that qualify as

“low financial integration” and thus cannot provide a meaningful statistical analysis for that regime

(see Table XII). While the empirical estimate of pass-through for the low financial integration regime

is indeed low, statistically this has little meaning. For the high financial integration regime, we find

that there is significant pass-through for both peggers and for non-peggers and for both short-term and

long-term interest rates. For short-term interest rates, the estimate is 0.437 for peggers and 0.323 for

non-peggers. For long-term interest rates, the corresponding numbers are 0.653 and 0.510. This

confirms our discussion above. In a world where capital controls are no longer in place, pegging a

currency exposes the country to shock transmission. But this is simply the trilemma at work. Floating-

currency countries also experience significant interest rate spillovers from the base countries, but the

coefficient is lower than it is for countries attempting to peg their currencies – which is in line with

the trilemma, too – albeit not significantly so, which might reflect the relatively low number of

observations from which we can draw inference. In any case, the dilemma findings are hard to

interpret in a world of largely globalized capital flows.

                                             IV. Conclusions

We propose a simple measure of de facto global and regional equity market integration using the beta

exposure of the stock market returns of 17 markets to either the global or regional equity market

portfolio. The beta exposure depends significantly on de jure market integration and global growth

uncertainty, both accounting for about 50% of the total variation.

        When viewed over time from 1885 to 2014, we uncover a “swoosh pattern” in de facto global

financial market integration. That is, global financial market integration was high pre-1913, still

higher post-1990, and low in the interwar period. In fact, we statistically reject the presence of other

shapes hypothesized in earlier literature, such as a flat line, a U shape, a J shape, but cannot reject this

distinct “swoosh” pattern. For regional integration, we do not find a clear statistically significant

pattern. Also, we do not find integration to have reversed after the recent global crisis, contrary to

claims in a number of recent papers.

        Our results have implications for the recent debate on the trilemma hypothesis, which posits

that a country can only run two of the three following policies: open capital markets, an independent

monetary policy and a pegged exchange rate. We investigate the role of de facto financial market

integration and the exchange rate regime on monetary policy interdependence measured by the

sensitivity of local interest rate changes to international base rate changes, using both short and long-

term interest rates.



                                                                                                         33
        Our evidence is consistent with the trilemma hypothesis. First, for countries with flexible

exchange rates, interest rate pass-through is rather limited and is not affected by the extent of de facto

financial market integration. However, for peggers, a higher degree of financial integration increases

interest rate pass-through, undermining monetary policy independence. For segmented markets,

interest rate pass-through is close to zero or even negative, hence enabling these countries to decouple

from base interest rates. For integrated markets, in contrast, pass-through can be as high as 0.60 for

short and 0.75 for long-term interest rates. For the recent period, we find that the trilemma is alive and

well and has not morphed into a dilemma as recent papers claim, although it is natural to witness

larger pass-through in more globalized markets.

Figure 4. Economic importance of the instruments for global financial market integration – 1885-2014. The figure shows the evolution between 1885 and 2014 of the
value-weighted averages (17 countries) of the estimates of the conditional global betas obtained from the full model equations (1) to (3) when only one of each instrument in
vector X remains active, in turn. This is achieved by setting the loadings on the other instruments at their respective means.

                                                      Full Model Estimates


  The table reports the estimates of the parameters βi,tglo and βi,treg from the full model equations (1) to (3). Each
  instrument is included individually in the estimates reported in columns 2 to 7, while all seven instruments are
  included in column 8. We then obtain a parsimonious model in column 9 by excluding the variables with
  insignificant parameters. All the estimates control for country fixed effects, year effects and for the direct effects
  of the instruments included in vector X (whose coefficients are not reported to save space).The standard errors
  reported in parentheses are robust to heteroskedasticity and clustered heterogeneity. ***, **, *, and + indicate
  statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, 10%, and 15% levels, respectively.

The table reports the estimates of a variance ratio analysis. For each statistically significant instrument j (i.e. de
jure capital account openness, global growth uncertainty and high market volatility periods) of our parsimonious
specification, we calculate the variance ratio for the conditional global beta estimates as

and where the standard errors are estimated by bootstrap with 1,000 replications. Each replication in the
bootstrap consists in scrambling the residuals from the parsimonious model (shown in column 9 of Table III),
recreating the dependant variable using the data’s independent variables and the estimated parameters, and re-
estimating the model. We then re-compute the variance ratios as indicated above. ***, **, and * indicate
statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

                                        Constant-Beta Model Estimates


The table reports the estimates of the following model:

                         Ri ,t = α i + lt + β 0glo Ft glo ,\ i + β 0reg Ft reg ,\ i + e i ,t

Estimates obtained by OLS are reported in columns 1 to 3; estimates obtained by excluding outliers from the
sample (i.e. returns larger than 30% within a month in absolute value) are reported in column 4; estimates
obtained with a random effects estimator are reported in columns 5. The estimates of columns 2 to 5 control for
country fixed (or random) effects. The estimates of columns 3 to 5 control for year effects. The ρ-statistic in
column (5) is the percent contribution to the total variance of the panel-level variance component. The standard
errors reported in parentheses are robust to heteroskedasticity and clustered heterogeneity. ***, **, *, and +
indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, 10% and 15% levels, respectively.

The table reports the estimates of the parameters of the unconditional model equation (7) using short-term policy interest rates, in the spirit of Obstfeld, Shambaugh and
Taylor (2005). Column 1 reports pooled estimates, Columns 2 to 4 report estimates over three periods. Columns 5 to 8 report estimates by country groups. The estimates of
the parameters from the conditional model equation (8) are reported in columns 9 and 10 over the full sample. The standard errors reported in parentheses are robust to
heteroskedasticity and clustered heterogeneity. ***, **, *, and + indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, 10%, and 15% levels, respectively.

           Testing for the Monetary Policy Trilemma vs. Dilemma Hypotheses – Stability Tests

The table reports stability test results for a break in the coefficients of model equation (8) in 1990 and 2007,
respectively, using two interaction dummy variables: the first dummy is denoted prebreak and equals one before
1990 (respectively 2007) and zero afterwards; the second dummy is denoted postbreak and equals zero before
1990 (respectively 2007) and zero afterwards. The results are obtained using the full sample and short-term
policy rates (in columns 1 to 3) and long-term government bond yields (in columns 4 to 6). Columns 1 and 4
report the estimates without breaks, columns 2 and 5 the estimates with a break in 1990, and columns 3 and 6
the estimates with a break in 2007. The standard errors reported in parentheses are robust to heteroskedasticity
and clustered heterogeneity. ***, **, *, and + indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, 10%, and 15%
levels, respectively.

                            Appendix A. Data definitions, coverage, and sources



           This appendix outlines the data definitions, coverage, and sources. The sample includes 17

economies, namely: Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy,

Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the U.K., and the U.S. The data are

sampled at the monthly frequency. The baseline estimation period is January 1885 to June 2014. We

have an unbalanced panel due to missing observations, with up to 1,554 observations per economy.

           Equity prices: We take data on local equity market indices – initially gathered from national

sources – from Global Financial Data (G.F.D.). G.F.D. assembled long time series using benchmark

national indices (market capitalisation-weighted) at given points in time that are chain-linked with one

another. The resulting long time series are expressed in nominal local currency terms. They are not

systematically adjusted for dividend payments. The data are available since January 1885 for

Australia, Germany, the U.K. and the U.S.; January 1897 for Belgium; January 1898 for France;

September 1905 for Italy; January 1906 for Sweden; September 1912 for Finland; January 1914 for

Norway; July 1914 for Japan; January 1915 for Spain; January 1916 for Switzerland; January 1918

for Canada; January 1919 for the Netherlands; January 1921 for Denmark; and January 1922 for

Austria.

           Risk free rate: We take the 10-year US government yield as a proxy for the risk free rate,

also from G.F.D., which is available since January 1885 (T-bill rates are not available for the pre-

World War I period, in contrast). G.F.D. initially gathered these data from a range of scholarly and

official sources. 19 Yields on Treasury securities at constant, fixed maturity were constructed by the

U.S. Treasury department based on the most actively traded marketable Treasury securities. Yields on




19
   G.F.D. used the 4% U.S. government bond of 1907 from January 1885 to January 1895; from February 1895 until
September 1918, the 4% U.S. government bond of 1925 (when no trades were recorded during a given month, the previous
month’s yield was used). The source for this data was William B. Dana Co., The Financial Review, New York: William B.
Dana Co. (1872-1921) which reprinted data published by The Commercial and Financial Chronicle. Beginning in 1919, the
Federal Reserve Board’s 10-15 year Treasury bond index was used and 10-year bonds were used starting in 1941. The data
dating back to 1919 were taken from the Federal Reserve, National Monetary Statistics, New York: Federal Reserve Board,
which was published in 1941, 1970 and annually since then. To obtain constant maturity yields, Treasury staff constructed a
yield curve each business day and yield values were obtained from the curve at fixed maturities.
                                                                                                                       62
these issues are based on composite quotes reported by U.S. government securities dealers to the

Federal Reserve Bank of New York.

          Dollar exchange rates: We take the exchange rate against the U.S. dollar of the currency of

the 16 economies of our sample (i.e. all economies minus the U.S.) from G.F.D. to convert local

currency returns to U.S. dollar returns. The exchange rate is defined as the number of local currency

units per U.S. dollar (i.e. an upward movement indicates a depreciation of the local currency relative

to the U.S. dollar). We adjusted the data for re-denominations. They were available since January

1885 for Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden,

Switzerland, the U.K. and the U.S; April 1901 for Australia; January 1910 for Canada; January 1914

for Spain; and January 1920 for Belgium and Finland.

          Trade openness: Our measure of trade openness is defined as the sum of total exports and

imports of goods scaled by output. We took the data from Mitchell (1998a, 1998b and 1998c) for the

period 1885-1947, and from the I.M.F.’s Direction of Trade Statistics (D.O.T.S.) for the period 1948-

2013. Missing observations were replaced with their last known values. The data were available since

1885 for Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Norway, Sweden, the

U.K. and the U.S, against 1900 for the Netherlands; 1901 for Spain; and 1913 for Austria, Belgium

and Switzerland.

          Regional trade openness: We split the sample into three regions, namely: Europe (Austria,

Belgium, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Italy, Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden,

Switzerland, and the U.K.); Northern America (the U.S., and Canada) and Asia-Pacific (Australia, and

Japan). Regional trade is defined as the sum of a country’s exports and imports of goods to the

countries in the same region, scaled by total trade.20 We took the data from Mitchell (1998a, 1998b

and 1998c) for the period 1885-1947, and from the D.O.T.S. for the period 1948-2013. Missing

observations were replaced with their last known values. 21 We obtained long time series that start in


20
   Note that the U.S. is Canada’s sole regional trading partner (and vice-versa). Likewise, Australia is Japan’s sole regional
trading partner (and vice-versa).
21
   Insofar as bilateral trade data were available for a subset of the 13 European countries prior to 1948, we used the share of
intra-European trade obtained from this subset as a proxy, and rebased it to the actual share of intra-European trade (i.e. the
share obtained with all 13 European countries) in 1948.
                                                                                                                           63
1885 for Australia, Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway,

Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, the U.K. and the U.S; 1897 for Belgium; 1910 for Canada; and 1920 for

Finland.

          Capital account openness: We use the de jure index of financial openness of Quinn and

Voth (2008) for the pre-World War II period as well as the index of Quinn and Toyoda (2008) for the

post-World War II period. This index measures the extent of restrictions to capital outflows and

inflows by residents and nonresidents in a given country. It runs from 0 (financial autarky) to 100

(complete financial openness). Annual data for all our countries were available for the period 1890-

1931 and for the period 1950-2007. In other words, these indices leave gaps for parts of our sample.

To fill in the missing observations between 1932 and 1949, we assumed that each country index

evolved commensurately with the global index calculated by Quinn and Voth (see Quinn and Voth

(2008), Table 1, p. 536). When there were large discrepancies between our own estimates and those of

Quinn and Toyoda (2008) for 1950, however, i.e. in cases when a country’s capital account openness

had, in fact, evolved quite differently from the global average, we used linearly interpolated

observations between 1931 and 1950 instead. 22 We used 2008 observations to fill in missing values up

to 2014. This is consistent with the observation that none of the economies in our sample changed

capital account regulations in the global financial crisis, an observation supported by the data base of

Chinn and Ito (2006) which compile information reported to the I.M.F. up to 2012 and confirm that,

indeed, none of our economies took such measures. 23

          Financial development: We took the ratio of equity market capitalization to output as our

metric of financial depth from Rajan and Zingales (2003) for the period 1913-1999 and from Beck,

Demirgüç-Kunt, and Levine (2010) for the period 2000-2011. 24 We obtained updates for 2012 and



22
   This was the case of Finland, Japan, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland and the U.S. for which the discrepancy
between our own estimates and those of Quinn and Toyoda (2008) for 1950 exceeded 20 percentage points.
23
   This is also consistent with the observation that capital controls were introduced in recent years by emerging market
economies, but not by advanced economies (with the exception of Greece, Cyprus and Iceland, which, as readers will
remember, are not in our sample).
24
   The Rajan and Zingales data were available for selected years only and were linearly interpolated to annual data. Rajan
and Zingales gathered these data from an array of sources, including the official publication of the stock exchanges; those of
the Fédération Internationale des Bourses Valeurs (FIBV); private guides to stock exchanges; estimates based on a stock
exchange handbook in 1913 (or the closest year before 1913) to identify the number of domestic companies listed, the
                                                                                                                          64
2013 observations using data from Bloomberg (for equity market capitalization) and the I.M.F.’s

World Economic Outlook database (for nominal GDP in U.S. dollars).

          Oil prices: We first took data on the dollar price of an oil barrel (West Texas Intermediate),

as assembled from G.F.D. from an array of primary and secondary sources. 25 Then we calculated the

deviation (in logarithms) between oil prices and a five-year moving average to capture periods of

“high” and “low” global oil prices.

          Global growth uncertainty: Natural logarithm of the cross-sectional dispersion of real GDP

growth for the 17 countries of our sample in a given year. This yields a global time series with annual

observations over 1885-2014. Real GDP growth is calculated as the sum of real GDP per capita

growth and population growth using data from Maddison (2010). Observations for 2010-2014 are

taken from the I.M.F.’s World Economic Outlook database.

          High market volatility periods: Share of the 17 countries in our sample with high equity

market volatility in a given month. We estimate the conditional volatility of stock returns for each

country of our sample using GARCH(1,1) models. We normalize the conditional volatilities of each

country’s stock returns and define high market volatility periods as the proportion of the 17 country-

returns in excess of 1.65 in a given month. This yields a global time series with monthly observations

over January 1885-June 2014.

          Market capitalization: Market capitalization data are typically not available for our century-

long time period. For instance, MSCI value weights extend only to the 1970s (see e.g. Brusa,

Ramodorai, and Verdelhan (2014)). To obtain rough estimates of equity market capitalization relative

to world output, we multiplied each country’s equity market capitalization-to-output ratio with its

share in world output (itself taken from Maddison (2008)). 26 We then derived each country’s equity




number of shares of each company, and the price per share; and various issues of the Bulletin of the International Institute of
Statistics.
25
   Data for the period 1885-1987 are taken by G.F.D. from The Derrick's Hand-Book of Petroleum, Oil City, PA; those from
1898 to 1912 from the NBER; those from 1912 to 1941 refer to the price of an oil barrel in Oklahoma City; G.F.D. used data
collected by Platt’s for the period 1941-1968, and by the Bureau of Labour Statistics for the period 1969-1982; G.F.D. also
used the price for West Texas Intermediate Crude Oil for the period 1983-2014.
26
   The Maddison data on GDP weights end in 2008. We updated them with IMF World Economic Outlook data on country
shares in world GDP at purchasing power parity exchange rates.
                                                                                                                           65
market capitalization relative to the total sample capitalization from the latter metric. 27 To replace

missing observations prior to World War I, we used the observations in 1913 for all countries, except

Finland and Spain (for which data were not available prior to 1989 and 1980, respectively). 28 We used

the observations in 2011 to replace missing observations between 2012 and 2014.

          Central bank policy rates: We took data on the main central bank policy interest rate from

G.F.D., which assembled long time series using data from national sources on the main policy interest

rate used at a given point in time. 29 The data are expressed in annual percent and in local currency

terms. They were available since January 1885 for Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Denmark,

Finland, Italy, Japan, Norway, Netherlands, Spain, Sweden and the U.K.; against June 1907 for

Switzerland; November 1914 for the U.S.; July 1920 for Australia; and March 1935 for Canada.

          Domestic bond yields: We took data on government bond yields from G.F.D. We took the

10-year maturity for all countries, with the exception of Finland (5-year bond yield) and the U.K. (5-

year note yield) due to the absence of long term series for longer maturities. G.F.D. initially gathered

these data from national sources and assembled long time series using yields on the benchmark bonds

closest to the stated maturity, albeit not exceeding it, at given points in time. The resulting series are

expressed in annual percent and in nominal local currency terms. They were available since January

1885 for Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Netherlands,

Norway, Spain, Sweden, and the U.S.; November 1899 for Switzerland; January 1902 for the U.K.

and August 1910 for Finland.

          Peggers vs. nonpeggers: dummy variable which equals zero for nonpeggers and one for

peggers. Nonpeggers are defined as countries having floating, managed floating or freely falling


27
   Global GDP at market prices was not calculated prior to World War II. Existing historical series are later reconstructions.
As Schularick (2006) notes, Maddison’s estimates for real GDP in constant 1990 ‘international’, i.e. purchasing power
adjusted, dollars were ‘deflated to historical market value’ by the U.S. GDP deflator, a method which hinges on a purchasing
power parity assumption, but which also remains the best –albeit crude – available approximation. Although this method
may lead to overestimates of the GDP of developing economies, readers should note that the bias should be smaller and
similar across our sample of advanced economies.
28
   Our estimates are broadly consistent with estimates obtained from other sources for the modern period. For instance, we
find that the U.S. accounts for 52% of total sample market capitalization at the end of our baseline period, against e.g. 8% for
Japan and 4% for Canada. This compares with 51%, 10% and 6%, respectively, according to the estimates of the World
Federation of Exchanges for end-2012, and with 55%, 8% and 4% according to the MSCI World index (in May 2014).
29
   For instance, for the U.S. G.F.D. used the Fed’s discount rate from 1914 to 1950 (there are no data prior to 1914 insofar as
the Federal Reserve was established in December 1913 only); the Fed fund market rate from 1951 to 1979 and the Fed fund
target rate from 1980 to 2014.
                                                                                                                            66
exchange rates according to the classification of Ilzetzki, Reinhart, and Rogoff (2004). Peggers are

defined as the remaining countries, including those which were on the classical gold standard or gold

exchange standard prior to World War II according to the classification of Reinhart and Rogoff

                     Constant-Beta Model Estimates with GDP-Weighted Factors


The table reports the estimates of the following model:

                          Ri ,t = α i + lt + β 0glo Ft glo ,\ i + β 0reg Ft reg ,\ i + e i ,t

in which both the global factor and the regional factor are GDP-weighted (rather than value-weighted as in the
estimates of Table V). Estimates obtained by OLS are reported in columns 1 to 3; estimates obtained by
excluding outliers from the sample (i.e. returns larger than 30% within a month in absolute value) are reported
in column 4; estimates obtained with a random effects estimator are reported in column 5. The estimates of
columns 2 to 5 control for country fixed (or random) effects. The estimates of columns 3 to 5 control for year
effects. The ρ-statistic in column (5) is the percent contribution to the total variance of the panel-level variance
component. The standard errors reported in parentheses are robust to heteroskedasticity and to clustered
heterogeneity. ***, **, *, and + indicate statistical significance at the 1%, 5%, 10%, and 15% levels,
respectively.
