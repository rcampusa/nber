                                            ABSTRACT

We show that the size of the public debt, the budget deficit and the monetary overhang made it
impossible for France to stabilize its price level and return to the pre-war parity immediately after
World War I, even on the anti-keynesian assumption that a stabilization would not have had any

negative effects on real income. The reason for the immediate postwar inflation then was not
mismanaged policy but a wise choice in the French context. Nevertheless, a stabilization at a

devalued franc which would have been substantially higher than the rate achieved by Poincaré in
1926 was historically possible in early 1924, and it would likely have benefited not only France but
the entire international monetary system.

                                                  1. Introduction


    The standard interpretation of the history of the inter-war period is that Great Britain, by going
back to gold at the original parity, made a big mistake because of the drastic and prolonged
reduction in output that resulted from the deflationary policy followed to achieve successful
resumption (Keynes 1925). This was aggravated by sterling overvaluation in succeeding years,
which put the U.K. at a competitive disadvantage and reinforced the deflation’s impact on output.
By contrast France is generally viewed as having followed a wiser strategy by not returning to the
pre-war parity, then by pursuing an inflationary strategy and allowing the franc to depreciate by
80% before returning to gold at a devalued parity de facto in 1926, thus avoiding the economic
cost of deflation.
    The British followed the deflationary route because of the importance attached by the
government and the City of London to maintaining credibility in the bond markets. It was
generally believed that a restoration of the pre-war parity would allow the City of London to
regain its pre-war position as the center of international finance – in modern terms to follow the
gold standard contingent rule.
    Recent interpretations of the macroeconomic history of Britain reinforce these arguments and
cast some doubt on the classic Keynesian story. They first demonstrate the importance of the
reputational argument, showing that a country following the gold standard rule gains by paying
durably lower interest rates (Bordo and Kydland 1995). They also discuss the reasons for high
unemployment: in contrast to those attributing it to deficient aggregate demand (e.g. Thomas,

1981), they consider that it mostly reflected an increase in labor-market rigidities and high
unemployment benefits (Benjamin and Kochin 1979, 1982). Britain's balance of trade problems
are also attributed to rigidities in its specialization rather than to the overvaluation of the pound
(Maizels 1970 ; Broadberry and Ritschl 1995).
   The new classical reinterpretation of the 1920’s has not been applied to French
macroeconomic history, even if there exist some good reasons to do so: that the French
government also believed in the importance of reputation to maintain its borrowing capacity in an
unstable world; and that France had also been an important international financial center before
1914 and wished to rebuild that position. So it is not surprising that after World War I many
argued that it should follow a policy similar to the British for similar reasons. The costs of the
inflationary process from 1914 to 1926 are also well known: a fragile financial system (Bouvier,
1984); leading to insufficiently capitalized firms; a decline in the international position of the
French financial market; undervaluation of the franc leading to inadequate specialization
subsequently revealed during the 1927-28 post-stabilization crisis (Marseille 1981).
   The purpose of this paper is to open the debate by asking why France did not follow the
British example in an early deflationary policy and stabilization at the pre-war gold parity.
Specifically we ask the following questions: Was it possible for France to follow Britain in 1919?
What were the reasons or the constraints behind the choice made at the French Ministry of
Finance to resist the Banque de France and the public demand for a return to gold at the prewar
parity (with the revaluation and the deflation it implied) ? (Blancheton 2000). If the civil servants
in the rue de Rivoli, best symbolized by Pierre de Moüy, director of the Mouvement général des
fonds (the Treasury), wanted to stabilize the currency without destabilizing the economy, did they
succeed or was it possible to stabilize earlier at a lower cost?
   In this paper we thus concentrate on the simple question, could France have followed a
British-style macroeconomic strategy beginning in 1919, the last point at which French prices
were within striking distance of restoring pre-war purchasing power parity with respect to the
pound ? What was the actual importance of the constraints (budget deficit, public debt, monetary
overhang, political instability) that the French government faced in order to implement that
strategy?
   To answer this question, we simulate a simple model of the French economy in the 1920’s.
The model captures the effects of deflation and higher taxes on the supply side through the effects
via sticky wages on investment and real output. The counterfactual effects of a British-style
stabilization policy on fiscal balance is captured by assuming tax increases, conversion of the




                                                   2
short-term French debt into long-term debt and imposing the paths of British interest rates to
calculate debt service costs.
      The results of our simulation suggest that even in the most optimistic case (consistent with our
supply side model which minimizes most of the short term depressive effects of the stabilization),
with superior effects on the real economy than in the observed British pattern, the fiscal outcome
would have been dramatic – the debt to GDP ratio would have been much higher than the British
level and would have likely been unsustainable. Furthermore, the short term benefits to France of
following such a policy in terms of bond market credibility were not that great. After the de facto
stabilization, French long-term interest rates declined below British levels within two years. This
suggests that undervaluation and commitment to the gold standard were more important
ingredients for low interest rates than the credibility that the return to prewar parity gave to
Britain (and which was paid for by intrinsic macroeconomic fragility during the 1920s).
      By contrast, a stabilization early in 1924, during the first Poincaré government ( which was
subsequently replaced by the Cartel des Gauches), would have been much more easily
sustainable. This was because the real value of the debt had already been reduced by inflation and
the post-war monetary overhang had disappeared with the beginning of flight from the currency.
We speculate on the consequences such an earlier successful stabilization might have had at the
national and international levels.
      Section 2 discusses the historical background with the aid of some figures. Section 3 presents
the model. Section 4 contains the simulations. Section 5 describes a hypothetical 1924
stabilization. Section 6 concludes.


                                               2. Historical Perspectives


      During World War I both Britain and France followed expansionary monetary policies to
facilitate war finance and their price levels ballooned, almost doubling in Great Britain by 1918
and more than doubling in France. In the U.S., the major wartime supplier and after 1917, ally,
prices only increased 70% (see figure 1)1. Although the exchange rates of the two countries were
pegged close to the pre-war parity by the exhaustion of their gold reserves and later by U.S. loans,
free convertibility had in a de facto sense been suspended in the face of a panoply of controls.
Once hostilities ceased and U.S. support ended, the franc plunged (see figure 2) ; only the pound
depreciated less than what one might expect given the price levels, something reflecting
expectations of rapid stabilization or a return to pre-war parity.

     Both countries used a mix of taxes, bond finance, and seigniorage to finance the war. The
British were able to raise taxes more than the French and consequently ran smaller budget deficits
(for Britain 69% of expenditures in 1918, for France 80%, Eichengreen (1992), table 3.1, p. 75).
Both countries borrowed considerably and both followed short-term interest rate pegs (figure 3)
whereby the central banks purchased short-term debt from the government and thereby expanded
the monetary base. In both countries the ratio of short-term to long-term debt increased. The
French, however, issued more bons de la défense nationale than the British issued Treasury bills.
Also France started World War I with a higher national debt relative to Britain and, with larger
deficits during the war, ended up with a much higher debt ratio (1.8 versus below 1.4). (see figure
4)

   To restore pre-war convertibility, both countries had to reduce their ratios of short-term to
long-term debt to prevent a rollover crisis, to restore budget balance and to deflate, in order to
restore purchasing power parity with the U.S., the only major country still on the gold standard.
France faced a tougher situation than did Britain as it had more inflation to unwind, a greater
budget deficit, a higher ratio of short-term to long-term debt and a greater monetary overhang.
Yet by early 1919, according to Eichengreen ((1992) p. 73), both countries were within striking
distance of restoring parity (the pound was overvalued against the dollar by 10%, the franc by
35%).
   In Britain, although the exchange rate was allowed to float, official circles expressed a strong
commitment to resume gold payments at the original parity. The first clear statement was in the
Cunliffe Report of 1918, followed in subsequent years by other official documents and most


                                                         5
clearly by the application of the cuts in government expenditures they recommended (James,
2000). The key argument for resumption at the old parity was the need to maintain credibility. It
was widely believed that this would restore the pre-war glory of the City of London (Bayoumi
and Bordo 1998). Vociferous opposition to resumption at the original parity before and after the
fact was voiced by J.M. Keynes in his tract The Economic Consequences of Mr. Churchill (1925).
He was supported by other academics, by labor (but not the official Labor party), and by industry
groups. Most of the opposition, however, with the principal exception of Keynes, was centered
not on resumption at the old parity per se but on the deflationary policies that were adopted to
attain it.
   Although the monetary authorities wanted immediate resumption after the war, they were
unwilling in 1919 to follow the requisite tight monetary policies. The subsequent boom (which
was worldwide) was ended by a very contractionary monetary policy in Britain (in part reflecting
the desire to return to the pre-war gold parity), in the US, and in several other countries in early
1920, which led to a serious recession ending in 1921. Thereafter sterling appreciated close to the
old parity by December 1922, but the appreciation was reversed and resumption was delayed
because of unfavorable events on the Continent (the Germans’ refusal to pay reparations and the
Belgian-French occupation of the Ruhr (Pollard, 1970)), the unsuccessful attempt by the framers
of the Genoa conference to arrange a coordinated international restoration of the gold standard,
and the unwillingness of the US to follow an inflationary policy, as the British authorities had
expected (Eichengreen, 1992). By early 1924 the exchange rate began a steady appreciation
toward parity. The authorities waited until the market had pushed sterling close to $4.86 before
officially announcing resumption on April 28, 1925 (see figure 2).
   During the resumption episode, British money supply contracted sharply between 1919 – 1922
and then leveled off (figure 5), prices fell dramatically in the 1919 – 21 recession and continued
to fall through the rest of the decade (figure 1). The British budget deficit declined drastically at
the end of the war, reaching a surplus by 1919 (figure 6), as did the ratio of debt to income (figure
4) and the British were able to convert much of their short-term debt to long-term debt. Long-
term rates, after rising from 1919 – 21, declined throughout the 1920’s reflecting deflation and
the restoration of bond market credibility once Britain returned to gold (figure 7). The return to
parity likely contributed to a well-known bad economic situation : real GDP and industrial
production dropped precipitously (over 10% below its 1913 level) (see figures 8 and 9). Despite
some recovery, they remained below their 1913 levels until 1925 and 1929 respectively.
Unemployment also shot up dramatically after 1919 to over 11% of the labor force. Despite a




                                                 6
subsequent fall, it was never below 6.5% for the rest of the decade (figure 10). Accompanying the
rise in unemployment was a rise in real wages (figure 11).

 France, like Britain, suffered recession in 1919 – 1921, seen in falling prices (figure 1) and
falling industrial production (figure 9) ; but the fiscal deficit declined one year later and by less
than in the British case, and debt ratios remained high. Monetary policy was relatively tight up to
mid-1923, reflected in the relative stability of the price level (figure 1), high interest rates (figure
3) and a stable exchange rate (figure 2). Fiscal policy tightened progressively : whatever the
discussions on the budgetary figures (see appendix), the deficit decreased but didn't disappear
before 1926. That delay resulted from discrepancies between the right and the left over how to
trim the deficit, but mostly, until 1923, from the hope that German reparations would solve the

budgetary problem. Only with the German hyperinflation did the French realize that the
reparations would not be forthcoming in sufficient magnitude to cover the costs of reconstruction
and to reduce the deficit, and that they would be unable to make Germany pay.

   The relative roles of the political impasse and of the recognition of the absence of German
payments are difficult to disentangle. On the one hand, the relative stability of prices, long term
interest rates and the exchange rate until 1923 suggest that markets believed in the promised
stabilization up to a certain point and that the German hyperinflation had an important role in
modifying their expectations. On the other hand, the share of taxes in GDP rose from 14% in
1923 to 17% in 1926, a jump that compensated for the loss in reparations and allowed the
stabilization to take place (A and B bonds from the 1921 settlement imposed a yearly payment of
3 billion gold RM, of which 52% would go to France. Given the fall in the real price of gold
corresponding to the US inflation, this represented no more than 2.5% of French GDP in the
1920s. Furthermore, the Dawes plan of 1924 only temporarily decreased Germany’s obligations,
and could even have increased the anticipated payments since the 1921-1923 record had been
much below the obligations). More than the political impasse which the conventional story
focuses on, the markets anticipated a budget crisis because of the struggle with Germany. This led
to capital flight, a deteriorating exchange rate, difficulties in the renewal of short term debt, and
finally a monetary expansion by the Bank of France and an acceleration in inflation.
   Poincaré’s Bloc National temporarily relieved the French crisis by raising indirect taxes. But
continued conflict over the distribution of the higher tax burden under the subsequent left-wing
Cartel des Gauches government and the threat of a capital levy (Hautcoeur and Sicsic 1999) led to
capital flight and a short-term debt funding crisis, further inflation and depreciation of the franc.
The Bank of France contributed to the crisis by raising the possibility of a stabilization at a parity
different from the prewar one, and by engaging in political attacks against the government
(Jeanneney, 1976). The crisis ended with a second Poincaré administration, having the support of


                                                  10
both left and right2. The Poincaré administration ruled out a capital levy, reduced government
expenditure, raised taxes, and reduced money growth. These policies restored price stability and
encouraged an appreciation of the franc to the point in December 1926 at which it was pegged to
the pound at an 80% depreciated rate. This tour de force resulted from a change of personnel at
the Bank of France where the new, Cartel appointed, Governor Emile Moreau helped to convince
Poincaré of such a stabilization. Long-term interest rates declined after the 1926 de facto
stabilization, likely reflecting a restoration of credibility (figure 7), which was reinforced by the
legal restoration of the gold standard in June 1928.
    Despite the monetary and financial turbulence, French real performance (output, industrial
production and unemployment) was generally superior to that of the British (see figures 8, 9 and
10). (Real wages also did not rise as was the case in Britain (figure 11)).
    In sum, although, the macro-economic fundamentals in France immediately after World War I
were not that far from those in Britain, the French chose not to go the resumption to original
parity route. According to Eichengreen (1992), a greater national debt with a larger short-term
component, coupled with a weak political economy, explains why the orthodox resumption policy
was not followed. Below, we try to confirm that intuition by considering what would have
happened to France if indeed the British strategy were tried in 1919, and whether the reasons for
the inability to achieve resumption were mostly economic or politic.
    One can justify our strategy by the following reasoning: the three speculative attacks3 on the
exchange rate (in 1919, 1924 and 1926) resulted partly (maybe entirely in 1926) from the absence
of a clear commitment similar to that existing in Britain after the Cunliffe report. Such a
commitment was likely a necessary condition for imposing the tighter fiscal policy that was
needed in 1919 for reconstruction and in 1924 to compensate for the illusory German payments.
We then consider whether an early commitment on the British model would have been credible or
not.


                                                  3. The model


    From the above discussion, we know that the most important constraints on the stabilization
decision were the public finances, encapsulated by the ratio of public debt to GDP. We will
consider the economic and political feasability under the counterfactual scenario of an early

2
 Poincaré’s political clout depended on his previous intransigent attitude toward Germany, which made it possible for
him to abandon the expectation of Reparations payments without endangering his political position.




                                                         11
stabilization. But before turning to that scenario, we must more precisely define the stabilization
that we have in mind. We then model its impact on the debt/GDP ratio through the main
macroeconomic variables affected: the budget, money supply, price level, investment and growth.
    Recent as well as past stabilizations (Eichengreen, 1990) usually require at least two
conditions to be met: a significant shift in fiscal policy and a change in the monetary regime (in
the definition of Sargent (1986). Both changes usually have a direct impact on nominal debt and
nominal GDP.
    We consider as exogeneously given the change in fiscal policy which was tending toward
fiscal balance. Both a reduction in expenditures or an increase in taxes may be considered,
although we will think mostly in terms of changes in the tax ratio (especially when considering its
impact on the economy). For simplicity, we consider that the government can directly choose the
tax/GDP ratio and the ratio of expenditures to GDP.
    The change in monetary regime, in the postwar context, had to embody a clear commitment to
the gold standard, as Britain had made starting with the Cunliffe report from 1918. Such a
commitment implied that the exchange rate be pegged, exchange controls lifted, and price levels
and interest rates be taken as exogenous.
    We assume that the demand for nominal money is a function of nominal GDP and anticipated
inflation4. Actually, the M2/GDP ratio, which was growing slowly before the war, rose rapidly
during the war from 50 to 70%, reflecting the monetization of the public debt. It then decreased
sharply during the inflationary period of 1919-1920, stabilized shortly around 50%, decreased
during the two following inflationary episodes of 1923-26, and rose back to around 50%
thereafter. It seems reasonable to us to consider 50% as the level of the M2/GDP ratio compatible
with the zero anticipated inflation that would occur with a return to the gold standard.
    If, at the moment of stabilization the money supply exceeded the real demand for money at the
new parity, a clear commitment to monetary contraction would be necessary. This would have
had direct implications that must be taken into account not only for the monetary policy
conducted by the central bank but also for the government budget. For example, since Bank of
France notes represented more than half of M2 in 1919, and the Bank’s loans to the State
represented 90% of its assets other than gold, a reduction in the State’s debt toward the Bank was
necessary for any monetary contraction required by a stabilization (see table 1). We must add any
such reimbursement to the budget expenditures.

3
  We use the term speculative attacks because in every case the exchange rate overshot its purchasing power parity
level ; it does not mean that there were not fundamental economic reasons for the attacks (except, maybe, for the third
episode, on which see Hautcoeur and Sicsic 1999).
4
  We could not find any statistically significant impact of the interest rate on M2/Y during the prewar period.

Amounts are approximatively what they were at the end of 1919 (see ANNHIST 2003).

In order to reduce M2 (Banque de France' notes + commercial banks' deposits), one may either reduce Notes or
Deposits. Notes result from credits or loans created by the Banque de France. Deposits result from commercial bank
credits. Thus, one may either reduce loans to the State (three quarters of the Banque de France's assets), or commercial
bank credits to the economy.
In 1919 M2 = 67 billion francs (37+30) = 71% of GDP. Suppose that a reduction of M2 by 17 billion francs to 50
billion is imposed to reach the M2/GDP 50% ratio. It would imply :
- either a 17 billion franc reduction in Banque de France' notes, which requires at least a 15 billion franc reduction in
the loans to the State (since its credits to the economy are very limited);
- or a 17 billion franc reduction in commercial banks deposits (57% of their amount), which requires a similar reduction
in their credits to the economy.
- or a combination of both.

Furthermore, the credibility of the stabilization would also require a significant reduction of these
loans: first, because a purely contractionary monetary policy would inordinately reduce the size
of the banking system relative to the central bank (see table 1); second, because without an
important reduction in the note issue, the gold reserve ratio would prove inadequate.
A last important requirement for postwar stabilization in the French context would be the
conversion of short term into long term debt, because of the threat that non-renewal would
represent for the public finances. This would have a small impact on the budget through the
difference in interest paid on both kinds of debt5.
    Using this model, we can calculate the impact of the stabilization on nominal debt, which is
the first step in our construction of a counterfactual debt/GDP ratio. It depends on the
assumptions to be made about the evolution of money demand (and then of GDP), government
expenditures and revenues, and the structure of public debt.


    The second step is the estimation of the impact of the stabilization on GDP. Our estimation
procedure was chosen to give lower bound estimates to our results. Since we will show that a

5
  This may also have an impact on the liquidity of the banking system since it owns a substantial part of the short term
debt. We do not discuss this here because of a lack of available data.


                                                            13
stabilization at the prewar parity was impossible in France, we instead choose a model and some
hypothetical scenarios that would maximize the chances of success. In that perspective, we
minimize the negative impact of a stabilization on GDP by using a supply side model which does
not place much emphasis on the impact of stabilization on demand6. This also provides a first
(optimistic) attempt at building an anti-keynesian interpretation of the 1920s in France. Another
reason for using this approach is that we wish to measure the sustainability of the public debt in
the medium run7.
    One methodological problem we face is that in order to simulate the effects of a stabilization,
we need to take the exchange rate and the price level as exogenous, which was clearly not the
case during the flexible exchange rate period from 1918 to 19268. This change in monetary
regime makes it impossible to use existing models of that period like that of Villa (1995), which
have a different purpose and which treat the exchange rate and the price level as endogenous9. In
order to facilitate comparisons, we nevertheless tried to be as close as possible to Villa’s model,
and we used the same data.
    Mainly in order to fix a few ideas, we estimated GDP using three steps. The first one concerns
the real wage level.
    A classic problem with stabilizations is the resulting appreciation of the real exchange rate
because of the persistence of ongoing inflation or (in our case) of the price level. In Great Britain,
the overvaluation (in PPP terms) of the pound in the 1920s has been considered to be the central
cause of the economic stagnation. A central point in most discussions of the British stabilization
is the role of wage rigidities in the transmission mechanism. We estimate the relationship
between increases in prices and nominal wage inflation. In our model where prices are
exogenous, wages must be influenced by price movements. Since wage rigidities are a short term
phenomenon, we add an error correction mechanism to restore real wages back towards their




6
  Econometric attempts to introduce demand into our model were not successful either.
7
  Nevertheless, we must remember that although sustainability is based on economic fundamentals, a credibility
constraint could also make it impossible for the debt/GDP ratio to rise above too high a level (history suggests 200-
250%) even for a short period.
8
  There is actually a tradition in French scholarship that considers purely speculative attacks on the exchange rate as the
prime mover during the French inflation of the 1920s (from Aftalion 1927 to Jeanneney 1991). Nevertheless, even in
speculative attack models, the exchange rate itself results from expectations which make it endogenous in a broader
sense (see e.g. Webb 1986).
9
   Actually, we must estimate the reactions of the economy during a flexible exchange rate period (the prewar period
did not have macroeconomic shocks of the sort the inter-war has) and to simulate a fixed rate regime, which makes
almost any model problematic in one of the two regimes. This is because what we want to measure is the change of
regime in itself, for which econometrics is of little help.


                                                            14
previous level10 (a mechanism provided in real life by unemployment, a variable so badly
measured in inter-war France that we could not estimate it).
     We then turn to investment. This should serve two different purposes. First investment is the
most sensitive economic variable, strongly influenced by expectations of a recession, and deeply
influencing aggregate demand. Second, investment contributes to long term growth through the
accumulation of capital. In a very classic way, we will consider that it is influenced by factor
prices. The government deficit is added because in the absence of monetary finance a deficit may
crowd-out private securities issues in the capital market, an effect which is frequently
underestimated in an open-economy context by the impact of interest rates.
     Finally, we add to this the variation of the tax ratio (taxes/GDP), under two possible rationales.
The first, in our supply side perspective, posits a negative effect of taxes on firms11. This could
affect investment through capital market imperfections creating a role for retained earnings in
investment12. But, since what we are mostly interested in is the impact of budget deficits on the
public debt, we can also consider it in a Keynesian perspective, in which tax increases are
equivalent (in their effect on the deficit, under simplifying hypotheses) to cuts in expenditures,
which negatively affect demand expectations.
     Thus investment is driven by variables which are all exogenous in our stabilization scenario:
prices (via nominal wages13); interest rates (capital controls never succeeded in our period, so that
the interest rate was determined as the world interest rate plus expectations of exchange rate
changes under the hypothesis of uncovered interest rate parity); and fiscal policy.
     From investment, we calculated total capital using a simple accounting procedure (which
coefficients were also estimated). We then estimated GDP introducing both the capital stock (in
order to introduce supply side accumulation effects) and investment (in order to introduce short
term fluctuations). We add past GDP, which allows us to include the impact of a delay required to
return the capital stock to full employment after the war. We do not include unemployment or the
labor force because of the difficulty of estimating a Philips curve with that period's data.
     The model can be summarized in the following way :


10
   We should take into account productivity growth, but after the war, it probably converged towards its prewar level,
which is implicitly assumed here.
11
   Actually, most increases in taxes during that period affected firms disproportionately, either through direct taxes on
profits or indirectly on dividends (Grotard and Hautcoeur 2001).
12
   At least in the medium run, taxation may have an impact on investment only if it redistributes from the productive
towards the unproductive sectors of the population (to use terms used by contemporaries) and then increases production
costs. As we estimate the impact of taxation using the overall government receipts/GDP ratio, we may overestimate the
impact of taxation on business if the tax policy that would have been undertaken together with an early stabilization
would have been less biased against firms or revenues from productive activities.
13
   Because wages were actually endogenous, we considered previous period wages for the estimation. However,
directly introducing the level of wages would have led us to mix demand with supply effects


                                                           15
w = w (p, Dev-1)
Ir = k (Def ; Dev-1 ; r , T)
Yr = y (Yr-1 ; K, Ir)
     Where w represents nominal wages, Dev is the relative deviation of nominal wages relative to
prices since 191314 (assumed to represent the error correction term necessary to restore real wages
toward their prewar level in the medium run15), K the real capital stock, r the long term real
interest rate, Def the government deficit (as a percentage of GDP it is supposed to reflect capital
market direct crowding-out of private investment), T/Y the ratio of government tax revenue to Y
(nominal GDP), Yr real GDP. When no subscript is added, variables are for the current year.
     The estimation results16 are presented in table 2 (ordinary least squares; t-stat in parenthesis):




14
   If w and p are measured in terms of two indices based on 1913, Devt = wt/pt.
15
    This neglects productivity growth. This is not very important for the initial years, and partly explains the
underestimation of GDP in the long term in our simulations. We did not find any solution that would allow us to
explicitly introduce productivity growth.
16
   As discussed above, it was not clear whether to estimate the behavior of the economy over the prewar period (one of
a fixed exchange rate) or over the inter-war (one including important macroeconomic shocks). Estimation of the
nominal wages equation was impossible in the prewar period because productivity variations dominated purely nominal
ones during that gold standard anchored economy. We estimated it over the inter-war (results including both inter-war
and prewar periods are similar). The equation on capital accumulation and the production function were estimated for
the 1896-1939 period. The results did not differ much from one period to another.

            We want to estimate the impact of an early stabilization (on the British model) on the
 French economy. From the above discussion, we know that the only moment after the war when
 the return to prewar parity was still possible was 1919, before the increase in prices that made the
 gap too large. Was such a stabilization historically possible ? The macroeconomic answer to this
 question is the reason for this section. Politically, the answer is most likely no : although
 everyone agreed on the return to prewar parity, no schedule was discussed, and the monetary
 committee appointed in April 1918 did not have the political clout the Cunliffe committee had
 (Mouré, 2002 : 40).
    One could still hypothesize, however, that a joint stabilization could have been a choice for
 France and Britain if they had wished to manage postwar Europe in a cooperative manner. If they



                                                         17
had announced early in 1919 that they would rapidly return together to the prewar gold parity and
immediately stabilize the franc-pound parity at its prewar level, the signal would have been
powerful, and we believe it would have alleviated overvaluation in Britain and inflation pressures
in France. Such a solution was never contemplated: the pegging of the franc to the dollar through
credits from the allies ceased on March 14th, 1919, starting the depreciation of the franc and
French inflation17.
   What we must consider here however is whether a unilateral French stabilization in 1919
would have been prevented by the size of the public debt.
   In order to answer that question, we must simulate the model presented above using the data
from the early 1920s. But before doing so, we present our main assumptions concerning the
exogenous variables of the model.
   First, as a result of the choice of the monetary regime, we assume that the franc would have
been fixed at its prewar parity with sterling18. With free capital flows between the two countries,
interest rates and price levels would then be the same in both countries19. We assume that France
would have acted as a follower and would have imported British prices and interest rates. With
expected inflation eliminated, we assume, as discussed above, that the demand for money would
be restored to its prewar level of 50% of GDP20. With prices given and an estimate of the path of
real GDP, we could easily find the level of the money stock and then the necessary adjustment for
the money supply, that is the amount of Banque de France's loans to the State which needed to be
reimbursed. Needless to say, the relationship between the Banque and the government did not
quite work that way. The government had to commit to reimburse the Banque (Mouré, 2002: 47),
indeed, the François-Marsal agreements signed in December 1920 between the Banque and the
government served just that purpose. They incorporated a promise to retire 2 billion francs a year
from the loans.
   One may consider that an earlier and more serious stabilization decision would have
incorporated a stricter commitment. Furthermore, 2 billion francs were not enough to give


17
   This reflected growing American isolationism and Britain's erroneous fear that France could become a dominant
power in Europe, when it was actually harmed much more by the war than was Germany, see e.g. Duroselle (1993 :
19).
18
   This assumption has the advantage of being more plausible than a peg with the dollar (which had not yet the same
prestige as the pound) ; alternatively, one may consider that France choose a policy similar to the British one.
19
    These assumptions are optimistic because before World War 1 interest rates in France were usually slightly higher
than in Britain, and because the level of the debt was higher in France at the end of the war, making a higher risk
premium likely. The assumption on prices is also optimistic since with greater amounts of wartime destruction, of
foreign debt and of government domestic debt, France would probably require lower prices to maintain the real
exchange rate at equilibrium.
20
   In Britain, the money stock in the early 1920s reached higher values relative to GDP than before the war, which may
be attributed to expected deflation. Nevertheless, France started with a high monetary overhang, which was not the case
in Britain, so that we do not think that France could have benefited from such a high demand for money.


                                                          18
credibility to a stabilization decision taken in 1919. An M2/GDP ratio of 50% (in line with the
prewar level) would then require such a sharp reduction in private bank money as to put the
banking system in danger. A simple calculation (such as explained in table 3) shows that
commercial bank deposits could decrease by considerable amounts in order for M2 to follow a
credible path (which we consider as reaching 50% of GDP within 4 years, a delay which by itself
requires some credibility). This holds even if the reimbursements of the State's loans are given a
higher value of 3 billion francs a year, which, we take as a minimum. We thus assume that the
government would have repaid 3 billion francs a year by increasing its long term borrowing. Such
an amount, if accompanied by a similar reduction in note issue, would also permit the Banque to
reach a cover ratio of 35% within the same time frame21, a condition for a successful stabilization.




          Table 3: The four year impact on M2 of stabilization under two assumptions on growth.


We assume stabilization of the growth rate of M2 by one half in 1919, thanks to loans to the State and
growth of the note issue by half its actual rate (this is consistent with our other assumptions on growth and
an early stabilization decision). This gives a 58 billion franc value for M2 in 1919, of which notes represent
33 billion. If the rate of growth of GDP follows its actual path (no impact of stabilization on growth), the
50% of GDP ratio produces an M2 level of 44 billion francs in 1923, a 14 billion (24%) reduction from
1919. If French GDP were to grow as it did in Britain, M2 must reach 32 billion francs in 1923. Below we
calculate the impact on private bank's deposits if there were no decrease in the note issue and if 3 billion
francs in notes were repaid each year consequent upon the government’s reimbursement of its loans to the
Banque.

     The next and most essential assumption affecting the debt/GDP ratio is the level of taxes.
Contrary to Britain, France did not increase taxes during the war. Actually, even the nominal
value of taxes decreased at the beginning of the war, and the 5,7 billion francs of taxes in 1918
represented in real value around 40% less than the 4,3 billions of 1913. Taxes increased sharply
in 1919, with the amount paid almost doubling (when prices increased by only 20%), but taxes
represented only 11% of GDP (compared to 9% in 1913 but by contrast 16% in 1918 and 23% in

21
     37 billion less (7 x 3) gives 16, of which 6 is slightly more than 35%.


                                                             19
1919 in Britain). We assume an increase of similar importance in 1920, bringing the tax/GDP
ratio to 20%, and another significant increase in 1921, bringing it up to 25% (this is a higher level
than that reached in Britain, and 50% higher than the highest reached in France during the 1920s).


   Finally, we hypothesize about the evolution of public expenditure under a different monetary
regime. We will assume that except for interest on the public debt (which path results from our
assumption of imported interest rates and an optimistic consolidation scheme22), other
expenditures are maintained in real terms, in the sense that they are adjusted in nominal value for
price fluctuations. We consider this choice as a reasonable compromise between the view that
inflation decreased real expenditure (which was the case for civil servants salaries) so that
deflation would have increased it; and the view which emphasizes the budgetary "laisser aller"
resulting from the lack of a nominal monetary anchor.
   One may argue that we do not give enough weight to reductions in expenditure as a solution to
the deficit. It has often been argued that the compensations for wartime destruction had been
subject to opportunism resulting in excessive State expenditure. This cannot be neglected since
these compensations were the main reason for the rise in government expenditure (representing
around 9% of GDP in 1920, 12% in 1921, 8% in 1922 and 7% in 1923 before decreasing rapidly
(Blancheton, 2000, p.161)23. Nevertheless, the existence of devastated regions for which national
solidarity was required was a French (and not a British) problem so that imitating the British
reduction in expenditure was much more difficult in France.
   One should also notice that a substantial share of the compensations does not appear in
government expenditure since it was financed through loans from the newly created Crédit
National (which issued 15 billion francs of bonds between 1919 and 1922, more than 10% of
1920 GDP). So we choose to maintain the real value of these expenditures in our stabilization
scenario, and put the rest of the adjustment effort onto tax increases.




22
   A last, mostly technical assumption concerns the structure of the public debt. It affects slightly the debt/GDP ratio
via the budget deficit, but only up to the (small) difference between the interest rates on short term and long term debt.
We assume that the short term debt is consolidated under the following scheme: instead of its actual evolution, it
remains in 1919 at the 1918 peak value of 56 billion francs (instead of its actual level of 20 billion higher) and
decreases thereafter by 10 billion a year up to 6 billion francs in 1924 and 0 afterwards. This is a relatively slow pace in
comparison with the sharp reduction in the short-term debt that actually occurred after 1926.
23
   One should add that war pensions were also generously distributed, not only to soldiers but to their families. This
represented yearly around 2% of GDP during the 1920s.

                                                       Results

     Using the equations estimated in the previous section and our assumptions discussed above
about the evolution of the exogenous variables, we can simulate our counterfactual. One must
remember that our assumptions are quite optimistic for the result of the stabilization24.
     One might have deduced from figure 4 that the debt level was not much more of a problem in
France than in Britain (the debt/GDP ratio was 1.8 compared to 1.4 in 1919). In fact, that
difference would have been greatly expanded by the consolidation process under the “British”
scenario that we assume, because 1/ the “money overhang” was much more important (without
already being entirely reflected in prices), and since much of the money creation corresponded to
loans to the State, they had to be repaid if the stock of money had to decrease; 2/ public
expenditures were so high that even sharp increases of taxes on the British model would not
eliminate the deficit.
     We show in figure 12 the likely paths of nominal debt under our assumptions and various
hypotheses on the evolution of real GDP. Under the pessimistic one, France follows the British
growth rate from 1919 on (this corresponds to the Keynesian thesis that considers the recession as
the result of the stabilization). Under the optimistic one (in favor of which we give some
arguments below), the French growth rate is not affected by the stabilization. We consider the
case where the government is not able to raise the tax level as mentioned in our scenario in order
to give an idea of the importance of this assumption25. If one considers the most optimistic "Taxes
and French growth" scenario, one may summarize the impact of our various assumptions in the
following manner. The stabilization does not much affect the primary budget, except for the rise


24
   This is the case for the structure of the model and of the assumptions about the exogenous variables. One might
suppose that we have neglected the impact of our hypothetical scenario on the French government’s financial position
vis-à-vis foreign countries, that is the value in our scenario's francs of German Reparations and interest payments on
war debts to Britain and the US. In fact, by considering government revenues and expenditures in real terms, we
considered most of their impact. To see this suppose that German Reparations were to follow the actual pattern in terms
of gold marks. Converted into francs, they would bring a smaller amount of revenues to the French Treasury in our
scenario, the difference being measured by the ratio of our hypothetical exchange rate to the actual one. This ratio does
not differ much from the ratio of our hypothetical price level to the actual one, so that the impact of basing our
calculation on the exchange rate would not add much to the result. The same is at least as true for interest payments on
inter-allied debt, since their real value may better (in an ability to pay reasoning) be defined in terms of real francs
(actual nominal payments divided by price level) as in terms of foreign currencies. One may also consider that we
underestimated the role of foreign relations. We have been unable to find empirical evidence of a substantial role of
foreign trade on output. This is contrary to the conventional wisdom, which says that the exchange rate depreciation
and the real undervaluation of the franc during the inflation period had an important role in stimulating demand and
promoting economic recovery. Furthermore, our scenario with a less undervalued franc is compatible with a higher
trade deficit, which is necessary in order for foreign saving to finance part of the government debt consolidation
process without endangering too much private investment. Finally, we neglect the various effects of a French
stabilization on British growth and interest rates. The outcome might have been favourable, if considered as more
cooperative. But this is highly speculative.
25
   We do not give it in the "British growth scenario", but in that case debt would clearly be even much higher.

in taxes, which is an essential feature, representing 61 billion francs more in public earnings from
1919 to 1925 than was actually the case. The debt consolidation process significantly affects the
amount of interest paid on the public debt (9 billion francs less than the actual payments). The
monetary consolidation (less recourse to monetary financing and reimbursement of 3 billion
francs a year to the Banque de France) imposes the issuance of 26 billion francs more of public
debt. One may conclude that even raising taxes enormously and benefiting both from a high
growth rate and from low interest rates, the level of public expenditures and the necessary
abandonment of monetary financing of the deficit made it impossible to significantly reduce the
level of nominal debt.

   If we turn now to the real side of the simulation (that of real GDP), we will observe that it will
not play much of a role in our results. Because of the level of the nominal debt in our scenario,
any reasonable assumption about the path of real GDP will imply an excessively high debt/GDP
ratio.
   The simulation of the wage level using equation 1 suggests a dramatic increase in real wages
when prices decrease, followed by a slower decrease than in the British case (figure 13). This
may reflect an overestimate of French nominal wage rigidity. Nevertheless, high rigidity of wages
also appeared in the 1930s. Some observers explain this by the importance of independent labor
in France compared to the case in Britain (which makes unemployment less of a threat to
workers, with the resulting smaller impact on wages, and also a smaller impact through demand
on GDP).

      The heart of our simulation is the rate of growth of investment, from which we calculate the
capital stock and GDP. Some simulations (figure 14) show that investment is very sensitive to the
assumptions made about tax increases (mostly), the wage level or interest rates. H1 is our basic
scenario; H2 to H5 are given in order to suggest the relative importance of the various effects we
separated; H2 presents our scenario except for the impact of interest rates, considered as zero ; H3
doubles the impact of all variables ; H4 shows our scenario except for the impact of real wages ;
H5 gives it except for the impact of taxes26. A comparison between our simulations of GDP, its
actual path and the value it would have had under British-style growth (figure 15) shows, as our
choice of model implied, that our model certainly underestimates the short term negative impact
of an early stabilization on GDP (thus making it easier), and underestimates the long term growth
of GDP (because it neglects productivity growth). It may also provide some argument in favor of
a new classical interpretation of interwar history. At least, it suggests that the most important
constraint on stabilization was perhaps less the reaction of the real economy than that of the
financial sphere.




26
   There was actually much discussion among contemporaries on the impact of taxation on the economy, and the
solution proposed was to concentrate it on the very beneficiaries of the deflation - - those rentiers with nominal fixed
incomes. This was difficult not only because of their political clout - - taxing only public debt was too similar to a
default, and taxing all assets was politically difficult and economically controversial.

   This is confirmed by a look at the debt/GDP ratios in figure 16. We took as references the
polar cases of French and British actual growth rates, since the most optimistic scenarios we
simulated above for GDP were quite similar to the actual French path. We observe that in both
cases the debt/GDP ratio rises above sustainable levels (it reaches 240% even in the most
optimistic one), because even very high levels of taxation (such as in our main scenario) cannot
entirely eliminate the budget deficits. This confirms that making the financial constraint less

binding depends more on financial or monetary reforms (including inflation) than on the
economic situation. More importantly, no scenario is able to lower the debt/GDP ratio below 2,
even after a decade of very tight budgetary policy. This suggests that following Britain was
probably impossible in post-war France, even on the assumption that the French would have
accepted a major increase in taxes and under optimistic assumptions about the reaction of the
economy. This

                                              5. A stabilization in 1924


   The previous paragraphs show that no stabilization was possible in 1919. During the following
years, the debt/GDP ratio decreased mainly during two short periods in 1920 and 1924-26.
Stabilization occured after the second one. One might wonder whether it could have been realized
earlier. In 1920-23, the political preference for a return to prewar parity made any attempt at
stabilization unlikely to succeed. Nevertheless, market interest rates show that a stabilization
including a limited devaluation was expected throughout 1920-1924 (Hautcoeur and Sicsic 1999).
This solution became more likely in early 1924. The reasons for this include the facts that: the
German hyperinflation had just made clear that Germany would not pay and inflation was a
serious danger; the French Parliament accepted the plan to sharply raise most taxes (the "double
decime", a 20% increase in all taxes), bringing the budget almost to balance; this helped Poincaré,


                                                                 26
who was still the head of the government, to successfully stop a currency crisis (the pound rose
up to 123 francs on March 8 and returned to 63 on April 23) ; opinions changed in favour of a
stabilization recognizing a substantial devaluation of the franc (especially at the Treasury under P.
de Mouÿ) (Blancheton 2000; Mouré 2002: 64ss) ; and the preparation of the Dawes Plan which
created a favorable international environment even if it did not solve the problem of French debts
to the Allies.
     Consequently, we construct a stabilization scenario for April 1924, a scenario that Poincaré
could have pursued would he have won the elections, and even if it had been done before the
elections and he had lost, it is doubtful that the successor Cartel des Gauches would have
abrogated it27. Its main building blocks would be the following: stabilization at a level consistent
with purchasing power parity, after which France would follow the path of British prices and
interest rates.
     A significant question is the level of the exchange rate to produce such a stabilization. We
propose an exchange rate of 55 francs per pound sterling as the stabilization rate, since it is the
one that Sauvy considered best corresponded to purchasing power parity28. It is considerably
below the mean rate of 75 for 1924 but near the April rate of 63, making a successful stabilization
more difficult to achieve. Actually, a higher rate in terms of francs per pound would mean more
depreciation of the franc, facilitating exports, lowering the interest rate compatible with interest
rate parity, and so probably raising real GDP. It would also eventually allow more room for price
increases, thus raising nominal GDP. Both effects would decrease the debt/GDP ratio. Since we
will demonstrate that a stabilization was possible in 1924, this hypothetical exchange rate makes
proving our point more difficult and any other plausible rate would make stabilization easier to
achieve.
     For this exercise, we cannot use our previous model to simulate GDP since it was constructed
in order to bias the result in favor of a successful stabilization. We propose instead to consider
two paths for GDP. First, the pessimistic case, where the growth rate is assumed to be that of the
UK after its own 1919 stabilization decision. Second, the optimistic case, in which the actual
French growth rate is not modified. We believe that the "British" path would have been unlikely
for France since poor British economic performance in the early 1920s reflected: in part the
transition from the war economy to peacetime which was no longer the case in France in 1924; in
part the international context (in 1921); and in part the deflationary policy followed by the British

  Based on the observation that left wing parties are often strong supporters of financial orthodoxy, e.g. both the
British and French experiences in the 1930's, and the French left proclamations in the 1920's.

(which is not considered to be the case in France since we only assume a stabilization of prices).
We take this scenario as the "worst case".
   In both cases, we assume that interest rates follow the British path, exactly as in the 1919
scenario. New taxes would have been created so as to raise the tax/GDP ratio to 20% in 1924 and
25% in the following years. This represents an important rise, although not such a jump as in the
1919 stabilization scenarios, and it reinforces the idea that the real impact of the stabilization
should be small. The short term debt is consolidated at the same rate as in the 1919 scenario (by
10 billion francs a year beginning in 1924).
   On the monetary front, the difference between this stabilization scenario and the 1919 situation
is that, thanks to the flight from the currency in the years 1922-23, a stabilization leading to a
M2/GDP ratio of 50% would require an increase of the money supply (figure 17). And since note
issues represented only half of M2 at the end of 1923, a decrease of Banque de France loans to
the government was not required. Such a stabilization law, we posit would have revalued the gold
reserves (approximately from 5.5 to 11 billion francs), and the nominal profits gained would have
been used to cancel part of the government debt, as it was the case in 1928. So the debt would be
no more than 18 billion francs, half of the note issue. The gold reserve would then represent
almost one third of the note issue of 37 billion francs. The decrease in the loans to the
government would then have a purely psychological significance. One billion a year would be
sufficient, and its negative impact on the budget would be compensated by its positive impact on
monetary policy. Since M2 would not have had to decline, and the note issue would decrease, the
Banque could relax slightly or at least not harden its monetary policy. This also suggests that our
results are biased against a positive outcome from the stabilization.

   That is Sauvy's estimate of the PPP exchange rate at that moment. There has been considerable debate over the
correct price indices to use to calculate PPP for that period, and discussions about purchasing power parity calculations
in a context of important structural changes (since the prewar period). See Mouré (1996) and Sicsic (1992).

   We calculate the path of the debt/GDP and deficit/GDP ratios in a combination of these
hypotheses in figures 18 and 19. The debt/GDP ratio never rises above 2, even under the
pessimistic growth scenario and even if no new taxes are collected. Moreover, since a better
international environment in 1924 made it more likely for growth to be present than was the case
in Britain in 1919, we must conclude that a stabilization was possible in 1924 in France, even at
an ambitious exchange rate such as one half the prewar parity.

   We have estimated the impact of an early stabilization on the British model for the French
economy under very optimistic assumptions: that France would immediately benefit from the low
British level of long term interest rates and from price stabilization; that the budget deficit would
be reduced with little or no cost; and that the impact of the stabilization on GDP would be very
limited.
   Our main conclusion is that such a stabilization was impossible because of the salient problem
of the French economy after the war - - the excessive level of the public debt and the monetary
overhang. Under any plausible assumptions, an early stabilization would have pushed the
debt/GDP ratio well above 2 during many years, most likely an unsustainable level. The high debt
ratio we argue makes our stabilization scenario quite unlikely because it would have damaged the
government's credibility even were the serious distributive conflicts resolved. The apparent
solution of a capital levy, which would have reduced the volume of the public debt, was not
possible - - not only because of the general difficulties such a solution would have faced
(described by Eichengreen, 1990), but also because the increase in the real value of private debt
would likely have driven many businesses, and then many banks, to failure.
   This suggests that not only political considerations but also economic (more precisely
financial) constraints made an early stabilization on the British pattern impossible to realize in
France, probably despite the willingness of many politicians and the Banque de France.




                                                                   30
   Later on, a stabilization was politically difficult not only because it was only a pis-aller for
believers of the franc Germinal but because there was no obvious (and then credible) level where
the stabilization could be easily fixed. Nevertheless, we have shown, using both a detailed look at
the chronology and counterfactual calculations similar to the preceeding ones, that the most
virulent inflationary period, that of 1924-26, could have been avoided with a stabilization in 1924
at a devalued parity of 55-75 francs per pound, a much higher rate than the 125 francs parity that
would be fixed in 1928. Such a stabilization had became possible because the budget had been
(almost) balanced and the debt had been deflated by inflation and growth. The French had also
reduced their demands for German Reparations, which contributed to an easier international
settlement.
   One would be wrong to consider that the difference between our counterfactual 1924
stabilization and the actual de facto stabilization of 1926 is not that great. However, a 1924
stabilization would have had some important political advantages in the long term. France would
have stabilized more or less in line with Britain and Germany. This would have reinforced her
credibility and world position. Consequently, the Banque de France would not have had its vanity
wounded by the dominant position of the Bank of England. It would have assisted in other
European stabilizations, putting less pressure on Britain and building a more balanced and
cooperative political system in Europe. The real exchange rate of the franc would have been more
in line with that of the pound, limiting gold flows to France, the "international misallocation of
gold", and the pressure on the international monetary system in the late 1920s.
   The obstacles to such a beneficial stabilization were mostly political: within France, it implied
one last tax increase which provoked sharp debates; it also required a less conservative Banque de
France. But also, the obstacles were many outside France including: US isolationism and
opposition to any new loan to France (in contrast with Germany); erroneous British fear of
French domination in Europe; and British reluctance to share their monetary prestige. These
obstacles contributed to make it impossible to achieve such a Pareto-improving cooperative
solution. Perhaps had the IMF been in existence in the 1920s to provide the necessary funding,
the outcome would have been very different, and the gold standard would be less remembered as
a system so prone to produce great depressions.

                        APPENDIX: some details on the calculations and data



Data for all the graphs in section 2 come from the database used in Bordo et al (2001) and Mitchell (1992).
Data for the estimations and simulations are from Villa (1997). The most debated data for the period are the
budget deficit and the public debt. Available series for the debt include Sauvy (1984, vol.3, p. 16), Villa
(1997) and Bonnefous (reproduced in Mouré, 2002, p.42). Differences are important (see graph. A1). We
used Villa's series as being the most favourable to a stabilization in 1919 and the least one for a late
stabilization. Budget deficit series include that of Villa (1997), and two series reproduced in Mouré (2002,
p.42), from Bonnefous and from a Ministry of Finance archival document (B33985).


The crucial element in the paper is the calculation of the amount of public debt. It is calculated using Villa's
(1997) series DETTE (thereafter D), DGLT, DGCT (for total, long term and short term debts), AVANCES
(for Banque de France's loans to the government (thereafter AV); and BFG (budget deficit).
We have: DETTE = DGLT + DGCT
In theory we should have BFGt = Dt - Dt-1 since debt is measured in nominal terms. In fact, some
variations in the series of the debt level exceed the budget deficit of the corresponding year. This results
from different sources for the two series. We decided to give a priority to the debt series, which can only
minimize the debt level, going against our main point. So we added to the deficit the debt variations
exceeding it29.
In order to calculate the values of BFG, DGCT, DGLT and D in our scenarios, we calculated a primary
deficit. This supposed deducting interest paid on long and short term debt, which we estimated assuming 1/
that the long term debt in 1913 paid a 3% rate ; 2/ that every year's debt increase after 1913 paid that year's
yield of the 3% rente, plus half a percentage point; and 3/ that short term debt always paid 5% interest.
Knowing the deficit (BFG), we could calculate its value in our scenario, first by deflating its amount by the
ratio of British to French prices (based on the assumed stabilization year), then by adding the value of new
taxes, and the value of the consolidation of Banque de France loans (e.g. 3 billion a year, plus the deflated
value of the actual growth of those loans, which should have been financed by the budget in our scenario).
Adding to this hypothetical primary deficit the interest paid on the previous year's long term and short term
debt allows us to calculate the hypothetical deficit BFG, and then to calculate Dt using Dt-1. Our hypothesis
on the evolution of short term debt (stagnation in 1919, consolidation of 10 billion a year from 1920 on)
allows us to calculate the long term debt (DGLT=D-DGCT). Using both, we calculate the amount of
interest paid, which enters in the increase of D. This allows to take into account both the consolidation of
short term debt and the decrease in budget deficits (thanks to new taxes) in the calculation of interest on the
long term debt.


29
  Nevertheless, we smoothed the evolution of these variations in the three years 1919-1921 (instead of -20, +6.7, -16.7,
we put a constant -10 every year) in order to eliminate apparent shocks resulting only from problems in these series.


                                                          35
Then, we calculate our hypothetical primary deficit from our assumptions on short term debt (DGCT),
interest rates paid on both long and short term debts, the evolution of government expenditures and existing
ressources, and the creation of new taxes. Then, the budget deficit at t equals:
Deft = INTLTt + INTSTt + PrimDeft - NTt - AV
where Def is the deficit, INTLT interest paid on long term debt, INTST interest on short term debt and
PrimDef is the primary budget deficit (PrimDef = G -T) (G represents public expenditures other than
interest payments and T taxes). NT are new taxes30. AV is the variation of Banque de France loans (which
provided a non-monetary resource, or which reimbursement increased the deficit. The evolution of the debt
follows from that of the deficits.
