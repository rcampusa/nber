What drives globalization today and in the past? We employ a new micro-founded measure of bilateral
trade costs based on a standard model of trade in differentiated goods to address this question. These
trade costs gauge the difference between observed bilateral trade and frictionless trade. They comprise
tariffs, transportation costs and all other factors that impede international trade but which are inherently
difficult to observe. Trade costs fell on average by ten to fifteen percent between 1870 and 1913. We
also use this measure to decompose the growth of global trade over that period and find that roughly
44 percent of the global trade boom can be explained by reductions in trade costs; the remaining 56
percent is attributable to economic expansion.

          measure of bilateral trade costs based on a standard model of trade in diﬀerentiated goods
          to address this question. These trade costs gauge the diﬀerence between observed bilateral

          fell on average by ten to Þfteen percent between 1870 and 1913. We also use this measure
          to decompose the growth of global trade over that period and Þnd that roughly 44 percent

1        Introduction

International trade costs are the costs of transaction and transport associated with the ex-

change of goods across national borders and, thus, impede international economic integration.

They may also drive many key Þndings in the contemporary open-economy macroeconomics

literature (Obstfeld and Rogoﬀ, 2000). At the same time, economists know little about the

magnitude, evolution, and determinants of these obstacles to international trade (Anderson

and van Wincoop, 2004).

        Research on the nineteenth century trade boom has tracked certain costs like freight rates

and tariﬀs reasonably well (O’Rourke and Williamson, 1999). But the magnitude and impact of

a host of other important impediments to trade that are inherently diﬃcult to measure like non-

tariﬀ barriers, information costs, distribution channels, market micro-structures, legal frictions,

and the costs of uncertainty remain unexplored. As a step towards a better understanding of

these costs, our strategy is to move beyond the study of individual commodities and particular

trade cost elements to a more general approach derived from sound economic theory.

   We present a new comprehensive measure of international trade costs. We study trade costs

that are broadly deÞned and encompass not only shipping costs and tariﬀs but also many other

informational, institutional, and non-tariﬀ barriers to trade. Our focus is on the Þrst wave of

globalization from 1870 to 1913, a period that experienced many changes in trade costs and

substantial growth in trade.

   Our measure is derived from a micro founded gravity model of trade that is fully consistent

with the state-of-the-art gravity equation literature (e.g., Anderson and van Wincoop, 2003).

The framework is a multiple-country general equilibrium model of trade in diﬀerentiated goods

based on Novy (2007). We include bilateral trade costs and emphasize that to be consistent with

the theory these must be measured against trade costs with all other trade partners. Anderson

and van Wincoop (2003) call this multilateral resistance, and our measure captures this.

   The innovation here is to model and control for multilateral resistance in a tractable, yet

previously un-noticed way. This makes it possible to back out the bilateral trade costs from

the model’s gravity equation of international trade. It also obviates the estimation of arbitrary

speciÞcations of the trade cost function which is a typical feature of the current gravity litera-

ture. Instead, we compute trade costs directly on the basis of bilateral trade, total trade and

output data.

   The average level of trade costs between the US, UK, France and their trading partners

fell by ten to Þfteen percent in the forty years before World War I. Trade costs declined at a

rate of about 0.3 percent per year for the average country pair. The annual fall in trade costs

was therefore not as large as the roughly two percent annual decline in freight indices between

1870 and 1913 noted by Harley (1988) and Shah Mohammed and Williamson (2004). The

diﬀerence can easily be reconciled. Transportation costs are only one input into trade costs, as



                                                2
emphasized by Anderson and van Wincoop (2004). The factors contributing to declines in trade

costs include ocean shipping freight rates, the rise of the classical gold standard and improved

communication technology. On the other hand, international trade costs did not fall as quickly

as they might have because of tariﬀs (measured as tariﬀ revenue relative to total imports) that

rose on average by 50 percent between 1870 and 1913, new non-tariﬀ barriers, and ostensibly

faster domestic integration.1

    This allows for an interpretation of the late nineteenth century in which overall declines in

aggregate trade costs were much smaller than the observed decline in maritime freight rates.

Nevertheless, this is still compatible with a ‘Þrst wave of globalization’ since small changes in

trade costs can be suﬃcient to generate large increases in trade ßows as argued by Obstfeld

and Rogoﬀ (2000). And in fact, there is no question that these changes are most likely the

principal drivers of the rise in the share of output devoted to international trade. We argue

and demonstrate that one does not need to appeal to large changes in trade costs to see the

doubling in the export to GDP ratio reported by O’Rourke and Findlay (2003).

    After examining the levels and trends in trade costs, we turn to the determinants of trade

costs. This exercise underscores that our trade cost measure is reliable. In particular, our

evidence suggests that standard variables like geographic proximity, trade policy, transportation

costs, adherence to the gold standard, and membership in the British Empire matter in sensible

ways for explaining trade costs.

    Turning to the question of what drives globalization episodes, we use the micro-founded

gravity equation to attribute the growth in global trade to two fundamental driving forces — the

growth in productive capacity and the decline in trade costs. In line with the post-World War II

experience (see Baier and Bergstrand, 2001 and Whalley and Xin, 2007), we Þnd that roughly

56 percent of the global trade boom prior to World War I was due to the growth in productive

capacity and 44 percent was due to the decline in trade costs. We unmask a substantial degree

     See Williamson (2006) on the global rise in tariﬀs measured as tariﬀ revenue divided by import values. His
world average rises from 12 percent in 1865 to 17.5 percent in 1900. See Saul (1967) for a discussion of non-tariﬀ
barriers. See Jacks (2005) on domestic integration based on wheat price data. He shows much faster within-
country integration than cross-border integration. A fall in the cost of domestic trade (all else equal) makes
international trade relatively more costly.

of heterogeneity between core and periphery performance. Economic expansion contributes

the lion’s share of trade growth for core countries while trade cost declines dominate for the

periphery.


2    Historical Perspectives on Trade Costs

Economic historians generally concede that the Þfty years before World War I comprise a period

of globalization akin to our own in many respects. The world economy witnessed sustained

increases in international commodity, capital, and labor ßows (O’Rourke and Williamson, 1999

and Obstfeld and Taylor, 2004). Historical accounts, as well as popular conceptions of trade in

the years from 1870 to 1913, have generally stressed the singular role played by developments in

transportation and communication technologies in conquering time and space. The extension

of the railroad and telegraph networks take pride of place in promoting economic integration

domestically and in helping move goods to ports. In this view the increased use of steam

ships and persistent improvements in shipping technology play a similar role with respect to

international markets (see Frieden, 2006, p. 19 and James, 2001, pp. 10-13).

    In the most inßuential contribution to this literature, O’Rourke and Williamson accordingly

write that the “impressive increase in commodity market integration in the Atlantic economy

[of] the late nineteenth century” was a consequence of “sharply declining transport costs” (1999,

p. 33). Their metric for integration is the narrowing of price gaps for key commodities such

as wheat and iron. The data on this commodity price convergence throughout the nineteenth

century is extensive and well-documented (O’Rourke and Williamson, 1994 and Jacks, 2005).

However, O’Rourke and Williamson (1999) are quick to point out that a host of other factors

could also be responsible for the dramatic boom in global trade during the period, chief among

them being increases in GDP and import demand.

    What about other costs of trade besides transport? Recent research suggests a strong role

for developments outside the communication and transportation sectors. Jacks (2006) oﬀers

evidence from a number of North Atlantic grain markets between 1800 and 1913 that freight

costs can only explain a relatively modest fraction of trade costs in those markets. Jacks



                                               4
concludes that trade costs were also powerfully inßuenced by the choice of monetary regime

and commercial policy as well as the diplomatic environment in which trade took place. Even

so, a substantial portion of trade costs are left unexplained by these observables.

   A diﬀerent strand in the literature has examined integration based on the gravity approach

to international trade. Estevadeordal, Frantz and Taylor (2003), Flandreau and Maurel (2001),

and López-Córdova and Meissner (2003) Þnd that distance, tariﬀs, monetary regime coordina-

tion as well as cultural and political factors played a very important role in explaining global

trade patterns.

   And what of the view from the nineteenth century itself? The perceived factors were

manifold but could be boiled down to technological, informational, and institutional ones.

Such views are summarized in an 1897 study of trade costs in the British colonies conducted

and published at the request of Joseph Chamberlain (Trade of the British Empire and Foreign

Competition, 1897). The report surveyed colonial governors as to the reasons why non-Empire

producers were gaining market share in the British Empire.

   From their comments, it is obvious that determining total trade costs is more complex than

adding together an ad valorem tariﬀ value and unit shipping costs. Shipping costs were diﬃcult

to calculate directly as they varied by good, season, and with local economic conditions. The

governor of the colony of Victoria in Australia hesitated to give an average of the freight costs

from Europe due to such ßuctuations. The diﬀusion of the steamship was no simple matter

either as it favored certain classes of goods while sailing ships, still in heavy use on many longer

routes as late as 1894, favored others. There were also government subsidies on several, but

not all, key liners traveling between East Asia and Europe. All of this suggests that any single

freight index based on only a few commodities and routes is bound to be problematic if used

as a summary measure of shipping costs.

   Other governors also noted how diﬀerential marketing techniques, proximity, information

about local tastes and needs, credit practices, the relative quality and appearance of goods,

exchange rate stability, and even the precise weights and measures used in the marketing process

helped determine trade ßows. Moreover, Saul (1967) discusses at length how non-tariﬀ barriers



                                                 5
were impeding trade. Discriminatory railway tariﬀs, health and safety regulations, along with

conditional clauses to trade treaties and lengthy legal delays in challenging them featured in

the late nineteenth century trading system.

    What all of this evidence suggests is that our knowledge of the drivers and level of interna-

tional integration in the nineteenth century has a gap. Moving beyond the study of individual

commodities and particular trade cost elements to a more general attack on the issue may be

beneÞcial in this regard. We now show how to measure trade costs this way.


3    International Trade in General Equilibrium with Trade Costs

Recent theoretical advances in the trade literature have revived interest in trade costs as a de-

terminant of bilateral trade. In their state-of-the-art contribution, Anderson and van Wincoop

(2003) provide a now widely used method to estimate the elasticity of trade with respect to

speciÞc bilateral trade barriers. Moreover, they show how to avoid an omitted variables bias

in such an estimation. They demonstrate that the volume of trade between two countries is

not only determined by their bilateral trade barrier but also by their trade barriers with all

other trading partners. These ‘multilateral’ barriers are appropriately weighted averages of all

bilateral barriers. Intuitively, what matters for the volume of trade between two particular

countries is how their bilateral barrier compares to other bilateral barriers.

    Novy (2007) shows that multilateral trade barriers can simply be related to a country’s total

exports. The intuition is that the more a country exports, the lower must be its trade barriers

with other countries. Given this way of controlling for time-varying multilateral resistance,

the model goes on to derive an analytical solution for micro-founded bilateral trade costs that

depends on observable variables such as trade and output data. It therefore becomes possible

to compute bilateral trade costs over time. This is the strategy that we pursue in this paper.

    It is important to stress that the model by Novy (2007) is based on the same multiple-

country general equilibrium framework as the model by Anderson and van Wincoop (2003). In

particular, goods are diﬀerentiated by country and consumers love variety, so we use a standard

CES Dixit-Stiglitz consumption index. Trade between countries is costly, as captured by iceberg



                                                6
trade costs.

       The innovation of the theoretical model is twofold. First, as already mentioned, the model

provides a convenient way of controlling for multilateral resistance so that it becomes possible

to solve for bilateral trade costs. This simpliÞcation implies that we do not need to impose any

particular structure on trade costs either as to the set of determinants or their underlying func-

tional form.2 Second, the model relaxes the assumption made by Anderson and van Wincoop

(2003), and nearly all of the gravity literature, that all goods are tradable. When computing

trade costs, we explicitly allow for the fact that some goods are nontradable. Below we test

the sensitivity of all of our results to this modiÞcation and show that our central Þndings are

robust.

       Since many trade cost components are not directly observable, the need for a micro-founded

trade model to infer total trade costs is evident. Our trade cost measure is comprehensive

because it captures a wide range of trade frictions. We do not restrict our interpretation of

trade costs to well-known trade barriers such as tariﬀs and transportation costs. Following

Anderson and van Wincoop (2003, 2004) and Eaton and Kortum (2002), we acknowledge that

many sizeable trade cost components such as language barriers, communication costs and non-

tariﬀ barriers are not directly observable or measurable in price diﬀerentials alone.

       Finally, it should be emphasized that we consider aggregate trade and thus a very large

range of goods. The price gap methodology is simplicity itself but is restricted to only a few

goods due to data limitations and rests on an implicit arbitrage equation and the absence of

price discrimination (see Section 4 in Anderson and van Wincoop, 2004). We base our results

on a proven trade model — the gravity model. As in any other gravity model, we have to impose

assumptions on the elasticity of substitution and the aggregate tradability of the economy to

generate an estimate of bilateral trade costs. But as we show in the appendix, neither of these

two assumptions are too strong for our empirical conclusions. Overall, we view our methodology

as complementary to measures of price gaps. We therefore think that both approaches have

    The gravity equations by Baier and Bergstrand (2001) and Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) include
unobservable and highly nonlinear price indices. Baier and Bergstrand (2001) only consider transportation costs
and tariﬀs, whereas Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) assume that trade costs are a function of distance and a
border barrier.

advantages and shortcomings and, while focusing on diﬀerent aspects, each can provide valuable

insights into the integration of world markets.

3.1      A Gravity Equation with Trade Costs

This section provides a brief outline of the Novy (2007) model. The details of the model are given

in the technical appendix for reference. The model is general equilibrium and comprises multiple

countries that can vary in size. In each country, monopolistically competitive Þrms produce

diﬀerentiated goods. Optimizing individuals receive utility from consuming a large variety

of both domestic and foreign goods. When goods are shipped from country j to country k,

exogenous iceberg trade costs τ j,k are incurred, meaning that for each unit the fraction τ j,k melts

away during the trading process as if an iceberg were shipped across the ocean. Modeling trade

costs in this way is well established and customary in the literature; for example see Samuelson

(1954), Krugman (1980) and Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) whose representation of trade

costs is equivalent to using iceberg trade costs.

       We emphasize that trade costs τ j,k actually capture what makes international trade more

costly over and above intranational trade. For more details on this point see Novy (2007)

and Anderson and van Wincoop (2004, p. 716).3 We also follow the literature by making the

standard assumption of trade cost symmetry (τ j,k = τ k,j ), and without loss of generality we

normalize intranational trade costs to zero (see for example Baier and Bergstrand, 2001).4

       The equilibrium solution of the model gives rise to the following micro-founded gravity

equation

(1)            EXPj,k EXPk,j = sj (GDPj − EXPj )sk (GDPk − EXPk )(1 − τ j,k )2ρ−2

where GDPj is real output of country j, EXPj,k are real exports from j to k and EXPj ≡
P
  k6=j EXPj,k are total real exports from j. The elasticity of substitution is given by ρ and sj
   3
     This point can be seen in the example of grain shipments from the US to the UK after 1850. Much of
the decrease in the price gap between England and the US came through a narrowing of price gaps between
the Midwest and the East coast. Better and cheaper transportation networks improved the links between the
Midwest and the Atlantic ports. In this case we might see commodity price convergence between Chicago and
Liverpool but little change in trade shares. Federico and Persson (2007) examine this issue in detail.
   4
     Even if the two bilateral trade barriers are asymmetric, their geometric average corresponds precisely to the
trade costs implied by the symmetry assumption. Our trade costs can therefore be interpreted as an average of
the barriers in both directions. See Anderson and van Wincoop (2003, p. 175) for details.


                                                        8
is the fraction of the entire range of goods produced in country j that are tradable.

      Empirically we distinguish between traded and tradable. Goods may be tradable but traded

in only very small quantities or not at all due to prohibitive trade costs. For instance, beef

from Argentina could have been exported to Europe at great cost prior to modern refrigeration

technology, so we would classify this product as tradable throughout the period but not very

heavily traded. Some portion of the range of goods produced, however, is inherently nontradable

such as government defense services and so forth.

      Our gravity equation is not a function of a simple GDP term. As in any gravity equation,

bilateral trade ßows are an increasing function of productive capacity and a decreasing function

of trade frictions. The innovation of micro-founded gravity equation (1) is to show that the

total export terms encompass multilateral trade barriers in a convenient and practical way. In

particular, the size variables GDP −EXP are theoretically appropriate controls for multilateral

resistance (see the technical appendix for a formal derivation). For example, suppose that

exports of country j with all other countries besides k increase so that EXPj increases. Hold

all else equal on the right hand side of equation (1). Then EXPj,k EXPk,j must go down. The

intuition is as follows. For total exports EXPj to increase, country j’s trade costs with other

countries must have decreased, for instance τ j,l with l 6= k. Trade with country k has therefore

become relatively more costly, leading to the decrease in EXPj,k EXPk,j . Equation (1) thus

captures the point forcefully made by Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) that trade ßows are

not only determined by bilateral trade costs τ j,k but also by multilateral trade barriers.

3.2     A Micro-Founded Measure of Trade Costs

Since equation (1) relates multilateral resistance to total export terms, it becomes possible to

rearrange equation (1) so as to directly solve for trade costs τ j,k as a function of observable

variables. Rearrange (1) to obtain
                                  µ                                         ¶     1
                                                 EXPj,k EXPk,j                  2ρ−2
(2)                 τ j,k = 1 −
                                      sj (GDPj − EXPj ) sk (GDPk − EXPk )   .

This is our key equation. Trade costs are not estimated. They are simply calculated directly

as a function of the trade and GDP data. Equation (2) shows intuitively that if trade ßows

                                                    9
between j and k have increased but productive capacity in the two countries has remained

constant, then trade costs must have come down to facilitate the increase in trade. Conversely,

if trade ßows between j and k have remained constant but productive capacity has increased,

then trade costs must have gone up because the increase in output has not fed through to trade.

        Note that productivity changes do not aﬀect τ j,k . Consistent with the overwhelming major-

ity of models in the New Open Economy Macroeconomics literature, the production function is

linear in productivity (see the technical appendix and Obstfeld and Rogoﬀ, 1995). An increase

in the productivity of country j will therefore feature multiplicatively in bilateral exports, in

total exports, and in GDP and will therefore cancel out in equation (2). The intuition is that

price changes arising from productivity changes aﬀect all consumers both domestic and foreign.

Trade costs measure the relative cost of international versus domestic trade.

        We consider aggregate trade ßows between j and k such that τ j,k is a measure of aggregate

trade costs. Trade in particular goods like wheat or coal is not our focus. Also, our trade costs

are country-pair speciÞc and it is easy to compute the change of these trade costs over time.

As shown in the technical appendix, trade cost measure (2) is also valid in the more general

case when countries run trade deÞcits or surpluses.

4.1       Data and Methods

In this section, we provide an overview of trends in trade costs from 1870 to 1913. To compute

trade costs, we make use of the expression given in (2). All that is needed is bilateral trade data,

and data on total exports and GDP. We have such annual data for 18 countries.5 This sample

accounts for over 60 percent of world GDP and trade in 1913. The GDP data was taken from

Maddison (1995) while the trade data was taken from the Tableau Général du Commerce de la

France avec ses Colonies et les Puissances Etrangères (various years), the Statistical Abstract of

the United Kingdom (various years) and the Statistical Abstract of the United States (various

States.

years). We consider all French, UK, and US destined or originated bilateral trade for which

there is also a full set of GDP data (15 countries plus France, the UK, and the US). Thus, the

full panel of trade costs is balanced and evenly weighted between French, UK, and US trade

with 2,112 unique dyadic observations in total. In the regressions below, Þfteen observations

are lost for countries with no railways (Japan before 1872 and New Zealand before 1873), but

this is not expected to impart any systematic bias.

       Two parameter assumptions are necessary to compute trade costs. We direct the reader

to Appendix B which demonstrates that the overall qualitative results are not too sensitive to

these assumptions. For the reported results, the fraction of tradable goods produced, s, was

set to 0.8 while the elasticity of substitution, ρ , was set to eleven.6

4.2      Results

The resulting trade cost series can be seen in Figures 3 and 4. Figure 3 presents the simple

average of trade cost levels for the three countries. Figure 4 presents the indexed value of these

trade costs over time (1870 = 100). A few important elements are clearly documented. First, as

seen in Figure 3, France and the United Kingdom enjoyed substantially lower trade costs than

the United States for the entire period, perhaps reßecting not only the maturity of their trading

relationships but also their greater proximity to many of the world’s leading markets. Second,

the initial level of trade costs seems to condition their subsequent evolution: the United States

experienced a much more dramatic decline in trade costs over time, 16 percent (7.7 percentage

points) versus France’s 13 percent decline and the UK’s 10 percent (5.5 and 3.7 percentage

points, respectively). Finally from Figure 4, it seems that most of the decline in trade costs,

especially for France and the United Kingdom, was concentrated between 1870 and 1880. This

was, of course, a time of simultaneously declining freight rates and tariﬀs as well as increasing

    When the elasticity of substitution is set equal to eleven, this corresponds to a ten percent markup over
marginal cost. Irwin (2003) shows rough evidence of a 9.8 percent markup in American steel and pig iron
products in the late nineteenth century. Typical estimates in the contemporary literature, based on recent data
comprising goods that are more diﬀerentiated and therefore less substitutable, are around seven or eight as noted
in Anderson and van Wincooop (2004). Evenett and Keller (2002) suggest that the share of output in recent
years that is tradable is in the range of 0.3 to 0.8. Stockman and Tesar (1995) argue that the share of tradable
output would be in the range of 0.65 and 0.82. Moreover, it is decreasing in the size of the service and public
sector which are typically nontradable. Both sectors were much less signiÞcant in terms of total output in our
period.

5     The Determinants of Trade Costs

Researchers have focused on transportation, communication costs, tariﬀs, national borders, and

currency unions as determinants of trade costs. Little consensus exists on the functional form

that best describes trade costs. As our baseline, and following the bulk of previous work so as

to provide comparable results, we consider a log-linear speciÞcation of iceberg trade costs of

the following form:



(3)                                 τ jkt = Distδjk eβ 0 +β 1 Xjkt +ηjkt

where β 1 is a vector of coeﬃcients, Distjk is the great-circle distance between two countries’

capitals, δ is the elasticity of iceberg trade costs with respect to distance, and η jkt is a composite

error term. This implies the following estimating equation:



(4)                   ln(τ jkt ) = β 0 + δ ln(Distjk ) + β 1 Xjkt + dt + υ jk + εjkt

where we allow for the composite error term to consist of a country-pair speciÞc component υjk

(i.e., a Þxed eﬀect or a random eﬀect) and a country-pair white noise error term εjkt . In all

speciÞcations, we include time Þxed eﬀects collected in the vector of year indicators dt . Apart

from the previously mentioned distance variable, we consider a parsimonious set of potential

trade cost determinants Xjkt : tariﬀs (deÞned as the log product of each partner’s ratio of tariﬀ

revenue to imports), bilateral exchange rate volatility (measured as the standard deviation of the

change in the logged nominal monthly exchange rate), gold standard adherence, membership

in the British Empire, and the penetration of railroads (deÞned as the log product of each

partner’s ratio of railroad mileage to land area). Table 1 provides the summary statistics of

our data, see the data appendix for the data sources. In Table 2 we report two separate

regression speciÞcations of equation (4). The Þrst column presents our preferred results from a

random eﬀects speciÞcation. The second column presents the results from a country-pair Þxed

                                                    12
eﬀects speciÞcation. Country-pair Þxed eﬀects control for unobservables or omitted factors

at the country-pair level and therefore cannot separately estimate the impact of distance and

membership in the British Empire. It can readily be seen that the inferences drawn from column

1 are highly robust to time-invariant heterogeneity at the country-pair level. We discuss the

results from column 1.

   Nations further apart — reassuringly — had higher trade costs. Taking 0.07 as the distance

elasticity from column 1, the standardized coeﬃcient for distance is measured as 0.40. That is,

a one standard deviation increase in the distance between countries would be associated with

nearly a one half standard deviation increase in trade costs.

   The sign of the log product of tariﬀs is consistent with reasonable priors, although we should

note that we lack country-pair speciÞc information on tariﬀ barriers — that is, these measures

capture the general level of protection aﬀorded in French and US markets, for example, but not

the protection aﬀorded against French goods in US markets and vice versa. The point estimate

suggests that a one percent rise in the log product of tariﬀs is associated with a two percent

rise in trade costs.

   Adherence to the gold standard also appears to be associated with lower trade costs. Adop-

tion of the gold standard is predicted to bring about a roughly 3.6 percent decline in trade costs.

As previous work has shown, credible exchange rate stability seems to go along with greater

trade. Interestingly, exchange rate volatility itself does not seem to have any association with

trade costs. A potential explanation lies in the fact that exchange rate volatility and the gold

standard are strongly correlated: adherence to the gold standard entails virtually zero exchange

rate volatility. This view is conÞrmed by regressions containing only exchange rate volatility;

in this case, it is positively signed and signiÞcant.

   When both countries are in the British Empire this is associated with 50 percent lower trade

costs. This high number does not, however, suggest absurdly low trade costs between the UK

and its colonies. It must be kept in mind that the British Empire was a far-ßung aﬀair, with

distances from London in our sample ranging from a “mere” 5,376 kilometers for Canada to over

18,000 for Australia and New Zealand. Despite this moderating eﬀect of distance, the privileges



                                                 13
of imperial membership are hard to deny, a result which is consistent with the emerging view

on empire and trade (Mitchener and Weidenmier, 2007).

    The period we are considering is widely regarded to be one of improved infrastructure and

declining shipping costs. In our regressions we Þnd some support for the view that domestic

transportation infrastructure matters for international trade costs. The standardized ‘beta’

coeﬃcient on railroad density is -0.14. In other words, a one standard deviation increase in

the total length of a dyad’s railway network (relative to land area) would have decreased trade

costs by about one-seventh of a standard deviation.

    To understand how each of the trade cost proxies used above aﬀects actual trade levels, one

would need further information on the elasticity of substitution. For instance, we Þnd that the

gold standard may have decreased trade costs by 3.6 percent. This Þnding is compatible with

the seemingly larger eﬀect of the gold standard on bilateral trade (roughly 30 percent or more

in the literature) because what matters is the interaction between the elasticity of substitution

and the estimated impact of the gold standard on trade costs (see equation (1)).

    Overall we Þnd that our trade cost measure relates sensibly to standard proxies for trade

costs. Naturally this should be the case since what we have undertaken is only one small, but

non-obvious, step beyond what standard gravity models of trade do when they use a vector

of trade cost proxies in regressions explaining bilateral trade. Our regressions show that an

overall decline of trade costs of 10 to 15 percent over the entire period can be reconciled with

the following interpretation: trade costs are a function of many variables and over time some

rose, some declined and others stayed roughly constant; rising tariﬀs partially oﬀset declining

freight rates; Þnally, other trade cost components related to factors that are more diﬃcult to

measure fell slightly but not massively. Being more precise about the particular factors that

mattered at the bilateral level merits further study.


6    Accounting for the Increases in Global Trade 1870-1913

Finally, we return to our key question: what accounts for the marked increase in global trade

ßows between 1870 and 1913? The existing literature on the pre-World War I and post-World



                                               14
War II waves of globalization oﬀers likely suspects. On the one hand, much of the historical

literature has emphasized reductions in trade costs, speciÞcally those arising from endogenous

changes in commercial policy and exogenous changes in transport technology (O’Rourke and

Williamson, 1999). On the other hand, much of the contemporary literature has emphasized

secular patterns in income growth and convergence (Baier and Bergstrand, 2001). What we aim

for in this section is to relate changes in bilateral trade ßows to changes in productive capacity

and changes in trade costs in an accounting sense. Our micro-founded gravity model provides

a straightforward way of doing this. To arrive at a “decomposition” of the factors aﬀecting the

growth of trade we perform the following exercise. Assuming that sj and sk are constant, we

take the natural logarithm and then the Þrst diﬀerence of gravity equation (1) to obtain



(5)

∆ ln(EXPj,kt EXPk,jt ) = ∆ ln ((GDPjt − EXPjt )(GDPkt − EXPkt ))+(2ρ − 2) ∆ ln (1 − τ j,kt ) .

Then divide everything by ∆ ln(EXPj,kt EXPk,jt ) to get

(6)
                 ∆ ln ((GDPjt − EXPjt )(GDPkt − EXPkt ))                ∆ ln (1 − τ j,kt )
 1 = 100% =                                              + (2ρ − 2)                        .
                          ∆ ln(EXPj,kt EXPk,jt )                    ∆ ln(EXPj,kt EXPk,jt )

      The Þrst term on the right-hand side accounts for increases in bilateral trade due to economic

growth. The second term accounts for increases in trade due to a decline in bilateral trade costs.

It is readily seen from (6) that the contribution of the decline in trade costs is invariant to the

value of the elasticity of substitution because the share going to the GDP terms is given by the

data. This is true even if the elasticity changes over time.

      In deriving (6) we have implicitly assumed that the parameters sj and sk , which indicate

the fraction of all goods that are tradable, remain constant over time. For the post-World

War II period this proves to be a realistic assumption as the increase in the range of tradable

goods has been oﬀset by the increase in nontradable services (Novy, 2007). If the output of

tradable goods in fact increased faster than the output of nontradable goods, this would make

the decline in trade costs less important in explaining the growth of trade but it would not

aﬀect the contribution of economic expansion. In that sense, the numbers that we report in

                                                 15
this section can be seen as an upper bound for the contribution of the decline in trade costs.

   In Table 3 we report the growth in trade for our balanced sample between 1870 and 1913 and

the respective contributions of economic expansion and the decline in trade costs in explaining

this trade boom. We carry out this exercise for various subsamples of our data set. The Þrst

row presents results for the full sample. Here we see that about 56 percent of the expansion

of trade can be accounted for by changes in trading partners’ productive capacity, whereas

declines in trade costs account for about 44 percent of the growth in trade. These results

suggest a slightly larger role for trade costs than the Þndings of Baier and Bergstrand (2001)

who argued that two-thirds of the growth in trade amongst OECD countries between 1958 and

1988 was explained by the growth of output. But our framework also allows such calculations

for speciÞc country pairs.

   For trade between the more economically advanced and proximate countries in Europe,

economic expansion contributes the lion share to the expansion of trade. The decline in trade

costs is much more important for the markets outside of Europe and America. Declines in trade

costs with partners in Asia and Oceania are responsible for 65 and 56 percent of the increase

in trade, respectively.

   This geographical diﬀerence is consistent with the idea that in core-periphery trade between

1870 and 1913 real freight rates fell more quickly. There was also an expansion of trading

networks through pro-active marketing strategies in new markets, new shipping lines were

established, and telegraph connections in the less industrialized world improved. These factors

together expanded trade with the less developed world despite the rapidly rising tariﬀs of many

trading partners documented in Williamson (2006). The results from the core are also consistent

with the fact that the majority of their communications infrastructure was in place well before

1880 and that the tariﬀ backlash in Europe increased trade costs.

   The decline in trade costs has the most explanatory power for the growth in US trade and

the least explanatory power for the growth in British trade (see Table 3). One reason for this

heterogeneity is that prior to our sample period the UK had already become well integrated into

the world economy and generally had managed to lower trade costs far below those of the US



                                              16
and France (see Figure 3). This was due to its early free trade stance, its colonial connections

and the proximity of economic activity to the sea.

    Thus, to some extent the US and France caught up with the UK in reaping the beneÞts

from lower trade costs as they penetrated markets that were once the domain of Britain. In

explaining this phenomenon, the economic history literature (see the industry speciÞc essays in

Aldcroft, 1968) has focused on productivity versus trade barriers broadly deÞned. Our results

appear consistent with the idea that the US and France increased their international market

shares more by lowering trade costs than by scoring productivity gains.

    Given that falling trade costs can only explain about 44 percent of the pre-World War I

trade boom, an overriding role for communication and transportation technologies in the Þrst

wave of globalization is muted. This is for two reasons. Increases in tariﬀs put downward

pressure on the fraction of the growth in trade attributable to falling trade costs. But secular

increases in income were also key in fuelling the growth of trade. Overall, we are suggesting a

view in which the primary mover of increased trade volumes is the secular increase in income

with ancillary contributions from policy and technology. Assumptions about the parameters do

not aﬀect this conclusion. Nevertheless, overall declines in trade costs are almost by deÞnition

the largest contributor to the increases in the ratio of trade to output over the period as per

the consensus in the literature. Our contribution is to Þnd a way of measuring how large these

changes could have been.

    We should emphasize again that we obtain these decomposition results by using a standard

framework of trade in diﬀerentiated goods with trade costs that is widely used and accepted in

the literature (see Anderson and van Wincoop, 2003 and 2004). In particular, a unit income

elasticity is standard in the theoretical gravity literature. Evenett and Keller (2002) derive

gravity models from several leading theories of international trade, all of which are characterized

by unit income elasticities.7 Thus, even if we allow for diﬀerences in the underlying modeling
   7
     Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) allow for non-unit income elasticities by assuming that the share φ of
income spent on tradables equals Y α , despite the fact that they themselves argue “there is no clear theoretical
foundation for specifying the fraction spent on tradables as Y α .” More alarmingly for proponents of the idea that
trade costs are the key driver of integration, Anderson and van Wincoop note that α is likely to be greater than
zero, implying an income elasticity greater than one. To the extent that their argument is valid, an imposed unit
income elasticity provides an upper bound for the impact of trade costs.



                                                        17
strategy, or the value of parameters underlying our trade cost calculations, the fact remains

that changes in income will always explain a majority of the growth in bilateral trade for this

period. As in all of the standard gravity literature, an implicit assumption in our paper is of

course that aggregate trade costs are exogenous to economic expansion and the growth of trade.

In our view, the theoretical exploration of endogenous trade costs is a fruitful avenue for future

research.


7    Conclusions

We have studied the evolution and determinants of trade costs between 1870 and 1913. The

theoretical foundation for these trade costs represents a new way of explaining international

trade integration that is much easier to implement empirically than existing general equilibrium

gravity models of international trade. We now relate ‘multilateral’ resistance terms to observ-

able variables. This provides a convenient way to compute, not estimate, implied bilateral

international trade costs.

    The patterns we have found suggest that overall trade costs did not decline dramatically

after 1870 since tariﬀs and non-tariﬀ barriers rose. In the face of a shipping cost plunge, and

the elimination of exchange rate uncertainty for many trading partners, trade costs seem to

have fallen by roughly ten to twenty percent. Slightly over 50 percent of the variation in

these trade costs appears to be explained by proximity, policies, infrastructure, and the British

Empire. Our measure can easily be extended to provide a quantitative grasp of qualitative

observations made by country specialists and historians. They can also obviously be used in

empirical research in international economics where a measure of trade costs is needed.

    Finally, economic expansion and the decline in trade costs appear to be almost equally

responsible for increasing international trade between 1870 and 1913. The trade boom of the

nineteenth century therefore does not seem to be all about policy nor all about shipping and

communications. Economic growth and productivity advances were also important drivers of

the Þrst wave of globalization.

A.1 Optimizing Consumers
Optimizing consumers and Þrms inhabit J countries with j = 1, 2,..., J and J ≥ 2. The range
of all consumers and of all goods produced in the world is the continuum [0, 1]. Country j
comprises the consumer range [nj−1 , nj ] and country-j monopolistic Þrms each produce one
diﬀerentiated good on the same range, where n0 = 0 and nJ = 1. It is assumed that the
exogenous fraction sj of goods is tradable so that [nj−1 , nj−1 + sj (nj − nj−1 )] is the range of all
tradable goods produced by country j (0 < sj ≤ 1). These can be purchased by all consumers
in the world. The remaining range [nj−1 + sj (nj − nj−1 ), nj ] represents country j’s nontradable
goods. The latter are available for purchase to country-j consumers only.
    Exogenous bilateral iceberg trade costs τ j,k are incurred when goods are shipped from
country j to country k where               ½
                                             ≥ 0 for j 6= k

                                             = 0 for j = k
with τ j,k < 1. It is assumed that bilateral trade costs are symmetric (τ j,k = τ k,j ). The
assumption of zero intranational trade costs is a normalization which can also be found in
Baier and Bergstrand (2001).
   All consumers within one country are identical. They like consumption and dislike work
such that their utility can be described as

η is assumed to be identical across countries. Cj is a CES Dixit-Stiglitz composite consumption

good and sets the proÞt-maximizing price. Not all Þrms within one country are symmetric
since in country j the fraction sj of Þrms produces tradable goods, whereas the fraction (1 − sj )
produces nontradable goods. Let yji   T denote the output produced by country-j tradable Þrm
        NT the output produced by country-j nontradable Þrm i. In addition, let y T
i and yji                                                                             ji,k be the
tradable output of Þrm i produced for country k so that
                                                      J
                                                      X
                                               T         T
(14)                                          yji ≡     yji,k
                                                      k=1

   All Þrms face a linear production function that has constant returns to scale and that
operates with labor as the only input
                                             T
(15)                                        yji,k = Aj LTji,k
                                             NT
(16)                                        yji     = Aj LNT
                                                          ji

where Aj is an exogenous and country-speciÞc technology level that is assumed to be the same
across the tradable and nontradable sectors. LTji,k and LNT
                                                         ji denote the amount of labor used
             T        NT
to produce yji,k and yji with

                                                      J
                                                      X
(17)                                         LTji   ≡   LTji,k
                                                      k=1

Note that since all consumers within one country are identical, they each spread their labor over
all domestic Þrms according to how much labor input each Þrm needs. Since labor is assumed to

                                                      20
be internationally immobile, domestic consumers do not work for foreign Þrms. As in Obstfeld
and Rogoﬀ (1995), production does not exhibit increasing returns to scale. Since the number
of Þrms in country j is given by the range [nj−1 , nj ], their proÞts are determined endogenously.
This framework is therefore consistent with the approach taken by, for instance, Anderson
(1979) and Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) who assume that each region is specialized in
the production of only one good.
    Using demand function (12) market clearing for the tradable good produced by country-j
Þrm i requires
                                              Ã 1       T
                                                           !−ρ
                                               1−τ     pji
                                       T           j,k
(18)                     (1 − τ j,k ) yji,k =                  (nk − nk−1 )Ck
                                                  Pk

The right-hand side of (18) represents the amount of the tradable good i that the (nk − nk−1 )
consumers in country k demand. The left-hand side is the amount of the same good that
arrives in country k after being shipped there from country j. Accordingly, market clearing for
a country-j nontradable good requires
                                       Ã     !−ρ
                                  NT
                                         pNT
                                          ji
(19)                            yji =             (nj − nj−1 )Cj
                                          Pj

   The proÞt function for tradable Þrm i in country j is
                                          J
                                          X ¡ T T                  ¢
(20)                             πTji =      pji yji,k − Wj LTji,k
                                          k=1

where Wj is the nominal wage that is the same across tradable and nontradable Þrms because
workers are assumed to be mobile within countries. Plugging the production function (15)
and the market-clearing condition (18) into (20) and maximizing with respect to pTji yields the
standard markup
                                                      ρ Wj
(21)                                       pTji =
                                                    ρ − 1 Aj
For nontradable Þrms the same procedure leads to
                                                      ρ Wj
(22)                                      pNT
                                           ji =
                                                    ρ − 1 Aj
so that
(23)                                       pTji = pNT
                                                   ji ≡ pj

Thus, all country-j Þrms set the same price pj , irrespective of whether they produce tradable
or nontradable goods.

A.3 Equilibrium of the Model
Since within one country all Þrms producing tradable goods are symmetric and all Þrms pro-
ducing nontradable goods are also symmetric, the index i will be dropped in the following.
Each country-j consumer maximizes utility (7) subject to budget constraint (13), leading to
the optimal labor supply condition
                                              η      Wj
(24)                                              =
                                           1 − Lj   Pj Cj

                                                    21
In order to solve the model it is useful to deÞne per-capita output, per-capita labor supply and
per-capita proÞts as
(25)                                 yj ≡ sj yjT + (1 − sj )yjNT
(26)                                Lj ≡ sj LTj + (1 − sj )LNT
                                                            j
                                     π j ≡ sj πTj + (1 − sj )πNT
                                                              j

where yjT is the same as yji
                          T in (14), LT is the same LT as in (17) and π T is the same as π T in
                                      j               ji                j                  ji
(20). The remaining right-hand side variables are the corresponding variables for nontradable
Þrm i. Using the production functions (15) and (16) as well as the price markups (21)-(23) it
follows
                                       πj = pj yj − Wj Lj
Combined with budget constraint (13) and the optimal labor supply condition (24) this yields
the optimal per-capita labor supply
                                                     ρ−1
(27)                                       Lj =
                                                  ρ − 1 + ρη
   Express nominal wages across countries as
                             α1 W1 = α2 W2 = ... = αj Wj = ... = αJ WJ
where the α’s are auxiliary parameters yet unknown. It follows from the price markups (21)-(23)
that
                                                ρ Wk       ρ αj Wj

                                              ρ − 1 Ak   ρ − 1 αk Ak
Use (28) in price index (9) to derive
                                                   1
                                                        ρ
                                         Pj = ω j1−ρ       Wj
                                                       ρ−1
where
                  Ã J                                       !
                   X                                 αk ρ−1
(29)         ωj ≡     sk (nk − nk−1 )(Ak (1 − τ k,j ) )       + (1 − sj ) (nj − nj−1 )Aρ−1
                                                                                       j
                                                     αj
                    k=1

An expression for the real wage follows directly as
                                                       1
                                          Wj   ρ − 1 ρ−1
(30)                                         =      ωj
                                          Pj     ρ
Using budget constraint (13) and the optimal labor supply condition (24), expressions for
consumption and real proÞts follow as
                                                             1

as well as

    To solve for the α’s in (29), start oﬀ with (25) and plug in the market-clearing conditions
(18) and (19). Then replace the price variables and consumption using (21)-(23), (28), (30) and
(33) to yield

                   + (1 − sj ) (nj − nj−1 )Aj

At the same time, from the production functions (15) and (16), deÞnitions (25) and (26) and
expression (31) it follows
                                                     −1
                                         yj

                                         Aj
It must therefore be the case that the curly brackets in (34) are equal to ωj as deÞned in (29).
Setting the curly brackets equal to ω j and using (29) yields
                                    Ã            µ                     ¶ρ−1 ! 2ρ−1

Finally, plug (35) back into (29) to obtain
                                                     Ã                            ρ−1 

                   + (1 − sj ) (nj − nj−1 )Aρ−1
                                            j

The system of polynomial equations represented by (36) for j = 1, 2,..., J cannot be solved
analytically. However, it can be established numerically by repeated substitution that a unique
solution exists for the ω’s for all combinations of admissible parameter values. The admissible
parameter values are 0 < nk − nk−1 < 1, 0 < sk ≤ 1, ρ > 1, Ak > 0 and 0 ≤ τ k,j < 1 for all j, k.
The implicit function theorem can be applied to compute the partial eﬀects of changes in these
exogenous parameters on the ω’s. The ω’s give rise to sensible general equilibrium eﬀects for the
real wage, consumption and real proÞts in (30)-(32). For example, a technology improvement in
Aj increases ω j and therefore the real wage, consumption and real proÞts for country-j citizens
but, to a smaller extent, it also increases the other ω’s and is thus also beneÞcial to foreign
citizens.

A.4 A Gravity Equation with Trade Costs
Given the equilibrium solution to the model, one can now derive the equilibrium trade ßows
between countries j and k. Since all country-j Þrms producing tradable goods are symmetric
and since sj (nj − nj−1 ) is the overall number of these Þrms, all goods that leave country j for
destination country k are given by
                                                             T
(37)                                EXPj,k = sj (nj − nj−1 )yj,k

where EXPj,k denotes real exports from j to k. Likewise, all goods that leave country k for
export to country j are given by

As we are ultimately interested in bilateral trade costs and as these bilateral trade costs inßuence
trade ßows in both directions, we need to combine (37) and (38) in order to take all available
information on trade ßows into account. A useful way of combining unidirectional trade ßows
is to multiply them by each other. This yields
                                                      T                   T

   In order to derive gravity equation (1) plug the market-clearing condition (18) into the right-
hand side of (37) and use the country-j versions of (28) and (35) and the country-k versions of
(30) and (31). Also use production function (15) and rearrange to yield

Plug the left-hand side of (40) into the right-hand side of (36), noting that Lj = Lk from (27)
and using (17) and (26). Also note that LTj,j = LNT j    as pTj = pN
                                                                   j

Plug the country-j and country-k versions of (41) back into the right-hand side of expression
(37), where the right-hand side uses (18), (28), (30)-(31) and (35), and then rearrange to obtain
                                         (ρ−1)2                    ρ(ρ−1)         ρ−1             ρ

Finally, note that P OPj = (nj − nj−1 ) and P OPk = (nk −nk−1 ), where P OPj is the population
of country j. Also note from (25) that GDPj = (nj − nj−1 )yj and

                   (nj − nj−1 )yj = sj (nj − nj−1 )yjT + (1 − sj )(nj − nj−1 )yjNT

and by deÞnition (14)
                                                                                                      X

Using yjNT = yj,j
              N T = y T as pNT = pT it follows

The same applies to GDPk −EXPk . Now plug P OPj , P OPk , GDPj −EXPj and GDPk −EXPk
into (42) to obtain
                                           (ρ−1)2                      ρ(ρ−1)          ρ−1            ρ

As in (39), multiply (43) and (44) by each other and impose symmetry τ j,k = τ k,j to obtain
(1).

A.5 Allowing for Trade Imbalances
Most countries run trade deÞcits or surpluses. These trade imbalances often persist for some
time until rebalancing is required. For example, Australia and Canada ran persistent current
account deÞcits during our period of study. Novy (2007) incorporates trade imbalances into
the model. The derivation is reproduced below. The conclusion is that trade imbalances wash
out when the focus lies on symmetric trade costs such that trade cost measure (2) remains
unaﬀected.
   The model is therefore generalized to allow for trade imbalances. The per-capita budget
constraint (13) is generalized to
                                              J
                                              X
(45)                              Pj Cj +       Tj,l = Wj Lj + πj
                                              l=1

where Tj,l are nominal per-capita transfers from country j to l. As an accounting identity it
follows
                             (nj − nj−1 )Tj,l = −(nl − nl−1 )Tl,j
For analytical convenience it is now assumed that per-capita transfers are a fraction of per-
capita consumption spending
                                       Tj,l = µj,l Pj Cj
with µj,j = 0 for all j such that budget constraint (45) can be rewritten as
                                Ã     J
                                             !
                                     X
(46)                              1+     µj,l Pj Cj = Wj Lj + πj
                                      l=1
     PJ
If   l=1 µj,l > 0, then j is a creditor country and runs a net trade surplus.
    The generalized model can now be solved as outlined above. The key equations are given
in the following. The optimal labor supply condition (24) becomes
                                    η          Wj
(47)                                    =µ        ¶
                                 1 − Lj      P
                                             J
                                          1 + µj,l Pj Cj
                                                             l=1

The markups (21)-(23), per-capita output (27), the real wage (30) and real proÞts (32) are not
aﬀected. But if j runs a surplus, this reduces per-capita consumption Cj
                                                        Ã   J
                                                                         !−1
                                                1
                                               ρ−1
                                                            X
(48)                             Cj = Lj ω j             1+   µj,l
                                                                   l=1

Intuitively, due to logarithmic utility in (7), output Lj is constant. But if country j transfers
some of its output to other countries, then its domestic consumption must fall.

                                                        25
   Now use the notation
                                           J
                                           X               CAj
                                             µj,l =

where CAj denotes the nominal current account of country j and CONSj denotes its nominal
consumption expenditure.

In the case of a balanced current account (CAj = CAk = 0) equations (49) and (50) simplify
to (43) and (44). If j becomes a surplus country (CAj > 0), this implies an increase in trade
ßows EXPj,k from j to k and a decrease in trade ßows EXPk,j . Multiply (49) and (50) by
each other and impose symmetry τ j,k = τ k,j to obtain (1), which in turn implies (2). Trade
cost measure (2) therefore also holds in the more general case when countries run trade deÞcits
or surpluses.

                          Appendix B
    The Sensitivity of Trade Costs to Parameter Assumptions
    This appendix shows that our results are not highly sensitive to the assumed elasticity of
substitution and the tradable share. As mentioned, the relative ordering of trade costs is stable
with respect to perturbations in both the elasticities of substitution and the tradable shares.
Our reported regression results, which estimate the elasticity of trade costs with respect to
a change in the observable trade cost proxies, are strongly robust to reasonable shifts in the
parameters.
    The following two Þgures plot the evolution of the log change of trade costs for plausible
ranges of the elasticity of substitution and tradable shares for the United States and the United
Kingdom between 1870 and 1913.
    We assume that the elasticity of substitution is 11. But suppose in fact it is an unrealistically
distant 5. For this particular series, the change between 1870 and 1913 is oﬀ by about one-
third. In this case, our headline Þnding of a 15 percent fall in US trade costs would, in such
a circumstance, have to be revised to yield a 20 percent fall. Such a revision would not alter
our qualitative Þndings. The change in trade costs is negatively related to the elasticity of
substitution.
    There is, however, a large diﬀerence in the levels. The levels are doubled when moving
from 11 down to 5. If the elasticity of substitution is far from its assumed value, it would not
be prudent to take the exact levels of trade costs at face value. Also we do not explore what
happens when the elasticity moves over time. But as Broda and Weinstein (2006) suggest for
the post-1970 period, this parameter is quite stable.
    For unrealistically large perturbations in the tradable share of goods, s, the levels of trade
costs are fairly stable. The Þgure below shows only slight variation in levels when s moves
from 0.6 to 0.8. There is no change in the Þrst diﬀerences of trade costs for diﬀerent values of
tradable shares as this parameter enters multiplicatively.
    What happens if the tradable share changes over time? If the change is small, then not
much is the answer. However, the assumption of a constant s would tend to overstate any
decline in trade costs in the case of a sizeable (but implausibly large) increase from 0.6 to 0.8.
Conversely, any trade cost declines are understated when s actually falls.
    So what is the most plausible path of the fraction of all goods produced that are tradable,
s, in the nineteenth century case? It seems likely that s stayed fairly constant. Tradability is
not the same as whether a good is highly traded. It is also not simply the fraction of measured
GDP devoted to trade. A nontradable good is inherently impossible to trade at any level
of trade costs. A ‘non-traded’ good refers to the fact that little or no trade in a particular
good will occur when trade costs are prohibitively high. If we see trade in a particular class
of goods increasing over time in the nineteenth century, we believe that the vast majority is
attributable to changes in trade costs rather than to a large increase in the fraction of goods
that can be traded. For example, New Zealand did in fact export some dressed meat to Great
Britain prior to refrigeration. However, this trade increased exponentially in the face of large
reductions in their trade costs. Also, while there must have been some increase in the number
of varieties produced that could be traded, it is equally the case that the period saw the advent
of new economic activity that was inherently nontradable. Government provision of services
and the service sector became increasingly more important in most of these economies. If s fell
somewhat, we may be understating the fall in trade costs but probably by not more than ten
percent, as the second Þgure in this appendix illustrates.
    Finally, consider the non-linearities involved. These create large increases in trade relative
to GDP with seemingly small changes in trade costs. Take US-UK trade in 1900. A doubling
of total trade between the two nations relative to the product of their GDP (minus exports)
would have implied a decrease in trade costs by eight percent, all else being equal. Again, this
percentage is not very sensitive to the elasticity of substitution. To cut iceberg trade costs
from the actual 0.30 in 1900 to 0.10, holding everything else constant, would have required
both countries’ export to GDP ratios to rise from roughly two percent to 25 percent. Such
calculations also highlight that a doubling of the export to GDP ratio (a standard measure of
integration) is compatible with much less than a halving of trade costs.

    Bilateral trade: Taken from the Statistical Abstract of the United Kingdom (various
years), Statistical Abstract of the United States (various years), and Tableau Général du Com-
merce de la France avec ses Colonies et les Puissances Etrangères (various years). Trade was
converted into real 1990 US dollars using the US CPI deßator in Oﬃcer and Williamson (2007).
    GDP: Taken from Maddison (1995).
    Population: Taken from Mitchell (2003a, 2003b, 2003c).
    Tariﬀs: Measured as total customs revenue divided by imports taken from Mitchell (2003a,
2003b, 2003c). Many observations come from data kindly provided to us by Michael Clemens
and Jeﬀrey Williamson and are based on Clemens and Williamson (2004). Belgium is from
Degrève (1982). Switzerland is from Ritzmann-Blickenstorfer (1996).
    Gold standard adherence: Based on data underlying Meissner (2005) and equals one
when both countries adhere to the gold standard.
    Exchange rate volatility: DeÞned as the standard deviation of the monthly diﬀerence of
logged nominal exchange rates in a given year. Taken from the Global Financial Database.
    Distance: Measured as kilometers between capital cities. Taken from indo.com
    Railroads and land area: Taken from Mitchell (2003a, 2003b, 2003c).
    British Empire: Based on authors’ recollection and equals one if both countries were
members of the British Empire.
