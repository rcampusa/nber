         This paper develops new econometric methods to infer hospital quality in a model with discrete
dependent variables and non-random selection. Mortality rates in patient discharge records are widely
used to infer hospital quality. However, hospital admission is not random and some hospitals may attract
patients with greater unobserved severity of illness than others. In this situation the assumption of random
admission leads to spurious inference about hospital quality. This study controls for hospital selection
using a model in which distance between the patient's residence and alternative hospitals are key
exogenous variables. Bayesian inference in this model is feasible using a Markov chain Monte Carlo
posterior simulator, and attaches posterior probabilities to quality comparisons between individual
hospitals and groups of hospitals. The study uses data on 74,848 Medicare patients admitted to 114
hospitals in Los Angeles County from 1989 through 1992 with a diagnosis of pneumonia. It finds the
smallest and largest hospitals to be of high quality and public hospitals to be of low quality. There is
strong evidence of dependence between the unobserved severity of illness and the assignment of patients
to hospitals. Consequently a conventional probit model leads to inferences about quality markedly
different than those in this study's selection model.

1. Introduction


         This paper develops new econometric methods to estimate hospital quality and other
models with discrete dependent variables and non-random selection. Assessing the quality of
care in hospitals is an important problem for public policy and a challenge for applied
econometrics.1 Policy changes in Medicare reimbursement rates and the rise of managed care as
well as technological innovations have affected hospital incentives, and through that, hospital
quality.2 These quality changes have large welfare effects and hence the potential for large
deadweight losses.3
         Hospital patient discharge databases provide several indicators plausibly associated with
hospital quality. Since they cover large numbers of patients and hospitals and are much less
expensive to obtain and access than other sources of information, they have been widely used in
comparisons of hospital quality. Mortality has been the most popular indicator of hospital quality
in the literature: it is unambiguously defined and its link with quality of care is so strong as to be
tautological.4
         In this widely used framework, the conceptual experiment that reveals hospital quality is
hospital-specific mortality rates following random assignment of a population of patients to
hospitals. Patients, however, are not randomly assigned to hospitals. Patients or their physicians
are likely to choose hospitals based on factors such as location, convenience and their severity of
illness. If assignment were nonrandom, but random conditional on observed characteristics, then
conventional dichotomous outcome models could be used to infer the outcome of the conceptual
experiment from the available data. However, discharge data contain only crude summaries of
medically pertinent information and hence many aspects of the severity of illness are
unobserved. Thus, the assumption of random conditional assignment is not tenable and patients
with the same observed characteristics are not equally likely to be admitted to all hospitals. For

populations increase the likelihood of desired health outcomes and are consistent with current professional

medical outcomes of Medicare policy, the impact of managed care and the impacts of technological change,
respectively.

  For instance, if changes in Medicare policies cause hospitals to reduced their pneumonia mortality rates by one
percentage point, this would translate to over 6,000 lives saved annually in the U.S.
4
  Strictly speaking mortality is an indicator of hospital mediocrity; mortality is an inverse indicator of quality.
Subsequently we provide a precise definition of hospital quality in the context of the model developed in this study.

instance, if patients with high unobserved severity of illness select high quality hospitals, then
observed mortality rates for high quality hospitals will be inconsistent and upwardly biased
measures of mortality from the conceptual experiment. This will be true even after controlling
for observed measures of severity of illness. Conventional statistical methods that ignore
unobserved severity will produce misleading inferences about hospital quality. This has led
prominent medical experts to make a pessimistic assessment of the usefulness of discharge data
in assessing hospital quality.5
         Recent work by Gowrisankaran and Town (1999) developed a framework to control for
the non-random assignment of patients. This work modeled mortality as a function of indicator
variables for each hospital and patient discharge information. The authors treat mortality as
continuous and directly apply linear instrumental variables methods. The identifying assumption
is that a patient’s mortality is not affected by how far that patient’s residence is from alternative
hospitals. Combined with the demonstrable fact that patients are more likely to choose hospitals
that are closer to home, other things equal, the conventional conditions for consistency of
instrumental variables estimation in a linear model are satisfied. Conceptually, the estimator
would predict hospital A to be of higher quality than hospital B if patients residing near hospital
A have lower mortality than patients residing near hospital B, after controlling for their medical
and demographic characteristics.
         The difficulty with this approach is that because the outcome variable, mortality, is
dichotomous, any internally consistent model of hospital quality and choice must be nonlinear.
This paper develops a logically coherent model designed to infer the outcome of the conceptual
experiment that randomly assigns patients to hospitals, given data that has non-random patient
assignment.6 Inference with this model is challenging because the amount of information per
observation is small.7 This paper develops an approach to inference in this model that is practical
with the large data sets required to extract signal from noise in hospital patient discharge
databases. This approach is potentially applicable to a wide range of policy evaluations of



5
  Leading medical researchers, including Iezzoni et al. (1996), and government studies (US GAO (1994)) have both
argued that discharge databases are problematic, for this reason.
6
  Though the methods of Gowrisankaran and Town (1999) are much simpler than the ones developed in this paper,
there is no formal statistical model that rationalizes their approach.
7
  Simple measures of fit always indicate that most variation in mortality cannot be ascribed to covariates. Even if all
the difference in mortality rates were attributable to quality, the variation in these rates is small.

economic interest where the outcome variable is dichotomous.8
         The model developed here incorporates hospital choice and mortality as endogenous
variables and fixed hospital and patient characteristics as exogenous variables. Hospital choice is
described by a multinomial probit model and mortality by a binary probit model. The mortality
model includes indicator variables for each hospital to accommodate hospital specific differences
in quality as well as demographic variables and observed disease characteristics. The mortality
model is structural in the sense that it predicts outcomes given alternative assignments of patients
to hospitals including random assignment. The multinomial probit model is a reduced form
relationship that provides probabilities of hospital choice conditional on observed covariates that
are a function of demographic characteristics and distance of the hospital from the patient’s
home. The random component in the binary probit model includes unobserved severity of illness
and is permitted to be correlated with the random component in the multinomial choice model.
If, after controlling for the observed covariates in the hospital choice model, patients with high
unobserved severity of illness are more likely to be admitted to hospital A than patients with low
unobserved severity, this will imply a positive correlation between the shock in the mortality
equation and the shock in the hospital A choice equation.
         We estimate this selection model using Bayesian inference from data on 74,848 Medicare
patients admitted to 114 hospital in Los Angeles County during 1989 to 1992 with a diagnosis of
pneumonia. By transforming the integration problem posed by the latent variables into a
simulation problem, our approach to inference computes estimates orders of magnitude faster
than the method of maximum likelihood. This makes inference feasible for this type of
simultaneous equations model.9 The basis for the simulation procedure is the fact that the model
is similar to the conventional linear simultaneous equation model conditional on latent variables.
Using Markov-chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques, we iteratively simulate latent variable
values conditional on data and parameters, and parameters conditional on data and latent
variables. The second step is computationally similar to classical instrumental variables,

8
  Examples include the effect of school performance based on graduation rates, of prison rehabilitation programs
based on recidivism rates, of job training programs based on the incidence of harassment complaints, and many
medical outcome evaluations.
9
  Maximum likelihood evaluation for one parameter vector for one individual would require evaluating the joint
density of the mortality and hospital choice outcome for that individual. Given that we have 114 endogenous
variables and that the mortality error and hospital choice error are correlated, this would take several minutes on a
fast supercomputer. Multiplied by a data set of roughly 75,000 patients (necessary because of the small signal to
noise ratio), it would take months to evaluate the likelihood for a single parameter vector.


                                                           3
differing principally in the appearance of the discrete hospital choice in the mortality probit
equation, which does not pose a problem The simulation methods simultaneously recover the
joint posterior distribution of parameters and latent variables.10 Albert and Chib (1993) used this
approach in the binary probit model and Geweke, Keane and Runkle (1997) extended them to the
multinomial probit model. The methods developed here extend this approach to a new class of
models.
        We use these methods to address the motivating policy questions directly. First, to what
extent is hospital quality associated with observed characteristics of hospitals, such as size and
ownership status? Second, with what degree of confidence can it be said that one hospital is of
higher quality than another? We model hospital quality using hierarchical priors. This approach,
which combines some characteristics of classical fixed- and random-effects models, specifies the
quality of each hospital as a separate parameter, but assigns a more important role to the data in
determining whether these parameters are similar for hospitals with similar observable
characteristics, relative to a normal prior. Our approach provides an efficient method for
extracting the signal from the noise, which is particularly important given this type of data.
        The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the specification
of the model and methods for inference, with some details relegated to an appendix. The
database is described in Section 3. Section 4 presents findings on hospital quality and the role of
nonrandom admission to hospitals. Section 5 concludes. Five appendices are available in the
working paper version of this paper.11 Appendix A1 details the construction of the prior,
Appendix A2 details the likelihood function and computation, Appendix A3 gives evidence on
the numerical accuracy of our Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)) algorithm, Appendix A4
provides posterior rankings for the hospitals in our data set, and Appendix A5 provides
robustness results with alternative priors.


2. The Model


        The central component of the model is a structural probit equation, in which the
probability of mortality is a function of the hospital to which a patient is admitted, the observed

10
  Surveys that discuss convergence to the posterior include Chib and Greenberg (1996), Geweke (1997) and
Geweke (1999).

severity of the patient’s illness, and the observed demographic characteristics of the patient. The
objective is to learn about the way the hospital to which the patient is admitted influences the
probability of mortality in this equation. A multinomial probit model of hospital admission
supplements the mortality model, to permit non-random assignment of patients to hospitals. This
section describes, in turn, the specification of the model, the prior distribution of the model
parameters, and methods to recover the posterior distribution of these parameters.


2.1 Model specification
          Let i 1,! , n index the patients in the sample, and let j 1,! , J index hospitals in the

sample. There are two groups of exogenous variables in the model. The k u 1 vector xi consists
of individual characteristics of patient i that may affect mortality, including indicators for age,
race, sex, and disease stage, and measures of income. The q u 1 vector zij , which consists of

characteristics specific to the combination of individual i and hospital j, includes distance
between the home of patient i and hospital j and interactions of distance with observable patient
characteristics. The specifics of these variables are given in Section 3.
          There are two sets of endogenous variables in the model. The mortality indicator mi is 1
if the patient dies in the hospital within ten days of admission and is 0 otherwise. The J u 1
indicator vector ci has j’th entry 1 if patient i is admitted to hospital j, and 0 otherwise.

          To present the structural mortality equation, let H i i 1,! , n be independent N 0, V 2

random variable,
(1)        mi*   cicE  xicJ  H i .

          The mortality indicator mi         1 if mi* ! 0 and mi          0 if mi* d 0 . The structural

interpretation of (1) is that if patient i were randomly assigned to hospital j, then

mi*      E j  xicJ  H i and consequently P mi   1       ) E j  xicJ   V . Note that the parameters E

and V are jointly unidentified in (1) because they can be scaled by the same arbitrary positive

constant without changing the behavior of mi . In the conventional probit model this problem is
avoided by setting V                 1 . We return to this matter in the context of the complete model below.
           If ci were in fact independent of H i – as it would be if patients were randomly assigned

to hospitals, for example – then ci would be exogenous in (1). After resolution of the above
identification issue this model would conform with the conventional textbook specification of the
binary probit model. However, it is likely that in observed data, ci depends in part on H i : the

admission of patient i to hospital j takes into account information that is correlated with H i . The
conventional probit model is then misspecified.
           To develop a more plausible model of hospital choice, we assume that patients become
infected with one of the many bacterial or viral agents that can cause pneumonia and it has been
determined that they are sufficiently ill to benefit from inpatient treatment. At that point the
patient (or the patient’s agent) selects from the set of J hospitals the hospital to which the patient
will be admitted. The actual choice decision will be a complex function of many factors, such as
severity of illness, characteristics of the hospital, the patient’s primary care physician, etc. One
important observable influence on choice is distance: previous research has shown that the
farther a patient is from a hospital, the less likely is the patient to be admitted to that hospital,
other observables constant.12
           To present the reduced form model of hospital choice define the J u q matrix Zi ,
                              c
Zi     > zi1 , zi 2 ,! , ziJ @ .   Let the J u 1 vectors Ki ~ N 0, 6      i 1,! , n be mutually independent

conditional on the exogenous variables, and let U j , j 1,! , J denote the correlation between H i

                                                                                                                              c
and Kij . Define the J u 1 hospital choice latent vector multinomial probit ci*                          ci*1 ,! , ciJ*       as

cij     0 otherwise. As above with (1), the parameters D and 6 are jointly unidentified since

scaling D by any positive constant and 6 by the square of that constant leaves the distribution of

                                                               6
ci conditional on Z i unaffected. We return to this matter in the context of the prior distribution
in Section 2.2.
          As is customary in models with J choices, it is easier to work with J  1 latent utilities,
and normalize the Jth utility to 0. Accordingly, we define the                                                 J 1 u q        matrix

(3)       ci*     ZiD  Ki .
          If the unobserved severity of illness affects hospital choice, the mortality and choice error
terms will be correlated. Let U j denote the correlation between H i and Kij j 1,! , J  1 . The

larger is U j , the more likely is a patient with a high unobserved severity of illness ( H i ) to be

admitted to hospital j. Thus we shall refer to U j as the hospital j severity correlation. The

hospital severity correlations are a useful way to characterize severity of illness by hospital since
they are independent of the scale of H i which we know from (1) is unidentified.
          Now, we can write the variance of the joint error terms as:
                               ªV 2 S cº
(4)       var H i , Kic        «       »
                               ¬S 6¼
where S is a J  1 u1 vector with S j                             U jV61jj2 .

          To permit unobserved severity of illness to affect hospital choice in any way consistent
with the model, the only restriction we place on S is that var H i ,Kic be positive definite. Since

this implies complicated restrictions on S , a more graceful treatment is to work with the
population regression of the shock H i in (1) on the shock vector Ki in (3),

(5)       H i KicG  ] i ; cov Ki , ] i                0.

In this regression G is a                   J  1 u1 parameter vector and the scale of H i is normalized by

var ] i         1 . This specification simultaneously resolves the identification problem due to the

scaling in (1) and incorporates all permissible values of S                         6G in (4).




                                                                          7

number of patients admitted to hospital j; define UG and qG* analogously.


2.2 Prior distributions
         The number of free parameters in 6 is J J  1 2  1 , that is, 6,441 in our sample with

J=114 hospitals. We make one major simplification, that 6                                I J , so that after differencing,

6     I J 1  eJ 1ecJ 1 , where en denotes an n u 1 vector of units. We introduce some evidence on the
plausibility of this assumption in Section 4.4. Estimating these parameters would increase the
computation time by orders of magnitude and also complicate our MCMC simulation
algorithm.13
         We choose independent prior distributions for the parameter vectors, D, G, Jand E so as
to include all reasonable parameter values well within their support. We discuss specific aspects
of these priors here.14
         First, we utilize a variance component structure and a hierarchical prior to specify that
hospital qualities are similar ex ante while allowing the data to determine the degree of similarity
ex post. Each hospital, i, is in one of four ownership categories, j, and one of for size categories,


13
  Keane (1992) shows that 6 is the source of irregularity in the multinomial probit likelihood function.

  Appendix A1 of the Working Paper version of this paper (Geweke, Gowrisankaran and Town (2001)) contains
detailed descriptions of all the priors.


                                                                   8
k, detailed in Section 3.2. If hospital i is of ownership category j and size category k, then
decompose            Ei       E1  p j  s k  ui .   The     prior      distributions        of     the      components

E1 , p1 ,! , p4 , s1 ," , s4       and u1 ,! , u114    are jointly Gaussian, mean zero, and mutually
independent. The common term E1 has standard deviation 3 (essentially a flat prior). The other

components have variances W p2 , W s2 and W u2 , respectively, grouped together in the vector

Wc       W 2p , W s2 , W u2 . Given W , the prior specifies that hospital quality is more strongly correlated

between hospitals that share the same size or ownership specification. However, we employ a
hierarchical prior distribution with the variance terms having independent prior distributions
1.25 W 2j ~ F 2 5         j     p, s, u in the standard probit model.15

           Second, since Kij            Kij  KiJ , an iid prior on G implies a prior on U that is not

exchangeable with respect to the Jth hospital, which is undesirable since the numbering of
hospitals is arbitrary. We use the prior G ~ N 0, V G26 1                    with V G      0.196 , which implies an

exchangeable and diffuse prior for U .16
           Third, the priors for the selection model need to be carefully scaled relative to the
conventional probit model to account for the different values of V across the models. From (5),
V2       G c6G  1 in the selection model, but V             1 in the probit model. Since G ~ N 0, V G26 1 it

follows that G c6G  1 ~ V G2 F 2 J  1  1 and E G c6G  1                 V G2 J  1  1 . Thus, in the hierarchical

hospital quality prior in the selection model, 1.25 ª¬V G2 J  1  1º¼ W 2j ~ F 2 5 . Similarly, we
                                                                                                            12
scale the selection model prior standard deviations for E1 and J by ª¬V G2 J  1  1º¼                           relative to

the probit model.
           The choice of the prior distributions of D and J is relatively straightforward. As with E
and G the governing principle is that reasonable values be well within the support of the prior
distribution, and care must be taken to maintain the same scale in the probit and selection
models. With respect to the last consideration note in particular that the impact of covariates in

15
     The centered 99% prior credible interval for each   W 2j is (.22, 1.7). Robustness of our results with respect to
variation in these and other priors is summarized in Section 4.4 and detailed in Appendix A5.




                                                              9
the selection model, corresponding to J in the probit model is J G c6G  1 1 2 in the selection
model by means of the same reasoning leading to (7).


2.3 Inference
        The observed data are           xi , Z i , ci , mi , i 1,! , n , which can be abbreviated as y. The

model contains latent variables mi* , ci* , i 1,! , n , which can be abbreviated y* . The parameter

vectors are D , E , J and G , which can be collected in the vector T . The model specified in

Section 2.1 provides p y, y* T and the prior distributions in Section 2.2 provide p T . Explicit

expressions for these densities are given in Appendix A2. From Bayes rule, the distribution of
the unobservables y* and T conditional on the data and model specification is

(8)      p y * ,T y     p T p y, y * T       p y v p T p y, y* T .

        The objective is to obtain the posterior distribution of functions such as the hospital
quality probits q j , and ) q j  xicJ , the probability of mortality under random hospital

admission of a patient with observed characteristics xi to hospital j. This objective requires
integrating a highly nonlinear function over millions of dimensions, most of which correspond to
latent variables. This cannot be accomplished analytically.
        The parameter vector and latent variables can be partitioned into groups, such that the
posterior distribution of any one group conditional on all the others is of a single, easily
recognized form that is easy to simulate. Details of the partition are given in Appendix A2. The
problem is then well suited to attack by execution of a Gibbs sampling algorithm (Gelfand and
Smith, 1990; Geweke, 1999). In this approach, each group of parameters and latent variables is
simulated conditional on all the others. Following each pass through the entire vector of latent
variables and parameters, all parameter values are recorded in a file.
        As detailed in Appendix A2, the Gibbs sampling algorithm is ergodic and its unique
limiting distribution is the posterior distribution. Therefore, dependent draws from the posterior
distribution of any function of the parameters g T               can be made by computing the value of g


16
  Appendix A1 documents further details of this prior distribution including the reasoning leading to the choice
V G 0.196 .


                                                        10
corresponding to the recorded parameter values, after discarding initial iterations of the Gibbs
sampling algorithm to allow for convergence. We used parallel computing methods and a
supercomputer, exploiting the fact that in each iteration of the Gibbs sampling algorithm the
latent variables       mi* , ci* , i 1,! , n   are conditionally independent across individuals. The

iterations themselves are executed serially. The results reported in Section 4 are based on every
10th draw from 19,000 successive iterations (a total of 1900 draws), after discarding 1,000 burn-
in iterations based on convergence diagnostics. For comparison purposes, we apply the same
procedures to a conventional probit model for mortality, using the Gibbs sampling algorithm
described in Albert and Chib (1993). Appendix A3 provides details on the numerical accuracy of
our Gibbs sampling algorithm.


3. The Data

         The primary source of data for this study is the Version B Discharge Data from the State
of California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development. These data provide records
for all patients discharged from any California acute-care hospital during the years 1989 through
1992. We confine our attention to patients who were over 65 at the time of admission. During
this time period, the vast majority of patients over 65 were covered by traditional Medicare fee-
for-service insurance, which has standardized hospitalization benefits. We confine our attention
to Los Angeles County. A large metropolitan area is best suited to our purposes, because it has a
large base of patients and contains multiple hospitals in every size and ownership class. We limit
our study to a single disease, because there is evidence that the relation between mortality and
covariates is disease specific.17 We choose pneumonia in particular for three reasons. First, it is a
common disease18 that provides the large sample needed to draw inferences about hospital
quality. Second, in-hospital death is a relatively frequent outcome for pneumonia patients, which
makes it a relevant disease to examine through the medium of hospital discharge records. Third,




17
  See Wray et al. (1997)
18
  Pneumonia and influenza alone constitute the sixth leading cause of death in the US, and the fourth leading cause
of death for those over 65 (National Center for Health Statistics, 1996). Pneumonia is also the leading cause of death
among patients with nosocomial (hospital acquired) infections (Pennington, 1994).


                                                         11
there is independent evidence that an appropriately adjusted in-hospital mortality rate for
pneumonia is correlated with the quality of in-hospital care.19
           The secondary source of data is the Annual Survey of Hospitals Database published by
the American Hospital Association (AHA). Among other information, the AHA data contain the
addresses, ownership status, and size of each hospital in our sample.


3.1 Sample construction
           The sample was selected through a process of eliminating patients from the 1989-1992
Version B Discharge Data. The first qualification for selection is that the patient live in a Los
Angeles County zip code, be admitted to a Los Angeles County hospital and be over 65 at the
time of admission.
           The second qualification is that one of the five ICD-9-CM disease codes specified in the
discharge data be 48.1, 48.2, 48.5, 48.6, or 48.38, as suggested by Iezzoni et al. (1996) to define
pneumonia.
           The third qualification is that the source of admission must be either routine, or from the
emergency room. This eliminates patients transferred into the hospital from another medical
facility, or admitted from an intermediate care or skilled nursing facility. To the extent that
placement in these facilities is correlated with unobserved disease severity, and to the extent that
such facilities may be systematically located near higher quality hospitals, the key assumption
that distance from the hospital is exogenous in our model would be violated. This step eliminates
approximately 23 percent of the patients from the sample.
           The fourth qualification is that the patient be admitted to a hospital with at least 80
admissions for pneumonia in our data set. This screen reduces J and thereby computation time.
Its potential to introduce sample selection bias is limited by the fact that it eliminates fewer than
one per cent of the patients.


3.2 Variable construction
           The covariate vector xi in the mortality probit equations contains an indicator for each
year, demographic variables and indicators of disease severity. Most of the demographic
variables are constructed from the discharge records. These are four age indicators (70-74, 75-79,

19
     See Keeler et al. (1990) and McGarvey and Harper (1993).


                                                         12
80-84, and 85 or older), an indicator for female, and indicators for black, Hispanic, Native
American and Asian respectively. The discharge records contain no information on
socioeconomic status. As a proxy for the patient’s household income, we use the mean 1990
census household income for households with the same zip code, race, and age class as the
patient.20
         Indicators of disease severity in xi are constructed from the admission disease staging
information contained in the discharge records. Disease staging has been shown to be as good as
some risk adjustment data based on chart review of medical records.21 Since some of the 13
stages have very few patients, we aggregated stages into five groups: stage 1.1, stages 1.3
through 2.3, stages 3.1 through 3.6, stage 3.7, and stage 3.8. Indicator variables for all but stage
1.1 are included in xi .

         The indicator for mortality, mi , is set to 1 if the patient died in the hospital within ten

days of admission; otherwise mi            0 . The horizon for mortality is limited to ten days, because
beyond this point hospitals sometimes transfer terminally ill patients to other facilities, and this
decision appears to vary considerably by hospital. To control for differential patient transfer,
Gowrisankaran and Town (1999) used a hazard model as an alternative to the 10-day inpatient
mortality, but found little difference between the two specifications. In two separate studies of
heart disease patients, McClellan, McNeil and Newhouse (1994) and McClellan and Staiger
(1999b), find that there is a very strong correlation between 7-day mortality and 30-day mortality
rates across hospitals.22
         Table 1 provides a summary of the distribution of demographic characteristics and
disease severity in the sample, together with mortality rates. Within each age group the
composition of the sample by race and sex closely reflects the demographics of Los Angeles
County. Older individuals enter the sample in greater proportion to their numbers in the
population than do younger ones. Within each age group three-quarters of the sample is

20
   The census provides only two relevant age categories, 65 - 74 and 75+, instead of four. Thus, we aggregated the
discharge data age categories to this level. Additionally, the census provides income only within cells. To find the
mean income, we took the mean value for each cell as the income for each household in that cell. For the highest
cell, $100,000 or more, we assumed a mean income of $140,000. Income is measured in units of $100,000 and
income squared in units of billions of dollars squared.
21
   See Thomas and Ashcroft (1991). Iezzoni et al. (1996) showed excellent agreement of disease stage with the
ratings of other systems.
22
   As caveats, note that heart disease is very different from pneumonia and that these studies examine mortality, not
inpatient mortality.


                                                         13
classified in the least severe disease stage. Mortality rates increase gradually with age, increase
sharply with disease stage, are a little higher for men than for women, and are lower for Asians
and Hispanics than for whites or blacks.
       The covariate matrix Z i contains variables specific to the combination of patient i and

each hospital. The additional information in Z i not contained in xi is the distance of the patient’s
home from each hospital. The discharge data include patient zip codes and the AHA data include
hospital zip codes. The Census TIGER database provides the latitude and longitude of the
centroid of each zip code. Given these, standard great circle trigonometric formulas provide the
distance between each patient home and hospital.23 The five variables in Z i are distance (in
hundreds of kilometers); distance-squared; the product of distance and an age indicator (1 for 65-
69, 2 for 70-74, 3 for 75-79, 4 for 80-84, 5 for 85+); the product of distance and disease stage
(1.1, …, 3.8); and the product of distance and income (in units of $100,000).
       The prior distribution and subsequent analyses require the size and ownership status of
each hospital. This information was obtained from the AHA survey, and is summarized in Table
2. We specified private teaching, public (operated by Los Angeles county) other not-for-profit
and for-profit hospitals as four mutually exclusive ownership categories.
       While mortality rates differ slightly by ownership category none of the differences are
significant at conventional levels. The same is true by size category. Contrasts in mortality rates
are stronger between cross-classified cells in Table 2. For example, the mean of the cells private,
not-for-profit with 151-200 beds (11.11%) and private, for-profit with 201-300 beds (10.54%)
are significantly greater than the overall mean at the 5% level.


4. Findings

       The model set forth in Section 2 applied to the data described in Section 3 yields
evidence on systematic differences in quality across hospitals, provides insight into the
interaction between hospital choice and hospital quality, and suggests quality orderings among
hospitals. This section summarizes these findings.




                                                 14
4.1 Patient mortality and hospital choice
         Table 3 presents the posterior means and standard deviations of some parameters and
functions of parameters in the selection and standard probit models. Table 3 details qG , UG ,
               12
J G c6G  1         and W 2 G c6G  1 for the selection model and J, qG* and W 2 for the probit

model.24
         The mortality equation has three groups of covariates: demographics, disease severity,
and hospital indicators. In the case of the demographic and disease severity covariates,
coefficient posterior means in the selection and probit models are similar to each other, and
closely reflect the mortality rates presented in Table 1. Posterior standard deviations indicate
substantial information about differences in mortality probabilities across demographic group.
         In the case of the hospital quality probits, there are greater and more interesting
differences between the selection model, the probit model, and the raw data. Both the probit
model and the raw data (Table 2) do not draw any sharp distinctions in hospital quality by size or
ownership class. However, the selection model finds sharp distinctions by size. This suggests
that controls for both observed and unobserved severity of illness are important.
         The posterior means of the hyperparameters W 2j carry forward the substantial uncertainty

about hospital qualities in the prior distribution, combined with the information in the data. The
prior mean of each W 2j is 0.41. In the case of the four ownership components p j and size

components sk the data combine with the prior to lower the posterior mean to 0.21. In the case

of the 114 individual hospital components ui the data provide more information about the
common variance and lower the posterior mean to 0.037.25
         Posterior means and standard deviations of the choice covariate coefficient vector D
show that, as expected, distance is an important factor in describing the hospital of admission.


23
   For zip codes that contain more than one hospital, we used address-level latitude and longitude data from the
Census TIGER database, which stores the geographic location of every block corner and will interpolate from that to
find the latitude and longitude of any address.
24
   The normalization of J and W2 facilitates comparison between the two models.
25
   The mean of an inverted gamma distribution for W 2 of the form s 2 W 2 ~ F 2 Q is E W 2     s 2 Q  2 . If the
prior were conjugate then the posterior mean of each W 2j would be 1.25  d 2    n  3 , where d 2 is the sum of
squares due to p j , sk or ui and n   4 in the first two cases and n 114 in the last. The lower bound on the
posterior mean would then be 1.25 n  3 , or 0.18 in the first two cases and 0.011 in the last case.


                                                         15
The posterior mean of –13.65 implies that a hospital that is 20 kilometers farther from a patient’s
home than another has a normalized probit that is 13.65 u 0.2       2 | 2 units lower. The quadratic
term in the equation is highly significant, but since distances are at most 100 kilometers within
Los Angeles County, its substantive effect is not great. Interactions of distance with age and
severity both have negative coefficients with posterior standard deviations small relative to their
posterior means. Given that age class varies between 1 and 5 and observed severity varies
between 1.1 and 3.8, the posterior mean of the distance coefficient varies between –14.44 and –
17.08, with distance decreasing in age and observed severity of illness. The reason for this is
likely due to the increased cost and difficulty of transport for severely ill patients. Patients in zip
codes with higher average income are more likely to be admitted to nearby hospitals.
       Table 4 provides explicit posterior probabilities for hospital group quality comparisons
using the selection model and also lists the mean and standard deviation of the posterior
probability of mortality at each type of hospital given a 10% mortality (roughly the sample
mean) at other types. There are sharp differences based on hospital size (Panel A). The posterior
probability that the group hospital quality probit for the largest-hospital group exceeds that of the
smallest-hospital group is 0.71, and the posterior probability that it is greater than that of the
other two size groups exceeds 0.95. The posterior probability that the smallest-hospital group
quality probit exceeds that of the second-smallest group similarly exceeds 0.95. This is reflected
in a mortality rate of 11.7% for the 150-200 bed category given a mortality rate of 10% for the
smallest size of hospital.
       These findings are in rough agreement with the literature. A study by Keeler et al. (1992),
which examined the relationship between hospital quality and size using a very detailed and
expensive data set that included pneumonia patients along with patients with other, more
complex diagnoses, found that hospital quality increases with bed size. However, in their study
they did not allow for a nonlinear relationship between hospital size and morality rates, thus they
could not uncover the U-shaped relationship between hospital quality and size that we do.
Successful pneumonia treatments are linked to identifying the pathogen responsible for the
infection and administering the appropriate antibacterial agent early in the progression of the
disease, and subsequently monitoring and adjusting the dosage of the drug (Rello and Valles
(1998), Pennington (1994), McGarvey and Harper (1993)). There is evidence that smaller
hospitals may be better at the timely administration of antibiotics (Fine et al. (1998)) which may


                                                  16
explain why we observe that they have better outcomes. Furthermore, since small hospitals are
likely to treat a disproportionate number of pneumonia patients relative to more technically
challenging illnesses26 they may also develop expertise in this disease. That, in turn, may
overcome advantages that medium-sized hospitals may have in other dimensions, such as
laboratory facilities.
         There are less sharp differences in the selection model based on ownership (Panel B).
Overall, private teaching hospitals have the highest quality, public hospital have the lowest
quality, and other hospitals are in the middle. However, from the posterior standard deviations of
the mortality rates it is evident that there are no definitive comparisons among ownership
categories.
         There is debate in health policy circles regarding the role that for-profit hospitals should
play in the U.S. health system (Gray (1991), Sloan (2000)). Some have argued that private, not-
for-profit hospitals may better serve the public interest because they are more likely to provide
better care. Our results indicate that for the treatment of pneumonia in older patients and the
hospitals in our sample, there is no evidence of this. Keeler et al. (1992) also found public
hospitals in large cities to be of lower quality, while the difference in quality between for-profit
and not-for-profit hospitals is less pronounced. McClellan and Staiger (1999a) conclude that the
quality difference in for-profit and not-for-profit hospitals is small and if anything for-profits
likely provide better care in the treatment of heart attacks. Private teaching hospitals, which are
generally viewed as providing superior care (Keeler et al. (1992)), do appear to offer
significantly higher quality according to the selection model.


4.2 Selection and selection bias
                                                                                                                *
         We present some statistics on the relationship between the posterior means of q j , q j and

Uj across the 114 hospitals in Table 5. These statistics allow us to uncover the importance of
selection and the relationship between selection and quality.




26
  Performing a simple multinomial logit regression of Southern California patients, we found that pneumonia
patients were more likely to be admitted to smaller hospitals than were hospital patients generally. In contrast, acute
myocardial infarction (heart attack) patients were more likely to be admitted to larger hospitals than the average
hospital patient. Unlike pneumonia treatments, acute myocardial infarction treatments often include high-technology
surgery such as cardiac catheterization, angioplasty or bypass.


                                                          17
         We start by analyzing the quantitative importance of selection in influencing patient
mortality. In the simple probit model, the variance in unobserved disease severity H i is
normalized to be 1. From the posterior means of the coefficients on observed disease severity in
the model (Table 3) and the distribution of observed patient characteristics in the population
(Table 1), one may approximate the variance in the contribution of observed demographics and
disease severity to the mortality probit: it is about 0.45. The variance in the mortality probit due
to variation in hospital quality is about 0.013 (Table 5 Panel A), much smaller than the variance
due to unobserved severity of illness, which is normalized to 1. This decomposition of variance
is about the same in the selection model – variation in hospital quality is slightly higher (Table 5)
but it is still quite small relative to disease severity.
         In the selection model the variation in unobserved disease severity is decomposed into a
component that is independent of the hospital assignment process ( ] i from (5)) with variance 1,

and a component that is a function of the hospital assignment probits, KicG (also from (5)). The

variance of the latter term, G c6G , has a posterior mean of 8.7, which is much larger than the
independent component. This constitutes strong evidence against random assignment of patients,
and suggests that the simple probit model provides misleading inferences about hospital quality.
         Since patient selection is important, we are interested in understanding the relationship
between selection and quality. Table 5 Panel A reveals a positive relationship between the
posterior means of q j and Uj : the correlation between posterior means is 0.517 (Panel A) and a

simple least squares regression of the posterior means of the Uj on the posterior means of the q j
shows a slope coefficient of 0.183 that is significantly positive (t of over 6).27 Thus, hospitals
with higher quality (higher q j ) have a greater propensity to be selected by patients with greater

unobserved disease severity (higher H j ). This is also reflected in Table 3, which shows similar

patterns of qG and UG across types of hospitals.
         In any selection model, conditional on observed characteristics (including observed
severity), the observed mortality rate for each hospital will be decomposed into a hospital quality

27
  Since results in Table 5 are based on posterior means, they do not take into account dispersion in the posterior. To
account for this dispersion, one can examine the sample relation between q j , q*j and U j as a function of the
parameters, and consider the posterior uncertainty associated with this relationship. This would yield values of Table
5 for each draw from the posterior simulator. One can then compute the mean value across the draws. This method
yields similar results.


                                                         18
component and an unobserved severity component. Panel C of Table 5 shows that in this
relationship hospital quality q *j in the probit model is well described as a linear function of

hospital quality q j and severity correlation Uj in the selection model. From the regression
relation reported in panel C of Table 5, it is clear that variation in hospital severity correlation
                                                                           *
substantially drives variation in inferred hospital quality q j in the probit model. From the

regressions in panels B and C, one can infer the slope coefficient of .712 =.905  1.553 u .124

in panel D. Thus, variation in hospital severity correlation accounts for a substantial portion of
the variation in hospital mortality rates in the selection model, whereas in the simple probit
model this variation must be attributed to quality differences.


4.3 Ordering by quality
         The model and approach to inference described in Section 2 provide the complete
posterior distribution of all the parameters in the model, and any functions of these parameters.
In particular, corresponding to the parameter values in any iteration of the Gibbs sampling
algorithm, it is a simple matter to compute the corresponding hospital quality probits q j . The
1900 draws used to obtain the posterior moments reported in this section therefore also provide
1900 draws from the joint distribution of the hospital quality probits q j . Pairwise comparisons

between hospitals are then straightforward. For example, for two hospitals j and k, the numerical
approximation to the posterior probability that q j ! qk is the fraction of iterations in which
q j ! qk , and the joint distribution of q j and qk could easily be plotted.

         Comparing all 114 hospitals simultaneously is more challenging. A formal approach to
ordering hospitals by quality would begin with a loss function for orderings. Suppose the 114-
element vector of quality ranks is r, and the estimated quality rank vector is rˆ . If the loss

function is rˆ  r c A r  ˆr , where A is a positive definite matrix, then rˆ should be the posterior
mean of r.28 This estimate may, in turn, be approximated numerically by sorting hospital
qualities q j in each iteration of the Gibbs sampler, finding the corresponding rank for each

hospital, and then averaging the ranks across all iterations. The resulting estimated ranks rˆj are

used in the next paragraph.

be the median of the posterior distribution of rj , which in turn is an integer (with probability
one).
        Appendix A4 provides rankings based on both loss functions. The choice of loss function
turns out not to have a large effect on the orderings of relative quality. The rankings produced
by these alternative loss functions are similar. The posterior distributions of r and of the hospital
qualities convey the uncertainty associated with the rankings. For most pairwise combinations of
hospitals in the top and bottom quartiles, the posterior that the quality of the former exceeds the
latter is rarely less than 0.8 and exceeds 0.9 more often than not. An approximate rule of thumb
for the accuracy of rankings is that if a hospital is ranked at quantile x then the posterior
probability that its true rank is above the median is also x. Appendix A4 provides all the
rankings and several aspects of their joint posterior distribution.


4.4 Specification and robustness
        A key assumption in the selection model is that the distances between the patients’ homes
and the 114 hospitals in the sample constitute variables that may be used to control for the non-
random assignment patients to hospitals. Because of the nonlinear relationship between the
endogenous variables (hospital choice) in the mortality equation and the instruments, this
relationship was modeled explicitly. Table 3 reveals an indisputably strong link between the
measures in Z and the choice of hospital. For instance, distance and its square explain about 30%
of the variance of the probits. The findings are in accord with the literature.29
        The further assumption that distances from hospitals to patients are uncorrelated with
unobserved disease severity cannot be examined so directly. One plausible alternative is that
there remain geographic variations in unobserved disease severity after accounting for the
observed covariates listed in the first two panels of Table 3. We examined this possibility from
three angles. First, in a conventional probit model for mortality using the observed covariates,
hospital choice dummies and patient zip code dummies, the zip code dummies are insignificant.
Second, the same is true if dummies for nearest hospital replace zip code dummies. In both
equations, the coefficients on the hospital choice dummies are jointly significant in the presence
of the zip code dummies. Finally, we conducted a more direct examination by retrieving the




                                                 20
unobserved disease severity component from the mortality probit equation in each iteration of
the MCMC algorithm. In the regression of this component on zip code dummies and the other
regressors, the dummies were jointly insignificant in every iteration. All these findings are
consistent with the absence of any unobserved geographic component of disease severity.
           Given the large number of endogenous variables in the selection model, quite a few
assumptions about functional form were required. The dimensionality of the problem is perhaps
most evident in the 6,440 potentially independent free parameters in 6 , the prior variance matrix
in the multinomial hospital assignment model. The selection model takes the extreme step of
assuming that shocks to the probits in this model are iid normal before differencing (Section 2.2).
If this assumption is reasonable, then the 113 u 1 vectors of posterior shocks Ki i 1,! , n ,

which may be retrieved in each iteration of the MCMC algorithm, should be consistent with the
specification 6 I J 1  e J 1ecJ 1 . If it is not – for example, if patients with certain characteristics
all choose from one small group of hospitals – then this will be evidenced by a constructed

                                           ¦         Ki  K Ki  K c being substantially different from 6 . A

conventional goodness of fit test, carried out at the 5% level, rejects the null hypothesis in
slightly over half the iterations of the MCMC algorithm. We conclude that there may well be
misspecification of the covariance structure in the multinomial hospital assignment covariance
matrix, but it is probably not severe. Due to the large number of parameters in 6 , information
about the covariance structure beyond the data would be required to deal constructively with this
potential misspecification.
           The sensitivity of findings to the specification of the prior distribution can be examined in
a number of ways. To convey the nature of the sensitivity we set up three further variants of the
selection model. Variant A effectively eliminates the instruments from the entire model, by
scaling the prior standard deviations of the coefficient vector D in the multinomial hospital
assignment model by the factor 10 6 . This variant leaves only the functional form to identify the
hospital-specific parameters in the mortality equation. Variant B scales the prior standard
deviations of D in the original selection model downward by a factor of 5 and W 2 downward by
a factor of 25. Variant C is like Variant B except that prior standard deviations are increased by a

     See Luft et al. (1990) and Gowrisankaran and Town (1999).


                                                             21
factor of 5 relative to the base model. Thus, variants B and C provide alternative priors that are
plausible from the perspective of the subjective prior in the base selection model.
        Appendix A5 provides a detailed set of results for each of these prior distributions. As
one might expect, coefficients on covariates in the mortality probit equation show very little
sensitivity to the choice from among the four prior distributions. The same is true in the hospital
choice multinomial probit model, with the obvious exception of prior A. The findings about
hospital mortality (Section 4.1) are the same in variants B and C as in the base selection model:
quality is a “U” shaped function of size; private teaching hospitals have the highest and public
hospitals the lowest quality with differences in this dimension remaining small. By contrast
variant A shows little effect of size, or ownership, and the point estimates display neither the “U”
shape for size nor the ownership ranking of the base model. The correlations between hospital
quality posterior means in the base selection model and variants B and C are both 0.80. By
contrast, the correlation between hospital quality posterior means in the base selection model and
variant A is only 0.34. We conclude that reasonable variants on the prior produce distinct but
insubstantial differences, whereas elimination of the instruments from the model has strong and
substantial effects.


5. Conclusion

        This study has extended existing econometric methods in order to measure hospital
quality using the experience of patients admitted to hospitals in nonrandom fashion. Using
discharge records for almost 75,000 older pneumonia patients from 114 hospitals in Los Angeles
County, we find evidence of differences in quality between hospitals of different size and
ownership classifications. The smallest and largest hospitals exhibit higher quality than other
hospitals. We also detect substantial differences in quality for a sizable minority of individual
hospitals.
        As an important by-product, our methods produce information about the hospital
admissions process. Patients with greater unobserved severity of illness tend, overall, to be
admitted to hospitals of higher quality. Consequently more conventional methods that ignore
nonrandom admission, when applied to this data set, tend to lower the inferred quality of good
hospitals and raise that of poor ones, relative to our findings. We find that variation across



                                                22
individual hospitals in the unobserved severity of illness is at least as great as variation in
quality, and that this variation accounts for most of the large discrepancy between inference
about hospital quality in our model and with more conventional methods.
       The procedures used here are at the current frontier of intensive computational methods
in econometrics. A supercomputer and several days of computing were required to obtain the
results reported here. Recent and imminent innovations in numerical methods and computing
technology should sharply reduce the real costs of these procedures in the near term. Given the
policy importance of assessing quality of care in hospitals, we believe there is a significant return
to further investment in these methods and their application to similar questions in health policy
and related fields.

The first number in each cell is the posterior probability that the group quality probit qG in the
column category exceeds qG in the row category, and the second number is the posterior mean
probability of mortality in the row category given a 10% probability of mortality in the column
category, with the posterior standard deviation of this statistic in parentheses.

Appendix A1: Construction of prior distributions


       This appendix describes in detail the construction of the prior distributions used in the
selection model. The notation in this appendix is the same as in the paper.


A1.1 Prior distributions for D (selection model)
       There are five coefficients in the vector D in the hospital multinomial choice model (2)
corresponding to the five covariates: distance from patient i’s home to hospital j, the square of
this distance, and the product of distance with age, disease stage, and income respectively. The
priors for the five coefficients are independent, each Gaussian with mean zero and a specified
standard deviation.
       To construct these standard deviations, we took a random subsample of 1,000 patients
and constructed the covariate vectors z ij i 1,! ,1000; j 1,! ,114 of the multinomial choice

model. For each of the five covariates we found a value of the coefficient such that if all other
coefficients are zero then the joint probability that the patient goes to one of the 27 hospitals
farthest away is 0.003. We verified that these values resulted in the probabilities of the patient
going to the nearest hospital being between 0.1 and 0.2. These resulted in coefficient values of -
6, -12, -4, -5 and -35 for the respective covariates (ordered as in Table 4, bottom panel).
       The prior standard deviations are therefore set to 6, 12, 4, 5 and 35, respectively. Since
the mean of all distributions is zero, the prior is centered about independence of hospital choice
from the covariates. But it is sufficiently inclusive that it renders reasonable what we regard as a
priori reasonable effects of the covariates on hospital choices.




                                             A1
A1.2 Prior distribution for G (selection model)
        We begin with the probit equation (2) of the hospital choice model before differencing,

Express the correlation between Ki and the shock H i to the mortality equation (1) by means of
the linear projection

                                                                                                                         (A1.2)

This equation corresponds to (5) in the paper; we return to this correspondence below.
        Suppose that in the system (A1.1)-(A1.2) our prior distribution for G is
                          G ~ N 0, hG 1I J                                                                            (A1.3)

In (A1.3) the priors are independent and exchangeable across hospitals. The corresponding
                                                                               12
correlation between H i and Ki is U j                        G j   GcG  1 . Since the distribution in (A1.3) is

symmetric about zero, the prior correlation between the parameters U j and U k is zero.

        As explained between (2) and (3) in the paper, normalizing cJ*                                0 leads to

                         c*i     ZiD  Ki , Ki ~ N 0, 6 , 6                    I J 1  e J 1ecJ 1

which is (3) in the paper. Express the linear projection of H i on Ki as

                                 ¦
                                     J 1

The asterisks in this equation reflects the fact that var ] i* z 1 whereas var ] i                                  1 in (5). The

next step is to derive G *       G1* ,! , G J*1 c and var ] i* .

        From (A1.4), and then from (A1.1)-(A1.2),

(In this expression, the subscript “J” denotes the last element of the J u 1 vector, and the
subscript “  J ” denotes the first J  1 elements of the J u 1 vector.) Since the prior distribution

of G is (A1.3), the prior distribution of G * is also normal, with mean zero and variance




                                                               A2

          Because var ] i* z 1 whereas var ] i                              1 in (5), G * differs from G by a scale factor.

The prior for G will have mean zero and variance proportional to (A1.6). To obtain the factor of

Hence from (A1.2) and (A1.7),

Thus G ~ N 0, hG 1IT          implies the prior expectation hG 1  1 for var ] i* . This leads to the

appropriate normalization for (A1.6),
                                              § hG 1 · 1                           1

          Since var ] i*         involves G , the implied distribution for G under the normalization

var ] i      1 of (5) is not Gaussian. We therefore conjecture a Gaussian prior distribution for G ,

and then examine whether it is in fact similar to the non-Gaussian prior implied by (A1.3) and
(5). From (A1.3) and (A1.8), the prior expectation of var ] i*                                              is 1  hG 1 . Our conjectured

Gaussian distribution for G is therefore

         A series of numerical experiments showed that the non-Gaussian prior implied by (A1.3)
and (A1.5), and the Gaussian prior (A1.9), give essentially identical moments for the correlations
U j and U j , for the same values of hG . Table A1 shows the relationships between hG and some

moments of U j and U j . (In Table A1, R 2             GcG GcG  1 , the fraction of variance in the

mortality shock explained by the hospital choice probits in (A1.2); R 2                        G cG G cG  1 , the

fraction of variance in the mortality shock explained by the hospital choice probits in (5).)
         Observe that as the standard deviation in the elements of G , hG1 2 , increases, R 2 and R 2

increase; that this must happen is obvious from (A1.2) and (5). But the correlations U j and U j

do not increase significantly beyond hG1 2     .08 . This is due to the large number of hospitals, and

the symmetry of the prior in G . For the work reported in this paper, we chose hG1 2                     0.2 , or

equivalently, V G    0.196 .


A1.3 Prior distributions for E
         The variance component structure in the prior for E described in the text can be used to

simplify the coding of the algorithm detailed in Appendix A2. Let W be a J u J  9 matrix of

hospital characteristics. Let the first column of W be entirely units, columns 2 through 5
dichotomous variables for the four ownership categories, and columns 6 through 9 dichotomous
variables for the four size categories. Redefine E to be the J  9 u 1 vector of corresponding

coefficients. The priors for the components of this vector are mutually independent, with
E1 ~ N 0, 32 . The hierarchical prior distribution for E 2 ,! , E J 9 is

                 sp2 W p2  F 2 Q p , E j  N 0,W p2         j     2,3, 4,5 ;
                 ss2 W s2  F 2 Q s , E j  N 0,W s2         j     6, 7,8,9 ;
                 su2 W u2  F 2 Q u , E j  N 0,W u2         j 10,! , J  9 .

In the prior distribution used in the paper, sp2       ss2        su2      1.25 for the conventional probit model

with V     1 . As discussed in Section 2.2, the variances in the selection model are scaled by

readily verified that the prior distribution of WE is the same as the prior distribution of E

described in the text. The elements of the J  9 u 1 vector E have proper prior distributions,

and the posterior distribution of WE is exactly the same as that of E described in the text.


A1.3 Prior distributions for J
         The demographic covariates xi are of two types: dichotomous variables, and two

continuous variables (income and its square). The coefficients J i of the dichotomous variables
are independent in the prior, all with standard deviation 0.5 in the conventional probit model
with V    1 . The coefficients on income and its square (call them J 1 and J 2 ) are derived from the
independent priors

                              J 1 y  J 2 y 2 ~ N 0, 0.252 ,
                                  2              2
                          J1 2y        J 2 2y       ~ N 0, 0.252 .

Substituting for average income y , scaling y by 105 and y 2 by 109 (as was done in variable

construction) yields prior variances of 3.603 and 0.1437 for J 1 and J 2 , respectively, and a prior
covariance of –0.7026. As discussed in Section 2.2, these coefficients are scaled by
                 12

      Since individuals are independent, the joint distribution of observables and latent variables
for all individuals is the product of this expression over i 1,! , n .


A2.5 Gibbs sampling algorithm
      The posterior density is proportional to the product of the prior density (A2.1) and the
distribution of observables and latent variables (A2.2) over i 1,! , n , taking the observables as
fixed and the unobserved latent variables and parameters as the arguments of the posterior
density. In a Gibbs sampling algorithm (Gelfand and Smith, 1990; Geweke, 1997) the
unobservables are grouped and successive drawings are made for each group. Given weak
regularity conditions, the unique stationary distribution of these repeated drawings is the


                                                                        A7
posterior distribution. In the algorithm described here there are 2n  2 groups: c*i i 1,! , n ,

mi* i 1,! , n , D , and Q . In each case the conditional distribution may be determined by

examining the kernel of the posterior density in the vector being drawn.
     The latent vectors c*i i 1,! , n are conditionally independent, with c*i ~ N ci , H i1 where

using the generic algorithm in Geweke (1991), the fixed structure of 6 permits a more efficient
procedure. Specifically, it can be shown that conditional on all the other parameters and latent
variables, the j’th element of c*i , denoted cij* , is

    The conditions set forth by Roberts and Smith (1994) for the posterior distribution to be the
unique stationary distribution for a Gibbs sampling algorithm, described as Gibbs sampler
convergence condition 2 in Geweke (1997) are satisfied. The key technical condition is that the
support of the posterior distribution in latent variables and parameters is connected and upper
semicontinuous.


A2.6 Computation time
       Using an IBM 332Mhz 604e processor and ESSL matrix computation routines, the
computational time per iteration was approximately 6 minutes. This processor is comparable to a
Pentium III 600. We then used an IBM SP supercomputer with Silver nodes, each of which has
the 604e processor as its base, in order to compute each iteration in parallel. Two steps were very
parallelizable: the cij* can be computed in parallel for each individual, and the matrix

multiplications necessary to compute the conditional posterior of D can also be broken up by
individual. We were able to reduce the computation time close to proportionally to the number of
processors that we used. For instance, the algorithm took 100 seconds per iteration with 4
processors, 60 seconds per iteration with 8 processors and 33 seconds per iteration with 20
processors. Thus, computation time for 20,000 iterations with 20 processors is roughly 8 days.

single vector y. A posterior moment can then be expressed E ª¬g T y º¼ for the appropriate

function of interest g. The Gibbs sampling algorithm produces serially correlated draws

 V 2 M        , to the posterior standard deviation V , is   RNE  M         . For any given posterior

distribution and MCMC algorithm, RNE will be different for different functions of interest.
          The results reported in the paper are based on 20,000 iterations of the Gibbs sampler.
Visual inspection of parameter draws shows that convergence to the invariant (i.e., posterior)
distribution occurs within the first 1,000 iterations, which are discarded. Of the remaining
19,000, every tenth iteration is used to compute posterior moments. (This reduces the size of the
posterior files. Because of the serial correlation in functions of interest over iterations, little
information is lost.)
          The values of NSE and RNE corresponding to the moments reported in Table 4 are
provided in Table A2. (RNE is computed from the 1900 retained iterations.)                  The Gibbs
sampling algorithm for the probit model exhibits no serial correlation, and consequently
numerical standard errors are all about 1 1900 | 1 44 of the posterior standard deviation. The
degree of serial correlation in the Gibbs sampling algorithm for the selection model varies,
depending on the moments. Serial correlation is modest for the demographic and severity
coefficients in the mortality probit equation, with all but one RNE greater than 0.2. For the group
quality probits and the coefficients in the multinomial probit hospital selection model serial
correlation is greater, with RNEs between 0.004 and 0.014. Observe that if RNE is 0.01, with

posterior variance itself: stated less formally, simulation noise inflates the posterior standard

deviation by 20 19         1 2.6% .

       Table A3 provides similar information about the numerical accuracy of approximations
in the Gibbs sampling algorithm for the quality probits q j (selection model) and q*j (probit

model) and for U j , the correlation between the mortality probit equation shock and the shocks to

the hospital choice multinomial probit model. The RNEs for q*j in the probit model are centered

about 1.0, as was the case for all moments of this model in Table A2. The RNEs of the quality
probits q j in the selection model are comparable to those of the group quality probits and D

vector in Table A2, while for the correlations U j they are somewhat lower.


Appendix A4: Rankings of hospitals


       Table A4 provides rankings for hospitals based on quadratic and absolute value loss
functions, using the posterior density from the selection model. Table A5 provides pairwise
comparisons: for hospitals at equally spaced quartiles of the posterior quality distribution, the
table indicates the posterior probability that the hospital has lower quality than each of the other
hospitals in the set. The choice of loss function does not have a large effect on the orderings of
relative quality. The majority of hospitals have probability of at least 0.05 of being in any of
three quartiles of the distribution. Roughly 10% of hospitals appear to be either better or worse
than average, with posterior probability of at least 95%. Fairly confident pairwise rankings can
be made for the ends of the distribution but not for the majority of hospitals.
       Tables A6 and A7 provide the same figures as Tables A4 and A5 respectively, using the
posterior density from the probit model. The two sets of tables indicate substantially different
orders of rankings, but similar magnitudes of coefficients. In both models, there are 42 hospitals
that have quality probit exceeding 0.1 in absolute value. However, the probit model exhibits
somewhat more confidence about the rankings. There are only 9 hospitals (as opposed to 21 for
the selection model) for which the probability of placement is at least .10 in each quartile, and
about 25% of hospitals appear to be either better or worse than average, with posterior



                                            A11
probability of at least 95%. The greater confidence in rankings can be ascribed to the restriction
of no correlation between shocks to hospital choice and mortality in the probit model.


Appendix A5: Results with alternative prior distributions


       Section 4.4 of the paper describes three alternative priors chosen to study their impact on
the results. To recapitulate, variant A effectively eliminates the instruments, by scaling the prior
standard deviations of the coefficient vector D in the multinomial hospital assignment model by
the factor 10 6 . This leaves only the functional form to identify the hospital-specific parameters
in the mortality equation. Variant B scales the prior standard deviations of D in the original
selection model downward by a factor of 5. It does the same for the hospital coefficients E in

the mortality probit equation, by taking 1.25 u 15 u 15 u ª¬V G2 J  1  1º¼ W 2j ~ F 2 5   rather than

1.25 ª¬V G2 J  1  1º¼ W 2j ~ F 2 5 . Variant C is like Variant B except that prior standard

deviations are increased by a factor of 5 relative to the base model. Variants B and C are simply
reasonable alternatives to the base prior used in the paper.
       Tables 3 and 4 in the paper are reproduced for each of these variants in this appendix: for
variant A in Tables A8 and A9, for variant B in Tables A10 and A11, and for variant C in Tables
A12 and A13. Turning first to the variants on Table 3 (i.e. Tables A8, A10, A12), note that there
is almost no sensitivity of the covariate coefficients in the mortality equation to the three
alternative priors. Given that (1) the priors for these coefficients are the same in all three
variants, (2) these priors are independent of the priors for all the other parameters in the model,
and (3) that hospital choice and unobserved disease severity are orthogonal to the covariates in
the sample, the posterior distribution of the covariate coefficients in the mortality equation would
be the same under all three priors. Conditions (1) and (2) are met here; (3) cannot be verified, but
it is reasonable as an approximation and is the leading interpretation of the insensitivity of
mortality covariate coefficients to priors for hospital quality and the hospital choice multinomial
probit model. The posterior distribution of the coefficient vector D in this model is little affected
by the alternative priors B and C, while of course under variant A these coefficients are much
smaller.




                                             A12
       As one would expect, there is substantially more variation in the group hospital quality
probits q j , across the alternative priors. Table A14 provides the correlation coefficients between

the posterior means of the individual hospital quality probits across the 114 hospitals. The
correlations between the base selection model and prior variants B and C are both 0.80, whereas
correlation between the base model and prior variant A is 0.34. These comparisons support the
conclusion of the paper (in Section 4.4) that reasonable variations in the prior distribution
produce distinct but small effects on the posterior moments of interest, while eliminating the
instruments from the selection model produces a substantially larger effect.
       This relationship between the alternative priors and the base model is also evident in the
posterior probability comparisons of orderings in group quality probits: see the variants on Table
4 in Tables A9, A11 and A13. For the hospital size and ownership group quality probits, the
results are clear: the tighter (B) and looser (C) priors produce results close to the base model. By
contrast elimination of instruments (prior variant A) produces results entirely dissimilar from the
base model.

Notation and definitions are exactly as for Table 4 of the paper. The first number in each cell is the posterior
probability that the group quality probit qG in the column category exceeds qG in the row category, and the second
number is the posterior mean probability of mortality in the row category given a 10% probability of mortality in the
column category, with the posterior standard deviation of this statistic in parentheses.

Notation and definitions are exactly as for Table 4 of the paper. The first number in each cell is the posterior
probability that the group quality probit qG in the column category exceeds qG in the row category, and the second
number is the posterior mean probability of mortality in the row category given a 10% probability of mortality in the
column category, with the posterior standard deviation of this statistic in parentheses.

Notation and definitions are exactly as for Table 4 of the paper. The first number in each cell is the posterior
probability that the group quality probit qG in the column category exceeds qG in the row category, and the second
number is the posterior mean probability of mortality in the row category given a 10% probability of mortality in the
column category, with the posterior standard deviation of this statistic in parentheses.
