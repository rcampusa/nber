                                          ABSTRACT

Sea-level rise and ensuing permanent coastal inundation will cause spatial shifts in population
and economic activity over the next 200 years. Using a highly spatially disaggregated, dynamic
model of the world economy that accounts for the dynamics of migration, trade, and innovation,
this paper estimates the consequences of probabilistic projections of local sea-level changes under
diﬀerent emissions scenarios. Under an intermediate greenhouse gas concentration trajectory,
permanent ﬂooding is projected to reduce global real GDP by an average of 0.19% in present
value terms, with welfare declining by 0.24% as people move to places with less attractive
amenities. By the year 2200 a projected 1.46% of world population will be displaced. Losses in
many coastal localities are more than an order of magnitude larger, with some low-lying urban
areas particularly hard hit. When ignoring the dynamic economic adaptation of investment and
migration to ﬂooding, the loss in real GDP in 2200 increases from 0.11% to 4.5%. This shows the
importance of including dynamic adaptation in future loss models.

1      Introduction
Many effects of climate change develop gradually over prolonged periods of time. For example, global mean sea-
level is currently increasing at a rate of about 3mm per year (Hay et al., 2015). Under intermediate scenarios of
greenhouse gas emissions, the International Panel on Climate Change projects that by the year 2100 the global
mean sea level is likely to increase by 0.4 to 0.7 meters compared to the period 1986-2005 (Church et al., 2013).
In addition to being gradual and prolonged, many effects of climate change are heterogeneous across space. Rising
oceans bode ill for many large coastal cities, such as Amsterdam, Bangkok and Ho Chi Minh City, whereas inland
cities, such as Mexico City, Dallas or Kinshasa, will be untouched by the direct effects of sea level rise.
    Understanding these spatial and temporal dimensions is essential to any economic evaluation of climate change.
In particular, permanent coastal flooding will shift the spatial distribution of economic activity to more inland
regions.1 Moving the centers of economic production to the interior is certainly possible, since land is still a
relatively abundant resource, as reflected by 90% of world GDP being produced on 10% of land (Desmet and
Rossi-Hansberg, 2015). However, the feasibility of relocation does not necessarily make it easy or costless. Natural,
economic, and institutional barriers to moving people and goods abound. While relocating to higher ground should
be relatively straightforward in the United States, it is harder in the Netherlands and close to impossible for small
Pacific islands.
    Of course, the cost of changing the spatial distribution of economic activity is likely to be somewhat mitigated
as long as sea-level rise occurs gradually over time. Faced with a slow-moving process of rising oceans, the required
geographic relocation of people and economic activity over any short horizon is limited. The gradual nature of
this process also implies that any substantial rise in sea level takes longer to materialize than the standard time it
takes for capital and infrastructure to depreciate. As a result, the cost of capital destruction due to the permanent
rise in sea level is likely to be relatively small. Much more important than the loss in structures per se may be the
loss of local agglomeration economies that come with density. Intuitively, flooding Manhattan is costly because of
the technology and agglomeration economies lost. Manhattan’s buildings are valuable primarily because of where
they are, not because of the cost of rebuilding them.
    In addition to the static cost of relocating people and the static impact on agglomeration economies, there
are also important dynamic growth effects associated with changing the spatial distribution of economic activity.
Depending on whether the partial abandonment of Ho Chi Minh City due to permanent inundation leads to the
spatial dispersion of economic activity or to the emergence of new clusters, productivity and innovation will be
affected differently. To assess the growth effects of coastal flooding, we therefore need to account for the entire
economic geography of the world, as some clusters may disappear while others come into being. These growth
effects play out both at the local and the aggregate level. Ultimately, if sea-level rise destroys coastal high-density
clusters, without new ones appearing in other places, global growth may suffer.
    The above discussion suggests that a comprehensive economic evaluation of climate change in general, and
coastal flooding in particular, should focus on (i) quantifying the costs associated with changing the spatial distri-
bution of economic activity, (ii) analyzing the dynamic spatial response at a high spatial resolution, (iii) embedding
this high-resolution analysis in a global general equilibrium framework, and (iv) incorporating static and dynamic
agglomeration economies when estimating the effects of the destruction of existing economic clusters and the
emergence of new ones.
    Incorporating these considerations into an evaluation of the effects of sea-level rise requires a change in focus,
    1 Throughout   the paper, we use the term flooding to indicate permanent inundation and not episodic, temporary, flooding.


                                                                   2
from computing the value of destroyed land and structures, to evaluating the dynamic changes in the location
of economic activity. To do so, we need a high-resolution global dynamic equilibrium framework that is able to
analyze the effects of permanent inundation on both the places that suffer directly from the rise in sea level and
the rest of the world economy. In such a model, dynamics are crucial if we want to evaluate how different localities
are likely to evolve. Assessing how the economy reacts to flooding also requires realistically modeling the economic
links between locations, in particular the trade of goods and the migration of people.
    Desmet, Nagy and Rossi-Hansberg (2018) propose and quantify a model of the world economy at a 1◦ by
  ◦
1 resolution that incorporates these elements, except for the impact of sea-level rise. Rather than focusing on
investment in capital, the model emphasizes investment in local technology. In doing so, it explicitly models the
effect of static and dynamic agglomeration economies on productivity and growth. Our paper uses the benchmark
economic scenario in Desmet et al. (2018) and incorporates probabilistic sea-level rise projections for different
greenhouse gas emissions scenarios constructed by Kopp et al. (2014) and Kopp et al. (2017) for the period 2000
to 2200. Using many realizations of sea-level paths, we analyze which areas become permanently submerged over
time and compute economic scenarios in which people cannot live or produce in flooded areas. This exercise yields
average predicted costs of flooding in all areas of the world over time, as well as confidence bands for these costs,
which depend on the severity of the realized flooding paths. We measure these costs in terms of an individual’s real
income and in terms of her welfare; the latter measure also takes into account local amenities and an individual’s
idiosyncratic preferences for a location.
    Our evaluation of the effects of permanent coastal inundation emphasizes economic adaptation. Hence, in our
analysis we take sea-level rise projections to be exogenous to the evolution of the economy and ignore other adap-
tation efforts aimed directly at reducing flooding.2 The novelty of our approach lies in incorporating endogenous
economic adaptation to flooding through migration, trade, and local investments in technology. Our assessment
quantifies the costs of flooding relative to a counterfactual scenario where sea levels remain constant; these costs
can then be combined with cost estimates of flood mitigation and other forms of physical adaptation to properly
evaluate different policy options.
    Under an intermediate scenario of greenhouse gas emissions, we project that sea-level rise will lead to a drop
in global real GDP of 0.19% in present discounted value terms (with a 95% credible interval of 0.07 – 0.37%)
and a displacement of 1.46% of world population in 2200 (with a 95% credible interval of 0.15 – 3.54%). The
spatial variation in these effects is large: some countries, such as Vietnam, lose more than 7%, and some coastal
cities, such as Bangkok and Shanghai, lose an important share of their population. These magnitudes would be
significantly larger if we ignored the dynamic spatial adjustment of the economy to sea-level rise. If people were
immobile when faced with rising oceans (or unable to move far from inundated areas), the real GDP loss in the
year 2200 would be 4.5%, compared to 0.11% in our benchmark model. When not taking into account the spatial
dynamic reaction of the economy, our quantitative findings are in the same ballpark as those of Nicholls and Tol
(2006) and Hinkel et al. (2014).
    Existing evaluations of sea-level rise mostly fail to account for the geographic evolution of the world economy,
and in particular for its spatial dynamic reaction to flooding. In its simplest form, assessing the costs of sea-level rise
is often done on the basis of today’s economy (Dasgupta et al., 2007). This overlooks that the spatial distribution
of the world economy will change over the coming centuries. It also ignores that people will move when their
  2 Impact-specific optimization models have been used to look in greater detail at the tradeoff between adaptation costs and residual

damages (Vafeidis et al., 2008, Hinkel et al., 2014, Diaz, 2016). An alternative approach forgoes optimization, focusing instead on
comparing costs under different adaptation scenarios (Neumann et al., 2015, Nicholls et al., 2011, Yohe et al., 2011).



                                                                  3
land becomes inundated, and that their migration will affect existing and future clusters of population, economic
activity and innovation. Some researchers incorporate static projections of the changing future distribution of
population and economic activity into their analysis by using different socio-economic scenarios, such as those of
the IPCC’s Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (Nakicenovic et al., 2000, Nicholls, 2004, Hinkel and Klein,
2009, Anthoff et al., 2010). However, these scenarios only make projections for large regions, and they are not
general equilibrium in nature. As an example, one such scenario simply assumes rapid future convergence in GDP
per capita and fertility across the different regions of the globe. More importantly, the existing literature does not
incorporate economic adaptation in the form of migration or new innovation in emerging clusters (Hsiang et al.,
2017).
    In addition to the issue of dynamic adaptation, it is key to choose the appropriate geographic level of analysis
when evaluating the impact of permanent flooding. Damages from a rise in sea level have been assessed at the
local level (Neumann et al., 2011, Hallegatte et al., 2011), the regional level (Bosello et al., 2007, Houser et al.,
2015), and the global level (Nicholls and Tol, 2006, Diaz, 2016). Local studies ignore the economic linkages to the
rest of the world, such as the possibility of people moving to other areas, while regional or global studies often
are not conducted at a spatially disaggregated level and thus ignore that many of the effects of flooding are local
in nature. By analyzing the global economy at a high resolution, we are able to assess the heterogeneity in local
effects, without losing sight of the linkages between different locations.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes the dynamic spatial model of Desmet et
al. (2018), with the difference that the amount of land is time-dependent due to flooding. Section 3 explains how
to calibrate and simulate the model, and discusses the different flooding scenarios. Sections 4 and 5 present the
quantitative results at the global and the local level, respectively. Section 6 concludes.


2      A Dynamic Spatial Model
Our dynamic spatial model of the economy follows that of Desmet et al. (2018), with two differences. First,
because of future flooding, the amount of available land in each location will be time-dependent. Second, there is
uncertainty about the future global and local sea-level rise. When presenting the model, we do so for one particular
path of sea-level rise. In the simulations, we will solve the model for many different paths, so we can analyze the
uncertainty faced by the world economy as it moves forward. As we will make clear below, individual and firm
decisions are directly affected by the realized path, but not by the uncertainty around the severity of the realized
flooding scenario.


2.1        Endowments and preferences
The world economy occupies a two-dimensional surface S, where a location is defined as a point r ∈ S. The
surface S is partitioned into C countries. Location r has land density Ht (r) which is time-dependent because
of sea-level rise. There are L̄ agents in the world economy, each supplying one unit of labor.3 An agent derives
utility from local amenities and from the consumption of a set of differentiated products. Utility is further affected
by an agent’s idiosyncratic locational preferences and by the moving costs from having resided in different places
in the past. More precisely, the period utility of agent i who resides in r in period t and who lived in locations
    3 We keep total world population fixed throughout. Hence, our model has implications about population shares rather than popu-
lation counts.

take the form at (r) = a (r) Lt (r) , where a (r) can be thought of as a location’s exogenous amenity, and Lt (r)
represents the negative effect of population per land, Lt (r) , on amenities. A higher value of λ means more
congestion from amenities; this acts as a geographic dispersion force. A greater value of Ω implies more dispersion
in agents’ tastes across locations; this acts as a second geographic dispersion force. An agent earns income from
work, wt (r) , and from the local ownership of land, Rt (r) /Lt (r).
    We assume that the mobility cost of moving from r to s is the product of an origin-specific cost, m1 (r), and a
destination-specific cost, m2 (s). In addition, we also assume that staying in the same location is costless. Taken
together, this means that m (r, s) = m1 (r) m2 (s) and m (r, r) = 1 for all r, s ∈ S. Because m (r, r) = 1 implies
that m2 (r) = m1 (r)−1 , the permanent utility flow cost of entering a location is compensated by a permanent
utility flow benefit when leaving that location. As a result, agents only pay the flow cost of having entered s while
residing in s. For example, if an agent migrates from Mexico to the U.S., and later returns to Mexico or moves to
a third country, she only pays the utility flow cost of having entered the U.S. while living in the U.S. As shown
by Desmet et al. (2018), this implies that an agent’s dynamic location decision simplifies to a sequence of static
decisions. This formulation is what ultimately makes the model computationally tractable.

where η (r, s) is such that S η (r, s) dr = 1. This specification implies that the average draw is increasing in
population density, past innovation, and past productivity in the own location and in the rest of the economy. The
positive effect of population density on the average draw introduces a second agglomeration force. Given that there
is more scope for this effect when there is greater dispersion in draws across locations, this agglomeration force is
increasing in α/θ. The importance of past innovation introduces inter-temporal spillovers, and guarantees that the
economy does not stagnate in the long run. In addition to the two static agglomeration forces mentioned before,
these inter-temporal spillovers introduce an additional dynamic agglomeration force. High-density locations that
have innovated in the past continue to be productive today. This attracts more people, increases market size, and
so makes them good places to continue innovating today. The role of past productivity in the rest of the economy in
determining a location’s average draw ensures that this dynamic agglomeration force does not lead the economy to
concentrate over time in one place. As such, the dynamic agglomeration force will be increasing in γ 1 /(ξ(1 − γ 2 )).
    Productivity draws are correlated across space, with that correlation going to one when the distance goes to
zero. This, together with the fact that the cost of innovation is per unit of land, implies that in any small interval
there is a continuum of firms that compete in prices. These firms bid for land to the point of making zero profits
net of the fixed innovation cost. To the extent that innovating allows firms to offer a higher bid for land in a
particular location, firms will innovate. Our specification of technology in equation (3) implies that any innovation
in location r in period t becomes available to all potential entrants in location r in period t + 1. As in Desmet and
Rossi-Hansberg (2014), the firm’s dynamic innovation decision therefore simplifies to a sequence of static decisions.
Hence, after learning their common local productivity draw, a potential firm in r maximizes current profits,

where pω t (r, r) is the price charged by the firm of a good sold at r. If we denote the iceberg cost of transporting
a good from r to s by ς (s, r) ≥ 1, then the price of a good ω, produced in r and sold in s can be written as
pω            ω
 t (s, r) = pt (r, r) ς (s, r).



2.3    Prices, export shares and trade balance
                                                                                                                ω
Because firms are subject to perfect competition, it is easy to see that in any r ∈ S we have Lω   t (r) and φt (r)
                                                                                               ω
being identical across goods ω. That is, if one of the goods gets a better productivity draw, zt (r), it will simply
sell at a proportionately lower price pω
                                       t (r, r), leaving the maximization problem above unchanged. This allows us
to write the price of a good produced at r and sold at s as
                          µ  1−µ                             (1−µ)− γξ1

where the second equality defines mct (r) implicitly. The expression (4) is similar to the one in Eaton and Kortum
(2002): the price is inversely proportional to ztω (r) and proportional to a term that captures the marginal input
cost. Importantly, that marginal input cost term is exogenous from the point of view of the individual firm, so
that productivity draws affect prices without changing the input cost.
   This result allows us to apply many of the results of Eaton and Kortum (2002). In particular, the probability




                                                                    6

2.4    Equilibrium: existence and uniqueness
The conditions above define a dynamic competitive equilibrium of this economy that can be reduced to a system
of equations that determines wages, employment levels, and utility in all locations. In particular, for any t and for
all r ∈ S, given a (·), τ t (·), Lt−1 (·), ς (·, ·), m (·, ·) and Ht (·), the model determines the equilibrium wage, wt (·),
population density, Lt (·), and utility, ut (·) . Desmet et al. (2018) show that a dynamic competitive equilibrium
exists and is unique if
                                                     α γ1
                                                       +       < λ + 1 − µ + Ω.                                         (6)
                                                     θ      ξ
This condition essentially states that the static agglomeration forces must be less strong than congestion forces.
The left-hand side consists of agglomeration forces from getting better draws in more dense places (α/θ), and
from spreading the innovation cost over more units in more dense places (γ 1 /ξ). The right-hand side consists
of congestion from amenities (λ), land (1 − µ) and taste heterogeneity (Ω). The intuition for this condition is
that if congestion is stronger than agglomeration, we get rid of possible multiplicities common to many economic
geography models.


2.5    Balanced growth path
In a balanced growth path (BGP) the spatial distribution of employment is constant and all locations grow at the
same rate. Desmet et al. (2018) show that a unique balanced growth path exists if

                                            α γ1        γ1
                                              +   +              ≤ λ + 1 − µ + Ω.                                       (7)
                                            θ   ξ   [1 − γ 2 ] ξ

This condition is similar, but stronger, than the condition for uniqueness. In particular, the left-hand side now
includes an extra term reflecting the dynamic part of agglomeration economies. If dynamic agglomeration forces
are too strong, it leads the economy to eventually concentrate in one location. For example, if 1 − γ 2 = 0, the
above condition (7) no longer holds. Innovations cease to diffuse to the rest of the economy, and the economy
would increasingly concentrate in the most productive location.
    In all simulations presented below, conditions (6) and (7) are always satisfied. Because the current calibrated
world economy is not at the balanced growth path, its spatial distribution changes over time, even in the absence



                                                                     7
of flooding. During this transition to the balanced growth path, the world growth rate also varies over time. Of
course, once we add flooding, the dynamics of the world economy also varies due to the progressive inundation of
some of the available land.


3     Quantification, Calibration and Flooding Scenarios
3.1     Data and calibration
We discretize the world into 64,800 1◦ × 1◦ cells. Structural parameter values are partly taken from the literature
and partly estimated from data. Throughout, we use the parameters of the baseline simulation in Desmet et al.
(2018). For the year 2000, we use data on the geographic distribution of population and output per worker from
the G-Econ 4.0 database developed by Nordhaus et al. (2006) to invert the model and recover local productivity
measures.
     We also need estimates of amenities for all grid cells. In a world with perfect mobility, it is enough to have
information on population and productivity to get such estimates: locations with low productivity but large
populations must have good amenities. However, when mobility is limited, those same low-productivity, high-
density locations might also be low-utility places that are hard to leave because of high migration costs. In a world
with restricted mobility, we therefore need data on utility, as well as population and productivity, to estimate local
amenities. To that end, we use country-level survey data on subjective well-being from the Gallup World Poll
(Gallup, 2012).4 Subjective well-being, measured on a scale from 0 to 10, where 0 represents the worst possible
life and 10 the best possible life, has been shown to be an adequate measure of welfare (Deaton and Stone, 2013).
     To simulate the model, we also need information on mobility and transport costs. We use Gabriel Peyre’s Fast
Marching Toolbox for Matlab to calculate optimal transport routes between locations given the costs of crossing
each grid cell. These costs are determined by a variety of attributes, including whether the cell is covered by water
and whether it has a river, a railroad or a highway.5 In addition, we estimate the cost of migrating in and out of
each location so that the model matches the evolution of population between 2000 and 2005 exactly. The intuition
is simple: if a location experiences a large relative increase in productivity but its relative population level does
not change much, it must have high barriers to immigration.


3.2     Simulation
Once we have estimates for all the parameters, the migration and trade costs, and the initial distributions of
technology, amenities and land, we can simulate the model forward for the years 2000 to 2200. Every period we
update the spatial distribution of technology given local innovations, we account for the amount of land lost to
flooding, and then solve for the distribution of population and welfare. As shown by Desmet et al. (2018), the
model can be solved by a simple iterative procedure.
  4 Because the data are at the country level, there are no utility differences across locations within countries in the initial period.

Such utility differences do arise in future periods.

                                                                   8
3.3     Flooding scenarios
To incorporate the flooding of land in every period, we rely on probabilistic sea-level rise (SLR) projections by
Kopp et al. (2014) for the global mean and for local relative SLR at 1,091 tide-gauge sites around the world from
2000 to 2200. Note that sea level does not change uniformly across space, due to differences in, among others, ocean
dynamics and tectonics. For example, because of high subsidence, Galveston, Texas, is predicted to experience
SLR close to double the average rate, whereas because of solid earth responses to regional glacial mass loss, Juneau,
Alaska, is predicted to experience a drop in sea level.6
    These projections are conditional upon three alternative pathways of future greenhouse gas concentrations,
known as Representative Concentration Pathways (RCPs) 8.5, 4.5, and 2.6 (Van Vuuren et al, 2011). RCP 8.5 is
a high-emissions pathway, consistent with fossil-fuel-intensive economic growth, leading to CO2 concentrations of
540 ppm in 2050, 936 ppm in 2100, and 1830 ppm in 2200 (compared to 278 ppm in 1750 and 400 ppm in 2015).
RCP 4.5 is a moderate-emissions pathway, leading to CO2 concentrations of 487 ppm in 2050, rising to 538 ppm in
2100 and then stabilizing at 543 ppm. RCP 2.6 is a low-emissions pathway, consistent with the aspirational goals
laid out in the Paris Agreement, in which atmospheric CO2 concentrations peak at 443 ppm in 2050 and decline
to 421 ppm in 2100 and 384 ppm in 2200.
    For each RCP, Kopp et al. (2014) generate 10,000 Monte Carlo samples to calculate a joint probability
distribution of global and local relative SLR at 1,091 tide-gauge sites around the globe. For our analysis, we take
the 10,000 paths in the year 2100, divide them into 40 equally-sized 2.5 percentile bins based on the global sea-level
rise implied by them, and then take a random path from each one of the 40 bins.
    To compute how much land gets flooded, for each grid cell we combine the estimated SLR with topographic data.
To that end, we primarily employ Climate Central’s CoastalDEM (Kulp and Strauss, 2018), a near-global elevation
model based on NASA’s SRTM (NASA, 2015). CoastalDEM uses an artificial neural network to substantially
reduce the vertical error present in SRTM, caused by factors such as vegetation density, population density, and
random noise. This dataset has coverage between latitudes 60N and 56S and has a horizontal resolution of 1
arcsecond. At higher latitudes, we employ JAXA’s ALOS World 3D 30m mesh (AW3D30) (Tadono et al., 2016),
which has full global coverage and equivalent horizontal resolution, but contains vertical error comparable to SRTM
(Hu, Peng, Hou and Shan, 2017; Santillan and Makinano-Santillan, 2016). In Appendix C we assess the sensitivity
of our results to the use of AW3D30, alone.
    We convert elevations to reference local mean higher high water levels (MHHW), corresponding roughly to local
high tide lines, to be used as the baseline for adding sea level projections and then estimating inundated land. We
begin with the global mean sea level (GMSL) model MSS CNES-CLS15 (Aviso, 2015), based on TOPEX/Poseidon
satellite measurements from 1993 to 2012, vertically referenced to the GLAS ellipsoid (M SLGLAS ). Using the
tidal model TPX08 (Egbert, Bennett and Foreman, 1994), Mark Merrifield (University of Hawaii) developed and
provided us MHHW deviations from GMSL, which we add to M SLGLAS to compute a global MHHW surface
relative to the ellipsoid. We convert MHHW, CoastalDEM, and AW3D30 to a common vertical datum using
NOAA’s VDatum tool (Parker et al., 2003) version 3.7, so that we may compute our final elevation map, expressing
   6 These projections are fairly consistent with those of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report

(Church et al., 2013). They do not include recent scientific findings regarding modes of Antarctic ice sheet instability, which are likely
to revise upward estimates of GMSL rise after 2050, particularly under high-emissions scenarios (e.g, DeConto and Pollard, 2016).
Thus, the resulting numerical estimates are most likely biased low. Appendix C considers an alternative set of projections (DP16
projections of Kopp et al, 2017) that incorporate a physical model allowing for a relatively unstable Antarctic ice sheet. This particular
model is at the high end of literature projections; thus the two sets of projections taken together can be viewed as roughly bounding
the space of plausible sea level PDFs.



                                                                    9
elevation as height above local MHHW.
    For each time period t and each 1◦ by 1◦ grid cell r, we take the corresponding water height from each of
the 40 stratified GSML paths to determine Ht (r), the proportion of land in the grid cell that is not inundated.
Low-lying regions isolated from the ocean by high ridges are removed using connected components analysis and
are not included in these calculations.


4     Global Effects
In this section we examine the global effects of sea-level rise, focusing on real GDP and welfare losses, as well as
on the displacement of population. We start by showing time paths of these effects, and then estimate the present
discounted value of future losses. Given the uncertainty about sea-level rise, all our estimates come accompanied
by credible intervals. The key contribution of our model is to incorporate the spatial dynamic reaction of the world
economy to future flooding. To quantify how this form of economic adaptation matters for our results, we compare
our findings with more naive models that do not account for this type of adjustment.


4.1     Time paths of global losses and population displacement
Figure 1(a) shows 40 stratified, random paths of GMSL rise over the next 200 years under the moderate-emissions
Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 4.5. It also depicts the mean, the median and the 20-80% band of
the RCP 4.5 probability distribution of Kopp et al. (2014). The median shows GMSL rise of ∼1.3 meter between
2000 and 2200, with a 20 – 80% band going from 0.7 to 1.8 meters. Figure 1(b) displays the percentage of real
GDP per capita that is lost due to flooding. The mean loss peaks at 0.47% of real GDP in the year 2133, and then
declines, reaching a loss of ∼0.11% by 2200. This non-monotonicity is due to the dynamics of how the world adjusts
to coastal flooding. As people are forced to move out of flooded areas, some economic clusters get destroyed, but
others are reinforced and new ones emerge. Over time the greater geographic concentration of people increases the
dynamic incentives to innovate, thus partly compensating the direct negative impact of flooding. Uncertainty in
SLR implies uncertainty in its economic effects. Taking a 95% credible interval,7 the effect on real GDP/capita in
the year 2200 ranges from ∼ − 0.24% to ∼ + 0.49%. Figure 1(c) and Table 1 show the share of the world population
displaced by flooding. The mean share displaced increases monotonically over time and reaches 0.58% in 2100
and 1.46% in 2200 under RCP 4.5 (Table 1). In the more extreme emissions scenario RCP 8.5, the mean share of
population displaced rises to 2.25% in 2200.
    Figure 1(d) depicts average welfare losses across individuals in the world over the next 200 years for the different
sea-level paths. Losses peak at ∼0.6% in the second half of the twenty-second century, and then decline to ∼0.4%
in 2200, with a 95% credible interval between -0.2% and 0.9%. The welfare losses are slightly larger than the
real GDP losses. Coastal flooding makes people move to areas with less attractive amenities, either because they
relocate to inland places with worse inherent amenities or because they relocate to more crowded places where
amenities suffer from greater congestion.
   7 Given that we use 40 paths, we take the interval between the second largest and the second smallest outcome. We refer to this as

a credible interval, since the procedure used to generate the SLR probability distribution in Kopp et al. (2014) is Bayesian.

4.2     Present discounted value of future losses
In addition to examining the time series of losses, we also compute the expected present discounted value of future
losses. All present-value calculations reflect the period 2000 to 2200 for the three different emissions pathways.
Using a 4% annual discount rate, Table 2 reports how much higher the present discounted value of real GDP is
under no flooding relative to the mean under flooding (see Appendix B for alternative discount rates).8 For the
moderate-emissions RCP 4.5, the expected present-value loss of world real GDP per capita due to flooding is 0.19%
(95% credible interval of 0.07% – 0.37%). Across scenarios, the expected present-value losses range from 0.16%
(95% credible interval of 0.07% – 0.33%) under RCP 2.6 to 0.25% (0.12% – 0.44%) under RCP 8.5. Turning to
welfare, Table 2 also reports that the present discounted mean loss in the moderate-emissions pathway RCP 4.5
amounts to 0.24% (95% credible interval of 0.08% – 0.45%) over the period 2000 to 2200, slightly higher than the
loss in real GDP. Under the more extreme RCP 8.5, mean losses increase to 0.31% (0.14% – 0.55%).

4.3     Heterogeneity in GMSL rise
To further analyze the impact of flooding, Figure 2(a) plots the relationship between GMSL rise in 2100 and the
present discounted value of world real GDP per capita for each of the 40 stratified random paths and three RCPs.
The slope is around 0.4: the present-value of real world GDP per capita between 2000 and 2200 drops by about
0.4% per 1m GMSL rise in 2100. This relation appears to be similar under RCP 2.6, 4.5 and 8.5. Figure 2(b) plots
a similar graph for the share of the world population in 2100 that is displaced by flooding. The slope is around 1.2,
indicating that a 1m GMSL rise in 2100 implies a displacement of around 1.2% of the world population in 2100.
    Figure 2 also shows that GMSL rise in 2100 is not a full description of the entire dynamics of an SLR path, nor
of its local variation. Outcomes with a similar GMSL rise in 2100 can generate different losses. For example, for
a GMSL rise of 0.8m, variation in the geography and timing of flooding can generate GDP losses of between 0.2%
and 0.3%. That, is depending on the spatial and temporal characteristics of the path we can have effects that are
50% larger. The variation of the fraction of displaced population for a given GMSL rise is even larger. An increase
of 0.8m in GMSL can yield displaced populations that go from 0.5% to 1.0%; the displaced population estimates

values are not bounded.

4.4                                            The importance of economic adaptation
Compared to the existing literature, an essential contribution of our model is that it takes into account economic
adaptation: the dynamic and spatial reaction of the economy to flooding. For example, if rising sea-level leads
to Ho Chi Minh City becoming inundated, its population will move elsewhere. This will change the geographic
distribution of population, thus affecting the incentives for innovation in different locations. As a result, it will put
the economy on a different dynamic spatial path.
    To assess the importance of incorporating the dynamic spatial reaction of the economy, we compare the quan-
titative predictions of our model to the predictions of alternative evaluations that abstract partially or completely
from economic adaptation. To that end, we consider a number of simplified assessments of sea-level rise. A first
assessment estimates the losses of flooding, without taking into account the possibility of moving. That is, for each
year t, we take our model’s predictions in the absence of flooding, and compute which fraction of world population,
GDP and world welfare gets flooded using the median GMSL rise projection under RCP 4.5 for that year. We
refer to the population that lives in these regions as “flooded” and compare it to the population displaced in our
baseline evaluation. Because this approach does not allow people to move when faced with flooding, in Figure 3
we refer to it as the “no adaptation (naive)” model.
    As can be seen in Figure 3(b), the percentage of population that gets “flooded” in 2200 increases to ∼ 1.65%
from a fraction of displaced population in our baseline case of ∼ 1.45%.9 The effect on real GDP losses for the
year 2200 is substantially larger, increasing from 0.11% in the benchmark model to ∼ 4.5% in the no adaptation
naive model (Figure 3(a)). This much larger loss is due to two effects that are ignored in the naive model. First,
when locations become permanently inundated, people can generally move, albeit at a cost. As a result, the loss in
real GDP in flooded coastal regions is (partly) compensated by the gain in real GDP in other non-flooded inland
   9 These figures are of the same order of magnitude as others estimated in the literature. For example, Nicholls et al. (2006) report

estimates of between 0.7% and 1.5% of additional world population suffering from flooding by 2080.


                                                                                                                                13

regions. To be clear, in our model we are not assuming people can freely move when flooding occurs (Recall that
we are using migration costs between locations as estimated from observed changes in population between 2000
and 2005.) The difference with the naive model is simply that we are not assuming such migration costs are always
and everywhere infinite. Second, when people move to other places, this leads to growing spatial concentration in
these places, and hence to greater incentives to innovate in these newly emerging clusters. Both effects help to
mitigate the negative effect of sea-level rise. Hence, ignoring these effects leads to much greater estimated losses
from flooding.
    To understand the differential impact of both effects, we consider a second alternative evaluation where we
allow people to move when faced with permanent inundation, but we do not allow this to affect firms’ incentives
to innovate. That is, location-specific productivity is not affected by people moving due to flooding, but we do
take into account that people who move away from flooded areas add to real GDP in the places where they settle.
In Figure 3 we refer to this case as the “no adaptation (static equilibrium)”. In this alternative setup, loss in
real GDP in 2200 is around 1.5%. As expected, this loss is greater than in the full-blown model that incorporates


                                                         14
changes in the incentives to innovate, but less than in the naive model that does not allow people to move.
    To complete our comparison, we contrast our findings to a third alternative evaluation where we take today’s
geographic distribution of economic activity and keep it unchanged over time. This is the simplest possible form
of evaluation, and is akin to the accounting exercise in Dasgupta et al. (2007). We simply use the GMSL rise
projection for each year t, and estimate which part of real GDP is lost and which part of the population is flooded,
based on today’s data. In Figure 3 we refer to this case as the “no adaptation (fixed population)” model. Compared
to the naive model, where losses are also calculated without taking into account people’s reallocation as a result of
flooding but the economy evolves spatially over time, we find smaller losses in real GDP and population “flooded”.
This is consistent with the spatial dynamic model predicting coastal areas becoming relatively more productive
over time, and harboring an ever greater share of world population.
    From these comparisons we conclude that incorporating the spatial dynamic adjustment of the economy is key
to quantitatively assessing the economic impact of sea-level rise. In spite of migration being costly, the possibility
of moving and the dynamic effects of the spatial reallocation of economic activity lead to a significant decrease in
the real GDP loss from flooding. We see a similar, though somewhat smaller, mitigating effect on welfare losses
(Figure 3(c)). However, even for welfare the effect of flooding is more than five times larger in the naive evaluation
than in our baseline. These results also imply that the cost of coastal flooding depends crucially on the size of
migration costs. Higher costs due to, for example, more restrictive migration laws would increase the cost of coastal
flooding significantly.


5     Local, Country and City Effects
The global economic effects of SLR mask heterogeneous local effects. Some regions suffer dramatically from
inundation, while others experience economic gains. When presenting real output and welfare outcomes at the
local level, we face the decision whether to focus on total local real GDP and welfare, which are directly affected
by the number of people in a given region, or on per capita outcomes, which are not. The former is helpful to
illustrate that some areas not only experience a decline in the average well-being of their residents, but also become
relatively empty by losing population. In what follows we will discuss both total and per capita outcomes. We
analyze these effects at the cell level, the country level and the city level.


5.1    Cell-level effects
Figure 4 displays a world map of the mean loss in total real GDP across realizations in the year 2200. As expected,
coastal areas suffer significant losses across the globe, but the effects are unevenly distributed. The negative effects
tend to be larger in Southeast Asia and Northwest Europe, while they are more contained on the Pacific coast of the
Americas. Flooding also affects areas that are not directly impacted by the sea-level rise. In particular, in the year
2200, inland regions tend to gain around 1.5% of GDP. These results underscore the importance of our spatially
disaggregated general equilibrium analysis: focusing only on flooded areas would ignore this redistribution. In
present discounted value terms, around 20% of coastal cells lose. In contrast, almost all inland cells gain (see
Figure 5(a), which presents the CDF of the present discounted value of real GDP losses for coastal and inland
cells).

    A map that depicts for each grid cell the flooding-induced percentage loss in population in the year 2200 looks
very similar to Figure 4. Not surprisingly, the areas with the greatest share of displaced population are the same
as those that lose most in terms of real GDP. In the year 2200 close to 20% of all coastal cells lose population (see
Figure 5(b), which depicts the CDF of 2200 population losses in coastal and inland cells).


5.2    Country-level effects
We further illustrate our findings by looking at the fate of some particular countries. Appendix A presents, as
examples, the evolution of real GDP and welfare for China and the U.S. The figures show that China and the
U.S. experience a similar evolution of welfare costs but the losses in GDP per capita are larger and are much
more persistent in China. In Table A1 in Appendix A, we also present losses in real GDP, welfare and population
for most countries in the world. For example, China’s loss in real GDP per capita due to permanent inundation
peaks in 2121 at 0.94%. For the U.S. the PDV of real GDP losses amounts to 0.03% with a population loss that

peaks in 2021 at 0.01%. Another interesting case is the Netherlands.10 It loses more from flooding than most other
countries, with total real GDP declining 0.41% and the welfare in the country dropping 1.05% in present discounted
value terms. The country loses 3.0% of its population in 2200, and as a result economic activity declines.


5.3               City-level effects
Coastal flooding is bound to have an important effect on many of the world’s largest cities. Table 3 reports the
estimated effect of flooding on population and real GDP in a sample of 25 large coastal metropolitan areas in the
year 2200. We use the built-up area in 2016 and assign the proportion of the cells covered by this area to the
metropolitan area for the entire 200-year period. For our estimation, we assume that the share of land lost to
flooding in a city is the same as the share of land lost to flooding in the cells that overlap the city. Compared to
a world without flooding, Ho Chin Minh City is predicted to lose 40.5% of its area, 21.8% of its population, and
21.5% of its real GDP. Other metropolitan areas that stand to lose an important share of their population are
Amsterdam, Bangkok, Miami, Shanghai and Tianjin. The corresponding real GDP losses are commensurate. The
uncertainty of the effects is often substantial. For example, Miami is projected to lose between 0.5% and 51.1% of
its population when using a 95% credible interval. Appendix C Table C1 reports estimates for alternative sea-level
rise projections and alternative elevation maps.


6           Conclusion
Permanent coastal inundation is an important consequence of anthropogenic climate change. Evaluating the
economic consequences of any climate-related phenomenon raises the challenge of accurately accounting for the
dynamic spatial adjustment of the economy and the uncertainty inherent in environmental projections. To address
  10 In our simulations the Netherlands inundates immediately since we do not consider existing dikes or other forms of protection

against inundation. As mentioned before, the numbers we find should be compared with cost estimates of mitigation and other forms
of adaptation.

this challenge, this paper combines recently developed economic modeling with probabilistic flooding projections
for different emissions pathways.
    The results indicate that the economic cost of coastal flooding is shaped by spatial dynamics. Under RCP 4.5,
we estimate that sea-level rise will induce an average decline in real GDP of 0.19% (with 95% credible interval 0.07
– 0.37%) and an average drop in welfare of 0.24% (with 95% credible interval 0.08 – 0.45%). In some countries, the
effects are more than an order of magnitude larger, with an estimated decline in real GDP of 7.60% in Vietnam,
9.37% in Thailand and 5.37% in Bangladesh. In terms of population, in the year 2200 flooding is predicted to
displace an average of 1.46% of world population (with a credible interval 0.15 – 3.54%). At a national level,
population displacement in the year 2200 is 14.60% in Vietnam, 2.28% in Thailand and 12.38% in Bangladesh.
    The magnitude of our findings depends crucially on the dynamic spatial adjustment of the economy to coastal
flooding. When faced with rising sea-level, people in our model have the possibility of moving to higher ground,
albeit at a cost. As this occurs, the destruction of existing economic clusters is at least partly compensated by
the emergence of new clusters of economic activity. The higher concentration of people in interior regions in turn
enhances the incentives of local firms to innovate. When ignoring these mitigating factors, the expected real GDP
loss is substantially larger. If people faced insurmountable barriers to moving when experiencing coastal flooding,
the real GDP loss would be around 4.5% in the year 2200, compared to 0.11% in our model.
    Given the complexity of the issue at hand, our model necessarily leaves out some important aspects. First,
although we account for the uncertainty in flooding scenarios, and we demonstrate the robustness of our evaluation
to a variety of economic parameters, our evaluation does not include potential measurement error in economic
variables or model misspecification. Second, we do not account for feedback loops between economic outcomes and
flooding through changed emissions pathways. Third, nonlinear effects beyond those coming from agglomeration



                                                                            18
economies may aggravate the effect of flooding. Examples include partial flooding leading to contamination of
freshwater supplies and the possibility of political stress and violent conflict. Fourth, we only analyze the impact
of permanent, albeit gradual, inundation and not temporary flooding caused by extreme weather events. Coastal
locations will likely experience increasingly frequent flooding before they fall below the high tide line, causing
migration and its ensuing economic impacts to occur faster than modeled here. Finally, and conversely, we do
not model efforts to mitigate flooding using a variety of methods such as barriers and dikes, which might delay
migration. Future work should focus on extending our research in these directions in order to improve further our
estimates of the economic consequences of coastal flooding.

Appendix
A. Country Effects
Figure A1, Panels a and b, displays the losses in real GDP per capita and welfare in China. These effects are in
per capita terms, and hence measure the impact on an individual resident. The mean loss in real GDP per capita
due to flooding peaks at 0.94% in the year 2121, and declines thereafter. Figure A1, Panels c and d, displays the
behavior of real GDP per capita and welfare in the U.S. over the next 200 years. The overall effects are small. As
the country receives flooding refugees from other countries, the spatial concentration of economic activity increases,
leading to more innovation and higher GDP per capita in the long run. The welfare effects are negative though,
because of the crowding out of amenities. Given the size of the country, and the high internal mobility, there is
enough scope for economic adaptation.
    Table A1 presents the total real GDP, total welfare, and total population changes that result from flooding, as
well as the peak losses in real GDP per capita and total population for all countries in our analysis. We here limit
ourselves to describing the results for a few countries. In PDV terms, calculated over the period 2000 to 2200,
Vietnam’s total GDP drops by 7.60% because of flooding. This negative effect is due not only to the losses in
real GDP per capita, but also to Vietnam’s drop in total population relative to other countries. In the year 2200
Vietnam’s population is 14.60% lower, compared to a world without flooding. A contrasting case is the Democratic
Republic of the Congo (DRC). There the peak per capita income losses are negligible given that the country is
not directly affected by flooding. However, it attracts migration from flooded areas, leading to an increase in
population by around 1.79% in 2200. These gains in population imply that both total output and the total utility
generated in the country increase.


B. Parameter Robustness
The quantitative results depend on the parameter values governing the forces of the economic model. These
parameters were chosen as in the benchmark scenario in Desmet, Nagy and Rossi-Hansberg (2018). As explained
before, that paper estimates the parameters of the model using a variety of data and finds that the resulting
economic model is successful in matching other, non-targeted, empirical moments. Still, there is uncertainty about
the true value of these parameters. Hence, we conduct a number of robustness checks, related to the strength of
production externalities, the importance of congestion costs, the intensity of technological diffusion across space,
and the degree at which the future is discounted. In all of them we keep the same selection of the 40 sea level
paths for RCP 4.5. The results, reported in Table B1, demonstrate that our evaluation of the cost of permanent
inundation is quite robust to changes in these parameters.

No production externalities. In a first robustness check, we eliminate static production externalities. That is, we
no longer assume that local density has a direct positive effect on local productivity. Since this affects the spatial
concentration of economic activity both under the flooding and the non-flooding scenarios, we would probably
expect the effect of inundation on real income and welfare not to change much. There is one subtle change
that might potentially worsen the negative impact of flooding though. As we discussed before, in a world with
production externalities, the greater geographic concentration that comes with sea-level rise partly compensates the
direct negative impact of flooding on real income. By eliminating static production externalities, this mitigating
effect is no longer present. However, our analysis shows that this change is quantitatively negligible: both the real


                                                         23
income effects and the welfare effects of flooding are essentially left unchanged compared to the benchmark case.
Larger congestion costs. In a second robustness check, we increase the congestion parameter by 50%. That is, we
increase the elasticity of amenities to population density by one-half, implying that local amenities suffer more from
congestion than before. This reduces the incentives for people to geographically concentrate. As in the previous
robustness check, the mitigating effect of the increased spatial concentration due to flooding weakens. On the
other hand, higher congestion in amenities implies that less people choose to live in coastal regions, hence reducing
the negative impact of coastal flooding. The overall effect on real GDP per capita is very slight: the negative
effect drops from 0.19% to 0.18%. The increase in congestion costs also has a direct impact on the utility that
people derive from amenities. As a result, the greater geographic concentration that comes from land loss implies
a somewhat larger negative welfare effect from flooding: in present discounted value terms, it increases from 0.24%
in the benchmark to 0.29% when the congestion parameter is 50% larger.
Stronger spatial diffusion of technology. In a third robustness check, we increase the parameter that determines
the strength of spatial technology diffusion by 20%. This has two effects: on the one hand, it gives places better
access to best-practice technology, and on the other hand, it reduces the incentive to agglomerate. How does this
affect the losses from flooding? The rise in the sea level forces economic activity to move out of some previously
highly productive places. However, if other locations have easier access to best-practice technology through spatial
diffusion, that loss is less pronounced. As a result, in present discounted value terms, the loss in real GDP drops
slightly from 0.19% in the benchmark to 0.17% when the spatial diffusion of technology is stronger. The welfare
effects of flooding remain virtually unchanged.
Lower discount rate. In a fourth robustness check, we lower the discount rate from 4% to 3%. This is the central
discount rate used by the U.S. government when calculating the social cost of carbon. This parameter change
increases the importance of future years in our present discounted value calculations. Giving more weight to later
years slightly increases the losses, from 0.19% to 0.26% for real GDP and from 0.24% to 0.34% for welfare.
Ramsey discounting. In a fifth robustness check, we use time-varying Ramsey discounting. The Ramsey equation is
often used in cost-benefit analysis, and relates the discount rate to the growth rate of the economy. For example, a
future benefit is discounted more in a fast-growing economy than in a slow-growing economy, because of diminishing
marginal utility, and a future benefit is discounted less if there is more uncertainty about future growth if agents are
risk averse. As a result, in a world where future growth rates may be changing over time, the discount rate will be
time-varying. To generate Ramsey discount rates for the next 200 years, we take the predicted growth path of real
GDP in the no-flooding scenario, and plug this into equation (30) in Weitzman (2012), together with a coefficient
of relative risk aversion of 2 and a rate of pure time preference of zero (so as not to favor any particular generation
in the calculation of PDVs). In the baseline quantification, our model predicts that growth rates first increase
and then decline slowly to their balanced growth level, so discount rates exhibit a similar pattern. With Ramsey
discounting, the predicted loss in real GDP decreases from 0.19% to 0.13%, whereas the welfare loss decreases from
0.24% to 0.14%.


C. Alternative Datasets on Sea-Level Rise Projections and Elevation
In this section we compare how our findings change when using alternative datasets on elevation and sea-level
rise projections. For elevation, we consider JAXA’s ALOS World 3D 30m mesh (AW3D30) for the entire globe.
For sea-level rise projections we consider DP16 (Kopp et al., 2017). These replace the Antarctic projections

                                                          24
of K14 (Kopp et al., 2014), which are based on the ‘likely’ range assessment of Church et al. (2013) and the
structured expert judgement of Bamber and Aspinall (2013), with ensembles of Antarctic simulations developed
with a physical model, as described by DeConto and Pollard (2016). This model incorporates multiple modes of
Antarctic instability involving ice shelves and ice cliffs, which leads to more rapid mass loss from the Antarctic ice
sheet in the second half of this century and beyond, particularly under higher emissions scenarios.
    Table C1 reports our findings for GDP and welfare losses, as well as for the share of population that gets
displaced by flooding. When using DP16, real GDP losses rise to 0.32% in present discounted value terms,
compared to 0.19% in our benchmark case. We see a similar pattern for welfare losses, which increase from 0.24%
in the benchmark to 0.39%. The percentage of the population displaced by flooding in 2200 is also higher: 3.25%
of the world’s population, compared to 1.46% in the benchmark case. The effects of flooding are larger in Kopp
et al. (2017) because the sea-level rise projections include a less stable Antarctic ice sheet, and thus tend toward
faster sea-level rise after 2050 (DeConto and Pollard, 2016).
    When using AW3D30 elevation data, the effects are smaller. Real GDP losses in present discounted value terms
drop to 0.07%. These alternative elevation data also generate smaller displacements of the world’s population:
0.46% in 2200. These smaller numbers are due to the higher positive vertical bias, compared to CoastalDEM. For
completeness, Table C1 also includes an additional robustness exercise where we simultaneously use DP16 for the
sea-level rise projections and AW3D30 for the elevation data.
    Figures C1 through C3 display the cell-level effect on real GDP in the year 2200 using the alternative flooding
projections and elevation data. The DP16 projections increase losses in coastal areas, whereas AW3D30 reduces
coastal losses. These findings are confirmed in Table C2 which reports population losses in 25 major coastal cities.
Using the benchmark K14 and CoastalDEM data, Miami loses 6.7% of its population. When using DP16 sea-level
rise projections that includes more rapid Antarctic ice sheet loss, Miami loses 49.8% of its population. In contrast,
when using AW3D30 elevation data which includes greater vertical bias, Miami experiences no losses.

             The geographic extent of metropolitan areas is defined as their built-up areas in 2016 and
             come from the Atlas of Urban Expansion (http://www.atlasofurbanexpansion.org/).
             Percentage loss refers to (nonflooding scenario / mean of flooding scenarios) -1, where the
             flooding scenarios are based on RCP 4.5. Caldulations assume that the share of a city's
             land flooded is the same as that of the 1º by 1º cells the city belongs to. K14 and DP16 refer
             to sea-level rise projections according to Kopp et al. (2014) and Kopp et al. (2017), whereas
             CoastalDEM and AW3D30 refer to digital elevation models from JAXA's ALOS World 3D
             30m mesh and Kulp and Strauss (2018). The benchmark in the paper corresponds to K14
             CoastalDEM.
