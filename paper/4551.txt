                                         ABSTRACT

       Existing studies of the impact of conviction on income and employment do not
consider life cycle issues. We postulate that conviction reduces access to career jobs offering
stable, long-term employment. Instead, conviction relegates offenders to spot market jobs,
which may have higher pay at the outset of the career but do not offer stable employment or
rapidly rising wages. Thus, first-time Conviction may increase the wages of young workers
while decreasing the wages of older workers. We test our theory with data on federal
offenders and find that first-time conviction has a positive and significant effect on income for
offenders under age 25 and an increasingly negative and significant impact for offenders over
age 30. These results imply that the present value of income lost as a result of conviction
varies over the life cycle, reaching a maximum in the middle of the career. We find that the
gains sought by these offenders follow similar profiles, suggesting that prospective offenders
are deterred by the possibility of lost future income. Because the discounted loss in future
income facing young offenders may be small, our results may provide part of an explanation
of youth crime.

       A growing literature indicates that arrest and conviction limit legal earning opportunities.

Recent studies find that the market penalty of lost income is large, both absolutely and in

comparison with fines and prison terms (Lott, 1992; Waldfogel, 1994a). Furthermore, the

adverse effects of arrest and conviction are at least somewhat persistent (Waldfogel, l994b;

Grogger, 1992). The large and growing involvement of urban youth in crime is thus alarming

not only because of the direct harm to victims but also because of the damage that young

offenders are doing to their own long-term economic prospects'. Many youths are choosing

criminal activity in the face of seemingly enormous market penalties.

       While recent studies of the stigmatizing effect of conviction and arrest consistently find

that contact with the criminal justice system increases job instabiit?, evidence of the effect of

conviction on income is mixed. Lou (1992) and Waldfogel (1994a) find that conviction reduces

income, while Nagin and Waldfogel (1992) find that conviction increases the income of young

offenders.

       Here we reconcile the seemingly contradictory findings on the impact of Conviction on

income with a theory, and new evidence, which may also help explain youth involvement in




    'See Freeman (1990), or Mauer (1990) for discussions of the involvement of minority youth
in crime.
   2Recent studies discussed in the text estimate conviction effects using longitudinal data.
These studies include Freeman (1990), Grogger (1992), Waldfogel (1994a), and Nagin and
Waldfogel (1992). A significant earlier literature attempted to measure the effect of
rehabilitation programs on economic opportunities using cross-sectional post-conviction data.
See, for example, Cook (1975) or Witte and Reid (1980). There is also small body of
experimental evidence on this subject (Boshier and Derek, 1974; Buikhuisen and Dijksterhaus,
1971; Schwartz and Skolnick, 1962). In these studies employers are presented with job
applications with and without reported criminal records. All of the studies find stigma effects.

crime. We postulate that conviction reduces access to "career jobs"--jobs that offer the prospect

of stable, long-term employment. Instead, conviction limits offenders' legal employment
opportunities to spot market jobs which may pay young workers more than career jobs but offer

little prospect of stable employment or rapidly rising wages. Based on human capital theory,

we argue that career jobs will have steeper wage trajectories than spot market jobs but will also

have lower starting wages. Consequently, conviction may raise wages if experienced early in

a worker's career but reduce wages if experienced later. Because the Nagin and Waldfogel

(1992) study is based on a cohort of young men just starting their work careers whereas the

results reported in Lou (1992) and Waldfogel (1994a) are based on a sample of generally older

workers, this "life cycle" theory reconciles the different prior findings.

       We test our theory by measuring conviction effects for federal fraud offenders of various

ages. We find that first-time conviction has a positive and significant effect on income for

offenders under age 25 and an increasingly negative and significant impact for offenders over

age 30. Subsequent convictions, by contrast, reduce income at all ages which, for reasons

described below, is also consistent with our theory. We recognize that the fraud offenders in

our data are an atypical group of offenders, so we examine limited available data on federal

larcenists, who are more like typical offenders. This analysis also supports our theory.

       Our results imply that the present value of income lost as a result of conviction varies

over the life cycle and, in particular, is a single-peaked function of age that reaches a maximum

in the middle of the career. If our results, based on convicted offenders, are applicable to

potential offenders, then this variation in the market penalty for conviction implies that the

deterrent threat of lost income facing individuals without criminal records is smaller for youth
                                                3
than for mid-career adults. This may provide part of the explanation for the disproportionate

involvement of youth in crime. Furthermore, if prospective offenders are deterred by the

possibility of lost income, then the age variation we find in the market penalty for conviction

implies that the criminal gain required to offset the risk of incurring this penalty will also have

a humped shape over the life cycle, all other things being equal. In accordance with this

prediction, we find that the gains sought by fraud and larceny offenders are single-peaked

functions of offender age and that the profiles of both market penalties and dollar gains peak at

about the same age.



                               II. Conviction and the Life Cycle

1. Conviction Effects

       Human capital theory (Becker, 1964) predicts rising wage trajectories and stable

employment in jobs where workers and employers jointly invest in firm-specific human capital.

Early in the career, the worker takes some of his compensation as training, so the money wage

is below the value of his marginal product. Wages rise over the course of the career as the

individual accumulates human capital and experiences a declining implicit reduction in take-home

pay to cover training costs. The joint investment of employee and employer in firm-specific

human capital also creates an incentive for maintaining a stable long-term employment

relationship. For this reason we term such jobs Ncareerw jobs.

       We postulate that individuals with criminal records will have reduced access to career

jobs. Employers providing career jobs will be reluctant to invest in individuals with criminal

records because such records signal that the individuals may be prone to stealing from the firm
                                               4
or harming customers or other employees. More generally, a criminal record signals that an

individual is untrustworthy. With reduced employment opportunities in the career job market,

individuals with criminal records will tend to be limited to employment in what we call spot

market jobs. In such jobs there is little joint investment in firm-specific human capital. Thus,

human capital theory suggests that spot market jobs will have flatter wage trajectories, and will

be more unstable, than career jobs. Wage trajectories will be flatter because of less investment

in human capital. They will be less stable because neither the employer nor the employee has

as much of a stake in the ongoing employment relationship.

         If conviction causes workers to move from steeply-sloped career wage profiles to less

steeply-sloped "spot market wage profiles, then the effect of conviction will vary depending on

when it occurs in the life cycle. Consider Figure 1. Career workers' wages follow the steeply-

sloped profile whereas the wage trajectory of workers in the spot market follows a less steeply-

sloped spot market trajectory. At some age t, the wage of individuals without criminal records

equals the spot wage available to convicted individuals3. By shifting workers from steeply-

sloped to flatter wage paths, conviction causes an immediate increase - but an ultimate reduction
-   in the wage of workers younger than age t and an immediate and long-term reduction in the

wage for workers over age t4.



     3While we have drawn the career profiles as monotonically increasing, we recognize that
human capital depreciation, as in Ben-Porath (1967), could cause our careerw profile to dip near
retirement.

    4Our argument that conviction relegates individuals to spot market jobs is reminiscent of
secondary labor market (SLM) theories (c.f., Gordon, 1975; Harrison, 1972). Our argument,
however, is fundamentally different. SLM theories argue that individuals are relegated to
working in poorly paying, insecure SLMs based on characteristics such as race and gender that
have no bearing on productivity. By contrast, we are arguing that conviction signals
                                                     5

2. Lost Income and Deterrence

        At any point in time (r), the total effect of conviction on income of an individual in the

career market is the discounted value of career wage income (ye) less spot wage income (y,).

Assuming retirement with certainty at T and that conviction permanently moves the individual

to the spot market path5, the present value of the change in lifetime income, which we term the

present value of obedience rents (PVOR), is

                                                 T
                                   PVOR(t) =     E   P'b7(t)   —




where     =   11(1 +5)   and ô is a discount rate.    The difference, y - y3, can be thought of as the

current value of legal obedience rents, and the present value of such rents is the opportunity cost

of conviction at time r.

        We    would expect equalization of the discounted utility of the spot vs. career jobs

(Polachek and Siebert, 1993) but only measured at the outset of the career and not thereafter.

Thus, while PVOR(O) would equal 0 if utility were based only on income, we expect discounted

obedience rents to be positive for r>0. Once an individual has begun investing in a career job,

the present value of future income, as of that time until retirement, will exceed the present value

of spot market income over that same period. Thus, among career workers, discounted income

losses from being relegated to the spot market are small only for those at the beginning or the



untrustworthiness, a characteristic that does affect productivity.
     5Evidence on the persistence of stigma effects is limited but that which is available suggests
that decay rates are slow and thereby that the adverse effects are long lasting (Waldfogel, 1994b;
Grogger, 1992). Note that our framework does not necessarily assume persistence. The degree
of persistence is captured by the discount rate ô. Greater persistence corresponds to a lower
discount rate.
                                                6

end of their careers.

       PVOR(r)'s trajectory over the life cycle depends on the discount rate and the shape of

pre- and post-conviction income profiles. Figure 2 shows the present value of obedience rents

over the life cycle for various discount rates and assuming the stylized income profiles in Figure

1. With a zero discount rate, PVOR reaches a maximum at the age when career income

surpasses the spot income available to convicts. For higher discount rates, the PVOR maximum

comes later. All PVOR profiles calculated assuming that the career trajectory crosses the spot

trajectory from below have a humped shape, which implies that the highest opportunity cost of

conviction occurs during mid-career. If the post-conviction profile is below the pre-conviction

profile for all ages, the PVOR profile can be either hump-shaped or can decline monotonically.

       PVOR(r) traces out variation over the work career in the deterrent threat stemming from

the market penalty for conviction. Thus, assuming the distribution of criminal opportunities does

not vary over the work career, the probability of offending should be inversely related to the

level of PVOR(r), where offending probability increases as PVOR decreases. Figure 3 depicts

the predicted "U-Shaped" time path of probability of offending (for a hump-shaped PVOR)

where this probability reaches its minimum at the time when PVOR(r) reaches its maximum6.

       PVOR(r)'s shape also has implications for changes over the work career in the minimum

dollar gain from offending required to balance expected costs. We expect the minimum gain



    6Figure 3 implies that sometime following middle age the incidence of offending should
begin increasing. All available evidence suggests a monotonic decline in offending through
adulthood (see for example Wilson and Hermstein, 1985). This suggests that the noneconomic
costs of crime, for example, loss of standing in the community, increase with age. It is also
possible that available data on offending disproportionately undercount offenses most likely to
be committed by elderly individuals.
                                               7

necessary   to induce law-breaking to be positively related to PVOR(r). Thus, if PVOR is hump-

shaped, as depicted in Figure 3, then gains sought by offenders should similarly be hump-shaped

with age and furthermore should have a maximum which coincides with that of PVOR(r).



                                           ifi. Data

       The data for     this study are assembled from the administrative records of the

Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AO). The data consist of a two-observation panel on

the legal income of criminals, with one observation before, and one after conviction. Pre-

conviction data are extracted from pre-sentence investigation reports and post-conviction data

are taken from monthly probation reports. The primary sample used in this analysis is
comprised of males convicted of fraud in the U.S. federal courts in 1984 who are released from

probationary supervision by the end of 1987. For these individuals we have both pre- and post-

conviction measures of income.

       Pre-conviction income is measured for the year prior to conviction; and post-conviction

income is measured for the last year of probationary supervision, usually about two years after

the pre-conviction income observation. Both pre- and post-conviction income are measured by

average monthly income from all legal sources -          wages   from legitimate employment,

scholarships, disability and welfare payments, investment and pension income, and so on. While

data on wages would be ideal for this study, none are available, nor are data available on hours

worked. In addition to the income data, the data set includes an estimate of the dollars involved

in the offense for which the individual was convicted as well the offender's age, race, region,
                                               8

marital status, and education7.

       As will be discussed, the principal focus of the analysis is the subset of men with no

prior convictions. Of the 7094 men convicted of fraud in federal courts in 1984, 4237 have no

prior convictions. Of these first-time convicts, 2097 were released from supervision by the end

of 1987 and are thereby candidates for inclusion in the sample of individuals with both pre- and

post-conviction income data. Of this group, 1336 had valid data on both pre- and post-

conviction income and on other variables of interest. We acknowledge that this winnowing

process raises obvious questions of sample selection, but we also note that the pre-conviction

monthly income of the entire population of fraud offenders with no prior convictions ($2503)

is virtually identical to that of the 1336 who are the principal focus of our analysis ($2535).

Furthermore, we note that the probability of completing supervision by the end of 1987 does not

vary by age, a variable we use as a surrogate for pre-conviction job tenure.



                                         IV. Analysis

       This section examines four empirical questions relevant to the theory advanced above.

First, how does first-time conviction affect job stability over the life cycle? Second, does the

effect of first-time conviction on income vary over the life cycle so that conviction raises the

income of young workers and decreases the income of older workers? Third, is the conviction

effect over the life cycle different for workers who already have criminal records? Fourth, do

the gains sought through fraud vary by the age of the offender in a way that follows the age

trajectory of PVOR?



    7See Waldfogel (1994a) for a more detailed description of the data.
                                                9
       Table 1 reports summary statistics on the demographic characteristics of first-time fraud

and larceny convicts. Companion statistics, if available, are also provided for the broader

population of convicted offenders in the criminal justice system (CJS). Fraud offenders are

clearly not representative of offenders at large in the CJS; they are older, more likely to be

white, and far better educated than other offenders. Federal larcenists are more similar to

typical offenders in the CJS than are fraud offenders. Hence, at the end of the paper we also

report analyses of the limited available data on larcenists to provide perspective on the generality

of our findings.

       Before turning to the findings, we make an observation on measurement. Our theory

assumes that conviction reduces access to career jobs but does not assume that individuals

without convictions will necessarily work in career jobs. If all individuals hold career jobs prior

to conviction and spot market jobs afterward, the observed income difference for any age will

equal the distance between career and spot market profiles. In reality, some workers may hold

spot market jobs prior to conviction, and some may hold career jobs afterward. While we

assume that a higher fraction of offenders hold career jobs before than after, the possibility that

pre- and post-conviction income averages reflect workers in both types of jobs will tend to make

the observed effect of conviction on income smaller (in absolute value) than the difference

between career and spot profiles at any age.



1. First-Time Conviction and Employment

       Consider first the prediction that conviction increases job instability by reducing access

to career jobs. Unlike the prediction that first-time conviction's impact on income varies over
                                                10

the work career, the theory does not predict that the change in job stability will depend on prior

work experience; first-time conviction shifts the worker from a stable career profile to an

unstable spot profile at any point in the work career and should therefore increase job instability

throughout the career.

       The data set lacks a direct measure of job stability, such as number of jobs held. We

thus use an indirect measure of the impact of conviction on job stability--the change in the

fraction of individuals with positive income between the times of their pre- and post-conviction

income observations. We interpret a post-conviction decline in this proportion as an indication

of more sporadic employment and therefore greater job instability.

       Table 2 reports the change in the proportion of first-time convicts with positive income

by age of conviction, our proxy for work experience. Consistent with the findings of Freeman

(1991) and Nagin and Waldfogel (1992) that conviction reduces legal labor market opportunities,

the fraction of first-time federal fraud offenders with positive income declines significantly, from

90.4% to 85.0%. Between ages 18 and 49 the decline is stable and under 5%. From age 50

to 59 the decline is only modestly higher - about 7%. Only convicts over 59 suffer a materially

larger decline in positive income probability than the other age groups. We suspect that many

of these convicts simply retired following their conviction. While the evidence of the impact

of Conviction on job stability is based on a very imperfect measure, it accords with the theory:

Conviction increases job instability no matter when experienced in the work career.



2. First-Time Conviction and Income

       Consider next the impact of first-time conviction on income. Table 3 reports the mean
                                               11

and median percentage difference between pre- and post-conviction real income for the sub-

sample of first-time convicts who had positive income both before and after conviction. The

results are consistent with prior research and with the predictions of the theory. The average

percent change in income following conviction is -7.7% (with a t-statistic of -3.33). The median

change is somewhat smaller, -3.8% (with a Wilcoxon signed rank statistic of -2.87), but still

negative. The change, however, differs enormously across age groups. Young workers actually

experience an increase in income; individuals convicted prior to age 25 experience on average

a 24.1 % increase in income. Thereafter, the change declines monotonically with age. The

average change for individuals convicted between ages 25 and 39 is insignificantly different from

0. After age 39 the effects turn negative, and increasingly so. For individuals convicted after

age 59, the average decline is over a third. The same pattern of changes is mirrored in the

medians - the median percent change in income is positive and significant for young offenders,

but for older individuals who have presumably accumulated more human capital at pre-

conviction jobs, the change eventually reverses sign and becomes increasingly negative.

       The results reported in Table 3 are precisely in accord with the theory, but the

measurement procedure, a simple contrast of pre- and post-conviction income, suffers from a

potential bias depicted in Figure 4. Consider first the measurement of the negative impact of

conviction on income that is predicted to occur later in the work career. This change is

measured by the difference in income between points A (pre-conviction income) and B (post-

conviction income). The correct measure of the conviction effect, however, is the income

difference between points C and B, where C measures what income would have been at the time

of the post-conviction income measurement, had the individual not been convicted. As can be
                                               12

seen from the figure, failure to account for the growth in income that would have occurred

between the measurements of pre- and post-conviction income absent conviction results in an

understatement of the negative impact of conviction. Figure 4 also illustrates the analogous -

but opposite - measurement bias arising for young workers. During the period when spot market

jobs pay more than career jobs, simple differencing of pre- and post-conviction wages, E-D,

overstates the true positive short-term impact of conviction on income, E-F8.

       To control for the potential bias depicted in Figure 4, we estimate the following two-

equation model describing pre- and post-first-conviction income as function of age and other


             other factors may also be biasing our results. One is that by restricting our sample
to individuals with positive income pre- and post-conviction the summary statistics in Table 3
may misrepresent the income penalty of conviction for the entire population of first time
convicts. In practice this does not appear to be a problem. It is not possible to compute
percentage changes for individuals with no income. We can, however, compute group averages
by age. The changes in average income by age, including those with no income, mirror the
pattern in Table 3. The under-age 25 group experience a 22.5% increase in income following
first time conviction. Thereafter, the change declines monotonically; the changes for the age
groups 25-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, and 60 and over are, respectively, -2.2%, -8.6%, -15.8%, -
23.6%, and -45.3%.
         A second potential source of bias is the impact of imprisonment on post-conviction
income. Although it is theoretically possible that our results are driven by human capital
depreciation while in prison, empirically this is not the case. When we exclude the 26 percent
of the sample punished by imprisonment, we obtain nearly identical results.
       A third potential source of bias is the impact of being charged with a crime on pre-
conviction income. Some of the individuals in our sample may have been dismissed from their
jobs prior to Conviction simply because they had been charged with a crime. This seems
particularly likely if they were charged with defrauding their employer. We have no basis for
assessing whether such pre-conviction discharges from employment occurred to any appreciable
extent but if they did, our estimates of the negative impact of conviction are understated. Thus,
it is possible that even the youngest workers suffered a decline in annualized income. We note,
however, that pre-conviction job dismissal does not explain the main result of this section, that
first-time conviction effects vary over the life cycle.
         A fourth potential source of bias is that prior to conviction individuals may participate
in crime because of a temporary reduction in their legal income. If so, then the change in legal
income experienced with conviction will understate the negative effect of conviction on earning
ability. However, unless this bias varies by age, it will not affect our basic results.

equations have different intercepts and age profiles. The estimated conviction effect depends on

age and is


                          (X +    &1age1 + â2age) - (X(i + âage + aage5.

This estimation approach controls for income growth between pre- and post-conviction income

observations under the assumption that the individual's income would have followed the pre-

conviction age-income trajectory in the absence of conviction. By contrast, the raw differences

in Table 3 correspond to a case in which the individual gains no experience between pre- and

post-conviction income observations. This is equivalent to assuming that absent conviction,

offenders' income would have remained at its pre-conviction level.

           To control for the effect of time-stable individual differences on pre- and post-conviction

income, the model is estimated both as a fixed and random effects specification. Appendix



     9The specification in equations la and lb allows for a quadratic income profile while figure
4 is drawn, for simplicity, assuming linearity.
                                               14

Table Al reports the coefficient estimates of the random effects model; the less efficient fixed

effects estimates give rise to nearly identical conviction effect estimates'°. These estimates

imply a pre-conviction income profile that starts below and ends above the post-conviction

income profile. Table 4 reports age-varying estimates of first-time conviction's effect on income

for two worker profiles (single, white and high school or college educated) from the random

effects model. The results mirror those reported in Table 3. First-time conviction has a positive

effect on the income of workers under age 30. After age 30 the impact becomes increasingly

negative. Thus, both tabular and regression results support the idea that conviction shifts

workers off of career profiles.

       Ideally, we would supplement our tests on income by examining the types of jobs held

before and after conviction, but our data include no information on the types of jobs held before

or after conviction. Thus, it is not possible to examine directly whether conviction is associated

with reduced participation in career jobs. Nagin and Waldfogel (1992), however, report direct

evidence of such reduced participation among young British men. These men experience a sharp

decline in participation in apprenticeships and in employment at jobs requiring training following

their first adult conviction.



3. Conviction Effects on Offenders with Prior Convictions

       The results presented thus far pertain to the subsample of first-time convicts. Table 5

is the counterpart of Table 3 for the sub-sample of individuals who had been convicted prior to

their fraud conviction in 1984. Unlike for first-time convicts, there is no relationship between

                                                 15

the change in income and age. With one exception, all age groups, including the youngest,

experience significant declines in income. Hence, subsequent conviction does not appear to

cause   workers to move to a profile with a higher intercept and lower slope, as is true for first-

time convicts.

         The existence of a market penalty for convictions beyond the first has a number of

interpretations, one of which is not strictly within the structure of our model. First, the types

of spot market jobs available to first-time convicts may not be the most low-paying and unstable.

Such jobs may be the domain of individuals with multiple convictions who, by their repetition

of criminal behavior, most clearly signal that they are untrustworthy. A second interpretation

that is compatible with our model's single spot market begins with the observation that our

theory does not require that the wage trajectory in the spot market be flat, just less steep than

in the career market. The first conviction may relegate the individual to a single spot market,

and the impact of each additional conviction may be to move the individual back along the spot

market wage trajectory. In the extreme the individual's initial wage following each Conviction

is the starting spot market wage. Such movement back along an upward-sloping spot market

trajectory would result in a decline in income following each conviction beyond the first. This

interpretation can explain why the decline in income beyond the first conviction is unrelated to

age. Unlike for first-time convicts, age is not expected to be correlated with current job

tenure".

4. Lost Income and Deterrence


    "We would have liked to measure the relationship between the size of second-time
conviction effects and time elapsed since first conviction, but we do not observe the time elapsed
since each individual's previous convictions.
                                                16

       According to the theory the age profile of gains sought by offenders should coincide with

the age proffle of PVOR(r). Testing this prediction requires an estimate of the PVOR(r) profile.

To compute the PVOR(r) profile relevant to workers without criminal records, we use pre- and

post-first-conviction income trajectories projected from the age-income relationships implied in

the estimates of eqs. Ia & lb. We interpret the pre-conviction age-income relationship estimated

in eq. la as the path that a worker would experience over time by assuming that age is a

reasonable proxy for pre-conviction work experience and that there are no period or cohort

effects mediating the relationship between age and income.

       Inferring the prospective post-first-conviction income trajectory from the estimate of eq.

lb requires even stronger assumptions because post-conviction income observations are taken

shortly (about two years) after the first conviction. Thus, the post-conviction age-income

relationship can be interpreted as a profile of post-conviction starting wages in the spot market

by age of first conviction'2. Because it is based on starting pay, the post-first-conviction profile

does not necessarily indicate the prospective income trajectory to be experienced following

conviction.   Identifying the income profile experienced after conviction requires income

observations taken at varying intervals after conviction (including some more than two years

after conviction). If, long after conviction, income remains on the age-income profile defined

by eq. Ib, this relationship can also be interpreted as the income path actually experienced

following conviction.

       One source of identifying evidence on the shape of the post-conviction profile is pre-

second conviction data. Some fraud offenders are convicted for a second time in 1984, and


    '2We are grateful to Bengt Holmstrom for pointing this out.
                                                17

these convictions occur at varying - albeit unknown - intervals following the first conviction.'3

If the profile estimated on post-first-conviction (starting) pay also accurately describes pre-
second-conviction income, then we have some evidence that the profile estimated in eq. lb is

the income path experienced following a first conviction and is therefore relevant to calculations

of prospective discounted foregone income. Indeed, this is what we find: We cannot reject the

hypothesis that the age trajectory of pre-second-conviction income equals the age trajectory of

post-first-conviction income, all else constant. We thus estimate PVOR by assuming that, after

conviction, an ex-offender's income follows the post-conviction income profile estimated in eq.

lb.
       Figure 5 depicts the present values of obedience rents for individuals without criminal

records. These PVOR profiles are derived from pre- and post-conviction income profiles for

discount rates of 5%, 10%, and 20%. At their maximum the present values of obedience rents

are quite substantial. They range from nearly $60,000 in present value for a 5% discount rate

to about $25,000 for a 20% discount rate. Note that these calculations do not necessarily

assume complete persistence of the conviction effect. For example, a 20% discount rate in our

model is equivalent to a 10% psychic discount rate in conjunction with post-conviction income

that converges back toward the pre-conviction trajectory at 8.3% per year (1/(1+20%)

(11(1 + l0%))(l00% -8.3%))'.

profile back to the pre-conviction profile is no more than 10 percent per year.
                                               18

gains and age of first conviction. Observe that the mean gain for fraud is generally several

orders of magnitude larger than the median gain. This is because the distribution of gains is

very highly skewed. Nonetheless, whether measured by the mean or by various order statistics,

the distribution of gains from fraud opportunities that were undertaken by convicted offenders

follows the hump-shaped trajectory of PVOR; gains rise monotonically through the younger age

groupings, reach a maximum between ages 50 and 60 (the 75th percentile maximum occurs

between 40 and 50), and then decline in the oldest age group. Observe that for discount rates

of 10% and 20% the maximum of PVOR coincides with the maximum of the gains distribution

as reported in Table 6- between age 50 and 60. At the 5% rate the PVOR maximum occurs

at only a modestly lower age - about age 45. Thus, the maximums of both the gains and PVOR

functions appear to coincide at reasonable discount rates. We note, however, that dollars

involved in the offenses may follow opportunity, which, in turn, may follow income. The

estimated pre-conviction income profile for fraud offenders reaches a maximum at age 56.

Hence, we can only say that these data are consistent with our deterrence explanation.

       Our theory predicts that the probability of offending will be negatively related with

PVOR, holding access to criminal opportunities constant. However, because we have no direct

evidence on the criminal opportunities confronting potential offenders by age, we cannot test this

incidence prediction. It is this same lack of information that prevents our observation that

dollars involved in offenses follow PVOR to be more than simply consistent with, rather than

evidence for, a deterrent effect stemming from PVOR.



5. Do the Results Hold for Larcenists?
                                               19

       According to the characteristics listed in Table 1, federal fraud offenders are atypical

U.S. criminals. Federal larcenists are also atypical, but considerably less so. To provide

perspective on the generality of our findings for fraud offenders, we repeat the basic elements

of our analysis on a small sample of federal larcenists (n=397)1S. The results are summarized

in Table 7. The findings on income are quite similar to those for fraud offenders. Conviction

increases the income of offenders under 25, while it has an increasingly negative effect on the

income of offenders over 30. The median dollar gains from larceny follow the clear hump-

shaped pattern predicted by the theory with the maximum occurring between age 40 and 49.

The hump-shaped pattern for the mean gains is less distinct but still present. Due to a few

outlying observations, the mean estimates, however, are rather erratic. The results for larcenists

are thus reasonably in accord with the theory and are supportive of its generality.



                                         V. Conclusion

       This paper presents evidence that first-time conviction effects vary substantially by age

while subsequent conviction effects do not. First-time conviction raises the income of young

offenders and reduces the income of older offenders, while subsequent conviction effects reduce

income at all ages. The results are rationalized by assuming that first-time conviction moves

workers off of career income profiles to less steeply sloped spot market profiles. Subsequent

convictions simply demonstrate that workers' marginal products are less valuable and/or move

them back along an upward sloping spot market wage trajectory. The results imply that the



   The sample is constructed according to the same criteria used for the 1336 observation
sample of positive income fraud offenders.
                                                20
discounted prospective income loss due to conviction is hump-shaped over the career and, if

deterrence operates, that the pattern of gains sought by offenders should also follow this pattern.

Data on actual gains sought by convicted offenders are consistent with this prediction.

       Our model of conviction's effect on job opportunities presumes that would-be offenders

have access to jobs offering the prospect of human capital accumulation.              Given their

backgrounds it is reasonable to presume that most fraud offenders had access to career jobs prior

to their conviction. Indeed many probably used such access to perpetrate their frauds. It less

clear, however, whether the larger population of offenders generally have the skills to qualify

them for a career job even at an entry level. Thus, our findings may not generalize to the larger

population of individuals with criminal records. A replication on a more representative sample

of offenders is needed. In such a replication it would also be desirable to have data on the types

and number of jobs held before and after conviction. With such data the prediction that

conviction restricts access to career type jobs could be directly tested and also a more rigorous

test of the impact of conviction on job stability would be possible.

       If the results do generalize they have important policy implications for crime control.

They suggest that in the short-run young offenders may suffer no income loss from conviction.

Combined with the tendency toward leniency in the sentencing of first-time convicts, this may

cause disincentives to crime to be small for young offenders, particularly those with high

discount rates. A possible solution is the institution of harsher penalties for juvenile and young

first-time offenders.     Any such changes in sentencing policy designed to increase the

disincentives to crime among the young should, however, take into consideration the long term

market penalty of stigmatization even if this penalty is underappreciated or overly discounted by
                                              21

young offenders themselves. One possible mechanism for balancing short run incentives to

provide a deterrent threat with long term consequences is a policy of expunging the criminal

records of young offenders after a specified period of "going straight."
