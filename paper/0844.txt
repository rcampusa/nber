     This paper critically evaluates the contribution of labor economics
and industrial relations research to our understanding of the impact of
government labor market regulation. Recent theoretical and empirical
literature is analyzed for four major policies: (a) workplace safety and
health; (b) employer—provided pensions; (c) wage minimums; and (d) employ-
ment and pay practices with regard to women and minorities. Studies on EEO
and OSHA reforms find small but positive impacts on the outcomes they sought
to alter: the minimum wage literature indicates low skilled workers were
not benefited much by wage floors; and as yet no analysis exists on whether
ERISA improved pension security. Directions for future analysis are
suggested, including the role of research in policymaking, whether and how
regulatory policy affects labor productivity, and the distributional impact
of different forms of regulation on various labor market groups.

                The Labor Market Impact of Federal Regulations:

                       OSHA, ERISA, EEO and Minimum Wage

        This paper critically evaluates what we have learned about the impact

 of federal regulation of the workplace in the last decade. Policies selected

 for special attention are those affecting (a) workplace safety and health,

 (b) employer—provided pensions, (c) wage minimums, and (d) employment and pay

practices with regard to women and minorities. Discussion of each policy is

organized in the same way. First, we present a brief overview of the major

legislative, administrative and judicial developments in the policy area that

occured during the 1970's. Next ,   the   theoretical literature is summarized,

followed by a discussion of studies on the specific labor market regulation.

Finally, for each policy, we ask the question: What have we learned about the

effect of the regulatory policy on the level and distribution of social well-

being? General observations on all four regulatory programs appear in a fiual

section.

I.     Occupational Safety and Health

       Until 1970, occupational safety and health standards were not uniform or

consistent across the nation's workplaces. In a few industries, federal govern-

ment supervision was the norm, as with the Mine Safety Act. Some states ran

programs varying in scope and impact. For the most part, however, industry—

level groups in the private sector developed their own concensus standards for

job health and safety, and complied with them on a voluntary basis. During the

latter half of the 1960's, public policy on workplace safety began to change,

in part responding to high and rising injury rates on the job. This concern

found a voice in the Occupational Safety and Health (OSH) Act of 1970, and in

subsequent judicial and administrative developments in the area.
                                        —2—



1. Policy Overview

The Act's goal was to make the workplace "healthful arid safe for working men

and women" (Smith, 1976, p. 14), imposing on employers the responsibility for

insuring that workers were not exposed to hazardous conditions. In addition

to this general mandate, employers were instructed to abide by a rather lengthy

list of safety and health standards that had been devised by private industry,

as well as   other   federal safety laws such as the Nine Safety Act and the Walsh

Healey Act. Enforcement of the law's general safety and health clause as well

as a multitude of individual standards, devolved upon Department of Labor inspectors.

While inspectors were most frequently allocated to firms in targeted industries,

they could also be invited in by employees suspecting violations. Employers

found in noncompliance were usually fined, about $25 per violation during the

mid—1970's (Smith, 1976). Additional administrative agencies were charged

with reviewing practice and suggesting changes in policy. These included the

Occupational Safety and Health Commission, the National Institute for Occupa-

tional Safety and Health and the National Advisory Commission on Occupational

Safety and Health. The OSH Act also indirectly facilitated the formation of

union management committees to deal with occupational and safety matters at the

firm and industry level ((Kochan, Dyer, and Lipsey, 1977).

       Various judicial interpretations of the OSH Act influenced the form and

substance of the legislation over timeJ       For instance, the Act did not require

OSHA inspectors to obtain a search warrant; however in 1978 the Supreme Court

ruled that employers could require inspectors to obtain one. Employers and

workers both were granted permission to accompany safety inspectors on rounds.

An important case in 1977, Marshall v. Daniel Construction, produced the ruling

that employees would not be allowed to refuse to work even if they feared or
                                         —3—




suspected dangerous working conditions on the job. The most controversial

issue in the safety and health area was only recently reviewed by the

Supreme Court: The question was whether economic cost—benefit analysis could

be used in evaluating health and safety standards.       Several textile firms

argued that compliance with the Act's standards would be so expensive as to

threaten their economic viability. The defendants argued, and the Court

agreed, that the OSH Act did not require a comparison of compliance costs and

benefits in determining new standards.2 The long—term impact of this decision

is still unclear, since the Agency's director has argued that OSH standards must

still be "the least expensive way of reaching a specific level of protection".3

The pros and cons of cost—benefit approaches in this context are considered in

more detail below.

2. The Impact of Safety and Health Policy

Most theoretical analysis of safety and health policy applies a neoclassical

framework. This approach focuses on how OSH law affects labor costs, and traces

its impact through the economic system. In a world where all employers and

workers are competitive and well informed, wages paid in the labor market would

reflect workers' evaluations of the risk they face on the job. Different types

of employees demand different amounts of on—the—job safety, and employers

supply different amounts depending on their own technology and the cost of

lowering job risks. The labor market rewards workers willing to take risks

with wage premiums depending on   the   distribution of workers' tastes and employers'

technologies.   (Lucas, 972; Rosen, 1974; Thaler and Rosen, 1973).
        In this neoclassical, world, imposing minimum legal standards   on

workers'   physical environment raises employers' costs of hiring labor. Profits
are   lowered and firms have an incentive to substitute away from labor to capital.
Depending on the degree of responsiveness in labor demand and consumption, this

process produces a cutback in employment and in overall output. Many neo-

classical analysts would therefore view an OSH—type standards approach with

some skepticism, since it creates inefficiencies in markets presumed to

operate efficiently.

       Somewhat less orthodox approaches have also evolved in the last decade

which perceive safety regulation somewhat differently. Many such analysts

believe that workers are exposed to too much risk because the costs of making

jobs safer appear too high. This is explained by workers' and/or firms' imper-

fect information ——    they   do not have the technical and medical capabilities

required to monitor and alter the work environment. As yet, there exists no

careful study of the ways in which workers obtain, process and act on informa-

tion pertaining to workplace safety and health. Bacow (1980) suggests that most

workers do have difficulty monitoring compliance with OSH standards. Complimentary

evidence from Kochan (1980) finds that union workers appear to obtain higher risk

premiums than do their nonunion counterparts. On the other hand, Smith (1979)

and Viscusi (1979) find no significant effect of unionism on the injury rate.

Thus, the evidence suggests that large organizations like unions may improve

workers' perceptions of risk on the job, but perhaps cannot significantly lower

those risks. There is at least fragmentary evidence indicating that there are

scale economics for firms in the production of job safety and safety information;

Gordon (cited in Smith, 1974) suggests that large firms are more able to implement

standards for this very reason. Oi (1974) along with Cooke and Cautchi (1981)

also find that injury rates are lower in large firms, which is consistent with

the view that   firms may experience    scale economies in injury reduction.
       Whether or not these studies judge OSHA favorably in terms of

improving the functioning of the labor market depends on whether information

problems or scale economics are more important. OSH—type standards imposed

by the government benefit workers most if they are unable to determine desireable

safety levels on their owli. On the other hand, legally required safety equipment

and job redesign may be costly and in fact be more expensive than fully informed

workers would be willing to incur in changing their own working conditions.

       Another group of studies has inquired about whether the labor market

responds enough to information about workplace hazards. The evidence here is

mixed. Viscusi (1979) concludes that workers are often poorly informed

about workplace hazards, and adapt slowly by quitting their jobs, as they

learn about the risks involved. Smith (1979) reviews the literature on

wage premiums for higher risks of death on the job, and concludes that riskier

jobs do pay more though injury rate differences across industries do not appear

to be reflected in wage premiums. Smith (1974) also examined firm behavior,

focusing on the relationship between workplace injuries and risk premiums that

firms pay their workers. He concludes that "employers do seem to be responsive

in their safety efforts to the cost of injuries" (p. 741), and will react to

economic incentives by making the workplace safer. However, this responsiveness

is not large; he estimates that it would take a per—injury penalty of $1,600

to $3,000 (in 1974 dollars) to lower the injury rate 10 percent. This was

about 100 times as large as the average OSHA penalty at the time. All three

types of studies would suggest that OSH regulation was a necessary though

probably not sufficient policy to improve working conditions.

      Differences in theoretical frameworks have generated different empirical

approaches for evaluating the impact of OSH law. Some authors provide fascinating
                                         —6—


descriptive analyses of the medical, technical, practical, and bureaucratic

difficulties encountered during OSHA's first year of life. Ashford (1976)

has an extensive review of problems encountered in medical research and the

difficulties of convurting these medical/technical finds into OSH standards.

He also provides an interesting overview of the bureaucratic obstacles en-

countered in developing new standards, complemented by Mendeloff's (1979)

review of vinyl chloride and mechanical press standards.

          Other new initiatives in the safety area are the focus of authors

interested in union—management negotiations over changes in workplace health

and safety practice. Bacow (1980), for instance, reviews the quite different

approaches to worker safety of the United Auto workers, United Steelworkers

and the United Association of Plumbers and Pipefitters. Kochan, Dyer and Lipsky

(1977) study the relationships between a single union (Machinists), the

perceptions of the workers represented by this union, and management's percep-

tion of safety and health issues. These case studies provide a wealth of in-

formation about the ways in which particular unions and companies interact

altering workplace safety and health, and will serve as models for institutional

researchers in the future.

          In addition to these more descriptive evaluations of OSHA, a few more

quantitative studies are also available. Unfortunately, these studies are

plagued   by almost insurmountahi e data problems. Perhaps the   single most

serious   problem   deterring good quality research in this area is that no good

data exist on workers' exposure to risk.4 Thus, there is no way to determine

the rein tionship between the number of workers affected by workplace illness

or injury and the total number actually at risk on their jobs. A second

problem with workplace safety data is that statistics collected prior to the
                                       —7—



 passage   of the OSH Act are incompatible with post—OSH Act statistics. Analysts

 therefore cannot determine the effect of OSHA directly5 by examining trends

 in injuries or illness over time, and instead must focus on differences in

 workplace hazards as reflected in post—OSFIA data alone. This may lead to under-

 estimates of the effect of OSFIA, since one would suspect that inspections

 would have some spillover effects even on firms not directly subject to

 inspection.

        A third drawback of workplace safety data is that the reporting re-

 quirements are better for injuries and very poor on occupational illness

 (Ashford, 1976). Thus, policy evaluations have been restricted almost

 exclusively to the analysis of work injuries. Virtually nothing is known about

 the long run effect of OSH on occupational illness. Other analysts

 have criticized available data for still another reason: "assessment of small

 risks requires immense amounts of data" in order to be certain that changes

 in injury rates are indeed permanent and not due to measurement error (Rosen,

 1981, p. 242). Efforts to reduce measurement error in data have led analysts

 to examine industry level statistics, yet such aggregation obscures a great
                                                6
deal of variation across firms in an industry       (Oi, 1974).

       Another serious drawback of quantitative data in this area is attributable

to the problem of defining and measuring the policy variable of interest.
                                                                                    7
Some analysts focus on industry—wide probabilities of OSHA inspection or citations.

However, the likelihood of inspection is distributed unevenly across firms,

implying   that the impact of OS}1 policy on individual firms is not well
measured by industry level data. Other analysts have focused on plant—level
data, representing the effect of OSHA policy by timing of inspections, whether
or not there was an OSHA inspection in a given year, or the number of citations
over time (Smith, 1979; Cook mid Catitchi, 1981). No study has yet determined
which is the most useful and sensible measure of the policy variable, and more
                                      —8--




work needs to be done in this area.

       With these caveats in mind, let us turn to the evidence. Most empirical

studies focus on injury rates as the dependent variable, and relate them to

measures of OSIIA policy.   Mendeloff (1979) uses time series information, focus-

ing on national injury rates. He concludes that injury patterns after the

passage of the Act did not differ significantly from thL overall injury rate that

would have been predicted in the absence of OSHA. His further analysis with

state—level statistics are almost as inconclusive. Smith (1974) looked at cross—

sectional injury rate statistics for 3—digit industrial groupings, and rejects

the hypothesis that Target Industries program reduced injury rates significantly.

Viscusi (1979) also uses industry level data, but follows the same industries

over a period of four years; the policy variables he includes are the industry—

specific OSHA inspection rate and the proposed OSHA penalty for noncompliance.

Again, no significant effect of the government policy was detected.

       Because of the drawbacks noted earlier in national and industry level

aggregate data, a few analysts have looked at injuries at the plant level. An

early report by DiPietro (cited in Mendeloff, 1979) studies firms' injury rates

in 1973 as a function of whether or not firms were inspected in the previous

year. Firm size and changes in employment were also controlled. Overall, results

from this study reiterate the evidence generated by aggregate analyses——OSHA

inspection apparently had no statistically significant effect on firm level injury

rates. That author suggested that the null finding might be attributable to the

fact that inspections were often targeted at firms with exceptionally poor injury

records; in other words, the inspection variable was probably endogenous and

thus biased toward zero. A more recent study by Smith (1979) controls for this

potential problem by focusing on a subsample of plants, all of which had been

inspected in either 1973 or 1974. In order to measure the effect of inspection,
                                          — C) —




Smith differentiated between plants which were inspected early in the year, and

others which were not visited until the winter months. He postulates that firms

visited    earlier would have a longer period over which to correct workplace
hazards and thus should have experienced lower injury rates than the plants
visited    later. interestingly, the evidence indicates that days lost due to

injury were significantly reduced by early inspection in 1973, but not in 1974.

Various explanations for the lack of consistency are suggested, the most plausible

being that firms inspected in the later year were more likely to be "problem

cases" as compared to the plants visited earlier in the program. Overall, the

author concluded that injuries were reduced from 5 to 16 percent with additional

inspections. A third study of plant level data (Cooke and Gautchi, 1981), in-

vestigated changes in days lost due to injury over the period 1970 to 1976.

These   authors found that an increase in the total number of OSI-IA citations over
the    same period reduced days lost due to injury by a (statistically significant)

.3 to .5 days per worker in large plants. No effect was discerned in small work-

places, however.

         Clearly much more work remains to be done in this area. To reiterate

Rosen (1981), the dependent variable should measure which workers are at risk,

rather than the very crude measures usually used. The endogenity of inspections

at the firm level must also be an analyzed in more detail, ideally within the

context of a model which takes into account the role of unions and management

in enforcing the law.    !3ettcr ways   of modelling the implementation of OSHA policy
must be devised, to better reflect Lhe likelihood of apprehension, the likelihood
that   OSHA inspectors will actually perceive violations, the probable size of

penalties if apprehended, and the role of follow—up investigations. On the basis

of empirical work in the 1970's, it is suggested that the estimated effect of an
                                        —1)-



increase in OSHA inspections on workplace injuries ranges between zero and about

15 percent, where the lower end of the range is characteristic of empirical

studies using aggregate data, and the higher estimates are produced by plant

level studies. More empirical studies of behavior at the individual firm level

in the future will probably produce estimates of the impact of OSHA at the

higher end of this range.

3. Effects of OSHA Policy on Levels of Well—Being

Has national policy on occupational safety and health had any significant impact

on the level and distribution of well—being? This is one of the most interesting

of all the research questions in the occupational safety and health area, and yet

the most overlooked.8 There are, of course, many methods of devising answers to

the question. One approach has been to use cost benefit analysis as an inter-

mediate step in guiding decision—making (Ot, 1974). However, others (Chown, 1980;

Wood, 1974) argue that cost—benefit places a price on illnesses and injuries, and

"the worker must not be viewed simply as an economic entity." Regardless of

whetlier   cost—benefit is the only criterion that should be used, or whether
instead it    should be one of many, no one in the health and safety area has yet

developed a list of the costs and benefits of OSHA and their distribution across

the workforce. In addition, no one has asked whether other policies, such as

those which impose more safety responsibilities on workers directly, might be

more cost effective and/or equitable than the current standards—setting approach.

4 .   Couci usion

This review of what we know about job safety and health policy has revealed some

strengths and many weaknesses. No one has inquired into the impact of OSH policy

on employment and wages. The best available firm—level evidence indicates that

current practice has a small negative effect on workplace injuries. No one has
examined the     impact   of OSH policy on occupational illness, and this area should

 receive   highest research priority in the next decade. The evidence suggests that
workers are not well acquainted with workplace hazards, though they do learn over
time.      Better ways of making available such information should be found. Firms

act    as though they face rather minimal incentives to reduce workplace hazards
under   current Jaw and practice. While the socially desirable level and distri-

bution of risk on the job has not been established, existing cost—benefit method-

ology is probably too narrow in scope to completely measure the effects of work-

place risk. On the other hand, more attention must be devoted to understanding

the costs and benefits of safety and health policy. A prerequisite to more use-

ful research is better information on who is actually exposed to what kind of

risks. Labor management and the federal government should join to produce and

analyze    these sorely needed data.
II.       Pension Income Security: ERISA

          Private pensions today cover roughly half of the workforce, and provide

an average of $3,000 to retirees receiving a pension (President's Commission on

Pension Policy, 1981). Pensions grew in importance as a source of retirement

income mainly since wwii,       spurred by tax deferral of employer contributions to
company plans, NLRB rulings that pensions were appropriate topics of collective

bargaining and the Taft—Hartley Act which provided the framework for private

multi—employer    pension plans. The Welfare       and Pension Plan Disclosure Act (WPPD)

of 19.5? wa an early attempt to organize data collection on the nation's patch-

work   of retirement   and other   employer   provided    welfare plans.
         During the late 1960's and early       1970's,    reports in the press began to
surface    about companies who reneged on or were unable to keep promises to        pay
retirement   benefits. In addition, concern over workers' difficulties in vesting
                                       —12—




was expressed in several Congressional hearings.10 This discussion prompted

passage of the Employment Retirement Income Safety Act (ERISA) of 1974; its

purpose was "to reduce the risk of workers not receiving adequate pension bene-

fits, despite long—term participation in a firm's pension plan, by establishing

funding standards, reporting requirements, and regulations on information that

must be provided to participants and minimum vesting rules" (Masters et al, p.43).

1. Policy Overview

ERISA establishes minimum standards with which a pension plan must comply,

including (Skolnick, 1974):

       a. Participation: A full—time employee must be allowed to participate
          in a plan if he is at least age 25 and has worked at the firm one
          year.

      b. Vesting: The employee has full legal rights over employer pension
         contributions after having fulfilled one of three vesting require—
         merits (the most cornnioii l)Lng 10—year "cliff vesting").
                                                                      Emaloyee
         contributions are immediately vested.

      c. Information. Employees must be provided with an annual statement on
         their benefit and vesting status; the Department of Labor must
         receive periodic reports on a plan's financial standing.

      d. Financial: All plans promising a specified benefit to retirees
         (defined benefit plans) are required to accumulate funds in com-
         pliance with actuarial principles. Unfunded liabilities must be
         amortized over a period oF 30 years in most cases. A governmental
         non—profit firm, the Pension Benefit Guarantee Corporation (PBGC),
         insures a portion of defined benefit plans income by charging a
         flat per—worker premium. In case of plan illiquidity, the PBGC
         can claim up to 30% of a firm's assets to cover benefits promised.

      e. Fund_management: Pension plan sponsors are personally liable for
         pension investment performance if their investment advice is not
         in conformity with accepted money management practice (the "Prudent
         Man" rule).  (This applies to both defined benefit and defined
         contribution plans, where the latter specify how much is contributed
         to the plan, but not payouts.)

      f. Liidividual plans: Workers with no employer—sponsored plan may
         establish an Individual Retirement Account (IRA) or a Keogh plan
         (for the self—employed) into which tax—deferred contributions
         (up to a limit) may be deposited.
                                             - 3-


The law does not require employers to provide a pension nor does it interfere with

the determination of pension contribution or benefit levels. The          purpose   of the

minimum    standards, therefore, is to increase the      chances that a worker promised

a    pei-ision actually receives some form of retirement income from the employer

making the promise.

         Administration and enforcement of ERISA policy is allocated to several

different entities: the Labor Management Services Administration of the Labor

Department monitors pension plan reporting and disclosure, and pension fund

asset holdings. The Internal Revenue Service has responsibility for evaluating

plans' compliance with participation, vesting and funding standards established

in ERISA. In addition, the PBGC oversees plans' long—term and short—term finan-

cial status. Finally, individual employees are empowered to file suit against

plan administrators——if benefits are illegally withheld.

         Judicial decisions in the last decade have also modified the way ERISA

is interpreted. The most recent Supreme Court decision found that an employer's

pension promise should not be construed to be a guarantee of any particular

benefit level, real or nominal.          The long—term implications of this finding are

unclear at this juncture, but would seem to be far—reaching.

2. The   Impact   of Pension Reform Regulation

One group of      studies   evaluating the impact of pension policy classifies pensions

as   defined wages (Schiller and Weiss, 1979). In       this view, workers like group

pensions because (1) they       permit   tax deferral of income, and (2) they offer a

higher return on savings and lower insurance costs than individual plans could

provide (Mitchell and Andrews, 1981).

         This approach has been criticized for not explaining why most pension

plans require the employee to work for several years before vesting; why defined
                                        —14-




the wnrker's income level while working; and, why many pension systems are

underfunded (Logue, 1979). An alternative theory holds that pensions are an

implicit contract between workers and employers, designed to improve worker

productivity and lower turnover (Lazear, 1979c). Vesting and participation

requirements are understandable in this light. Pension underfunding has been

interpreted along the same lines (Treynor, Regan and Priest, 1976; Feldstein

and Seligman, 1980; Smith, 1981). The underfunded pension will pay off if the

firm is in good financial health, which induces workers to internalize incen-

tives to become more productive, exhibit lower turnover, and require less super-

vision. The existence of defined benefit plans which are unrelated to workers'

salaries may be explained by the view that workers are risk—averse, and prefer

a flat dollar benefit with certainty to a benefit based on a worker's own

(uncertain) income stream as he nears retirement age.

          Though the different theories emphasize distinct aspects of the private

pension system, no one yet knows what role pensions actually play in the labor

market. For this reason, there is some disagreement about the expected impact

of ERIISA regulations in the literature. Those who believe the labor market

behaves   according to neoclassical rules predict that ER1SA lowers the riskiness
of a pension promise, by virtue of which   the pension promise becomes more

expensive.    In response to more costly but   more secure pensions, workers' wages

and/or benefit levels may fall; however, expected total compensation over

individuals' lifetimes would not necessarily change (Schiller and Weiss, 1980).

On the other hand, the justification for ERISA might be different in a less

neoclassical labor market. Research by Hamermesh (198la), for instance, suggests

that workers have very imprecise ideas about their own health and life expect-

ancies, implying that they do need help planning their retirement savings.
                                            -15-




Employees, especially at younger ages, tend to value pensions at a relatively

low rate (Mitchell, 1980, 1982), suggesting that unions and other institutions

are useful in making them more aware of the need for pensions (Custman and

Segal; 1972; Lester, 1967), and in redistributing income via pensions (Freeman,

19??). ERISA is needed in this non--neoclassical environment because it protects

workers against the possibility of fraudulent pension nonreceipt. There is also

some   evidence that   pension managers are less than perfectly "rational" in the

economic   sense,12and might   not reduce   other elements of the   compensation   package
in   response to the greater security of pensions.

        Before turning to the results of empirical studies on the effects of ERISA,

several comments are required on the severe data problems encountered by any

would—be empirical researcher in this area. Perhaps the single most serious

problem is that there is no way to measure the outcome variable of greatest

interest to many researchers; i.e., the lifetime consumption and pension benefits

eventually received by today's workers, as compared to what they were promised

(and, perhaps, to previous cohorts' benefits). Until today's workers retire from

the labor market, it will be impossible to determine what they actually received

in total compensation. An additional problem is that it has been difficult to

quantify the appropriate policy variable(s) associated with ERISA. For these

reasons, empirical research on ERISA is almost nonexistent. The few available

studies have focused on other (non benefit) factors: for instance, analysts have

examined pension portfolios (Cummins et al, 1980), the impact of underfunding

on firms' stock prices (Feldstein and Seligman, 1980 Gersovitz, 1980), and the

costs of administering pension plans (Mitchell and Andrews, 1981, and Andrews

and Mitchell, 1981). No one has carefully and systematically analyzed whether

and how ERISA has changed wage and/or pension benefit levels and employees'

rights to pensions; no one has determined whether pension plan termination
                                      —16-




 patterns are attributable to the regulation or the poor financial market; and

 there are virtually no representative pre—ERISA data that can be used to

  determine scientifically whether the regulations had any effect on any outcome

variable over time. Therefore we must conclude at the outset that empirical

evidence on the impact of ERISA is almost nonexistent and the few available

studies do not examine the effect of the regulation on compensation levels,

income distribution, employment patterns, or many other dependent variables of

interest.

        Two descriptive and two quantitative empirical studies focus directly

on the impact of ERISA reforms. Logue (1979) and Ture and Fields (1979) sketch

evidence on vesting and participation rules before and after ERISA, but do not

develop a systematic empirical model. Cummins et al (1980) and Cummins, Percival

and Westerfield (1979) analyze non—labor market aspects of the regulatory impact;

 the first paper focuses on plan administrators' attitudes about extra costs

attributable to the law, while the hatter paper attempts to determine whether

ERISA had any significant impact on the portfolio composition of pension funds

(Chapters 3 and 4). Both studies found little if any evidence that ERISA affected

pension plan operation, though the former article suggested that costs for

multi—employer plans may have been increased somewhat.

        Two additional studies examine the impact of ERISA indirectly by

focusing on pension underfunding patterns. Gersovitz (1980) finds that pension

underfunding tends to lower a firm's stock prices, but only to the extent that

underfunding is less than one—third of the firm's assets. This is significant

because under ERISA, a pension plan has claim to that proportion of the

company's assets; this study thus implies that ERISA indeed influences the

probability of retirees receiving promised pensions.     Nonetheless, the report
                                          -1 7-




 by Bulow (1979) shows that ERISA's regulations on pension underfunding are likely

 to be ineffective since actuarial assumptions are not specified in the law,

 and firms can alter their reported level of underfunding simply by selecting

 different actuariaL assumptions. Finally, two studies (Mitchell and Andrew,

 1981; Andrew and Mitchell, 1981) find that larger pension plans benefit from

 scale economies, arid suggest that ERISA may encourage plan merger by standardizing

 pension characteristics.

 3. Effects of ERISA on Levels of Well Being

          Has the change in policy expressed in ERISA had any significant impact

on society's level and distribution of well—being? As should be clear from the

preceding discussion, the paucity of studies evalluating the effects of ERISA on

the labor market makes it impossible to answer this equity question. Some overall

descriptive material on the income distribution of retirees is available from

various sources; for instance, the Presidents' Commission on Pension Policy (1981)

finds that poverty among those over 65 years of age has declined relatively

and absolutely over time, in part due to increases in private pension income.'3

However, no one has attempted to evaluate how much of this change in income was

due to ERISA regulation, and how much is attributable to other causes. No study

has determined whether groups who traditionally received little from pension

 plans,such as women and blacks, have indeed benefited from ERISA as a result

of the less strict vesting and participation requirements. Impacts on the rest

of the   economy have been   largely ignored this far: Cummins, et al (1980)

suggest that small firms might he most seriously affected by the regulation, but

careful analysis of this topic remains to be done.

4. Conclusions

         One of the most surprising features of the literature on ERISA is that
                                       - 3-


there is so little of it, and that it is so unsystematic. In part this is

explained by recognizing that pensions have become a topic of research interest

only recently, and their role in the labor market and the economy as a whole

is as yet not completely clear. This review of studies available to date suggests

that ERISA has had no significant effects on the outcome variables examined ——

pension portfolios and administrative costs —— but no data are yet available
 to address the issue of whether ERISA has affected benefit levels and/or benefit

security for current or future retirees. It is hoped that researchers in the

1980's will devise better ways to fill some of the gaps identified here.

          We also suggest that various reform proposals discussed in the last decade

deserve serious research scrutiny. Some analysts suggest that existing regulations

governing investment of fund assets are too restrictive and should be relaxed

to permit a more innovative investment pattern (Rifkin and Barber, 1978). Others

recommend looser participation and vesting provisions, to benefit workers with
                                                                14
short job tenure who have difficulty qualifying for benefits.        A few researchers

have begun to investigate the Tros and cons of indexing pension benefits to

inflation (Feidstein, 1981 ; todie, 1980).Some urge the establishment of a

mandatory private pension system covering all workers, a position particularly

favored   by the Presidents' Commission on Pension Policy (1981). Finally,
several researchers have proposed that the PBGC be revamped in light of its low
level of reserves and its lack of experience rating (Treynor, Regan and Priest,
1976).      As yet however, all of these proposed reforms remain in the planning
stages.
III. Federal Ninimum Wage Policy
          Minimum wage legislation grew out of national concern over workers'

standards of living and how to best improve them. During the 1920's and '30's,
                                           — 9-



 proponents of the policy argued that employers should not be permitted to pay

 workers below—subsistance income. Thus a wage floor was expected to be and is

 still touted as an anti—poverty (Levitan and Belous, 1979). Opponents then and

 now contended that a legislated wage floor would be ineffective against poverty,

 since low wages reflected low productivity rather than exploitative employer

 practices (Welch, 1)78). This portion of the paper reviews theoretical and

 empirical minimum wage research over the last decade.

 1. Policy Overview

           The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) was passed in 1938, to bring about

a "minimum standard of living necessary for health, efficiency, and general

wellbeing of workers.., without substantially curtailing employment or earning
          15
power".        The bill was of necessity born of compromise; several earlier efforts

to implement state specific wage floors had failed in the courts, and Roosevelt's

attempt to establish industrial wage minimums under the National Recovery Act

met a similar fate in 1935. Initially the FLSA was limited to the 20%

of the workforce engaged in interstate commerce. For employees subject to the

law, the Act set a wage floor of 25 cents an hour for both men and women, or

about 1/2 of the average hourly wage in manufacturing at the time.'6 The

minimum has risen over time and now      stands   at about half the average manu-

facturing wage (F. Welch,     l978).17   Coverage increased over the last 40 years

from about 40 to about 80 percent of non agricultural civilian nonsupervisory

employees.      Administrative and enforcement powers under the FLSA were granted
to a special Wage and hours ijivisioti of the Department of Labor. The Labor
Department     was given responsibility for granting exemptions to the law where

specified, including for companies with annual sales under a quarter of a million

dollars.

2. The Impact of Minimum Wage Policy

          A simple neoclassical model of the effect of a minimum wage was first

stated four decades ago (Stigler, 1946) If employers and workers are

competitive, a minimum wage set above the competitive level will reduce

employment because firms cannot pay workers more than the value of their marginal

product and thus the wage floor induces layoffs of workers that would otherwise

be earning less than that floor. The extent of disemployment is a function of

labor demand elasticity when coverage is universal and the wage floor uniform

across workers (Welch, 1978), and of how high the wage floor is set. Incomes

fall to zero for those who lose their jobs, and the overall distribution of
                                   18
earnings becomes more unequal.

          Theoretical neoclassical research of the 1970's elaborated on this simple

textbook approach in several ways. llashimoto and Mincer (1970) recognized that

Sonic firms are exempt from FLSA provisions, implying that they may lower

wages and absorb those laid off from covered sector jobs. Wachter and Kim (1979)

pointed out that some individuals may be unwilling to take uncovered sector jobs,

preferring instead to remain unemployed in the hope of finding a job at a higher

covered—sector wage. Therefore, Mincer (1976) concludes that unemployment rates

are not particularly good measures of the impact of wage minimums. Other

authors (Hainermesh, 1981) stress that firms' responsiveness to a wage floor

depends   on the   ease   of substitution between skilled and unskilled workers. A
general   equiUbrium long—run    theoretical model of the impact of a minimum wage
which   takes into account: both physical and human capital formation has not yet

been analyzed in detail, though recent efforts by Cox and Oaxaca (1981) are

promising.

          Though neoclassical models of the minimum wage impact grew increasingly
                                            —21—




 sophisticated over the last decade, their theoretical predictors became less and

 less clear cut, In general, the following theoretical conclusions follow

 from   the analyses:
             1. A wage floor will reduce labor demanded in firms covered
                by the minimum, though the quantity and distribution of
                labor cutbacks depends on the level and coverage of the
                  wage minimum, labor and product demand elasticities,
               real
             substitutability of capital and labor of various types,
             and labor supply.
          2. Aggregate employment may or may not fall.
          3. Aggregate unemployment may or may not rise.
          4. The effect of minimum wages on the overall income distribution
             cannot be determined a priori.

Resolution of these theoretical ambiguities requires empirical analysis.

          Theoretical neoclassical models of the minimum wage have been

challenged from three directions. All three emphasize labor market inefficiencies

due to employer behavior; in contrast to the literature on other forms of labor

market regulation, virtually no attention has been devoted to other labor

market structures that might justify government regulation.

          One interesting case, mentioned by Stigler (1946) and others, arises

when empioycrs     are   monoposonists and control labor purchases completely.

In this type of market, a wage floor set high enough forces the monopsonists
                                                               19
to   raise wages and employment without reducing efficiency.        The single

quantitative paper on this topic, West and McKee (1980) reports that firms' output

indeed tends to rise significantly after the wage minimum is raised. If this

finding is supported in other data, it would constitute an important argument

in   favor of minimum wage policy.
         A    second rationale for a wage floor was elaborated in the early

writings of Webb (1912). He held that workers respond to higher wages by

becoming more productive, so that a wage floor may improve earnings without
                                             —2—


 lowering employment at all. Why        employers   do not pay enough to benefit

 from this wage—productivity interaction is as yet unclear in the literature.

A third argument for a minimum wage is usually termed the "shock theory".

It states that employers are slow to adopt productive new technology, but a

wage floor induces them to overcome this lethargy by investing in more innovative

production techniques. Whether or not innovation in this form contributes

to net employment increases or not, and why employers are slow to adjust, is

unclear. These two rationales for a wage minimum seem to raise more questions

than they answer, and require more theoretical and empirical attention before

they can stand on their own.

        The empirical literature on minimum wages is voluminous, perhaps

larger than on any other single labor market regulation. Its quality is,
                   20
however, uneven.        Most studies identify employment rates (or levels) as the

dependent variable of most interest, though some concentrate on unemployment.

In part, this relatively narrow empirical focus was a result of data shortcomings:

aggregate figures on employment were typically easier to obtain than were other

data. One disadvantage of an        aggregate   focus is that changes in group composition

when people leave and enter the ranks of the unemployed may affect results.

As individual level micro data become available, this problem of sample

selection began to be addressed. Relatively few studies focus on the distribution

of individwd or faniily income.         Fewer studies still analyze changes in income
patterns over time and     over   peoples'   lifetimes.
        Data problems have also made it         difficult   to develop good measures of

the appropriate policy variables. In any particular cross section of firms, all

covered employers must offer the same minimum.2' This uniformity means that

cross section data do not contain a "control group" with which firms covered by
                                     -23-



the law can be compared. Some cross section studies develop a variable

which is the ratio of the federal. wage minimum to some area—specific average

wage, often multiplied by a variable proxying for coverage. This approach

may be criticized by recognizing that regional variation in wage levels often

reflects not minimum wage level differences, but other labor market features

(like industrial structures) which may more readily explain regional disemployment.

Other analysts use time series data, on the argument that changes in the price

level and in the nominal wage floor over time should provide the empirical

variation required for quantitative analysis. Time series studies have drawbacks

too, because they pick up changes in workforce composition as females and youths

entered the labor market. Finally, both cross section and time series studies

have found it difficult to distinguish between the impact of the minimum level

and coverage, since policy changes usually alter both variables at the same

time.

        With few exceptions, empirical studies tend to focus on teenage

employment patterns, because this demographic group is the most numerous, the
                                                                     22
least skilled, and probably most susceptible to disemployment effects.

Keeping in mind the methodological and data differences across studies, the

time series evidence suggests that a 10% increase in the minimim wage is

associated with a 0.5% to 1.5% decline in youth employment; cross sectional

evidence is more variable but also spans that range (Brown, Gliroy and Kohen,

1980). Some analysts claim that the wage floor has a larger disemployment effect

on blacks than on whites, but this contention is as yet only weakly supported

in the data.

        Studies on adult employment response to the minimum wage are even more

inconclusive; analysts disagree not only on the magnitude but also the sign of
                                         —24—




 the impact. Hamermesh (1981b) claims that adult employment is marginally

enhanced by the minimum wage, while Gramlich (1976) finds no response.

Mincer   (1976) concludes that older males and many females   lose jobs, but

Parsons (1980) argues that adult females are, on net, not adversely affected.

This evidence is thus contradictory and will remain so until empirical work

controls for compositional changes in groups under study and identifies

substitution between different kinds of labor and capital.

         While the majority of studies takes a static perspective, a few analysts

examine labor market dynamics as workers and firms adjust to new wage minimums

over time. Here the conclusions are also in disagreement: Zucker (1973)

reports that about 4/5 of the total employment changes occured within six

months of a change in the minimum. This rapid adjustment is confirmed by

Hamermesh (1981), but Moore (1971) in earlier work, found a much slower

adjustment pattern. More research is needed on this topic in future years.

3. Effects on Well Being

         Many have inquired about the distributional effects of the minimum.

Welch (1978) and Parsons (1980) conclude that many minimum wage workers are from

reasonably well—to—do families. Gilroy (1981) puts it differently (p.179—81)

                 1tAs one might expect, a large proportion —— 43 percent ——
              of those workers in families below the official poverty level
              are making the minimum wage or less.. .Wliat is surprising is that
              these workers account for only 11 percent of all mimimun wage
              workers."

I.n general, the policy does not appear to   benefit the poor relatively more

when evaluated in cross   section data or even over short periods of time. This
conclusion   may he altered as new data become available on the impact of the

wage floor on workers' skills and lifetime income patterns: studies by Mincer

and Leighton (1980) and Ehrenberg and Marcus (1980) conclude that the life—long

impact of minimum wage coverage may lower income for low wage workers.
                                             —2 3—




 4. Conclusion

              The literature on one of the oldest forms of labor market regulation, the

minimum wage, contains some strengths and some weaknesses. To a great degree,

 appi   led   researchers in the last decade have tested only neoclassical empirical

models.        The available   evidence suggests that teenage employment is somewhat
lower than it could be as a result of wage floors, though in the long run
effects are as yet uncertain. A less clear picture emerges about the impact
of   the minimum wage on adult employment. Our understanding of how the policy

affects the distribution of income is as yet rudimentary; as better micro

data on firms and workers are developed, this shortcoming must be remedied.

              It must also be recognized that existing empirical studies have not

viewed broadly enough the context in which minimum wage policy operates.

Other institutions, regulations, and social policies also affect the eventual

income distribution of earnings and nonlabor income, and should be taken into

account as well. For instance, levels of and eligibility rules for welfare

programs vary across regions and over time, influencing the payoff to work and

participation as well as unemployment. Unemployment insurance plays a major

role for some workers. Income and other taxes alter the relative returns to

working as do in—kind transfers and their eligibility requirements. The role

of labor unions in establishing and maintaining prevailing wages has not yet

been taken into account in studies which purport to evaluate the minimum wage,

either. The interactions of poLitics and institutions should he examined in

order    to develop   a clearer   understanding of the contribution of each to the
distribution      of income and employment. They are usually not, however.

              Even this brief review of minimum wage policy would be incomplete

without mentioning some of the more controversial topics surfacing in recent
                                          —26—


years. The Report of the Minimum Wage Study Commission (1981) touches on several:

What would result from a special subminimum for youth? On this topic, Brown (l981b)

Hamermesh (1981) ,    and Freeman, Gray and Ichniowski (1981) come to quite divergent

conclusions. Should the wage floor be indexed to inflation? Does the minimum wage

cause wage structure compression, or do employers maintain traditional wage differ-

entials? Should the minimum be tailored to specific industries and regions?

Evaluating these questions will, no doubt, receive a great deal of attention in

the 1980's. Whether the wage minimum is the best way to alleviate poverty is an

add   Ltionai important concern that   must   also   he examined   in the   next decade.


IV.    Antidiscrimination Policy
           Prior   to the 1960's individual states     had a variety of bills on the
books protecting workers treated unequally because of race, sex, or age (Landes,
1968). At the Federal level, some concern over discriminatory practices was
embodied in the     1938 Fair Labor Standards Act, but this law protected mainly
against    long hours and poor working conditions. Not until the 1960's did Federal

regulation directly confront the labor market problems of minorities and women.

This section evaluates what we have learned in the last decade about the
                                                                            23
impact of Federal antidiscrimination policy on blacks and women.

1. Policy Overview

          Covcrnmc'nt policy toward labor market discrimination in the 1960's found

expression in two major pices of legislation: the Equal Pay Act of 1963, and

Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act. The Equal Pay bill focuses specifically

on sex discrimination, by prohibiting employers from maintaining separate pay

scales for males and females. The law specifies that men and women must receive

the same wage when they work at the same establishment, performing equal work

which requires the some skill, effort and responsibility ("equal pay for equal
                                                —27-




work"). It does permit pay differences across workers performing different

jobs, or where seniority and piece rate systems produce different earnings

outcomes.

           Title VII of the Civil Rights bill contrasts with the Equal Pay Act

because it proscribes discrimination due to race, religion and national origin

as well as gender. Its pay provisions are broader than those in the Equal Pay

Act because they are not explicitly limited to comparisons across equal jobs.

Employment provisions figure prominently in this law: it prohibits unequal

practices in hiring, training, promotion or discharge. A novel feature of this

bill is that it establishes an enforcement arm, the Equal Employment Opportunity

Commission       (EEOC), .lcrrged   initially wi Lii   conciliation   arid   preparation   of court
                                                                                                      24
briefs and       later   permitted to initiate court proceedings and           represent employees.

           A second important antidiscrimination           tool wielded by      the federal govern-

ment is its leverae as a purchaser of goods and services. Executive Order 11246

(as amended in 1968) requires government contractors not only to abide by

existing antidiscrimination law, but also to             take affimative action in hiring,
training       and promoting minorities and women. If a firm is found in noncompliance,

it may lie penalized in       several   ways, including debarrment in the most extreme case.

           In   addition to   Congressional Acts and administrative practice, a third

antidiscrimination        tool became   important during the 1960's and 1970's: judicial
          25
action.         The Supreme Court     took   active stances in several important cases.

Incriggs v. Duke Power (197.1) for instance, it prohibited pre—employment tests

which selected against racial minorities more often than whites, when they did

not predict successful performance on the job.                The principle of retroactive

back pay was examined in a case involving American Telephone and Telegraph,

culminating in a $38 million negotiated settlement for women employees (Wallace,

1976). More recentl.y the Court has examined particular affirmative action plans.
                                                       —:s—




In the Weber case, for instance, the Supreme Court found that a degree of reverse

discrimination was permissible under Title VII.

             Cases involving yet another principle have begun to emerge in the last

few years. The controversey here is the principle of "equal pay for comparable

worth", which holds that men's and women's pay rates should be equalized for

jobs which are in some sense comparable though not identical (Livernash, 1980;

Lindsay, 1980; Milkovich, 1980).                     The Supreme Court's recent (1981) decision

on County of Washington v. Gunther was less than definitive on this new principle,

because of several narrow interpretations of the legislative record. It is likely

that this topic will continue to find its way to court during the 1980's.

2. The Impact of Antidiscrimination Policy

             One of the most interesting features of national antidiscrimination

policy is that it regulates labor market outcomes rather than labor market

processes. Thus it differs from, say, health and safety policy which establishes

standards for working conditions but does not specify worker health levels.

This focus on outcome has some drawbacks: if the nature of discrimination is

poorly understood, required changes in labor market processes may not occur as

a result of policy (Marshall, 1974). On the other hand, a result of the law's

focus    on outcomes           is that policymakers have been forced(with some difficulty)

to focus on workers' earnings and employment patterns directly.

            Bvcanse the regulatory               approach   is so direct, it might be thought that

ant   icliscr iti ina   t on   pci icy   might   be more    successful   than other laws in attaining
its    goals. Neoclassical theorists find some ground for disagreement, however.

Analysts in this tradition note that Federal pay provisions, in particular, can

have unexpected results: raising blacks' or womens' wages may encourage employers

to hire fewer of them,in favor of (now relatively cheaper) white males (Madden, 1973).
  The simple theoretical approach suggests, then, that higher pay may be offset

 by employment losses for blacks and women.

         Though equal pay regulations may be ineffective, employment and affirm-

 ative action provisions are more likely to reduce barriers confronting minorities

 and females, according to neoclassical analysts. These barriers arise from

 what Becker (1957) calls "tastes for discrimination" on the part of employers,

 fellow workers, and/or consumers. When equal employment legislation is effect-

 ively enforced, employers will find it expensive to avoid hiring women or blacks,

 and will increase their demand for these types of workers. If qualified females

 and minorities are available for hire, the policy should, on net, improve their

 earnings and employment both in absolute terms and in comparison with white

male workers. The effectiveness of this policy is further enhanced if misinformed

employers do not realize that women and minorities are as productive as are

white males, and the law forces them to revise their expectations (Cain, 19).

        Challenges to the neoclassical view of the labor market and policy are

quite numerous. Some authors emphasize that unequal outcomes occur because

workers face difficulties in other markets. For instance, black workers have

often paid more than whites for housing, transporation, and education (or

received lower quality for the same price) as well as other services (Kain,

1968; Danziger and Weinstein, 1976; Welch, l973;Butler, 1981). Women also face

non-labor market barriers of various types (Loury, 1981; Frank, 1978). To the

extent that these non—labor market factors determine entry to jobs and training

opportunities, females and minorities find good jobs less accessible. Anti—

discrimination policy was thus complemented by housing and educational subsidies

of the last decade.

        A second and influential group challenging the neoclassical model is
                                     -o-

the dual labor market analysts (Doeringer and Piore, 1971). Writers in
this group postulate that various institutional labor market features explain

the lower job attainment of blacks and women, including co—workers' unwilling-

ness to bring blacks and women into training and apprenticeship programs

(Briggs and Foitman, 1981), inability of employees to turn educational

skills into monetary rewards (Oaxaca, 1973), and difficulties of women and

minorities in holding jobs once hired (Marston, 1976). In this view,

vigorous affimative action was likely to be quite valuable in altering

discriminatory labor market structures.

        Monoply and monopsony have been emphasized in still other studies as

factors contributing to the persistence of unequal pay and employment for women

and blacks. Stiglitz' (1973) analysis led him to conclude that employer

monopsonies were not strong enough to explain lower earnings for females

and minorities, but more recent researchers find that monopolistic firms

pay black workers less (Haessel and Palmer, 1978). Few alternative job

opportunities for women is given as the explanation for lower wages in other

studies (Frank, 1978; Cardwell and Rosenzweig, 1978); thus firm—side market

power appears to depress women's earnings as well as blacks'. Others note that

unions were discriminators in the past (Wallace and Driscoll, 1981), barring

entry to all but white males. High union wage levels might also have facilitated

employer discrimination indirectly, by creating a labor pool from which

employers   could select only the workers that they favored. Analysts writing
in   this vein tended to conclude that the equal pay and especially the affim—
ative action provisions of antidiscrimination   policy would be especially

important   in helping women and blacks override monopsonistic and union barriers.
       Making the transition from theoretical to empirical policy analysis
                                       —3 L-




  proved to be difficult for many researchers, in
                                                       part because of several data

  problems. Freeman (1973), Butler and Heckman (1977) and Brown (1981a)

  have written extensively on the fact that aggregate data can      conceal   flows
  of workers in and out of the labor
                                       market, so that increases in reported earn-

  ings attributed to policy initiatives might be spurious. Almost equally

  problematic has been the empirical
                                       difficulty of finding policy variables that
  adequately reflect antidiscrimipation policy. Studies of compliance with

  federal contractors typically use companies without any federal contract

 as the "control group" for purposes of
                                               evaluating the impact of affirmative
 action policy. However, Brown (l981c) points out that federal contractors
                                                                             may
 differ systematically from
                            noncontractors, making the comparison erroneous.
 Osterman's (1981) policy measure is more precise, since the term he uses is

 an industry specific tally of contract reviews and compliance agreements.

 EEO studies have even more difficulty
                                         quantifying the policy variable of
 interest: Beller (1980) focuses on EEO investigations by type, but is forced

 by data constraints to limit her attention to state—level data rather than

 individual company and employee groups.

      Empirical studies of antidiscrjmjnation
                                                   policy may be divided into

federal contract compliance studies, and research on EEO. Prominent in the

first literature is a set of studies
                                       appearing in the Industrial and Labor
Relations Review in 1976, as well as the review by Brown (198lc). Ahart

(1976), for instance, provides a descriptive account of the difficulties encounter-

ed in enforcing the policy. The papers by Goldstein and Smith (1976) and Heckmen

and olpin (1976) are some of the better—known
                                                    econometric evaluations of the
micro—economic data. Flanagan (1976) and Brown (198lc) compile and examine the

evidence from time series and other studies.       Overall these studies indicate
                                       —32--



  that   federal contract compliance efforts were rather ineffective,

at least with respect to relative employment rates of blacks and whites.

Employment gains for black males are detected in a few studies (Brown (1981)

concludes no more than 10% in the long run"), but specific policy variables

like contract reviews are usually not responsible. No effect is found for

black females, in most cross sectional studies. Smith and Welch (1977) and

Freeman (1973) examine relative earnings of blacks, and suggest that racial

earnings differences between males were not strongly influenced by contract

compliance policy. Only the Osterman (1981) study detects a significant policy

impact, and that paper looks at turnover rates rather than earnings.

         Less quantitative research analyses the direct impact of EEO, in part

because of data problems noted earlier. A cross section study by

Belier (1980) uses data on the probability of EEO apprehension and of having

to pay a penalty to the EEOC or to state Fair Employment Commissions, derived

from actual data on EEO investigations by state. Interestingly enough, the

effectiveness of the law appears to differ across minorities and women: on

net, policy variables are found to reduce black employment and have

virtually no effect on black—white relative earnings; in contrast EEO

policy significantly narrowed the sex difference in earnings over time by 3

to 8%.26 A time series analysis by Freeman (1973) found that cumulative EEOC

expenditure had   a positive   and significant effect on relative black earnings.

Butler and Ileckmnn (1977) correct for sample composition bias noted above

and find virtually no effect of EEO variables. Smith and Welch (1979) also

cha1leng Freeman's conclusion, saying that an improvement in educational

quality was more likely the responsible factor in improving black relative

earnings.     Arriving at a firm conclusion in this area is difficult, but the
                                       —33-



  available evidence iindicates that women's relative earnings were marginally

  improved by EEO policy, while black/white employment and earnings differentials

 were probably not significantly affected.

 3. Impact on Wellhving

          It is difficult to evaluate the impact of antidiscrimination
                                                                         policy
 on the overall level and distribution of wellbeing. The consensus to date

 might be summarized as follows: overall employment probably was little affected

 by the policy, and relative earnings growth was largest for women. Both

 highly skilled females and minorities benefited more than did others (Freeman,

 1973).     No one has yet attempted an overall assessment of the short—run costs

 and benefits of antidiscrimination policy, nor a complete analysis of its effect

 on individual and family income and expectations. Long—run impacts have

 generally been neglected; two exceptions are found in Lazear's (l979a, 1979b)

work, which concludes that job advancement is much more likely for females

as a result of the policy initiatives, but not for blacks. Much research

remains to be done in this area.

4. Conclusion

      The main contribution of antidiscrimination analysis over the last decade

has been its new insights into real world labor market institutions.       Structures

coming under scrutiny include the role of hiring and personnel policy, on—the---

job training and apprenticeship, and the relationship between earnings, worker

characteristics, and firm—level variables. More analysis is needed on each

of these elements, in order to more fully understand how antidiscrimination

policy works when it does, and why it failed when it did. In general, existing

analysis indicates that antidiscrimiriation policy probably improved women's

earnings, and had little effect on black workers' earnings and employment.

V. Concluding Remarks

        Previous sections discussed the available research on workplace health

and safety, pensions, minimum wages, and discrimination in pay and

employment. It is also instructive to look across the policy areas to

appraise the literature as a whole.

1. Did the government policies attain their goals?

        Neoclassical and institutional research is uneven on the direct impact

of the four regulatory policies. The evidence indicates that EEO and OSHA reforms

had a positive though small effect on the outcomes they sought to alter; the

minimum wage probably did not improve earnings for most low skilled workers;

and no study examined whether ERISA improved pension security. More analysis

needs to be done on the direct as well as the second—round effects of these

labor market regulations, including their impact on total compensation

and employment, collective bargaining, organizational structure, and

whether they alter employer and worker attitudes. Most studies take a

fairly narrow perspective, looking only at one particular program or policy

at a time. A wider net must be cast to understand how any given policy initiative

interacts with other political and economic entities in the labor market.

2. What were the costs and benefits of these regulatory policies and to whom

did they accrue?

        Rational social decision making should be based on an understanding of

the level    and distribuL on   of costs and benefits associated with a given policy,

yet   the   literature is far from helpful in this regard. No researcher has fully

examined the direct costs of any of tile four policies including compliance and

enforcement expenditures. In only a few instances, analysts have investigated

which labor market groups benefited from regulations ——      the minimum wage
studies stand out as exceptions. There are also no studies of the effect of
                                    — 5—




these regulations on overall productivity, and virtually no analyses on how

the regulations altered the distribution of power between labor and management,

if at all, and between these parties and the government. Each of these questions

should be addressed in the next decade.

3. Was the actual regulatory package the best possible set of policy instruments

available to attain the desired goals?

      In evaluating existing programs, it is important to ask whether more

beneficial outcomes might have been achieved with a different set of policies,

given the same budget allocation and the same socio—economic circumstances.

Most of the regulations impose standards on employers, but a variety of other

schemes might be devised. For instance, many safety and health studies

mention alternative policy tools to reduce risks; the various options should

be enumerated and analyzed in other a'rs as well. We still have only a

rudimentary understanding of regulatory agencies' behavior, goals and constraints;

this gap must be filled too if realistic and feasible policy alternatives are

to be considered.

4. What kind of policy research is likely to be the most useful in the next decade?

      Labor market outcomes are the product of complex and fluid interactions

between workers and employers, operating in the context of a variety of social,

economic and political influences. Over the last decade, researchers have

realized ever more clearly that good policy analysis requires a thorough

understanding of what goes on inside the "black box" of the labor market. This

is necessary because policy affecting one aspect of the employment relationship

sometimes elicits unexpected reactions along other dimensions: for instance,

wages may decline in response to regulations about job or pension risk. The

most useful research must decode institutional and economic puzzles to find

out how they work. To date, some influential insights of this type have
                                     —36—



been provided by analysts of the discrimination area. To this analysis

must be added research on how policyinakers incorporate research findings

in developing new regulations a topic seriously understudied to date.

      The questions that remain to be answered are challenging. More

complete and sophisticated answers are beginning to emerge. However, if

this trend is to continue, more and better data are required than have been

available in the past ——   particularly   with respect to union, firm—level

and government behavior. It is hoped that recent cutbacks in federal

support for data gathering and research programs will not retard this

endeavour too seriously.

 5Mendeloff (1979) examined trends by analyzing changes in injuries over time,

 though 01 (1974) points out that several industries not targeted had higher injury

 rates in 1970.


 7Bacow (1980) has a succinct review of these studies.


 8Mendeloff (1979) suggest that male, blue collar, and union employees were

 perhaps the groups most advantaged by OSHA     policy,   but confirmation of this

 surmise awaits further research.

12For instance, Bulow's paper (1979) indicates that pension funds do not invest

solely in bonds, though economic theory predicts that they should.
                                     —38--




 13Most of the increase is probably attributable to real improvements in Social

 Security benefits.


14See, for instance, the hearings summarized in the President's Commission on

Pension Policy (1981).

      a summary of historical precedents to the FLSA and the Act's major provisions

see the Report of the Minimum Wage Study Commission (1981). Here we focus only on

the wage floor provisions of the Act.

16Iost of the minimum wage literature refers to "covered workers" though "subject

workers" is the more technically correct terminology. The distinction here is that

a covered worker may be exempt from the Act while a subject worker is both covered

by the Act and not exempt from its provisions. In fact it has recently been estimated

that one quarter of the employed wage and salary workers are covered, though exempt

from the minimum wage provision of the Act. (S. Welch, 1981).

'7Many states also established their own legislation governing wage and hours.

These state floors are typically less than or equal to the federal level, but

may cover more workers.


18Cramlich (1976) and Ragan (1977) recognize that workers hours might adapt rather

than employment, particularly if the firm bears hiring and training costs. This

does not materially affect the conclusions drawn from the model with respect to

total earnings and employment changes, however.

19Thether a national uniform wage minimum is likely to be "correct" for all firms

is unlikely, though how the correct levels might be set has not generated much debate

in literature.


20Several early efforts sponsored by the Department of Labor in the 1950's focused

on low—wage sectors such as the garment and lumber industries. Though these pieces
                                           —39




 usually concluded that the minimum wage had little or no deleterious effect on

 employment in these sectors, their empirical conclusions did not stand up to

 re—analysis by Peterson and Stewart (1969) and Brown, Gilroy, and Kohen

 (1980).


 21Ashenfelter and Smith (1978) argue, however, that compliance varies across fis

 and over time, depending on the cost and probability of being caught and penalized.

 Compliance is also influenced by regional and sectoral differences in wages and

 prices. Recent evidence indicates that minimum wage violations are concentrated

 among    the retail   and trade sectors of the economy, and disproportionately impact

 women   and teenagers. (Sd    .[ekaerLs and Welch, 1981).

22
     Teenagers under 18 years o]d         also covered by FLSA restrictions on child
labor. Hence for that subset of teens, the minimum wage may not be the only cause
of disemployment.

23Goldfarb (1974) has a well—organized review of papers appearing up to the early

1970's. The Report of the Minimum Wage Study Commission (1981) provides a

bibliography and review of several works the Commission sponsored as well as in-

dependent research. The paper by Brown, Gilroy and Kohen (1980) is perhaps the most

comprehensive.

24Antidiscrimination policy also covers workers indentifiable by religion, age,

handicap and    veterans    status. Less attention has been devoted to these areas,

however.


25See Smith (1980), Gold (1981) and Wallace and Driscoll (1981) for a review

and discussion of legislative issues.

26The    reduction in the earnings gap was largely due to lower male wages.

policy were estimated to he between 3 to 8%, higher in years of lower

unemployment.
