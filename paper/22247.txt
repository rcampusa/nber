                                           ABSTRACT

Large institutional investors own an increasing share of the equity markets in the U.S. The
implications of this development for financial markets are still unclear. The paper presents novel
empirical evidence that ownership by large institutions predicts higher volatility and greater noise
in stock prices as well as greater fragility in times of crisis. When studying the channel, we find
that large institutional investors exhibit traits of granularity, i.e., subunits within a firm display
correlated behavior, which reduces diversification of idiosyncratic shocks. Thus, large institutions
trade larger volumes and induce greater price impact.

1        Introduction

Recent decades have witnessed the rise of large institutional players in financial markets. Since
1980, the top 10 institutional investors have quadrupled their holdings in U.S. stocks. As of
December 2016, the largest institutional investor oversaw 6.3% of the total equity assets, and the
top 10 investors managed 26.5% of these assets. Observing these trends, regulators have expressed
concerns about systemic risks that could result from the high concentration of assets under a few
large actors. The main threat is that institutional investors, when experiencing redemptions,
liquidate their portfolios and destabilize asset prices, propagating the effect to other investors’
balance sheets. 1 Any potential implications of large institutional investors on the prices of the
securities they hold remain unclear and unexplored.

         Theoretical arguments suggest that large institutions should impact stock prices more than
small institutions. Gabaix (2011) posits that large market players are “granular,” i.e., shocks to
these agents are not easily diversified when aggregating across units and are reflected in aggregate
market outcomes. In particular, aggregate fluctuations can result from firm-level shocks if the
distribution of firms is fat-tailed. Applying this notion to financial markets, Gabaix, Gopikrishnan,
Plerou, and Stanley (2006) suggest that the trades of large investors can explain excess volatility.

         Drawing inspiration from this theory, our empirical contribution is twofold. First, we show
that ownership by large institutions is associated with larger volatility in the underlying securities
and that this increase reflects an increase in the noise embedded in stock prices. Moreover, we
show that during times of market turmoil, stocks with higher ownership by large institutions
display significantly larger price drops. This finding is relevant for regulators who are concerned
about financial stability.

         Second, when studying the channels behind these effects, we find empirical evidence
supporting the view that large institutions are granular, i.e., behavior within the subunits of a large
firm displays some correlation that limits internal diversification and exacerbates market impact.
Specifically, capital flows and trading strategies are more correlated across different entities within

1
  The Office of Financial Research (2013) identifies redemption risk as a major vulnerability of asset managers and
points to the fire sale channel as a source of systemic risk. Relatedly, a recent Financial Stability Board publication
(2015) remarks that, although research studying market contagion is abundant, a gap exists in the study of the potential
effect of large individual organizations.


                                                           1
the same institution than across independent managers. We interpret this evidence as the outcome
of centralized functions, such as marketing, research, and risk management, as well as of a unique
corporate identity that guides managers’ decisions and investors’ responses. These results can
explain why large institutions have a bigger impact on asset prices than a collection of smaller
independent entities. Consistent with this conclusion, we find that the trading activity of large
institutions explains their effect on volatility. Top institutions trade in larger volumes and have a
greater impact on prices.

       Our study has three parts. In the first part, we start from the hypothesis that large investors’
trading activity leads to more intense price pressure, which in turn translates into higher stock price
volatility. We confirm this prediction by showing a significant relation between ownership by top
institutions and stock-level volatility. The economic magnitude of this effect grows over time,
coinciding with the rise in the importance of large institutions in financial markets. Toward the
end of the sample, the effect is economically large: A one-standard-deviation increase in the largest
10 institutions’ ownership is associated with 16% of a standard deviation increase in volatility.
While our main tests focus on daily volatility, the effect is also present at lower frequencies
(weekly, monthly, quarterly), making it relevant for long-term investors as well.

       One might speculate that the increase in volatility that we identify is a desirable outcome
of institutional ownership. For example, large institutions could encourage information production
and faster price discovery. To shed light on this issue, we investigate whether large institutions are
associated with more efficient prices. In fact, focusing on daily return autocorrelation, we find that
stocks with higher ownership by top institutions display more negatively autocorrelated returns.
This evidence is consistent with the idea that large institutions impound liquidity shocks into
prices, which then revert, and lead to noisier prices.

       Next, we directly address regulatory concerns and study the effect of large institutional
investors on stock prices during periods of market turmoil. Given our conjecture that large
investors influence asset prices through a more intense demand for liquidity, we expect the prices
of the stocks that they own to be more fragile when aggregate liquidity is low. Accordingly, we
find that in turmoil periods, stocks with higher ownership by large institutions experience
significantly lower returns, while no effect on the level of returns is present in normal times.


                                                  2
        In the second part of the paper, we study the potential drivers of the previous findings.
Focusing on the granularity of large institutional investors, we ask whether different units within
a large firm display more correlated behavior than independent asset managers. The within-firm
correlation, in turn, would prevent the diversification of idiosyncratic shocks, causing these shocks
to have a larger impact on asset prices.

        We investigate several channels through which the organizational structure of large
institional investors can lead to greater volatility in the underlying stocks.

        First, intuitive arguments suggest that the various asset managers in the same institution
may experience more correlated capital flows than independent entities. For example, institutions
typically cultivate a brand name, and therefore affiliated entities are perceived as sharing the
destiny of the broader family. Similarly, distribution policies and cross-selling practices (e.g.,
funds offered in company pension schemes) may increase flow correlation. Consistent with this
conjecture, we find that the correlation of flows of mutual funds within the same family is
significantly higher than that of independent funds.

        Second, investment choices may be correlated across asset managers who operate under
the same institution. In particular, institutions often rely on a centralized research division that
generates investment views that inform trading decisions across the family. Thus, even though
different asset managers have leeway in their portfolio allocation, their behavior may display
abnormal correlation due to the family-wide investment directions. The evidence supports this
conjecture, as changes in portfolio holdings are significantly more correlated for mutual funds in
the same family.

        Third, we show that changes in portfolio holdings, which proxy for trading activity, explain
the relation between large institutions’ ownership and volatility. We drill down on this finding
using transaction-level data from Ancerno. We find that large institutions’ trades generate greater
price impact. The larger size of the trades of this investor class explains their greater impact on
prices. This evidence is consistent with the granularity of large institutional investors, as it suggests
that different units within the same firm are more likely to trade in the same direction, so that their
trades are bigger when they hit the market. In turn, this finding can explain why the prices of stocks
owned by large institutions are more volatile, noisier, and more fragile.


                                                   3
       The last part of the paper details a case study investigating the effects of large institutional
ownership on the volatility of the underlying stocks in a specific setting. We examine the merger
of two large institutional investors in 2009. Arguably, this merger is an exogenous event relative
to the determinants of the volatility of the underlying portfolios. Securities in the portfolio of the
smaller institution are, after the merger, owned by the largest institution in the market. Based on
our previous results, we expect their volatility to increase. Indeed, we find a significant increase
in post-merger volatility as a function of pre-merger ownership by the smaller firm (the treatment
variable).

       Overall, our results are consistent with the conjecture that institutional investors, through
their large trades, increase the volatility of the underlying securities. Our evidence contributes to
the understanding of the determinants of prices and volatility in financial markets.

       Our paper relates to a body of economic literature studying the impact of granularity in
several contexts. Acemoglu, Carvalho, Ozdaglar, and Tahbaz-Salehi (2012) and Kelly, Lustig, and
Van Nieuwerburgh (2013) study the effects on supply chains, and Blank, Buch, and Neugebauer
(2009) and Bremus, Buch, Russ, and Schnitzer (2018) study the effects of granularly large banks
on the banking industry. Corsetti, Dasgupta, Morris, and Shin (2004) develop a model that explains
the impact of one large trader on the behavior of small traders.

      In finance, we relate to a literature showing the impact of demand by institutional investors
on asset prices. Sias (1996) and Bushee and Noe (2000) find evidence that increases in institutional
ownership are accompanied by a rise in stock volatility. Our novel contribution is to identify large
institutional investors as a separate and more important contributor to stock price volatility. Other
studies have established that aggregate institutional ownership can affect the volatility and
correlation of asset returns and liquidity (Greenwood and Thesmar 2011; Anton and Polk 2014;
Ben-David, Franzoni, and Moussawi 2018; Agarwal, Hanouna, Moussawi, and Stahel 2017). Our
original contribution is to show that a few large institutions can induce this effect. Koijen and
Yogo (2019) estimate a structural model in which large institutional investors smooth their price
impact and therefore have a muted effect on aggregate market volatility. Different from these

authors, we provide direct reduced-form evidence on the effect of ownership structure on
volatility. 2

       The paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 lays out our testable conjecture with the aid of a
simple model. Section 3 describes the data. Section 4 explores the implications of large institutions
for asset prices. Section 5 investigates the channel. Section 6 explores the case study of a merger
of two large institutions. Section 7 concludes.



2        Hypothesis Development

To support our empirical analysis, we lay out a simple theoretical framework. Starting from
reduced-form equations on the behavior of asset managers and the price-setting mechanism in the
market, we develop an equation that illustrates a potential channel through which granular asset
managers impact asset prices. 3

       We assume that the dollar demand for a stock that a manager submits to the market depends
positively on the size of the manager’s portfolio. This reduced-form equation is the outcome of an
optimization problem. The manager responds to publicly observable signals, such as earnings
announcements, and idiosyncratic institutional shocks, such as unexpected redemptions by the
institution’s clients. Formally, the market demand for stock i by manager k at time t is a function
of the manager’s investment in the stock in the prior period, labeled 𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 :


2
  We also relate to a literature studying demand- and supply-side drivers of market liquidity, inspired by the theory of
Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2008). For example, Hameed, Kang, and Viswanathan (2010) and Aragon and Strahan
(2012) identify a significant role of supply-side determinants, which lead to systematic liquidity dry-ups during market
downturns. Karolyi, Lee, and Van Dijk (2012) and Kamara, Lou, and Sadka (2008) show that correlated demand for
liquidity, proxied by commonality in institutional ownership and related trading volume, is a prominent factor. Koch,
Ruenzi, and Starks (2016) show that correlated demand by mutual funds generates liquidity commonality, and
Agarwal, Hanouna, Moussawi, and Stahel (2017) document that ETF arbitrage and basket trading generates a distinct
liquidity commonality that dominates the effect of open-ended mutual funds. Our work identifies large institutions’
trading activity as a novel demand-side determinant of liquidity shocks. Ben-David, Li, Rossi, and Song (2020) present
causal evidence that correlated demand by mutual funds, that is generated by return-chasing behavior of mutual fund
investors, causes systematic return patterns.
3
  We draw inspiration from Greenwood and Thesmar (2011), but we differ from their work in highlighting the effect
of large institutional ownership as a distinct channel for price volatility. The authors, instead, focus on the correlation
and volatility of fund flows across asset managers and the concentration in the ownership base of a given company.
The structure of our theoretical framework is similar to that of Landier, Sraer, and Thesmar (2017), who study
concentration in the bank lending market. Similar reduced-form formulations for investors’ asset demands and the
price impact of trades are present in Gabaix, Gopikrishnan, Plerou, and Stanley (2006).

                         ∆𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑎𝑎𝑡𝑡 𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 + 𝜂𝜂𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 𝑓𝑓(𝐴𝐴𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘−1 ),                (1)

where 𝑎𝑎𝑡𝑡 is a common shock to all managers (e.g., driven by aggregate market news), with variance
𝜎𝜎𝑎𝑎2 , and 𝜂𝜂𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 is an idiosyncratic component (e.g., driven by the institution’s flows), with variance
𝜎𝜎𝜂𝜂2 . The two components are uncorrelated. Also, 𝜂𝜂𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 is uncorrelated across managers. 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 is the
weight of the stock in the institution’s portfolio. Intuitively, if the manager does not hold the stock,
idiosyncratic shocks, such as unexpected redemptions, do not affect the demand for the stock.

      𝐴𝐴𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘−1 is the total size of the institution’s portfolio. The function 𝑓𝑓 mediates the effect of the
size of the institution on the demand for the stock such that 𝑓𝑓 ≥ 0, 𝑓𝑓(0) = 0, 𝑓𝑓 ′ > 0, and 𝑓𝑓 ′′ ≤ 0.
This function captures the extent of granularity of a given institution. If institutions can fully
diversify idiosyncratic shocks internally, i.e., the case in which 𝑓𝑓 = 0, these shocks do not lead to
net demand for the stock from the institution. In this case, a large institution is closer to a collection
of many independent firms that are exposed to demand shocks that cancel out and do not increase
the net demand for the stock. At the other extreme, 𝑓𝑓 is a linear function (i.e., 𝑓𝑓 ′′ = 0) and
institutions are fully granular. In this case, the idiosyncratic shock scales up proportionally with
the size of the institution, and it fully translates into demand for the stock.

      The empirical evidence suggests that large institutions make efforts to smooth shocks
internally by exchanging assets across funds within a family in off-market transactions (Gaspar,
Massa, and Matos 2006; Bhattacharya, Lee, and Pool 2013). On the other hand, one can reasonably
conjecture that the entities within the same large institutions experience correlated flows and
implement correlated investment strategies. In other words, different entities within a large firm
may be exposed to correlated shocks. If this is the case, one can reasonably conclude that, while
the size of the shock may not grow linearly with the size of the institution, the reality is far from a
situation in which shocks are fully diversified internally.

      Based on models with asymmetric information (e.g., Kyle 1985) or risk-averse market
makers (e.g., Grossman and Miller 1988), we assume a reduced-form equation for the price impact
of trading. Specifically,

                                                          ∆𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖
                                     𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝜇𝜇 �                  + 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ,                         (2)
                                                          𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1
                                                 𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘



                                                                  6
where 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 is the market capitalization of the stock at time 𝑡𝑡 − 1. 𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 can be thought of as a
fundamental shock to stock prices, with a variance-covariance matrix across stocks given by
Σ𝑒𝑒 = 𝜎𝜎𝑒𝑒2 (𝜌𝜌𝜌𝜌 + (1 − 𝜌𝜌)𝐼𝐼), where 𝐽𝐽 is a square matrix of ones and 𝐼𝐼 is the identity matrix, and both
matrices have size equal to the number 𝐾𝐾 of managers in the market. To avoid unnecessarily
complicating notation, we assume the price impact parameter 𝜇𝜇 is the same across stocks.

            Combining Equations (1) and (2), and assuming the K investors hold all the outstanding
shares of stock i such that ∑𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 = 𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 , we derive the expression for the variance of stock
returns:
                                                                                                                   2
                                                                                         𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 𝑓𝑓(𝐴𝐴𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘−1 )
                       𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉(𝑅𝑅𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) =     𝜎𝜎𝑒𝑒2   +   𝜇𝜇 2 𝜎𝜎𝑎𝑎2   +     2 2
                                                                          𝜇𝜇 𝜎𝜎𝜂𝜂 � �                             � .                  (3)
                                                                                                  𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1
                                                                                  𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘

            Hence, the variance of returns has an idiosyncratic fundamental component, 𝜎𝜎𝑒𝑒2 ; a systematic
component due to aggregate shocks driving institutional trades, 𝜇𝜇 2 𝜎𝜎𝑎𝑎2 ; and a third component that
                                                                                                                                𝐴𝐴𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1
depends on the shape of the function 𝑓𝑓 and the structure of ownership. Because 𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 =                                                 , if
                                                                                                                                𝐴𝐴𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘−1

𝑓𝑓 is linear, the third term corresponds to the Herfindahl-Hirschman index of the managers’
ownership shares in the company. Intuitively, if stock ownership is more concentrated, the shocks
of individual managers are a bigger fraction of the stock demand and are less easily diversified
across managers. Hence, these shocks translate into stronger price pressure and higher variance
(Greenwood and Thesmar 2011).

            To develop further intuition, we divide and multiply 𝑓𝑓(𝐴𝐴𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘−1 ) by 𝐴𝐴𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘−1 in Equation (3).
Then, we can rewrite the stock price variance as
                                                                                                                          2

where 𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 =                  is the weight of the stock in the market portfolio. The first term in the brackets,
                       𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡−1
𝐴𝐴𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘−1
           , captures the size of an institution’s equity portfolio relative to the stock market. Because of
𝑀𝑀𝑡𝑡−1

this term, return volatility depends on the extent of ownership by large firms. Intuitively, the more
large institutions hold the stock, the greater the difficulty in diversifying idiosyncratic institutional



                                                                                   7
                                                                                                           𝑓𝑓(𝐴𝐴𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘−1 )
shocks when they reach the market through institutional trades. The second term,                                        ,
                                                                                                             𝐴𝐴𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘−1

attenuates the effect of institutional size, as a function of the concavity of 𝑓𝑓 (i.e., the extent of
granularity). Institutions that manage to diversify shocks internally, even if they are very large, do
not have a large price impact and, consequently, they have a smaller effect on volatility. Finally,
                     𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1
the third term,                     , modulates the impact of a given institution on return volatility as a function
                         𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1

of the holdings of that stock. For example, if a stock is not part of an institution’s portfolio, that is,
𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1 = 0, that institution does not contribute to return volatility.

      Let us consider the case of maximum granularity, i.e. when the function 𝑓𝑓 is linear. Further,
             𝑤𝑤𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1
let us set
              𝑞𝑞𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖−1
                          = 1 for ease of intuition. In this scenario, the variance depends exactly on the

Herfindahl-Hirschman index of the asset management industry. In such a case, when an asset
management sector is populated by atomistic managers, each owning a very small portfolio (i.e.,
𝐴𝐴𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘−1 ≈ 0 for all managers 𝑘𝑘), the effect of institutional shocks on volatility disappears. On the
other extreme, if only two large institutions are present in the market, the effect of those institutions
on return volatility is maximized.4

      Hence, Equation (4) contains the main testable prediction of the model:

Stock return volatility is positively related to the amount of that stock owned by large asset
managers. The magnitude of this effect depends on the extent of the granularity of large
institutions, i.e., the extent to which idiosyncratic shocks to an institution are not diversified
internally.

      In the next section, we study the relation between large institutions’ ownership and volatility.
Then, in the following part of the paper, we investigate the channel. In particular, we study the
factors that may limit internal diversification of shocks within large institutions.




4
  In fact, the effect on variance would be maximized if only one institution owned the entire market. This is not a
realistic scenario because in this case the institution would not find a trading counterparty and there would be no
foundation for Equation (2), which assumes that price concessions derive from trading activity.

3        Data Description

To construct our sample, we use institutional ownership data from the first quarter of 1980 to the
fourth quarter of 2016 from Thomson-Reuters and the original SEC 13F filings. 5,6 Appendix A
provides a list of all institutions that appear among the top 10 during our sample period.

         We identify the largest institutional investors in each quarter based on a rolling four-quarter
average of the rankings of their aggregate equity holdings. At the top of the ranking, we find a
firm, Barclays Global Investors (BGI), that held its position almost uninterruptedly from 1990 to
the end of the sample, experiencing a change in the denomination of the reporting entity in 1997
and a merger in 2009, which we will further discuss below. Overall, our sample contains 41 unique
institutions that fell within the top 10 institutions at some point during our sample period. They
hold an average of $169 billion (inflation-adjusted to the end of 2016) in assets in a given quarter
of our sample.

         We measure large institutional holdings as aggregated ownership by subsets of large
institutions, specifically the top 3, top 5, top 7, and top 10 institutional investors. We use all stocks
in the Center for Research in Security Prices (CRSP) universe, regardless of whether they are held
by the largest institutional investors. We use data from CRSP and Compustat to construct other
stock-level variables. Because the main variables from the 13F filings are at a quarterly frequency,
we construct all other variables at a quarterly frequency. Table 1, Panel A, provides summary
statistics for our sample of institutional investors. Further summary statistics are provided in
Internet Appendix Table IA.1. The top 10 institutional investors hold on average 8.1% of the
outstanding shares of a given stock, with a standard deviation of ownership of 9%. Ownership of
the average stock decreases for the combined top 11 through the top 20 institutions and beyond.
The top 30 through the top 50 institutions together hold 2.7% of the shares outstanding of the

5
  The 13F filings require all institutions with investment discretion over $100 million or more of U.S. equity assets at
the end of the year to provide detailed quarterly reports of their long holdings in these qualified securities in the next
year. See Ben-David, Franzoni, and Moussawi (2012) for institutional details regarding 13F data and an overview of
the Thomson-Reuters Institutional Ownership database.
6
  In our preliminary analysis, we noticed that the Thomson-Reuters’ data exhibit a substantial increase in stale holdings
reports and in the number of dropped institutions, starting in 2013. For example, we found that in 2015 Thomson-
Reuters’ data underreports institutional ownership in the 13F filings by about 10% due to omissions of institutions
and securities. Thomson-Reuters attempted to fix these data quality issues in subsequent updates, but, as of the latest
draft of our paper, certain omissions still exist in recent years of the data. In the Internet Appendix, we describe an
alternative data collection approach that overcomes these limitations and make it available to other researchers.


                                                            9
average stock in our sample. Ownership by large institutions can be compared to aggregate
institutional ownership. We observe that for the average stock in our sample, institutional investors
own 38% of its shares (Ownership by all institutions). 7

           Figure 1 plots the time series of the percentage of holdings of large institutions over our
sample period. We include the holdings of the largest institutional investor as well as those of the
groups of the top 3, 5, 7, and 10 largest investors. We observe that the percentage of total shares
outstanding held by large institutions in an average U.S. common stock is increasing over time.
For example, the largest institution in the economy more than quadruples its holdings from 1.4%
of the equity market at the beginning of the sample (1980) to 6.3% at the end of the sample (2016).
Similarly, the largest 10 institutions own 5.6% at the beginning of the sample and 26.5% at the
end. Over the same period, ownership by all institutions roughly doubles. Comparing this trend to
the faster growth of large institutions suggests that ownership has become more concentrated over
time. Appendix B provides a detailed description of the variables we use in the study.



4          The Relationship between Large Institutions’ Ownership and Asset Prices

4.1        Volatility

           The main testable prediction from Section 2 is that large institutions have a larger impact
on stock volatility than does a collection of smaller independent managers with the same asets
under management (AUM). To study the effect of large institutions on volatility, we start from a
simple specification:

      𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼 𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂𝑂ℎ𝑖𝑖𝑝𝑝𝑖𝑖,𝑞𝑞−1 + 𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝐶𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑖,𝑞𝑞−1 + 𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇 𝐹𝐹𝐸𝐸𝑞𝑞 + 𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆 𝐹𝐹𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖   (5)
                             + 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 .

           We estimate Equation (5) using ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions. The variables
are measured quarterly at the stock level. The dependent variable is stock volatility measured over
the calendar quarter. “Top institutional ownership” is the fraction of shares outstanding


7
  We note the maximum value of Ownership by all institutions is 1.27. Indeed, institutional ownership might be above
100%. This rare situation occurs when shares that have been short sold are double-counted. Lewellen (2011) discusses
these situations and concludes that they do not represent data errors, but rather are the result of short selling.


                                                                          10
collectively held by the top 3, 5, 7, and 10 institutions (Top insts ownership). We include the
following controls: lagged log(market cap), lagged book-to-market ratio, lagged past 6-month
return, lagged inverse price ratio (1/price), lagged Amihud illiquidity ratio (Amihud 2002), and
lagged total ownership by “middle” institutions (which reflects ownership by all institutions
ranked below the ones at the top, excluding those included among the bottom institutions, see
next). We also add a variable that measures the lagged Ownership by bottom institutions whose
aggregate equity holdings sum up to that of the largest 10 institutions. Using this variable, we can
verify whether the effect of interest originates from the size of assets under management,
irrespective of whether the assets are managed by top institutions. Lastly, our specifications
include stock and time (at the quarterly frequency) fixed effects. Standard errors are double-
clustered at the stock and quarter level throughout our analysis, unless otherwise specified.

         The estimates are presented in Table 2, Panel A. We note that up to the 30th largest
institution, the positive relation between ownership by large institutions and stock volatility is
statistically significant. The magnitude decreases substantially for institutional investors ranked
21st to 30th, and it is indistinguishable from zero for institutional investors ranked 31st to 50th.
Furthermore, the effect of ownership by the bottom institutional investors with the same total size
as the top 10 institutions is negative, consistent with the view that only large investors affect
volatility.

         We can calculate the economic magnitude of our results. Focusing on the top 10 investors
and using the summary statistics in Table 1, a one-standard-deviation increase in their ownership
is associated with an increase in volatility of 3.33% of a standard deviation (0.945*0.090/2.55).
As will be seen below, the effect is significantly stronger in the later parts of the sample period
(when the asset management industry consolidates) and for the largest institutional investors. In
the same specification, ownership by middle institutions has a magnitude of only 0.7% of a
standard deviation (0.082*0.228/2.55). Hence, the slope for large institutions is 4.5 times as large. 8

         Greenwood and Thesmar (2011) construct a fragility measure that captures the effective
concentration of ownership in a stock, weighted by the volatility and correlation of the trading

8
  In the specifications focusing on the top institutions (up to the top 10), the magnitude of the slope for top institutions
is larger than the slope for the “middle” ones by at least 42% and on average 205%. Therefore, the effect of top
institutions is economically more important than the effect of “middle” institutions by at least an order of magnitude.


                                                            11
needs of its investors. This variable accounts for large (i.e., concentrated) ownership stakes by
institutional investors, irrespective of the size of the institution. Instead, we focus our attention on
ownership by large institutions, as a channel distinct from large stakes by institutions of any size.
We find a high correlation (54%) between Greenwood and Thesmar’s (2011) fragility measure
and ownership by the top 10 institutions. Therefore, a test of whether the two effects can coexist
in the data is interesting. In Table 2, Panel B, we add Greenwood and Thesmar’s (2011) measure
to our main regression model. We again find that the coefficient on large institutional ownership
is positive and statistically significant. We conclude that ownership by large institutions and
fragility capture two partly independent empirical phenomena. This analysis suggests that
ownership by large institutions has an impact on volatility that is separate from the effect of
concentration, which is captured by the fragility measure. 9

         A potential channel is that large institutions operate on a bigger scale, for example, because
they are exposed to larger flows. Thus, when they rebalance their portfolios, they are likely to trade
a bigger chunk of the stock, for a given amount of ownership. 10 In Section 5, we explore this
trading channel and find supporting evidence.



4.1.1    Nonlinear Relation between Ownership and Volatility

         Next, we conjecture that the relation between volatility and ownership is nonlinear and
stronger for higher levels of ownership. If the channel behind the effect of interest is the price
impact of trades, as the model in Section 2 suggests, this effect should be stronger for higher levels
of ownership. When institutions own a small fraction of a stock, they can find multiple trading
counterparties. Thus, their price impact is contained. On the other hand, if a top institution owns a
large fraction of the stock, finding trading counterparties becomes more complicated and larger



9
  In Internet Appendix Table IA.2, we also show that large institutions’ ownership has a separate effect on volatility
from concentration, defined as the Herfindahl-Hirschman index of institutional ownership shares, although the two
variables have a high correlation, at around 70%. In a specification including both concentration and large institutions’
ownership, the explanatory power of the latter variable is strong and comparable to the magnitude in the original
specifications of Table 2, Panel A.
10
   This prediction is embedded in the theoretical model in Section 2. In Equation (1) of the model, the shocks to
trading, 𝑎𝑎𝑡𝑡 and 𝜂𝜂𝑘𝑘,𝑡𝑡 , are applied multiplicatively to the assets under management of the investor. Thus, larger investors
trade more intensely for the same realizations of the shocks.


                                                             12
price concessions become necessary. The impact of trading on volatility is, in the latter case, more
important.

        To test this conjecture, we create dummy variables denoting different intervals on the
distribution of ownership. Specifically, every quarter, we break ownership into four quartiles,
within each decile of market capitalization. The ownership ranking is done within stock size
deciles to control for correlation between ownership and the size of the stock, which in turn
correlates with volatility (e.g., institutions hold larger stakes in larger companies, which are also
less volatile). Then, we run the volatility regressions including three out of the four ownership
dummy variables, the baseline group being the first quartile. Standard errors are clustered by stock
and quarter.

        The estimates in Table 3 fully support this conjecture. The strength of the relation between
ownership and volatility is monotonically increasing from the first to the fourth quartile of
ownership. Thus, the positive relation between volatility and ownership is indeed nonlinear and
increasing in the level of ownership.



4.1.2   Subsample Analysis

        We next carry out subsample analyses to determine whether the effect of large institutions
on volatility changes over time. The increasing concentration in stock ownership implies that
finding trading counterparties for large trades is more difficult in recent times. Keeping other
market characteristics constant, the same amount of trading by a large institution should lead to
bigger price movements in recent times. On the other hand, stock market liquidity has significantly
improved over our sample period. It remains, therefore, an empirical question whether the impact
of large institutions on stock prices increases over time.

        We split our sample into three periods: 1980–1990, 1991–2003, and 2004–2016.
Corresponding results are shown in Table 4, Panels A, B, and C, respectively. We find that in the




                                                 13
first period, the coefficients on top ownership are generally indistinguishable from zero. However,
in the later two periods, the coefficients are positive and statistically significant at the 1% level. 11

        Furthermore, we run our regressions in annual subsamples and plot the coefficients in
standard deviation units for a one-standard-deviation change in ownership by the top 10
institutions. We report this result in Figure 2. It is evident from the graph that coefficients increase
over time. At the end of the sample, the effect of interest is nearly 16%, which is substantially
larger than the average effect in the sample (3.3%). The increase in the effect of interest tracks the
overall rise in the size of the largest institutional investors over time as reported in Figure 1. We
conclude that the economic magnitude of the relation between large institutions’ ownership and
volatility has grown along with the increase in their market share.

        The nonlinearity in the effect of ownership observed in Table 3, combined with increasing
ownership by large institutions (Figure 1), is a valid reason to conclude that the effect of large
institutions on volatility rises over time. In the later years of the sample, the distribution of
ownership by large institutions shifts to the right, which, combined with the nonlinearity in the
relationship between ownership and volatility, allows us to conclude that ownership is more
impactful in recent times.

        On the other hand, the effect of ownership on volatility should be similar for a given level
of ownership throughout time. To this purpose, we run the nonlinear specifications every year. In
this case, we define the dummy variables based on the quartiles of the ownership distribution over
the entire sample. In this way, we study the effect of the same level of ownership in different
periods. Internet Appendix Figure IA.1 reports a five-year moving average of the estimates for the
dummies corresponding to the second through the fourth quartiles separately estimated in each
year of the sample. We note that the dummies of the nonlinear specification do not display
meaningful trends, consistent with the idea that the same level of ownership has a stationary
relation to volatility over time.




11
  Summary statistics for these subsamples are in the Internet Appendix, Internet Appendix Table IA.1. In Internet
Appendix Table IA.3, we also report tests using different subsamples. We find that the effect of interest is present
during the 2007–2009 financial crisis and other crisis periods as well as outside of crisis periods.


                                                        14
4.1.2    Analysis by Size Groups

         Based on the conjecture that the channel behind the relation between ownership and
volatility is the price impact of trades, this relation should be stronger for smaller stocks, which
are less liquid and more prone to price impact.

         To evaluate this claim, we run the main specification separately in each of the five size
quintiles. The size quintiles are defined in each quarter. We focus on the top 10 institutions for this
test. The estimates are presented in Internet Appendix Table IA.4, Panel A. Panel B of this table
presents value-weighted regressions. The results confirm that the effect of large institutions’
ownership on volatility is stronger for smaller stocks. Overall, this finding corroborates the view
that the relation between ownership and volatility is channeled through trades.

4.2      Noise in Prices

         The analysis in Section 2 posits that large institutions increase volatility because of the
larger price impact of their trades. Price impact is a temporary movement in prices that is
subsequently reversed, i.e., it is noise. In what follows, we explore this conjecture by studying the
relation between large institutional ownership and return autocorrelation.

         Our tests follow the specification in Equations (5) and (6), replacing volatility with a
measure of return autocorrelation. Specifically, we use returns adjusted following Daniel,
Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers (1997, hereafter, DGTW 1997) to filter out return variation
originating from the size, book-to-market, and momentum stock characteristics and calculate the
autocorrelation of daily adjusted returns within a quarter.

         In Table 5, we report estimates from the regression of the absolute value of stock-return
autocorrelation on Top institutional ownership and controls, including stock and quarter fixed
effects. Standard errors are double-clustered at the stock and quarter level. The estimates suggest
a significantly positive relation between the absolute value of return autocorrelation and large firm
ownership (up to the top 10th institution).12




12
  Using the statistics in Table 1, a one-standard-deviation change in ownership by the top 10 institutions is associated
with a 1.6% of a standard deviation increase in the dependent variable.


                                                          15
       In sum, this evidence corroborates the view that large institutions’ trades are more
conducive to temporary price pressure than trades by smaller institutions. In other words,
ownership by large institutions seems to increase the noise in stock prices.



4.3    Price Fragility

       In periods of turmoil, portfolio liquidations become more likely and the trades of large
institutional investors may be more impactful than in normal times because they take place in an
already illiquid market. Therefore, top institutions’ trades may induce significant price dislocations
at these times.

      To test this possibility, we identify periods of market stress by focusing on the return of the
overall market. We identify bad times as quarters in which the realization of the excess market
return is in the bottom 5% of the quarterly return distribution. We test whether stocks with higher
ownership by top institutions earn significantly lower returns in these quarters.

      Because stock characteristics, beyond ownership by top institutions, can be a driver of
returns during times of market stress, we focus on DGTW-adjusted returns. We further control for
these effects through regression controls (size, book-to-market, and past returns). Additionally, we
control for liquidity-related effects by including measures of stock-level liquidity in the regression
(the Amihud ratio and inverse stock price). These controls absorb the known asset pricing and
microstructure effects that are unrelated to large institutions’ ownership.

      Table 6 shows the results of this analysis. We find that the relation between ownership by
large institutions and the level of returns is significantly negative in times of extreme market
conditions. Interestingly, the relation is not significantly different from zero in normal periods.
This effect is not present for lower-ranked institutions. Hence, we view this result as evidence that
orderly liquidations become harder for a large institution in times of market turmoil, given the
sheer size of the blocks that are brought to the market during these low liquidity episodes. The
economic magnitude is also important. For example, based on Column (4) and the summary
statistics in Table 1, in a bad quarter, a one-standard-deviation increase in ownership by the top 10




                                                 16
institutions is associated with lower quarterly returns by 9.17% of a standard deviation (–
0.191*0.073/0.148).

       The quarterly frequency at which we compute returns justifies the claim that the effect of
large institutions is not merely microstructure noise that washes out at lower frequency. Rather, it
persists at frequencies that are relevant for long-term investors. Consistent with the evidence in
Coval and Stafford (2007), we interpret this finding as the result of the persistence of portfolio
flows, which ultimately induces persistence of trades and price impact. 13

       The finding of a negative correlation between large institutional ownership and stock returns
during times of market stress is consistent with the view that large institutions, when engaging in
liquidations, impose a high liquidity demand on the market. This evidence supports regulators’
concern that large institutions may be destabilizing during times of turmoil. 14



5        The Channel: Granularity of Large Institutional Investors and the Price Impact of
Trades

Centralized functions, such as research, marketing, and risk management, may create correlated
behavior across the units within a large firm, which in turn generates correlated trades coming
from the various divisions within an organization (Brown and Wu 2016). These trades are likely
to have a significant price impact because they do not offset one another, but rather they hit the
market in the same direction. Price impact and volatility result from the price concessions that
liquidity providers require to accommodate the large trades. These effects are mitigated for
independent investors because their trading behavior is less correlated. Hence, the price impact of
the trades of independent investors should be less pronounced.




13
   Further supporting evidence of the persistence of the effect of large institutional ownership on prices at lower
frequency comes from Internet Appendix Table IA.10, Panel A, in which we use weekly, monthly, and quarterly
measures of price volatility as dependent variables.
14
   In the Internet Appendix, we also study the relation between skewness and large institutions’ ownership. In Internet
Appendix Table IA.10, Panel B, we find that stocks that are held by large institutions display significantly lower
skewness, which is computed nonparametrically as in Ghysels, Plazzi, and Valkanov (2016). This finding is consistent
with Table 6 and supports the conclusion that large institutional investors can be destabilizing for prices.


                                                          17
         In this section, we empirically test whether different units within the same institution
display more correlated behavior than entities that are part of independent organizations. Then, we
study the trading channel for the relation between ownership by large institutions and volatility.



5.1      Correlated Flows

         Capital flows across units within large institutions may be correlated for several reasons.
Marketing efforts aimed at creating a family brand and at cross-selling an array of family products
are likely to increase the correlation of flows to the units within the organization. For example,
when a provider of a 401(k)-pension plan includes multiple funds from a given family among the
investment options, correlated flows will hit all of the funds in the family. Moreover, mutual funds
often inherit the reputation of the umbrella organization and are identified with it, as in “a Fidelity
fund.” Hence, the stellar performance of a given fund may induce investors to invest in other family
funds as well (as in Nanda, Wang, and Zheng 2004). Or, investors may perceive funds in the same
family as following a similar investment style and move capital in and out of the family as a result
of style investing (Barberis and Shleifer 2003). Also important, events that occur at the level of
the parent company may trickle down to affect the entities within it. As an example, Bill Gross’s
departure from PIMCO triggered outflows from funds at PIMCO that Gross, at the time the CIO
of the firm, was not directly managing. Because of these outflows, five of PIMCO’s funds appeared
in the infamous ranking of the 10 funds with the heaviest customer redemptions in 2014.

         The discussion suggests that the correlation of investor flows across units of a unique
institution is higher than across independent institutions. Testing this conjecture is not feasible
using the quarterly 13F data, because these data do not include investor flows, only changes in
long equity positions. To overcome this empirical hurdle, we use mutual fund data. We then test
whether the pairwise correlation of flows between funds in the same family (i.e., the same
management company) is higher than the correlation between funds in distinct families. 15


15
  The CRSP Mutual Fund Database does not have an explicit mutual fund family identifier, so we create one manually.
We then compute the monthly flows for each share class using the monthly assets and net return figures in CRSP, and
then aggregate the flows at the portfolio level. The flow-correlation measure is constructed using 12-month rolling
Pearson correlations of the monthly percentage of portfolio flows. To this end, we generate a dataset that includes all
combinations of mutual fund pairs. We restrict our sample to only those correlations that have nonmissing flows in

        We regress the correlation coefficient on an indicator variable for whether the pair belongs
to the same family. Panel A of Table 7 presents the results. Columns (1)–(4) use the entire universe
of mutual funds but restrict the sample to a 1% randomly chosen subsample of the data (for
computational efficiency). Columns (5)–(8) report results restricted to funds managed by the 20
largest institutions in the same sample. The different columns correspond to different combinations
of fixed effects: from a specification with time fixed effects (Columns (1) and (5)) to a specification
that includes fixed effects for each fund i-year and fund j-year (Columns (4) and (8)). The standard
errors in these regressions are clustered along three dimensions: year, fund i, and fund j. Despite
the different levels of fixed effects, the results are very similar across specifications. Using the
coefficient in Column (1), we find the correlation coefficient is about 3.2% higher when funds are
within the same family; that is, it is about twice as large as the sample average correlation. Given
that the standard deviation of the dependent variable is approximately 33.2% (Table 1, Panel A),
funds that belong to the same family have a correlation that is about 10% of a standard deviation
higher than that of the entire population of funds. Hence, the effect is economically significant.
We find that the result is robust for funds managed by the top institutions. For this subsample, we
find the correlation coefficient is about 2.4% higher when funds are within the same family.



5.2     Correlated Trades

        Next, we explore whether trades are more similar across units within an organization than
across independent firms. Again, we focus on mutual fund families to identify portfolio holdings
of subentities. We posit that mutual funds that are part of a family have access to common
resources when making investment decisions. For example, mutual fund managers in the same
firm may rely on the same equity research done by a centralized research department; they may
share information with neighboring managers in the spirit of Hong, Kubik, and Stein (2005); and
they may be bound by the same risk management rules set by the risk management department of




the last 12 months. Finally, to avoid overlapping observations, we keep one observation per fund pair-year as of
December. We end up with a sample of 249,665,892 observations on 8,410 different mutual funds belonging to 924
family groups in the period between 1980 and 2016. Table 1 shows the summary statistics for the variables used in
this analysis.


                                                       19
the organization. Also relevant, a recent paper by Auh and Bai (2018) shows that there is
information sharing between equity and bond mutual funds in the same fund family.

        We measure trades at the quarterly frequency using changes in holdings. 16 Given the
evidence on the flow correlation that we have just produced, it is natural that same-family funds
would adjust their portfolios in the same direction when they receive flows. Hence, to obtain a
result that is not mechanically related to our prior evidence, we focus on mutual funds’ active
trades. An active trade is the residual change in a stock quarterly holding after subtracting the
change in holding that would result from a simple rescaling of the portfolio proportional to the
quarterly flows (Greenwood and Thesmar 2011).

        We regress fund-quarter level pairwise correlations in active trades for any two funds in
our database on the same-family dummy. The results of the analysis are presented in Table 7, Panel
B. Columns (1)–(4) correspond to funds managed by all institutions, and Columns (5)–(8)
correspond to funds managed by the largest 20 institutions. The standard errors in these regressions
are clustered along three dimensions: year, fund i, and fund j. The estimates indicate that mutual
funds that belong to the same family have a higher correlation between trades. The correlation is
about 2.5% higher for same-family funds in the most restrictive specification for all funds and
2.2% higher for funds managed by the largest institutions. Again, the effect is highly economically
significant (36% and 32% of a standard deviation for all and large institutions, respectively), given
that the standard deviation of the dependent variable is about 6.9%.



5.3     Evidence on the Trading Channel

        The model in Section 2 postulates that large institutions affect prices via their trading
activity. The following analysis more closely inspects the trading channel.

        As a preliminary test, we split institutional holdings based on the extent to which
institutions changed the amount of ownership during the quarter. Arguably, substantial changes in

16
   We infer mutual fund portfolio composition from the Thomson-Reuters Mutual Fund Database and the CRSP
Mutual Fund Database. We rely on the Thomson-Reuters Mutual Fund Database for historical holdings of mutual
fund portfolios between 1980 and 2012, and we rely on the CRSP Mutual Fund Database for the portfolio holdings
after 2013 due to Thomson-Reuters data quality issues that also affected its mutual fund ownership database in recent
years.


                                                         20
holdings denote positions that are actively traded. Our tests aim to identify holdings by institutions
that traded more intensely. Specifically, for each stock-quarter-institution, we separate
observations based on whether the percentage change in shares held in an institution’s portfolio is
above 5%, where this number is the cutoff for the first quartile. 17 Then, at the stock-quarter level,
we aggregate beginning-of-quarter ownership by institutions with changes in holdings below and
above the cutoff. We repeat the exercise for top and non-top institutions. Then, we run a regression
of volatility on actively- and non-actively-traded ownership for top and non-top institutions. We
also include the usual controls and stock and quarter fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by
stock and quarter. The estimates in Table 8, Panel A, show that actively-traded ownership by top
institutions has the strongest association with volatility during the same quarter. Non-actively-
traded ownership provides a placebo test. We still find a significant coefficient on this variable,
probably because trading is very rarely zero across all the top institutions that hold the stock. We
find the same ranking of coefficients between actively- and non-actively-traded positions for
ownership by non-top institutions. Overall, the evidence is consistent with the trading channel, that
is, ownership affects volatility to the extent that it leads to trading activity.

        These results inspire us to directly use the actual change in ownership by institutions as an
explanatory variable for volatility and contrast its effect with that of the level of ownership. If
trading is really behind the effect of interest, the predictive power of ownership in these regressions
should be absorbed by trading activity. In a stock-quarter-level sample, we regress stock volatility
on quarterly absolute changes in holdings by large institutions, beginning-of-quarter holdings by
large institutions, the usual controls, and stock and date fixed effects. In some specifications, we
break the change in ownership into positive (net buys) and negative (net sells) changes. We also
include absolute changes in ownership by all institutions as a control, to study the incremental
predictive power of top institutions’ trading.

        The estimates in Table 8, Panel B, reveal that trading activity by large institutions has an
incrementally positive effect relative to institutional trading in general. We note that the level of
ownership loses most of its predictive power in these specifications to the advantage of changes in



17
  Other reasonable cutoffs give equivalent results. We note that focusing on instances of zero changes in positions
versus nonzero changes is not feasible because too few observations display a zero change in positions.


                                                        21
ownership. This finding supports the conjecture that trading, rather than ownership, matters for
explaining volatility.

        The tests in Panels A and B of Table 8 can raise the valid criticism that volatility and
changes in holdings in the same quarter are co-determined such that the regressions suffer from an
endogeneity problem. To address this issue, we use a pre-determined proxy for potential trading
activity. Specifically, we sort institutions based on their portfolio turnover in the prior quarter.
Following the literature (Carhart 1997), we define turnover as min(Buys, Sells)/[Average Assets in
t and (t-1)]. Then, at the stock-quarter level, we construct four ownership variables corresponding
to ownership by low-/high-turnover institutions and top/non-top institutions. A high-turnover
institution is in the top quartile of the distribution. We extend the definition of “top institution” up
to the 50th position in the ranking to have enough firms in each of the four buckets. We then use
these four ownership variables to predict volatility in the next quarter.

        In most of the specifications presented in Table 8, Panel C, ownership by high-turnover
top institutions has the largest relation to volatility. Again, these results suggest that the observed
link between top institutional ownership and volatility is channeled through trading activity.

        Next, we add a new data source to the analysis. Specifically, Ancerno collects detailed data
about trades by institutional investors (see Hu, Jo, Wang, and Xie 2018, for a detailed description
of this data set). In the version that we have access to, we can observe the identity of the institution.
Hence, we can identify the top institutions. Using Ancerno data gives us a unique perspective on
whether trading activity combined with large trade sizes by top institutions is responsible for the
association we observe between ownership by top institutions and stock volatility. Panel A of
Table 9 provides summary statistics.

        The evidence in Table 8 suggests that trading is more impactful when originating from
large institutions versus from a generic institution. This evidence implies that trades by large
institutions should display a bigger price impact. Using Ancerno data, our analysis is at the stock-
institution-day level. We follow Anand, Irvine, Puckett, and Venkataraman (2013) and compute
the price impact of trading volume in a given stock as the largest deviation between the execution
prices throughout the day and the opening price. The significant coefficient on the large institution
indicator in Table 9, Panel B, confirms the conjecture (Columns (1), (4), and (7)). The difference


                                                   22
in price impact for large institutions’ trades, however, goes away once we control for the size of
the trade. We include a second-degree polynomial in trade size because the effect of trade size is
typically concave (e.g., Frazzini, Israel, and Moskowitz 2012). Hence, the larger price impact (and
the ensuing higher volatility) of top institutions is likely because they trade larger blocks.

          We can test that large institutions make larger trades. Using Ancerno data at the daily
frequency for each institution, we regress the institutional daily trading volume in a given stock,
as a fraction of total stock-level volume, on a dummy for whether the institution ranks among the
top. 18 We include a control for the level of stock ownership by that institution at the beginning of
the quarter from its 13F filings. We also include stock-by-day fixed effects and cluster standard
errors separately by stock, day, and institution. The estimates in Table 9, Panel C, suggest that top
institutions trade in larger volumes, even controlling for the level of ownership by the institution.

          Finally, given the rise of passive investing, it makes sense to investigate whether the effect
of passive institutions on stock prices differs from that of active institutions. This analysis can be
conveniently conducted using CRSP mutual fund data, which allows us to identify passive mutual
funds, among which we include exchange-traded funds (ETFs). 19 After ranking mutual fund
families by their assets under management, we break ownership by top mutual fund families into
passive and active based on the type of fund within the family that holds the stock. The estimates
in Internet Appendix Table IA.11 suggest that passive ownership has a much stronger relation to
volatility than active ownership. To explain these results, we note that passive funds have less
leeway in trading given that they tend to trade at the close to minimize tracking error (see e.g.,
Bogousslavsky and Muravyev 2019). Hence, their trades are likely to generate a bigger price
impact.

          We perform an additional analysis in which we compare the holdings and changes in
holdings of large institutions to those of synthetic institutions of the same size, which are composed
of many smaller institutions (during the same quarter). To save space, this analysis is available in


18
   The trading volume at the institution-stock-day level is the sum of shares within an order divided by total trading
volume in the stock on a given day by a given institution. We separately consider buy and sell orders. If the institution
does not trade a stock on a given day, it is not included in the sample. Merging the Ancerno data with 13F ownership
data causes a loss of observations relative to the analysis in Panel B.

(2017).

the Internet Appendix, Section IA.1. The analysis shows that, compared with synthetic institutions,
actual large institutions hold less diversified portfolios and engage in larger position changes.
These findings join the earlier evidence in suggesting that the channel for the impact of large
institutions on volatility is large and undiversified trades.

        This novel evidence adds an interesting qualification to our results and further corroborates
the view that the trading channel explains the relation between large institutions’ ownership and
volatility.



6       Case Study: A Merger of Large Institutional Investors

        While the association between large institutional investors and volatility is strong, it may
not necessarily reflect a causal relation. For example, one possible explanation for this correlation
is that large institutional investors might prefer holding popular stocks, which may be more volatile
due to intense trading. In the next analysis, we exploit a natural experiment that can provide causal
evidence.

        We rely on the merger of BlackRockBlackRock and BGI in December 2009. Our test
compares the relation between institutional ownership and stock-level volatility before and after
this merger. If the size of the institutional investors affects the volatility of the stocks in their
portfolios, ownership by the merged institution should have an impact on the volatility of the
stocks that, before the merger, were held by a non-top institution.

        An important question relates to the exogeneity of the merger with respect to the outcome
variable of interest, stock volatility. We assume that the merger is an exogenous event relative to
the volatility of the stocks in the portfolios of the two original institutions. The motivation for the
merger resided in Barclays’ desire to sell some of its divisions to strengthen its balance sheet
following the financial crisis. Hence, the reason for the merger appears to have been unrelated to
the volatility of the underlying securities (see also Azar, Schmalz, and Tecu 2017). The merger
was announced on June 11, 2009, and was completed in December of 2009. Therefore, we expect
the effect of the trading activity of the merged institution to start manifesting itself in stock prices
from the first quarter of 2010.



                                                  24
       Right before the merger, BGI held equities worth about $596 billion and was the largest
institution as of the end of 2009, while BlackRock held equities worth about $156 billion and
ranked in the 12th position. After the merger, in December 2009, the combined entity was the
largest institutional investor in the equity market, overseeing approximately $815 billion of
equities. Hence, the stocks that were owned by BlackRock experienced a change of status
following the merger. BlackRock’s stocks ended up being owned by the largest institution in the
market, while they were previously owned by an institution ranked below the top 10. We exploit
this change of status as a natural experiment. The intensity of the treatment for each stock depends
on the amount of ownership by BlackRock before the merger.

       Our main specification resembles a difference-in-differences approach. Specifically, in our
first set of tests, we define the treatment variable to be ownership by BlackRock in 2009/Q3, i.e.,
the last complete quarter before the merger. This quantity represents the amount by which a stock
that was owned by a non-top institution (pre-merger BlackRock) ends up being owned by a top
institution after the merger (post-merger BlackRock).

where the Post merger dummy is an indicator for whether the quarter is 2010/Q1 or later. The
main variable of interest is the interaction between Treatment and the Post merger dummy. We
control for the usual stock characteristics (main effects and interactions with the merger indicator)
and for time and stock fixed effects. Standard errors are block-bootstrapped, clustering by stock
and quarter. The pre-merger window ranges between 2007/Q4 to the completion of the merger
(2009/Q4). We look at various post-event windows, from one quarter to eight quarters after the
merger, adding one quarter at a time to the estimation sample.

       Before estimating Equation (6), we verify that the natural experiment generates a valid
“first stage,” that is, the combined ownership by the two institutions does not decrease after the
merger. To this end, we run a specification replacing the merged entity’s ownership for volatility
on the left-hand side of Equation (6). The estimates in Internet Appendix Table IA.5. show that
the ownership of the combined entity is significantly higher than the pre-merger combined
ownership, for stocks with higher pre-merger ownership by BlackRock. Thus, there is no concern

                                                               25
that the combined entity experienced a decline in ownership, which would invalidate our
identification.

         The estimates of Equation (6) are reported in Table 10, Panel A. The samples in Columns
(1)–(8) include post-merger periods ranging from one to eight quarters, respectively. We find a
strongly significant effect of treatment after the merger. Using the summary statistics in Table 1,
when eight quarters after the merger are in the sample, a one-standard-deviation increase in the
interaction variable is associated with a 1.6% increase in volatility in standard deviation units
(0.009*4.270/2.340). The economic magnitude is not as large as for the full sample regressions in
Table 2. However, this experiment focuses on a single firm and studies the incremental impact
relative to the pre-merger BlackRock, which was already a sizeable asset manager (top 12). The
strong statistical significance of the result adds credibility to the causal interpretation of the
estimates in Table 2. 20

         Panel B of Table 10 reports results in which Treatment is instead a dummy for a high level
of pre-merger ownership by BlackRock (i.e., stock ownership greater than the median ownership
by BlackRock). In this case, the increase in volatility for treated stocks ranges between 13 bps and
25 bps. In units of standard deviation of the dependent variable, these slopes translate to an increase
of between 5.5% and 10.6%.

         After a merger, there is usually a period of portfolio adjustment. The combined entity may
need to close some portfolios and possibly move the capital to other ones. These activities may
mechanically lead to more coordinated trading and higher volatility for the portfolio stocks. To
insulate our analysis from this potential effect, in Panel C of Table 10, we exclude the four quarters
in the first year after the merger. The results remain significant and are of similar magnitude.

         To study whether the increase in volatility for treated stocks predates the merger, we
generate plots of the quarterly regression coefficients of the treatment variable (in dummy variable


20
   We note that Massa, Schumacher, and Wang (2016) find ownership of the combined entity, as measured before the
merger, is associated with lower stock volatility after the merger occurs. The difference in our research design is that
we use BlackRockBlackRock ownership as a proxy for the increase in ownership by top institutions following the
merger. Our motivation is to capture the effect of the behavior of the combined entity after the merger, e.g., the effect
of nondiversifiable large trades. In this sense, we measure an ex-post effect, whereas Massa, Schumacher, and Wang
measure the ex-ante effect triggered by the repositioning of other traders in anticipation of the risk of fire sales sparked
by the merger.


                                                            26
form for the above-median ownership by BlackRock) and display them in Figure 3. 21 The figure
shows the difference in volatility between the treated stocks and the matched controls. The merger
effect is clear. In the pre-period, the difference in volatility between the two groups is not
significantly different from zero. However, in the post-merger period, the treated stocks experience
significantly higher volatility than the control group in most of the quarters under consideration.
What ultimately matters is the double difference between the treatment and control groups before
and after the merger, which is proven in the regression analysis of Table 10.

         We perform additional robustness analyses for the tests in Table 10. First, in Internet
Appendix Table IA.6, we remove the financial crisis from the pre-merger merger period, as it was
a period of high volatility. In Panel A, we remove 2008/Q4 from the sample. In Panel B, we remove
all quarters from 2008/Q3 through 2009/Q1. In both cases, the results remain significant. Second,
in Internet Appendix Table IA.7, we run placebo tests using fictional dates for the merger, before
the actual merger date. Specifically, we choose 2008/Q4 in Panel A, and 2007/Q4 in Panel B.
Consistent with the effect that we estimate in Table 10 being related to the merger, we do not find
any significance around these alternative dates. Second, in Internet Appendix Table IA.8, we
replace the treatment variable, i.e., pre-merger ownership by BlackRock, with an alternative
treatment, i.e., pre-merger ownership by BGI. Consistent with the fact that firms with large BGI
ownership were already exposed to the large firm ownership before the merger, we find no effect
of this new treatment variable after the merger. Finally, in Internet Appendix Table IA.9 we
replicate the analysis in Table 10 using propensity score matching to generate a control group. Our
results are consistent with that of the main analysis.

         Table 10, Panels D and E, explore absolute and signed autocorrelation around the
BlackRock-BGI merger. Panel D shows that the absolute value of autocorrelation increases for the
treated group. Given the exogenous nature of the merger, this result supports a causal interpretation
of the association between top institutional ownership and return autocorrelation. Panel E shows
that the signed autocorrelation decreases after the merger. That is, the autocorrelation of returns




21
  To construct this graph, we identify a control sample with similar pre-merger volatility to the treated stocks using
propensity score matching (Abadie and Imbens 2006).


                                                         27
becomes more negative because of large institutional ownership, consistent with the view that
large institutions impound temporary shocks into prices that subsequently revert.

        In Internet Appendix, Section IA.2, we confirm the conclusions on flow and trade
correlation in the context of the natural experiment of the BlackRock-BGI merger. Overall, the
exogenous nature of the merger event with respect to the volatility of the portfolio securities as
well as the significance and robustness of the findings in Table 10 corroborate a causal
interpretation of the positive relation between volatility and ownership by large institutions.



7       Conclusion

Motivated by the dramatic increase in the concentration of institutional ownership in the stock
market, we investigate the effect of large institutional investors on stock prices. We find that
ownership by large institutions is associated with higher stock price volatility, autocorrelation in
returns (a measure of price inefficiency), and a greater magnitude of price drops at times of market
stress (a measure of price fragility).

        The paper also presents evidence on the channel through which large institutions affect the
volatility of the underlying securities. We find that funds within the same family exhibit higher
flow correlation and higher correlation of trades than funds belonging to independent families.
Furthermore, large institutions’ trades are bigger in absolute value and have a greater impact on
prices. This evidence suggests that large institutions are granular. That is, the subentities within
the same firm display correlated behavior. Hence, when these asset managers are hit by
idiosyncratic shocks, diversification is not as strong as if the shocks hit managers in independent
families. As a result, the trades of large institutions are more impactful for prices than the
diversified trades of a collection of small institutions.

        Our results have implications for regulatory design. In particular, they inform the debate
about the optimal size of an asset management firm. Regulators have been questioning the systemic
implications of large asset managers. We show that combining different institutions within a
unique conglomerate affects the “production function” of all the entities involved. Access to
capital as well as the investment and trading activities of the various components within a



                                                  28
conglomerate display a higher correlation than is the case for independent firms. This correlated
behavior, combined with the sheer size of the conglomerates, has repercussions on asset price
stability that are mostly felt during times of market stress. This last consideration in particular
supports the regulatory concerns, and it suggests that excessive concentration in the asset
management industry may pose a systemic risk. Of course, any regulatory action should weigh the
decrease in price efficiency and the increased potential of large price drops against the economies
scale in information production and trading that large institutions can achieve and can pass on to
their clients. The ultimate impact of large institutional investors on aggregate welfare remains an
open question for future research.

                       Figure 1. Time Series of Large Institutions’ Ownership
The chart shows the aggregate equity holdings by all institutions and the top institutions over time, as a percentage of
total market capitalization of the U.S. equity market.




                                         Figure 2. Yearly Coefficients
This figure presents slope coefficients and moving averages of slope coefficients from ordinary least squares (OLS)
regressions as in Equation 1, run by year. The dependent variable is the stock’s Daily volatility, which is computed
from daily returns during quarter q. The chart presents the standatdized coefficients of the key independent variable,
Top inst ownership. The slopes are expressed in standard deviation units of the dependent variable for a one-standard-
deviation change in top 10 institutions’ ownership. The sample period is 1980/Q1–2016/Q4.

     Figure 3. Treatment Effect on Volatility around the Merger of BlackRock and BGI
This figure presents slope coefficients from differences-in-differences regressions. We use the event of the merger
between BlackRock and BGI in December 2009 to test the relation between volatility and ownership by large
institutions. Point 0 on the x-axis represents the quarter of the merger, 2009/Q4. The dependent variable is the stock’s
Daily idiosyncratic volatility, which is computed from daily returns during the next quarter. The key independent
variable, which is represented with 95% confidence standard error bands, is the interaction between a dummy variable
that equals one if the firm is in the top 50% of pre-merger ownership by BlackRock and a quarter dummy. The control
sample is selected using propensity score matching based on a probit model for the probability of treatment as a
function of the average volatility during the pre-period. The chosen algorithm implements k-nearest neighbors
Mahalanobis matching, with k = 4.

            Table 2. Ownership by Large Institutional Investors and Stock Volatility
This table presents ordinary least squares regression results. The dependent variable in both panels is the stock’s Daily
volatility, which is computed from daily returns during the next quarter, quarter q. All independent variables are
measured during quarter q–1. The key independent variable is the Top inst ownership of the largest institutional
investors in a given stock. Panel B replicates the analysis from Panel A but includes Greenwood and Thesmar’s (2011)
fragility measure. Time and stock fixed effects are also included. The sample period is 1980/Q1–2016/Q4. Appendix
B provides variable descriptions. t-statistics based on standard errors clustered at the stock and quarter level are in
parentheses. *, **, and *** denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

This table presents ordinary least squares regression results. The dependent variable is the stock’s Daily volatility,
which is computed from daily returns during the next quarter, quarter q. All independent variables are measured during
quarter q–1. The key independent variables are indicator variables for holdings in different quartiles of the ownership
distribution. The quartiles are recomputed every quarter in each of 10 size deciles. Time and stock fixed effects are
also included. The sample period is 1980/Q1–2016/Q4. t-statistics based on standard errors clustered at the stock and
quarter level are in parentheses. *, **, and *** denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

                                        Analysis
This table presents ordinary least squares regression results. The dependent variable is the stock’s Daily volatility,
which is computed from daily returns during quarter q. The key independent variable is the Top inst ownership of the
largest institutional investors in a given stock. All independent variables are measured during quarter q–1. In Panel A,
the sample period is 1980–1990; in Panel B the sample period is 1991–2003; and in Panel C the sample period is
2004–2016. Time and stock fixed effects are also included. Appendix B provides variable descriptions. t-statistics
based on standard errors clustered at the stock and quarter level are in parentheses. *, **, and *** denote significance
at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

               Table 5. Large Institutional Ownership and Return Autocorrelation
This table presents ordinary least squares regression results. The dependent variable is the absolute value of
autocorrelation of the DGTW-adjusted returns (Daniel, Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers, DGTW, 1997) of stocks
held by large institutional investors. The sample period is 1980/Q1–2016/Q4. t-statistics based on standard errors
clustered at the stock and quarter level are in parentheses. *, **, and *** denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1%
levels, respectively.

                                   during Periods of Market Turmoil
This table presents ordinary least squares regression results. The dependent variable is the quarterly DGTW excess
return (Daniel, Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers 1997) of stocks held by large institutional investors. All independent
variables are measured during quarter q–1. The table uses the Top inst ownership of the largest institutional investors
in a given stock as the key independent variable. Top inst ownership is interacted with a dummy variable that equals
one if the market was in the 5% left tail of returns during a particular quarter. The sample period is 1980/Q1–2016/Q4.
t-statistics based on standard errors clustered at the stock and quarter level are in parentheses. *, **, and *** denote
significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

          Table 7. Correlation of Fund Flows and Similarities in Holdings and Trades
The table presents tests for whether mutual funds within the same family have correlated flows, correlated returns,
and similar portfolio holdings and trades. All panels present results from ordinary least squares regressions on an
indicator for membership of the funds in the same family. In Panel A, for each fund pair-year, we compute the 12-
month correlation of flows (scaled by lagged total net assets) over the calendar year. The dependent variable is the
correlation between each pair of funds. In Panel B, we compute the 12-month correlation of the active trades of two
funds over the calendar year. The dependent variable is the correlation of active trades between each pair of funds. In
all panels, we use a random sample of 1% of all observations to generate Columns (1)–(4) for computational
efficiency. t-statistics in parentheses are based on standard errors with three-way clustering: year, fund i, and fund j.
The sample period is 1980/Q1–2016/Q4. *, **, and *** denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels,
respectively.

                  Table 8. Evidence on the Trade Channel from Changes in Holdings
This table presents ordinary least squares regression results. The dependent variable is the stock’s Daily volatility,
which is computed from daily returns during the same quarter as when holdings changes are measured. In Panel A,
the key independent variables are dummy variables for large (above 5%) and small (below 5%) holdings changes by
top and non-top institutions. In Panel B, the key independent variables are abs(Total trades), Buys, and Sells, which
represent absolute, positive, and negative changes in ownership, respectively, by top institutional investors in a given
stock in quarter q. In Panel C, all independent variables are measured during quarter q–1. The key independent
variables are Holdings by top and non-top institutions for low- and high-turnover institutions. High-turnover
institutions are those in the top quartile in a given quarter. Time and stock fixed effects are also included in all panels
and specifications. The sample period is 1980/Q1–2016/Q4. t-statistics based on standard errors clustered at the stock
and quarter level are in parentheses. *, **, and *** denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

Panel A reports summary statistics for variables constructed using Ancerno data during the 1999–2014 period. Panel
B reports estimates from ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions of price impact on an indicator for top institutions
and controls for the size of the trades as a fraction of total daily volume. The dependent variable is computed as the
largest deviation between the execution prices throughout the day and the opening price. Stock-day fixed effects are
also included. Panel C reports results from OLS regressions of the size of the daily volume for each institution-stock
expressed as a fraction of total daily volume. t-statistics based on standard errors clustered at the stock, day, and
institution level are in parentheses. *, **, and *** denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

                   Table 10. Stock Volatility around Mergers of Large Institutions
The dependent variable is the daily volatility of the stocks held by large institutional investors in the next quarter.
Daily volatility is computed from daily returns. We use the exogenous event of the merger between BlackRock and
BGI in 2009/Q4 to test the relation between volatility and ownership by large institutions. The key independent
variable is the interaction term Treatment×Post-Merger Dummy, where Treatment represents the ownership of
BlackRockBlackRock as of 2009/Q3, i.e., before the merger was completed, and Post-merger dummy equals 1 for
2010/Q1 and later quarters. In Panel A, the treatment variable is the level of ownership. In Panel B, it is an indicator
for ownership in the top half of the distribution. In Panel C, ownership is again a continuous variable, but we skip the
first year after the merger. The sample in each column includes 2007/Q4-2009/Q4 plus several quarters after the
completion, as specified in the heading. Panels D and E present ordinary least squares regression results of absolute
and signed return autocorrelation around the BlackRock-BGI merger. The dependent variable is the absolute value of
autocorrelation of the DGTW-adjusted returns (Daniel, Grinblatt, Titman, and Wermers, DGTW, 1997) of stocks
held by large institutional investors. The key independent variable is the Ownership of the top institutions in the
previous quarter. In Panels D–E, the sample period is 2007/Q4–2011/Q4. t-statistics based on bootstrapped standard
errors are in parentheses. For Panels D–E, standard errors are bootstrapped. *, **, and *** denote significance at the
10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

IA.1     Large Institutions versus Synthetic Institutions

         The evidence that large institutional investors behave in a more correlated way than
independent firms suggests two additional conjectures on the granular nature of large institutions.
First, the trades of large institutions should be more concentrated, i.e., restricted to a smaller set of
stocks. This happens, for example, if the various managers within a given firm rely on the same
research sources. Second, we expect that large institutions place trades that are larger in absolute
value than the trades placed by a collection of independent institutions that manage the same
amount of total assets. This prediction emerges because correlated capital flows and correlated
trading behavior prevent diversification of trades so that trades reach the market as a large shock.
On the other hand, uncorrelated trades from independent institutions are more likely to be netted
against each other.

         To test these conjectures, we compare large institutions’ trades to the trades of smaller
institutions that add up to the same total equity holdings as the large institution. The comparison,
therefore, aims to keep the size of the assets under management constant so that we can analyze
the effect of variation in the organizational structure. In this analysis, we proxy for trades using
the quarterly changes in 13F holdings at the stock level. For each large institution among the top
10 in a given quarter (called here the “original institution”), we generate a sample of 99 “synthetic
institutions” in a block bootstrapping procedure. Each synthetic institution results from pooling
together institutions that rank below the 10th largest institution. These component institutions are
randomly drawn without replacement until the dollar value of the equity holdings of the original
institution is matched. 1 For the synthetic institutions to represent a valid benchmark, we assume
that the type of investors or investor behavior in the synthetic institutions is comparable to what
would prevail in the counterfactual market configuration in which no large institutions were
present.




1
  We add a fraction of the last institution drawn to ensure we exactly match the total dollar value of the equity holdings
of the random sample to those of the large institution. In 1980, the size of the equity portfolio of the largest institutional
investor equaled the aggregate size of about 25 random institutions. In contrast, reflecting the dramatic increase in
concentration in the industry, in 2016, 424 random institutional investors were needed to match the size of the top
firm.
                                                             58
IA.1.1 Portfolio Holdings

        We first examine the size of the universe of stocks that large institutional investors hold.
In Internet Appendix Table IA.12, Panel A, we compute the average number of stocks that make
up certain fractions of the institutional portfolio. For example, 50% of the equity portfolio of the
top institutional investor in the economy consists of 79 stocks on average (the largest holdings).
In contrast, the average number of stocks that account for 50% of the portfolio of a similar-size
synthetic portfolio is 93. The same pattern appears in almost every cell in the panel: The number
of stocks held by the original institutional investors is significantly lower (in the order of 24% to
39% lower) than the number of stocks held in the portfolio of the synthetic institutions.
Interestingly, on average the portfolios of the top 10 original institutions contain 1,995 stocks,
while 2,550 stocks comprise the portfolio of the synthetic institutions.

        These findings imply that the original large institutional investors allocate a given amount
of money to a smaller set of stocks than what the synthetic institutions do. In turn, this fact suggests
that top institutions are likely to trade each stock in larger amounts and to have bigger price
impacts. The next analysis, therefore, focuses on trade size.



IA.1.2 Trade Size

        Given the prior findings of correlated flows and similar and concentrated portfolio
holdings, we anticipate that the subentities within large institutions are less likely to execute
offsetting trades. Hence, we predict that large institutions will execute larger trades in comparison
to their synthetic counterparts.

        To test this supposition, we study the distributions of trade size (i.e., absolute changes in
portfolio holdings) for the original large institutional investors and the synthetic ones. We
construct a stock-quarter indicator for whether the original institution’s trade is above a given
percentile of the distribution of the synthetic institutions’ trades. Then, we average this indicator
across stocks and quarters. For each top-10 institutional investor, Panel B of Internet Appendix
Table IA.12 reports the average across stocks and quarters of this indicator for the 50th, 90th, 95th,
and 99th percentiles. On average across the top-10 institutions, 56.1% of trades by the original
institution are larger than the trades placed by 50% of the synthetic institutions. Moreover, 16.2%
                                                  59
of the trades are larger than 90% of the synthetic institutions’ trades, 9.4% of trades are larger than
the 95th percentile, and 3.7% of trades are larger than the 99th percentile. These numbers exceed
the percentages expected if the distributions of trade size were the same for the original and
synthetic institutions (i.e., we would expect 50% of trades to be above the 50th percentile, 10% to
be above the 90th percentile, and 1% to be above the 99th percentile).

       In sum, the evidence shows that the quarterly changes in equity portfolio holdings for large
institutional investors are significantly larger than for the synthetic institutions. Hence, large
institutions impose a higher liquidity demand on the market than smaller independent firms. This
liquidity demand can translate into price impact if the investors taking the other side of these trades
require price concessions. In turn, the price impact of these trades can explain the effect of large
institutions on volatility, noise, and price fragility that we document in the first part of the paper.

IA.2     Further Evidence on the Merger

         The following analysis casts the analysis of flows within the case study of the merger
between BlackRock and BGI. In regard to flows, we compute the annual pairwise correlation
among equity mutual funds using monthly returns within a year. We consider a four-year window
centered on the merger (2008–2011). The post-merger period contains the two years after the
completion of the merger (i.e., December 2009). We include in our tests the universe of all funds
as in Table 9. The treated funds are those that belong to the separate pre-merger companies (either
BlackRock or BGI) and end up in the same company after the merger. We also include controls
for pairs of funds that were already in the same company (either BlackRock or BGI) before the
merger. We use different combinations of fixed effects, and the standard errors are bootstrapped.

         Panel A of Internet Appendix Table IA.13 shows that the coefficient on the
Treatment×Post-merger dummy is positive and significant. Following the merger, funds that were
part of separate companies experience an increase in flow correlation by an average of 4.3%
relative to funds that belonged to the same company before the merger. This effect is economically
important, as the standard deviation of the correlation of flows in the sample is about 32%.

         We note that in Panel A of Internet Appendix Table IA.13, the interaction term 𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃𝑃 ×
𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝑜𝑜 𝐵𝐵𝐵𝐵 𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝𝑝 is statistically and economically significant. While not related to the main
effect that is being studied here, this result is consistent with our priors. In particular, it can be
explained based on the growth of passive investment. Right before the merger, BGI funds were
mostly passive (about 98% by AUM), whereas BlackRock funds were mostly active (about 99%
by AUM). 2

         Next, we study the correlation in trading activity. 3 To this purpose, we proxy trades with
the quarterly change in fund holdings. We compute this correlation for each pair of funds in the


2
  Based on CRSP mutual fund data, BGI funds that were acquired by BlackRock were mostly index funds/ETFs, with
the exception of money market funds. For these acquired funds, total assets were $368,785 million, of which index
fund assets were $362,329 million, and ETF assets were $358,169.6 million, as of Q4 2009 (the quarter of the merger).
We identified 706 share classes (180 portfolios) of BlackRockBlackRock funds in the pre-merger period. For the 663
share classes (178 portfolios) of BlackRockBlackRock funds that were active and part of BlackRockBlackRock in
September 2009 (the last quarter prior to the merger effective date), total assets were $305,945 million and index fund
assets were $3,362 million.
3
  We can identify 706 share classes for around 180 different funds for BlackRockBlackRock before the merger. For
BGI, before the merger, we identify 288 share classes for 248 different funds. Among the BGI funds, after the merger,
                                                          61
quarter as the correlation of the stock-level changes in portfolio weights. We retain the fourth-
quarter observations to keep the size of the sample manageable. Panel B of Internet Appendix
Table IA.13 replicates the specifications of Panel A using the correlation of holdings changes as
the dependent variable. We find that the coefficient on the Treatment×Post-merger dummy is
positive and significant in our most stringent specification. Following the merger, funds that were
part of separate companies experience an increase in trade correlation by an average of 0.4%
relative to funds that belonged to the same company before the merger. Because the standard
deviation of trade correlation in the sample is 16.8%, the economic magnitude is about 2.3% of a
standard deviation.




we identify 219 surviving share classes corresponding to 198 funds. Out of these 198 surviving funds, 194 have
nonmissing index fund flags in CRSP, i.e., they are classified as pure index or enhanced index funds.

 Internet Appendix Table IA.2. Institutional Holdings and Stock Volatility, Controlling for
                                      Concentration
This table presents ordinary least squares regression results. The dependent variable is the stock’s Daily volatility,
which is computed from daily returns during the next quarter, quarter q. All independent variables are measured during
quarter q–1. The key independent variable is the Top inst ownership of the largest institutional investors in a given
stock. Importantly, these regressions also control for the institution’s Concentration in a given stock. Time and stock
fixed effects are also included. The sample period is 1980/Q1–2016/Q4. t-statistics based on standard errors clustered
at the stock and quarter level are in parentheses. *, **, and *** denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels,
respectively.

 Internet Appendix Table IA.3. Ownership by Large Institutional Investors and Volatility
                          during Crisis and Noncrisis Periods
This table presents ordinary least squares regression results. The dependent variable is the stock’s Daily volatility.
Daily volatility is computed from daily returns during quarter q. All independent variables are measured during quarter
q–1. The table uses the Top inst ownership of the largest institutional investors in a given stock as the key independent
variable. Crisis periods (Panel A) are the stock market crash in the fourth quarter of 1987; the credit crunch from the
first quarter of 1990 until the fourth quarter of 1992; the Russian debt and long-term capital management (LTCM)
crisis in the third and fourth quarters of 1998; the dot-com bubble and the September 11 crisis, from the second quarter
of 2000 until the third quarter of 2002; and the subprime lending crisis from the third quarter of 2007 until the fourth
quarter of 2009. Panel B, focuses on noncrisis quarters. The sample period is 1980/Q1–2016/Q4. Appendix B provides
variable descriptions. t-statistics based on standard errors clustered at the stock and quarter level are in parentheses.
*, **, and *** denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

      Internet Appendix Table IA.4. Institutional Holdings and Stock Volatility, by Size
This table presents ordinary least squares regression results. The dependent variable is the stock’s Daily volatility,
which is computed from daily returns during the next quarter, quarter q. All independent variables are measured during
quarter q–1. The key independent variable is the Top inst ownership of the largest institutional investors in a given
stock. In Panel A, regressions are sorted by stock size quintiles. In Panel B, regressions are value-weighted by
beginning-of-quarter stock market capitalization. Time and stock fixed effects are also included. The sample period
is 1980/Q1–2016/Q4. t-statistics based on standard errors clustered at the stock and quarter level are in parentheses.
*, **, and *** denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

          Internet Appendix Table IA.5. Holdings around the BlackRock/BGI Merger
The dependent variable is the holdings of the stocks held by large institutional investors in the next quarter. We use
the exogenous event of the merger between BlackRock and BGI in 2009/Q4 to test the relation between volatility and
ownership by large institutions. The key independent variable is the interaction term Treatment×Post-merger dummy,
where Treatment represents the ownership of BlackRockBlackRock as of 2009/Q3, i.e., before the merger was
completed, and Post-merger dummy equals 1 for 2010/Q1 and later quarters. The sample in each column includes
2007/Q4–2009/Q4 plus several quarters after the completion, as specified in the heading. t-statistics based on
bootstrapped standard errors are in parentheses. *, **, and *** denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels,
respectively.

The dependent variable is the daily volatility of the stocks held by large institutional investors in the next quarter.
Daily volatility is computed from daily returns. We use the exogenous event of the merger between BlackRock and
BGI in 2009/Q4 to test the relation between volatility and ownership by large institutions. The key independent
variable is the interaction term Treatment×Post-merger dummy, where Treatment represents the ownership of
BlackRockBlackRock as of 2009/Q3, i.e., before the merger was completed, and Post-merger dummy equals 1 for
2010/Q1 and later quarters. The treatment variable is the level of ownership. The sample in each column includes
2007/Q4–2009/Q4 plus several quarters after the completion, as specified in the heading. In Panel A, we remove
2008/Q4 from the sample. In Panel B, we remove all quarters from 2008/Q3 through 2009/Q1. t-statistics based on
block-bootstrapped standard errors are in parentheses. *, **, and *** denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1%
levels, respectively.

The dependent variable is the daily volatility of the stocks held by large institutional investors in the next quarter.
Daily volatility is computed from daily returns. We implement a placebo test to corroborate the results of our event
study surrounding the exogenous event of the merger between BlackRock and BGI in 2009/Q4. In this case, we set
the merger date to Q4/2008 (Panel A) and Q4/2007 (Panel B). The key independent variable is the interaction term
Treatment×Post-merger dummy, where Treatment represents the ownership of BlackRockBlackRock as of 2008/Q3
(Panel A) or 2007/Q3 (Panel B), i.e., before the merger date, and Post-merger dummy equals 1 for 2009/Q1 (Panel A)
or 2008/Q1 (Panel B) and later quarters. The treatment variable is the level of ownership. t-statistics based on block-
bootstrapped standard errors are in parentheses. The pre-period includes nine quarters before the placebo merger date.
*, **, and *** denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

The dependent variable is the daily volatility of the stocks held by large institutional investors in the next quarter.
Daily volatility is computed from daily returns. We implement a placebo test to verify the results of our event study
surrounding the exogenous event of the merger between BlackRock and BGI in 2009/Q4. In this case, the key
independent variable is the interaction term Treatment×Post-merger dummy, where Treatment represents an indicator
for ownership in the top half of the distribution of ownership by BlackRock in 2009/Q3, i.e., before the merger date,
and Post-merger dummy equals 1 for 2010/Q1 and later quarters. The treatment variable is the level of ownership.
The control sample is selected using propensity score matching based on a probit model for the probability of treatment
as a function of the average volatility during the pre-period. The chosen algorithm implements k-nearest neighbors
Mahalanobis matching, with k = 4. t-statistics based on block-bootstrapped standard errors are in parentheses. *, **,
and *** denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

             Internet Appendix Table IA.10. Additional Dimensions of Return Distribution

In this table, the dependent variables are additional dimensions of the stock return distribution. All independent
variables are measured during quarter q–1. All panels use the Top inst ownership of the largest institutional investors
in a given stock as the key independent variable. Panel A uses Weekly volatility (Columns (1)–(4)), Monthly range
(Columns (5)–(8)), and Quarterly range (Columns (9)–(12)), where monthly and quarterly range are the percentage
difference between the highest and lowest price in the month or quarter, respectively. Panel B uses the Nonparametric
daily skewness (Columns (1)–(4)) and the absolute value of Nonparametric daily skewness (Columns (5)–(8)),
computed as in Ghysels, Plazzi, and Valkanov (2016). The sample period is 1980/Q1–2016/Q4. All regressions
include stock and calendar quarter fixed effects, and t-statistics based on standard errors clustered at the stock and
quarter level are in parentheses. *, **, and *** denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels, respectively.

         Internet Appendix Table IA.11. Active and Passive Mutual Fund Ownership
This table presents ordinary least squares regression results. The dependent variable is the stock’s Daily volatility,
which is computed from daily returns during the next quarter, quarter q. All independent variables are measured during
quarter q–1. The key independent variables are ownership levels by active and passive mutual funds. Calendar quarter
and stock fixed effects are also included. The sample period is 1980/Q1–2016/Q4. t-statistics based on standard errors
clustered at the stock and quarter level are in parentheses. *, **, and *** denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1%
levels, respectively.

Internet Appendix Table IA.12. Comparison to Synthetic Institutions: Small Universe and
                                   Large Trades
The table compares the portfolio holdings and trade sizes of large institutional investors to synthetic institutional
investors. For each top-10 institutional investor and quarter, we create 99 synthetic institutions composed of smaller
institutions that together equal the size (assets under management) of the top institution. Then, we sort the portfolio
holdings (stocks) by their value in the portfolio and count how many stocks make a certain fraction of the portfolio
value. We compare these numbers to the number of stocks held by the original institutional investors that make up the
same portfolio fraction. Panel A presents the average number of stocks held in the original portfolio relative to the
number of stocks held in the synthetic portfolio. In Panel B, we compare the size of the trades of large institutions to
those of synthetic institutions. For each stock-quarter within a portfolio, we calculate the change in the value of
portfolio holdings since the last quarter. Then, for each institution-quarter, we calculate the percentage of trades that
have a larger absolute value than a certain percentile in the distribution of trade sizes by the synthetic institutions. The
panel shows the average percentage of trades by large institutional investors that are above the 50th, 90th, 95th, and 99th
percentiles of the distribution of trades of the synthetic institutions.

 Internet Appendix Table IA.13. Correlation of Flows and Trades around the BlackRock-
                                     BGI Merger
In Panel A, the dependent variable is the correlation of flows between fund i and fund j, and in Panel B the dependent
variable is the correlation of the change in holdings between fund i and fund j. For each fund pair-year, we compute
the 12-month correlation of flows (scaled by lagged total net assets) over the calendar year. We use the exogenous
event of the merger between BlackRock and BGI in 2009 to test the relation between flow or holding changes
correlation and ownership by large institutions. The Treatment dummy identifies funds that before the merger were in
separate asset management firms (either BGI or BlackRock). The annual sample ranges between 2008 and 2011. The
Post-merger dummy identifies the years 2010 and 2011. We also include a dummy for pairs of funds that were in the
same company (either BlackRock or BGI) before the merger (BlackRock or BGI pair). t-statistics based on
bootstrapped standard errors are in parentheses. *, **, and *** denote significance at the 10%, 5%, and 1% levels,
respectively.

     Internet Appendix IA.C. Correcting Thomson-Reuters Data Problems and Sample
                                      Construction

       After June 2013, we use the 13F data parsed directly from the SEC EDGAR filings system
to supplement the Thomson-Reuters 13F data, which has serious data quality issues – most notably
omitted institutions and excluded securities. 1 To remedy these data quality issues, we use the
original 13F filings provided on the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website as
the source of our 13F data beginning in June 2013. 2 The sample we use is currently available on
the WRDS website as the WRDS SEC 13F Holdings database, along with the code used to clean
the data. Our methodology consists of the following steps.

       Because there are multiple filings per holding report period due to amendments, corrections,
and confidential treatment-related reporting, we first divide the sample into subsets that include
only one report per holding period at calendar quarter ends. We choose the first reported filing to
ensure that we avoid backfilling bias, especially due to amendments that might contain
confidentially treated securities. We identify one filing per holding report date (calendar quarter
end date, or rdate variable) from which to extract the holdings. However, in a few instances,
institutional investors attempt to fix errors and correct their holding reports a few days after the
original filings were submitted with the SEC. 3 Therefore, for each reporting period, we extract the
most updated filing within one month of the original filing date.


1
  For example, BlackRockBlackRock Inc. has stale data after September 2013; it is completely dropped from Thomson
in 2014; and it is added back to Thomson in 2015 with a fraction of the assets under management that were historically
associated with BlackRockBlackRock. Additionally, we find a substantial number of excluded securities (e.g., ETFs)
in recent quarters for unknown reasons. We reported many of these data quality issues to WRDS and Thomson-
Reuters, and we worked with WRDS to provide a detailed report that includes the code on how to fix Thomson-
Reuters 13F data problems using original SEC 13F filings. Please see the WRDS report for a comprehensive
discussion of the data quality issues and the code to fix these issues by cleaning the 13F data from SEC filings before
appending them to Thomson history: https://wrds-www.wharton.upenn.edu/documents/752/Research_Note_-
Thomson_S34_Data_Issues_mldAsdi.pdf. The mapping table between Thomson’s mgrno and SEC’s CIK is available
on the WRDS server under the WRDS_13F_Link.
2
  Asset managers also report positions that are managed for clients. For example, consider CalPERS, which uses
BlackRockBlackRock as one of its asset managers. According to CalPERS’ investment statement
(https://www.calpers.ca.gov/docs/forms-publications/facts-at-a-glance.pdf), it has about $160 billion in public equity.
Because its 13F assets as of the end of June 2015 accounted for only about $67 billion
(http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/919079/000114036115032277/xslForm13F_X01/primary_doc.xml),
CalPERS is likely to have a few billion dollars reported by asset managers, such as BlackRockBlackRock and others.
Those assets are reported under the respective asset managers’ 13Fs.
3
  See for example, Acadian Asset Management (CIK= 0000916542), which filed a corrected filing
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/916542/000114036113030478/0001140361-13-030478-index.htm) on
                                                          7
       Then, we aggregate holding information at the CIK registrant level, because we want to
capture ownership at the parent level. In the case of BlackRock, which has seven reporting entities,
we aggregate holdings across all seven reporting entities as described in the next section.

       After that, we use shares outstanding from CRSP to winsorize extreme holding information
that we suspect is due to reporting errors or to erroneous CUSIP information. Whenever any
holding by a single SEC registrant exceeds 50% of shares outstanding, we winsorize this
observation to 50%.

       Finally, we use historical holdings to map each CIK entity to its corresponding Thomson-
Reuters’ mgrno. If a CIK entity in the SEC data has the same number of securities that are matched
to a mgrno for an institutional entity in Thomson-Reuters and has the identical shares held in 10
or more holdings, or more than 80% of the holdings, then we consider them to be a match. We
additionally flag this match using the spelling distance between names of both entities in SEC
filings and the Thomson-Reuters database. 4 The link table is provided on the WRDS server as
WRDS_13FLink dataset. When linking the SEC data to Thomson-Reuter’s mgrno, we find that
many newly filing SEC 13F entities do not have a corresponding entity in Thomson-Reuter, which
is one of the data quality problems in the Thomson-Reuters database. We assign new mgrnos for
those entities using the negative number portion of the CIK. We then insert the linked post-June
2013 holdings data 5 sourced from SEC filings into the Thomson-Reuters ownership data prior to
June 2013 using the holdings report date variable (rdate). This dataset is then used to derive




August 6, 2013, one day after the original filing was reported to the SEC
(https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/916542/000114036113030262/0001140361-13-030262-index.htm). The
original filing has substantial double-counting errors that overstated Acadian’s holdings in every security by a factor
of 2-to-1.
4
  We are able to match 3,224 of the 3,271 mgrnos in Thomson-Reauters with holdings data in June 2013 to a valid
CIK (98.6%). We also made sure to manually verify that the remaining 47 institutions are in the SEC 13F sample.
5
  Thomson-Reuters carries forward the data from one quarter to the next, causing stale holdings data to be populated
for multiple quarters. One can easily detect carry-forward practices in Thomson-Reuters by comparing the vintage
date, fdate, with the holdings report, rdate, in the s34type1 dataset in the Thomson-Reuters database. Carry-forward
quarters occur when multiple fdate reports are sourced and “carried forward” from the same holding period (rdate).
We notice that several top institutions in our sample have stale data in sporadic quarters prior to June 2013 in our
sample (for example, BlackRockBlackRock Inc. in March 2010). To avoid problems arising from stale data, we
download, parse, and merge the SEC’s 13F-sourced data for those institutions during the quarters when their data are
stale in Thomson.
                                                          8
consistent measures of institutional trades over time. All trades and holdings datasets are
constructed based on this cleaned dataset.




IA.C1. BlackRockBlackRock Inc. Company Aggregation

       In 13F filings, BlackRock discloses the holdings of its various subsidiaries in seven different
CIK reporting entities or registrants, reflecting various affiliated entities and financial management
arms in several geographic areas. The Thomson-Reuters database merges these seven CIKs into
the following mgrno identifiers: 9385, 11386, 39539, 56790, 91430, and 12588. 6 We manually
verified that all BlackRock entities, as well as the top 10 13F institutional investors, do not have
stale data in the Thomson-Reuters 13F ownership database. 7 When reporting its beneficial
ownership positions (13G and 13D filings 8), BlackRock’s parent company reports the ownership
of all of its seven 13F entities in one report that reflects the aggregate holding at the parent
institution level. In a similar fashion, we aggregate the holdings by these separate BlackRock
entities to reflect the overall ownership by any affiliated BlackRock entity in our paper.

       If we take the reporting quarter of December 2014 as an example, BlackRock has its seven
distinct 13F registrants, i.e., separate filing entities, each of which reported separate 13F holdings
for a total of more than $1,488 billion worth of U.S. assets. 9 Only the long portion of the equity

6
  We additionally verify that these entities are only merged when BlackRockBlackRock appears in the manager name.
7
  Whenever we notice that Thomson-Reuters carried forward previous-quarter holdings for a top institution, we
manually downloaded and parsed the holdings from the 13F report source on SEC’s EDGAR.
8
  13G filings require entities that acquire ownership in a public company of more than 5% but less than 10% of the
outstanding stock to file a report with their beneficial ownership within 45 days after the end of the calendar year in
which the Exchange Act registration becomes effective. If the security holder holds more than 10%, then the holder
must file within 10 business days once the threshold is met.
9
  Anderson and Brockman (2018) present recent evidence showing the lack of reliability of Form 13F filings, and they
document the widespread presence of significant reporting errors, even among a select group of high-profile bank
holding companies. The authors conclude that “widespread reliance on 13F filings for institutional ownership figures
is unwarranted.” In our attempt to investigate this claim, we focus on their Table 9, which is instrumental in showing
the inaccuracy in the 13F data. The authors compare institutional holdings of Dow 30 firms based on institutions’ 13F
filings as of December 2014, mainly for BlackRockBlackRock and State Street, versus the underlying firms’ DEF14A
filings (i.e., annual proxy statements), and conclude that “any reliance on 13F-reported figures is fraught with
problems.” Once the ownership of various BlackRockBlackRock 13F entities are aggregated, the total ownership
figures line up almost perfectly with the DEF14A schedule positions, which are typically based on 13G or 13D filings
reported at the beginning of the calendar year preceding the mailing date of proxy statements to shareholders.

                                                          9
assets traded on U.S. exchanges are reported on 13Fs. The filings also show 38 different
subadvisors reporting within the seven BlackRock entities. See Table A.2 for a complete list of
BlackRock subsidiaries.

     According to BlackRock 13G and 13D filings, the beneficial reporting owner in all
BlackRock holdings is the parent entity of all 38 BlackRock subsidiaries reporting under the seven
BlackRock 13F reporting registrants. Because of the requirements of the 13G filing, all affiliated
subsidiaries with shared economic and voting interest should submit a single holdings report for
each security in which they maintain beneficial ownership of 5% or more. The holdings of
BlackRock in 13G filings to 13F filings can be compared only after aggregating across all seven
13F BlackRock entities. For example, Table A.3 illustrates the holdings of Coca Cola Co., Apple
Inc., and other Dow 30 companies by each of the seven BlackRock registrants that have 13F filings
in December 2014. Each advisor’s holdings are reported on a separate record with its respective
CIK, and then the total ownership of all BlackRock entities is reported along with the beneficial
ownership reported at the parent company level in proxy statements (DEF 14A filings) as well as
the 13G or 13D reports. As the table illustrates, the reported holdings by the BlackRock parent
company are approximately equal to, if not exactly the same as, the sum of the positions in each
stock reported by BlackRock-affiliated subsidiaries on their respective 13F filings. Therefore, to
reconstruct the ownership at the BlackRock parent entity level, one needs to sum for each stock
the ownership positions reported under all seven 13F registrants.




IA.C2. Comparing the SEC 13F Sample to Other 13F Databases

     We compared the SEC 13F sample with more accurate feeds of institutional ownership,
namely the Thomson-Reuters Global Ownership feed (also called the OP feed), which is a separate
feed from the legacy Thomson Institutional Ownership feed (Spectrum or SP feed) provided
through WRDS. We find that while the SP feed understates overall institutional ownership due to
the aforementioned data quality problems, the Thomson-Reuters OP feed is more in-sync with the
original 13F filings reported on the SEC website. We decide to use the SEC filings instead of the
Thomson-Reuters OP for two reasons.

                                               10
      First, the holdings data in the Thomson-Reuters Global Ownership database (OP) is
retroactively “refreshed” in every update to reflect entities and holdings information as of the date
of the data refresh. Therefore, the database is not as historical as the true SEC filings. This problem
is more pronounced for entities that change due to mergers and acquisitions, etc. We do not know
the full extent of this bias, however, because we did not compare vintages across time.

      Additionally, the Thomson-Reuters Global Ownership database (OP) makes many
assumptions that are not transparent in disaggregating the holdings from the CIK registrant level
to entities at the subadvisor level. For example, using the BlackRock example, the legacy
Thomson-Reuters SP feed aggregates the seven BlackRock CIK filing entities, as discussed earlier,
into three mgrnos. The newer Thomson-Reuters OP feed, on the other hand, disaggregates them
into their subadvisor entities and makes several assumptions when splitting individual holdings
between those mutually exclusive subentities. Thomson does not currently provide historical
mappings between the subadvisor and the parent entities. For this reason, we believe that the
original SEC 13F filings are more reliable for the purposes of our study.
