                                           ABSTRACT


Peer effects have figured prominently in debates on school vouchers, desegregation, ability tracking
and anti-poverty programs. Compelling evidence of their existence remains scarce for plaguing
endogeneity issues such as selection bias and the reflection problem. This paper firmly establishes
a link between peer performance and student achievement, using a unique dataset from China. We
find strong evidence that peer effects exist and operate in a positive and nonlinear manner; reducing
the variation of peer performance increases achievement; and our semi-parametric estimates clarify
the tradeoffs facing policymakers in exploiting positive peers effects to increase future achievement.

1      Introduction

     A revival of interest has developed in recent years among social scientists to ascertain

whether non-market (or social) interactions aﬀect a variety of individual outcomes. These

interactions demonstrate that interdependence among individuals may go well beyond

their responses to private economic incentives such as price and income. The impact of

these interactions upon outcomes of interest have been given among other names “social

capital,” “contagion,” “neighborhood eﬀects” and for the focus of the present paper “peer

group eﬀects.” For example, each student influences her classmates not only through

knowledge spillovers and how teachers respond to her, but also in how she aﬀects classroom

standards. A less disciplined student is more likely to disrupt her classmates, forcing the

teacher to devote more time in class to disciplining rather than transmitting knowledge.

Therefore a student’s performance in school may be influenced by the characteristics and

behavior of her peers. If these peer group eﬀects are substantial, government policy may

exploit them by optimally grouping students in diﬀerent classrooms to achieve desired

socioeconomic outcomes.

    The rekindled interest in non-market interactions is motivated in part by recent theo-

retical developments in the economics literature which demonstrate that the composition

of peer groups aﬀect the optimal organization of schools, neighborhoods and other are-

nas where agents interact. Recent theoretical analyses of school choice showing that the

introduction of vouchers could increase competition and improve the eﬃciency of public

                                             2
schools rely on the existence of positive peer eﬀects (e.g. Epple and Romano (1998), Cau-

cutt (2001), and Nechyba (2000)). Further, a number of recent macroeconomic growth

models (e. g. Benabou (1996) and Kremer (1993)) depend on certain form of peer eﬀects

for their optimal organization of neighborhoods and jobs of diﬀerent skill levels respec-

tively. Peer group eﬀects have also played a prominent role in policy debates concerning

ability tracking, school desegregation, aﬃrmative action and anti-poverty programs in

both rural areas and urban ghettos.

      While substantial theoretical developments have been made recently on the eﬀects of

peers (and other social interactions), there does not exist much compelling empirical evi-

dence on whether and how peer group characteristics aﬀect a variety of student outcomes.1

Empirical analyses on the eﬀects of peer groups have been plagued by various conceptual

and data problems.2 Many commonly used datasets suﬀer from significant attrition bias

as they fail to track those students who switched in between and out of schools, which

results in choice based samples.3 Moreover, such datasets often lack information on impor-
  1
     The literature on peer group eﬀects in education dates back to the publication of the
Coleman Report (Coleman et al. 1966). Numerous studies have since been conducted in
both the economics, sociology and education literatures which find either weak or non-
existent peer eﬀects. Recently, Hoxby (2000) and Sacerdote (2001) found positive peer
eﬀects employing sources of exogenous variation in peer group composition which are
outlined later in this section. We provide only a partial review of the recent literature
concerning peer eﬀects. Nechyba (2005) presents a more comprehensive survey of the
theoretical and computational literature and Hoxby and Weingarth (2006) provide a clear
overview and examine the performance of diﬀerent empirical models used in the literature.

     See Manski (1993), Manski (2000) and Moﬃtt (2001) for comprehensive discussion.
   3
     This is especially problematic for studies using metropolitan US datasets, where ap-
proximately 20% of the students are believed to switch in between and out of schools


                                             3
tant factors such as teacher quality and student innate ability. The analyses are further

complicated by various endogeneity issues such as the reflection problem and selection

bias. A reflection problem arises when student and peer achievement are determined si-

multaneously, which inherently convolutes the measure of peers’ influence. Selection bias

leads to a correlated unobservables problem when families select into neighborhoods and

schools for their children based in part on some unobserved group characteristics they

favor. Thus an observed positive association between one’s own outcome and that of the

peers may not be causal but due to some unknown factors that aﬀect both peer quality

and one’s own educational performance. This issue plagues studies using data from the

United States and many other countries where parents have much freedom in selecting

schools.

   Researchers have attempted to overcome the selection bias in one of three ways. The

most popular method is the use of instrumental variables (see Evans, Oates and Schwab

(1992) and Gaviria and Raphael (2001) among others) to mitigate the correlation between

unobservables and peer variables. But the statistical properties and economic validity

of these instruments are of debate.4 Recently, several studies have exploited credible
annually. For example, Hanushek, Kain and Rivkin (2004) report that in Texas approxi-
mately 50% of children switch schools at least once between grades four and seven even
after excluding changes due to the transition from elementary to middle school.
   4
     Heckman (1997) considers the economic interpretation of instrumental variable esti-
mators in general. The statistical concerns extend beyond the weak instrument problem.
For example, Rivkin (2001) argues that the use of metropolitan wide aggregate data as
instruments in the Evans, Oates and Schwab (1992) study exacerbates the specification
error in peer eﬀect estimates.


                                           4
exogenous variations to identify the eﬀects of peers on student outcomes. Sacerdote (2001)

has provided some of the strongest evidence that peer eﬀects exist at the college level by

exploiting the fact that roommates are conditionally randomly assigned at Dartmouth

college.5 Hoxby (2000) introduces two empirical strategies based on the assumption that

students are randomly assigned across classrooms based on gender and race to recover

estimates of peer eﬀects free of selection bias. Alternatively, researchers have acquired or

collected rich datasets (see Hanushek, Kain, Markman and Rivkin (2003)) that provide

strong controls to capture the selection process. We follow the last strategy and use a

unique dataset from a county in China’s Jiangsu Province.

      The primary goal of this study is to examine whether peer groups aﬀect students’

academic achievement in China’s secondary schools.6 The secondary school system in

China diﬀers markedly from that of the United States. Its features and institutional

structure yield significant benefits for research aimed at identifying the impact of peer

group characteristics on academic achievement. In particular, i) we are able to separate

the eﬀect of teacher quality from peer eﬀects, ii) attrition bias is not a concern in our

dataset, and iii) students are assigned into schools based primarily on observable test

scores. Therefore, the majority of cross sectional variation in a students’ peer group is
  5
     This methodology has also been used in Zimmerman (2003) and Kremer and Levy
(2003) who use data from diﬀerent selective higher education institutions where roomates
and dormmates are conditionally randomly assigned.
   6
     To the best of our knowledge this is the first such study using micro data from China
and the developing world. See Hanushek (1995) or Kremer (1995) for recent surveys of
school eﬃcacy in developing countries.

NOT generated by selection on unobservables in our setting. A second aim of the study is

to investigate in detail how peer groups aﬀect student achievement and discuss the policy

implications.

      This paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we describe China’s secondary

education system and the dataset that we have collected. In section 3 we introduce

the model that guides our estimation. We demonstrate that the institutional structure

of China’s secondary school system in combination with our econometric methodology

overcomes most of the problems associated with peer eﬀects estimation. Our empirical

results are presented and discussed in section 4. There is strong evidence that peer

eﬀects exist in China’s secondary schools. We find that students benefit from having

higher achieving schoolmates and from having less variation in the quality of peers in

their schools. Peer eﬀects operate in a heterogeneous manner: students who score in the

top quantiles on the college entrance examination benefit nearly twice as much from their

peers as students who score in the lowest quantiles from similar peers. Our semiparametric

estimates unveil the diﬃculties facing policy makers when they choose educational policies

that assigns students of diﬀerent achievement levels across schools (streaming or mixing)

to yield higher future achievement. Finally, we demonstrate that linear peer eﬀects are

not identified in a value added model using a fixed eﬀects estimator with a one way error

component where the peer variable is defined at the same level as the error component.7
  7
   If measures of peers are taken at the school (classroom) level, the coeﬃcient on mean
peer eﬀects would not be identified if school (classroom) indicators are included in a fixed


                                              6
We introduce an alternative strategy that permits identification of linear peer eﬀects with

unobserved fixed error component. A concluding section summarizes our findings and

discusses directions for future research.




2     China’s Secondary Education System

Our research focuses on secondary schools in one county in China’s Jiangsu Province.8 The

generous cooperation of local oﬃcials allowed us to collect a unique dataset that follows

nearly 1,300 students’ academic histories from the completion of junior high school in 1995

through the admission to colleges in 1998. The county has a population of approximately

one million in the sample period. It is an aﬄuent county typical of the booming coastal

regions of China: the per capita incomes for both urban and rural households were over

three times the national averages for each sector in 1997.9 This data set is composed

of individual scores on high school and college entrance exams in all six subject areas,

matched teacher data from administrative records for over 1,000 teachers, annual local

government investment (spending) in each school as well as other sources of school input.

    In China, entrance examination scores are by far the most important determinant of

admission to both senior middle schools (10th grade to 12th grade)and colleges.10 Within

each county, there is a clear ranking of high schools and there is keen competition to

attend higher ranked schools. It is common knowledge among the population whether a

school is a national model school, a provincial keynote school or a school that focuses on

teaching students trade skills. Students compete for positions in the higher ranked schools

by writing a municipal level high school entrance examination at the completion of junior

middle school (7th grade to 9th grade).11 This three-day examination covers material in

six subject areas.12 Since 1995, the entrance examination have underwent continuous re-

design to reduce the eﬀectiveness of drilling and teaching towards the test.13 The subject

areas are Chinese, English, mathematics, physics, chemistry, and politics. Scores on this

exam determine high school admission. Exceptions fall under the category of showing

exceptional ability in a subject area, fine arts, music or athletics.

   In their final year of senior middle school (12th grade), college bound students list their

preferences for various majors at colleges and universities, which is typically followed
entrance examination as educators argue that it overburdens students.
  11
     A municipality in China diﬀers markedly from one in North America. There are several
counties and one city within a municipality, which bears similarity to a Metropolitan
Statistical Area (MSA) in the US.
  12
     These six subject areas account for a total of 640 points. The remaining 45 points are
scores based on physical fitness. Rosen (1982) explains that the introduction of admission
examinations resulted in students spending an inordinate amount of time learning facts
they became less politically and physically active. Beginning in 1981, the criteria used
for admission changed to include athletic ability since many argued that a student needs
a well-balanced education intellectually, morally and physically.
  13
     Discussions with teachers and local education bureau oﬃcials gave us a strong impres-
sion that educators are increasingly aware of these changes and are feeling the pressure
from such changes.

by a three-day nationwide college entrance examination that encompasses material in

six subject areas.14 There are two versions of the college entrance exams. One is for

students wishing to major in the arts and is composed of questions in Chinese, English,

mathematics, geology, history, and politics. The other, for science majors, covers material

in Chinese, English, mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology. Both exams were scaled

out of 750 in 1998. The scores on these exams together with the preference lists, determine

which major of a university or college the student can attend.

      In China, the competition for positions in colleges or universities is very keen. In 1999,

only 10.7% of the population between 18-25 were either in the process of completing or

had obtained a tertiary degree.15 Since there are many more applicants than there are

positions available in colleges and universities this may result in some strategic choices

made by the students when filling out their preference lists.

      We have collected the cumulative scores on the municipal high school entrance exam-

ination for all junior middle students graduating in 1995. For eleven of the sixteen senior

middle schools in the county we know of the junior middle school each incoming student

was from and have indicators if the student was admitted based on exceptional skills in

art, music or athletics (in these situations admission test scores play a smaller role). The
 14
     There are some areas in China where students do not compete in this manner. Be-
ginning in July 2002, college entrance examination will be restricted to four subject areas
instead of six in many parts of China to reduce the burden imposed on students.

     Further, this figure comes after the government introduced a massive program boosting
the number of admissions in colleges by mandating colleges to accept more students.

records also indicate that some students were admitted prior to the entrance exam based

on their strong academic records in junior high schools.16 These records further provide

us with several demographic variables about each student and their family. Finally, we

have collected the scores on the 1998 National College Entrance Examination for the same

cohort of students. The scores obtained on these exams are almost the sole determinant

of admission to college. For each of these students, we are aware of the particular major

of a college or university which granted admission. This information is matched with the

incoming test scores so that we are able to follow nearly 1300 students from completion

of junior high school through admission to a tertiary education institute.

      We have collected information on school inputs from the administrative records of

ten of the county’s sixteen secondary schools from 1995 to 1998. These records provide

us not only with individual level information on each teacher’s demographic variables,

education and teaching history, but most importantly contain information on a measure

of teacher quality. In China, the local education bureau assesses each teacher using both

objective and subjective performance measures of factors including classroom instruction,

work ethics and student performance. Based on these assessments, teachers are ranked

within the education system and can be promoted from intern (newly hired) to third-

class, second-class, first-class and finally superior-class teacher. These rankings together
 16
    These students still complete the high school entrance examination and are encouraged
to perform to the best of their abilities. This occurs frequently as the inclusion of these
students will raise the average test score for the corresponding junior middle schools. It
is clear that these students do not face the same incentives as other test takers.

with years of teaching experience uniquely determine components of teachers’ salaries.17

This information is matched with the student data so that we obtain accurate measures

of school inputs.18

      Table 1 presents summary statistics on the characteristics of students and school inputs

available to students at schools of diﬀerent rankings in 1998. Notice that schools that are

nationally or provincially ranked have a higher percentage of instructors who are in the

superior class. Interestingly, average teaching experience is lower in these ranked schools

than in the unranked schools. This occurs since ranked schools can attract younger

teachers with higher degrees. Teachers in these ranked schools are also more likely to

teach the subjects in which they hold their degrees. It appears that teachers in the

national model school teach fewer sections and courses. Test scores for the incoming

classes are higher and variation in these scores lower in national and provincially ranked

schools versus the unranked schools. In particular, there is little variation in performance

at the national model school. Students at the national model school are most likely to

obtain tertiary education and at the Bachelor’s level. In most schools the majority of

compensation system.
  18
     Class sizes average 52 - 56 students in the data. There is very little variation in class
size within and across schools. We are able to match students in four of the nine schools
to their teachers and school investment data. The local education bureau claimed that
since teacher rankings were based in part on student performance, students were quite
randomly assigned across classrooms for fairness purposes. On our return trip to China
this spring we collected classroom data. We verified the claimed randomization using
simple regressions and tests for diﬀerences between classes.



                                               11
students are accepted into college certificate programs. Due to incomplete data on college

enrollment in school 7 it appears that school 2 and school 4, which are not ranked, place a

greater percentage of students in tertiary institutions than this provincially ranked school.

      The local government invests substantially more funds in national and provincial model

schools than in unranked schools. This is not surprising since local Chinese governments

usually associate economic growth with the education level of its population. Annual

reports even advertise the number of superior teachers in the local school system to

attract outside investment. Furthermore, nationally and provincially ranked schools tend

to receive more external donations than unranked schools, which exacerbates the inequities

across the schools.19 On our visit, we observed that ranked schools tend to have more

modern facilities. Overall, this data assists greatly in estimating education production

functions since we have i) valid outcome measures that accurately proxy achievement due

to the comprehensiveness of the mandatory exams in diﬀerent subject matters and strong

incentives for students to perform to their best on the exam, ii) no attrition bias as not

a single student left the sample, iii) reduced omitted variable bias problems as we have

actual measures of teacher quality and iv) complete information on the format of the

school assignment algorithm.
 19
   Accurate information on the exact size of these external donations was not recorded
by either the school board or individual schools.




                                              12
3     Empirical Model

In this section, we provide a simple model that guides our estimation and describe how

our dataset aids in overcoming many problems associated with peer eﬀects estimation

that have plagued empirical researches. We view the education process at period T in

two stages. In stage 1, a student is matched to a school. Denote SiT to be the school

matched to child i at time T . To distinguish our empirical strategy from those commonly

used in the literature we consider two matching processes. A school selection process

takes place if the education system does not permit schools to exclude students based

on their qualities (achievement, abilities, etc.). In this case, altruistic parents select the

optimal school j ∗ for child i (SiT = j ∗ ) which provides the highest indirect utility for their

household Vij∗ ,


              Vij ≡ Vij (Xi , Cj , Pj , Qj , AiT −1 , Ii ), for each j available to child i   (1)


where Xi are observable person-specific and family characteristics of the child i; Cj is the

cost of attending school j, which include the cost if living in a good school district; Pj

captures the characteristics of peers in school j, assuming parents have perfect foresight

at stage one (or peer characteristics do not vary much over time); Qj is school-specific

characteristics; AiT −1 indexes child i’s measured achievement at the stage of decision mak-

ing; and Ii is child i’s innate abilities. The availability of schools to a child is described by

the school admission rules in the local areas where parents can commute to work daily.


                                                   13
   When schools admit students based on their qualities, a school assignment process

takes place. School j has the jth highest minimum quality requirement, τ jT , for admission

if we sort schools based on some quality function QiT ≡ q(Ii , AiT −1 ) that maps each child’s

abilities and past achievement into a quality score. Each child i is assigned as follows:


                                 SiT = j if τ jT ≤ QiT < τ j−1T ,                                 (2)


   In the second stage, conditional on the selection or assignment of school j at the

first stage, the complete history of inputs [(XiT ...Xi0 ), (P−ijT ...P−ij0 ), (QjT ...Qjo )], and

independent random shocks (          iT ... i0 ),   the child gains knowledge as measured by a score

on an achievement test:


                   AijT = f (X iT ...Xi0 , P−ijT ...P−ij0 , QjT ...Qjo , Ii,   iT ... i0 )        (3)


   Linearizing the above achievement relationship (equation 3) yields


              AijT = β 0T +β 1T XiT +β 2T P−ijT∗ +β 3T QjT∗ +β 4T Ii
                              X
                              T −1
                         +(          α0t +α1t Xit +α2t P−ijt +α3t Qjt +α4t Ii +δ it ) +      iT   (4)
                              t=0


where δ it = α5t εit for some coeﬃcient α5t . The components of equation 4 may include

higher order and interaction terms.

   Following, Boardman and Murnane (1979) we re-express the achievement function as


              AijT = β 0 + β 1 XiT + β 2 P−ijT + β 3 QjT + β 4 Ii + β 5 AijT −1 +            iT   (5)


                                                        14
where the vector X contains individual characteristics (gender interacted with the resi-

dential status of each student’s family where males from urban areas are treated as the

comparison group), the vector I contains indicator variables for individual skills that cap-

ture portions of innate abilities and P−ijT is a vector of variables that captures the prior

achievement of all other students in the same cohort within that school. The inclusion

of Aijt−1 in the regression is to pick up a variety of confounding influences including the

prior, and often unrecorded as well as unobserved history of parental, school and com-

munity eﬀects. The implied restrictive assumption for this type of model is that Aijt−1

is a suﬃcient statistic of all the previous influences. This assumes that Aijt−1 is a state

variable that follows a Markov process.20 Note, in our baseline specification we include the

mean, the mean squared and the variance of the peers’ high school entrance examinations

scores.



3.1       Estimation

The general empirical challenge facing researchers in estimating problem equation 5 is

endogeneity of the peer variable which can arise and be formulated in more than one

manner. In the economics of education literature, the most discussed form of endogeneity
 20
    This assumption requires that the eﬀect of observed and unobserved factors in the
production process to be adjusting over time at the same rate as no past inputs and
shocks are left unrepresented by Aijt−1 . Due to the limitation of almost all education data
sets, this assumption is adopted for practical reasons and has not been tested to the best
of our knowledge.



                                            15
is the endogenous group membership problem. When public school admission decisions are

mostly based on residential location, the conditional expectation of the error term when

school j is chosen , E(    ijT |SiT   = j if VijT >= VikT for all k 6= j), does not typically

equal zero.21 Since VijT can include many such factors to decision making that are similar

within a community and not typically contained in a dataset, concerns regarding biased

coeﬃcient estimates become serious.

      In contrast to the typical US experience of a school selection process, a school assign-

ment process based primarily on characteristics observable in our data matches students

to senior middle schools in China. Students can attend a given school from anywhere

within the county and dormitories are provided at very low cost to accommodate stu-

dents from neighboring communities or rural areas. For this reason there is no need for

people to form communities within this county based on characteristics that henceforth

influence school composition.22 This result is originally pointed out by Barnow, Gold-

berger and Cain (1981) : “Unbiasedness is attainable when the variables that determined
 21
     In this case when a school selection process matches children to school, parents who
care about child’s education are willing to pay higher housing prices to move to a good
school district (see Black (1999)) and are more likely to engage in actions to improve their
child’s performance.
  22
     Social network (Guanxi) in China plays a limited role in determining who gets access
to the better senior middle schools. School assignment based on public information (test
scores) reflects in part the strong common preference for fair assignment process, which
is monitored by each family whose child is concerned. In counties such as the one studied
in this paper where extreme importance is attached to education, the scope with which
network can aﬀect the assignment process is minimized. Moreover, any back-door admis-
sions are generally rationalized as if the student had exceptional ability in a particular
subject area, fine arts, music or athletics, for which we have indicators to control.

the assignment rule are known, quantified and included in the [estimating] equation.”

     C
Let SiT to indicate the school assigned to child i at time T in China. In this setting

if we consider the eﬀects of school assignment on student achievement (equation 5), the

conditional expectation is given as:


 E[AijT |S C
           iT = j] = β 0 + β 1 XiT + β 2 P−ijT + β 3 QjT + β 4 Ii + β 5 AiT −1 + E(
                                                                                                 C
                                                                                           ijT |SiT   = j)

                                                                                                         (6)

  = β 0 +β 1 XiT +β 2 P−ijT +β 3 QjT +β 4 Ii +β 5 AiT −1 +E(   ijT |τ jT ≤   q(I i , AiT −1 ) < τ j−1T ) (7)

Since all the variables to the right of the conditional operator are known, and all the

schools follow the same deterministic assignment rule, E(∗) = 0, a simple regression

would obtain unbiased parameter estimates.

      To determine admission each senior middle school is provided with each student ap-

plicant’s high school entrance examination and information on exceptional skills from the

local education bureau. The files are sent in a sequential manner ensuring that the higher

ranked schools have the privilege of recruiting the best students.23 Administrators at

each senior high school convert this information to a single index and grant admission

to students whose index is above a cutoﬀ score. To verify whether students were truly
 23
     Students are restricted to apply to one school at each quality level, a factor that
we exploit in one of our empirical strategies described below. The philosophy behind
national and provincial model schools is that they are necessary to eﬀectively train top-
level manpower needed for China’s development. In certain parts of China, such as
Shenzhen, Xiamen, Shanghai and Changchun such schools have drawn criticism for being
elitist and have been abolished conceptually.



                                                 17
assigned to type of schools based on the observables in our data we used an ordered probit

regression of the rank of the school (unranked, aﬃliated with the ranked schools, provin-

cial school and national school) on the incoming test scores and indicator variables for

early admission or talent in subject areas. We then used our estimates to construct the

predicted probability that each student was assigned to each school type. Assuming that

each student attended the school type to which she had the highest predicted probability

we compared these predicted assignments to the actual assignment. In total we find that

96.67% of the matches are accurate,24 leaving little room for any unobserved factor to

potentially bias the estimates of equation 5.25

      Simultaneity problem in peer eﬀect estimation was first coined the ”reflection problem”

in Manski (1993), as it is similar to the problem of interpreting the almost simultaneous
 24
      We received unoﬃcial formulas that confirmed that assignment was based solely on
these characteristics and they were treated in a linear fashion with weights. The coeﬃcient
estimates are available from the authors by request. The concordance rates between
predicted and actual assignment by school type were 97.55%, 89.74%, 99.19% and 93.7%
respectively.
   25
      Potential candidates in our setting for such unobservables may exist due to parents’
preference to be geographically close to their child or the selection process by the student
prior to the high school entrance examination. To simplify the high school admission
process, students are required to choose one of the three provincial model schools as their
most preferred school before their High School Entrance Examination. Although all the
provincial schools are of the same rank they may have diﬀerent cutoﬀ scores for admission
due to the number of applications. Thus a student with score 588 may attend a lower
ranked school if his preferred provincial school has the cutoﬀ score at 590, even though his
score exceeded the cutoﬀ of another provincial school (say 585). The choices of students
among the provincial schools reflect their locational preferences and strategic guessing
(i.e. which school may have a lower cutoﬀ score), which do not correlate with academic
performances.

movements of a person and her reflection in a mirror. The problem occurs if the peer

variable measures classmates’ achievement at time T, which is obtained at the same time

as one’s own achievement. In our education production function, all the regressors are

known (predetermined) at the time of regression, which in theory avoids simultaneity

problems. Moreover, our peer variable is constructed using academic scores measured

immediately prior to any interactions among classmates, which captures the background

of one’s peers. We argue that a student’s current performance is not a function of the

current outcomes of his or her peers, but rather depends on peer quality used to form

the student body. Manski notes that if the transmission of peer eﬀects really follows this

temporal pattern, the identification problem is alleviated.




4     Empirical Results

4.1    Do Peer Eﬀects Exist?

Ordinary least squares estimates of our baseline equation 5 are reported in Table 2. The

first column presents the results for the full sample. With the exception of the tuition

variable, each regressor enters in a statistically significant manner.26 The results suggest
 26
    The bottom 25% of the incoming students in terms of admission scores are required to
pay higher tuition fees than other incoming students in each school. The local education
bureau claimed that in this county where education is highly valued, almost no one refused
to pay and went to either a lower ranked school or dropped out of school. Although there
is no selection in tuition payment, those students may face diﬀerent incentives as their
parents may expect more in the results. See Ding and Lehrer (2002) for a discussion of

                                            19
that a 1% increase in peer quality will increase one’s college entrance examination score

by 0.088%. In other words, the eﬀect of an increase in peer’s incoming test scores is

equivalent to about one twelfth (0.078%) of the eﬀect of a corresponding increase in

one’s own incoming test score. The sign on the peer squared term suggests a concave

relationship in peer eﬀect. Furthermore, the results suggest that individuals respond

negatively to an increase in the variation of their peers’ performance.

   Not surprisingly, winning an academic award or being awarded early admission is

positively related to future student test performance, while skills in music and athletics

are correlated with poorer performance. Urban females score lower than rural females.

This may be explained by the greater accessibility to high school education for urban

females than their rural counterparts as the negative impact of being a female may not

aﬀect a top student as much as it aﬀects an average student.

   The school quality variables included are mainly teacher quality variables. The es-

timated coeﬃcients in both regressions indicate that students benefit most from higher

ranked teachers, which suggests the importance of teacher inputs.27 The natural collinear-

ity between the school quality variables may explain the implausibly large magnitude of

the associated coeﬃcients. It is worth noting that even with the removal of the school
survey evidence which demonstrates that families in urban areas of China rarely refuse
to pay higher tuition fees.
  27
     The excluded group is the sum of percentage of third class and new teachers. Nearly
all new teachers are promoted to third class within their first year and as such we assume
that teaching quality would not diﬀer between these ranks.



                                            20
quality variables a concave relationship in peers exists. The results suggest that a 1%

increase in the quality of peers will increase one’s score on the college entrance examina-

tion by 0.41%. This estimate provides an upper bound for the eﬀect of peers since school

quality is positively correlated with peer quality. The finding that second class teachers

benefit students slightly more than superior teachers is driven by the provincial school

7, which has many young teachers ranked at the second class. If that school is removed

from the analysis the results correspond to our priors with the ordering of the eﬀect of

each type of teachers consistent with the definition.

      We examined how good the measures of teacher qualities are at explaining the diﬀer-

ences in between schools other than the peers. We find that having a higher percentage

of superior and first class teachers accounts for 35 − 50% of the variation in the school

fixed eﬀect. We explored the relationship with extrinsic measures of teacher quality such

as highest degree attained and teaching experience and find that they could only explain

5 − 10% of the variation. This result is consistent with other studies examining school

quality which suggest that a good measure of teacher quality is essential to any such

studies.28 In fact replacing the teacher quality variables with these extrinsic measures

suggested that a 1% increase in the quality of peers will lead to an implausible 0.80% in-

crease in one’s score on the college entrance examination. This suggests that the extrinsic

measures may be negatively correlated with actual teaching quality.
 28
   This point was originally made in Murnane (1975) and stressed in the influential survey
by Eric Hanushek (1986).


                                            21
      The second column of Table 2 reports the results from exploiting the natural regression

discontinuities created by the entrance exam cutoﬀ rules for entry into diﬀerent ranked

secondary schools.29 This addresses the concern that our ability, past achievement and

demographic variables may not capture all the individual diﬀerences across students that

aﬀects future academic outcomes. We compare the outcomes for students who scored

similarly (within 20 points or 2.9%) and tightly around the cutoﬀ scores of the provincial

model schools on the high school entrance examination. Within a tight range of 20 points

on a 685-point exam, the academic abilities and achievements of the students are hardly

discernibly diﬀerent, but they were enrolled in diﬀerent schools with diﬀerent peers due

to keen competition described in section 2. The use of this sample is similar to a natural

experiment in that most of the diﬀerence between college entrance examination scores of

this group of students who attend diﬀerent schools must be attributed to diﬀerences in

the behavior and composition of the peer groups and diﬀerences in school inputs.

      In this subsample students scored similarly and within a twenty point interval on

the high school entrance examination.30 Those who attended provincial schools in this
 29
     Regression discontinuity estimators exploit discontinuities in the treatment assignment
mechanism that may develop because of rules governing access as in this study (or as in
Angrist and Lavy (1999) study of the eﬀects of class size on test scores) or geographic
boundaries (as in Black (1999) who estimated parents’ willingness to pay for higher quality
schools). The approach only identifies treatment eﬀects locally at the point where the
probability of receiving treatment changes discontinuously. Even though the rule in our
case is deterministic we are not provided with the threshold score for each provincial
school. Thus, we can not use it as instrumental variable for the probability of receiving
the treatment (attending a provincial school).
  30
     The scores included are those between 568 to 588.


                                              22
sample entered with an average score of 579.31 (standard deviation =7.92) which was less

than one point higher than students in the lower ranked schools (578.46 with standard

deviation= 7.92). Yet these students had access to higher quality peers (and diﬀerent

school resources31 ) and scored an average of 20 points (approximately 3% higher) greater

on the college entrance examination32 . Mann Whitney tests confirm that this diﬀerence

in performance on the college entrance examination is statistically significant (z = -3.036,

Prob > |z| = 0.0024).

      The OLS estimates for this subsample are carried out on 65% fewer students and

two fewer schools and as a result peer quality has significantly less variation within and

between schools. The peer variance continues to be negatively and significantly related

to higher scores on the college entrance examination, while the signs on the mean peer

variable and the quadratic term have changed from those obtained in the full sample.

The marginal peer eﬀect remains positive and is significantly larger for this subsample

(0.518), with a convex relationship on peer eﬀects. Since the tuition variable is a perfect

predictor of attending provincial schools it is not included in the analysis.
 31
     Mann Whitney tests for this sample demonstrate that there are significant diﬀerences
in peer ability between provincial and non- provincial schools (z =-20.165, Prob > |z|
= 0.00). For the school resources presented in table 1 significant diﬀerences between
provincial and non provincial school exist only for years of teaching experience ( z =
1.640, Prob > |z| = 0.10) and teachers who instructed the subject in which they were
awarded their degree ( z = -1.94, Prob > |z| = 0.05).
  32
     Provincial school students scored 453.48 (s. d.=54.90) versus a score of 431.04 (s.d.=
51.75) for students who attended lower ranked schools in this subsample.




                                            23
4.2      How Do Peer Eﬀects Operate?

The concavity in the full sample and the convexity in the subsample suggests that het-

erogeneity in students’ response to their peers may exist. To get a complete picture of

the heterogeneous responses, we employ a partial linear model where the mean peer vari-

able is entered as a nonparametric function to be estimated instead of a simple quadratic

function. The nonparametric estimate would not only explain the diﬀerence between the

shapes in the full sample versus the subsample but would also lend evidence to policy

discussions on whether to “stream” or “mix” students of diﬀerent abilities. Streaming

is to place students of similar abilities into the same group while mixing is to randomly

assign students into groups based on their abilities.33

      A partial linear model allows us to enter the mean peer eﬀect variable in a nonpara-

metric fashion. To estimate a partial linear model we modify equation 5 as follows


         AijT = β 0 + β 1 XiT + h(P−ijT ) + β 2v V PjT + β 3 QjT + β 4 Ii + β 5 AijT −1 +   iT   (8)


where h is a nonparametric function of the mean peer variable to be estimated and

V PjT is the variance of the peer variable. As before, we include the peer variance as

well as the remaining educational inputs as linear regressors. If a concave relationship is

estimated this would suggest that to increase total academic achievement, mixing students

of diﬀerent abilities is preferred.34 Similarly a convex relationship provides support for
 33
     See Hallam (2002) and the references cited in Glewwe (1997) for a recent survey of
the ability grouping literature in education and economics respectively.
  34
     Glewwe (1997) introduced a non-linear least squares (NLLS) estimator to determine

                                                 24
streaming students. Entering the peer variable in a nonparametric manner will improve

parameter estimates of the individual β 0 s if the peer variable is stochastic or if peers aﬀect

achievement in a manner that can not be captured by only two terms. Since improved

parameter estimates are obtained this has a secondary benefit of improving the estimation

of the shape of the peer eﬀect function: h(P−ijT ).35

   The nonparametric estimates of peer eﬀects are presented in Figure 1. The shape is

statistically diﬀerent from a horizontal line which further verifies the existence of peer

eﬀects in China’s secondary schools. The graph of the conditional achievement on av-

erage peer quality starts as concave and alternates between convexity and concavity as

peer quality increases. Moreover, neither a concave or convex figure could lie within a

90% confidence interval of the estimated curve. The results explain the diﬀerent shapes
whether streaming is preferred to mixing. This estimation takes account the distribution
of peer group characteristics and draws on a Box-Cox flexible functional form of the mean
peer variable. An advantage of this approach is ease of interpretation of the results as
the sign of one parameter estimate is enough to determine whether streaming is preferred
to mixing. The downside to this approach is that the functional form assumed is still
restrictive. This approach assumes that policymakers have a utilitarian welfare function
and that individuals only gain utility from the level of achievement they obtain. NLLS
estimates with our data (available from the authors on request) suggest that mixing is pre-
ferred to streaming. Yet neither a concave or convex function could fit the nonparametric
function estimated in Figure 1 even with an addition of a 90% confidence interval.
  35
     Methods to estimate this equation are introduced in Robinson (1988). We follow
the “double diﬀerencing” approach suggested in Robinson (1988) using a local linear
regression estimator in place of the traditional kernel regression estimator. As shown in
Fan (1992) the bias of the local linear regression estimator does not depend on the design
density of the data. Second, the local linear regression estimator avoids the boundary
bias problem associated with kernel regression estimators. We experimented with four
diﬀerent bandwidths and there were no major diﬀerences in the shape of the Figure.



                                              25
we obtained using the full sample and subsample near the discontinuity. Further, they

demonstrate the dilemma educational policy makers may face in determining whether

streaming or mixing students will obtain higher future average achievement. Students at

the low end of the conditional achievement benefit substantially from mixing with better

peers whereas students at the high end gain from streaming, while students in the middle

may prefer to be mixed with certain peers but streamed from other peers. The decision

on streaming or mixing may depend not only on the particular group of students involved

but also on policy makers’ preferences in trading oﬀ achievements of diﬀerent groups of

students, which is beyond the scope of positive economic analysis.36

      The above findings have focused on how peers aﬀect average performance. The impact

of observed factors may vary over the distribution of unobserved factors (i.e. ability) that

aﬀect achievement.37 To examine this hypothesis we reestimate equation 5 via quantile

regression using quantiles ranging from 0.05 to 0.95 at each 0.05. Quantile regression

provides a more flexible approach to characterizing the eﬀects of observed covariates

such as peer groups on diﬀerent percentiles of the conditional achievement distribution
 36
     This requires that a social planner knows the exact form of the social welfare function
defined for each possible achievement distribution for the population (i.e. it is strongly
separable with respect to each individual achievement value). Whether such a utilitarian
social welfare function is the right one for society is a question that is left to the reader
and beyond the current scope of this paper.
  37
     In all specifications we assume separability between student characteristics, school
quality variables and peer group eﬀects. Quantile regression allows students with diﬀerent
unobserved factors to respond diﬀerently to observed factors. If the coeﬃcient estimates
diﬀer across quantiles heterogeneous eﬀects are present. Note that at each of the 19
quantiles each of the three peer quality variables were statistically significant.


                                             26
providing a richer pattern on how peer groups aﬀect student achievement. Implicitly

we are allowing peer groups and ability to be two separate factors in the generation of

achievement (equation 4) to interact in unknown ways . If ability and peer groups are

substitutes we would expect the marginal returns on peers to decrease with ability. If

ability and peer groups are complements then marginal returns to peers would be higher

for the more able.

   Figure 2 presents the results corresponding to our baseline specification for regressors

such as the student’s own incoming test score and peer eﬀect variables. The solid line

in each graph represents the ordinary least squares estimate of the mean eﬀect. Each

triangle represents one of the 19 quantile regression coeﬃcient estimates. The eﬀect of

incoming test scores presents an inverted U graph where the largest gains are for those

students in the middle quantiles.

   While the mean peer variable demonstrates that the strongest gains accrue to those in

the lowest quantile, the quadratic peer variable shows that these individuals also achieve

the smallest benefits to achievement. Without common support of the peer variables

across diﬀerent quantiles, we cannot calculate comparable marginal eﬀects as a common

set of peer values are needed. If we assign the average of all peers as the common peer, a

graph of the marginal eﬀect across quantiles demonstrates the largest gains from having

higher quality peers appear in the middle quantiles. Students in the lowest quantiles

gain the least-only half of what the students gain in the higher quantiles. Finally, all


                                            27
individuals benefit from less variation in their classmates’ performance, although those at

the higher quantiles are not as negatively aﬀected by increases in this variation.

   It is clear that the heterogeneity of peer group eﬀects operates in at least two di-

mensions. First, the quantile regression results demonstrate that students of diﬀerent

unobserved abilities respond to the same peer diﬀerently. and we are able to reject the

hypothesis of homogeneity in the returns to peer groups. Second, estimates from the par-

tial liner model demonstrate that same student will respond in a heterogeneous manner

to diﬀerent compositions of their peer groups.



4.3    Are the results robust?

To address the concerns (despite the advantages of the data and the controls we employ)

that there may still exist some unobserved or omitted diﬀerences across schools that drive

the results in Tables 2, we consider fixed eﬀect estimation. This can be accommodated in

our framework by relaxing the assumption that the school quality variables are measured

perfectly (QtjT ) and allow for the possibility that they are measured with error (Qm
                                                                                    jT ) as


given by the relationship below:

                                    Qm     t
                                     jT = QjT + ujT                                    (9)

If we were to allow the random noise term (ujT ) to be correlated with some exogenous

regressors in equation 5 and employ a fixed eﬀects estimator (which are regularly used

in empirical studies of peer eﬀects) we are unable to uniquely identify the mean peer

                                            28
eﬀect coeﬃcient.38 The coeﬃcients of nonlinear peer variables can still be identified. To

demonstrate this consider substituting equation 9 into equation 5,

         AijT = β 0 + β 1 XiT + β 2 P−ijT + β 3 (QtjT + ujT ) + β 4 Ii + β 5 AijT −1 + ∈iT

Rewriting this equation at the mean level for each school j, we get

             AijT = β 0j + β 1 XiT + β 2 P−ijT + β 3 QjT + β 4 Ii + β 5 AijT −1 + ∈iT
                                             P
                                               A−ijT
        where β 0j = β 0 + β 3 ujT , P−ijT =          and
                                             Nj − 1
             P−ijT = AijT −1 if P−ijT is the mean peer eﬀect.

The fixed eﬀect regression is carried out on the following equation

           AijT −AijT = β 1 (X iT −XiT ) + β 2 (P −ijT −P−ijT ) + β 4 (I i −Ii )

                              +β 5 (AijT −1 −AijT −1 )+(   iT   − ∈iT )
                                                     −(AijT −1 − AijT −1 )
                         = β 1 (X iT −XiT ) + β 2                          +β 4 (I i −Ii )
                                                           Nj − 1
                               β 5 (AijT −1 −AijT −1 )+(   iT   − ∈iT )                      (10)

Notice that β 2 cannot be identified separately from β 5 due to perfect correlation between

the transformed mean peer variable and one’s past achievement as (Nj − 1) does not
 38
    We have also considered the case where this random noise term (ujT ) is normally
distributed with zero mean and uncorrelated with all the other exogenous regressors in
equation 5 and incorporate a random eﬀects estimator to achieve consistent estimates. The
patterns of estimates were similar in magnitude, sign and significance to those obtained
with OLS for both the full and subsample. The results (available from the authors by
request) suggest that a 1% increase in the quality of peers will increase one’s score on the
college entrance examination by 0.154%, which is equivalent to more than one seventh
(0.151%) the eﬀect of a corresponding increase in one’s own earlier achievement score for
the full sample and 0.354 for the subsample.

vary for each individual.      The mean peer eﬀect can not be identified in this setting.

Further, if one were to use current test scores to define the peer variables as considered

in several studies (recall this also introduces a reflection problem), the transformed peer

eﬀect variable would perfectly explain the transformed dependent variable.

      The coeﬃcients on the nonlinear peer variables can still be “identified" in these fixed

eﬀect regressions as such perfect co-movement does not apply to the quadratic or the vari-

ance terms.39 However only qualitative interpretation of these coeﬃcients is meaningful

as the marginal eﬀect cannot be calculated. Moreover the results are still sensitive to any

variation in school sizes and may suﬀer from lack of variation within schools.

      A strategy that helps us to identify whether mean peer eﬀects exist when the random

noise term, ujT , is correlated with some exogenous regressors in equation 5 is as follows.

We randomly assign with replacement each student a classmate from the same school.

We then recalculate the peer eﬀect variable for each student omitting oneself as before

but also the randomly assigned classmate from that school. This serves to break the

perfect correlation between the mean peer and earlier achievement regressors to achieve

identification, although multicollinearity arises instead which renders mean peer estimate

imprecise. Since this newly constructed peer variable can be viewed as if it were measured

with error, the estimates are biased towards zero in absolute value and statistical rejection.
 39
   In theory when the full rank condition is violated, identification is not possible. In
practice, canned software packages typically achieve identification by dropping one of the
perfectly correlated variables or a single observation.

      Column 1 of Table 3 presents summary results from one hundred fixed eﬀects regres-

sions with diﬀerent classmates randomly removed with replacement. The average of the

estimated peer eﬀect coeﬃcients, while large in scale due to the limited variation in the

peer variables within a school, are exactly the same in terms of signs and statistical sig-

nificance as those in OLS and random eﬀects. This renders it unlikely that something

unobserved or omitted is driving the results, at least qualitatively. We find that the vari-

ance of the peer quality is negatively related to student performance at the 1% level in

each of the 100 individual regressions. We also find that in 72 of the 100 individual re-

gressions both the mean peer and the quadratic peer are statistically significantly and in

a concave manner. Moreover, the three peer variables are always jointly significant in all

the regressions. Since the design of our identification strategy may bias these coeﬃcients

towards zero in absolute value and statistical rejection, the findings strongly reinforce

the existence of peer eﬀects in secondary schools. Further, they demonstrate conclusively

that the negative and statistically significant eﬀects of higher order moments of the peer

variable on student achievement are not driven by omitted school characteristics.

      Column 2 of Table 3 presents fixed eﬀects regression results for the subsample near the

entrance cutoﬀ discontinuity.40 Since we have only 406 students in seven schools consistent
 40
    Fixed eﬀects regressions are identified with this subsample since the peer variable is
defined over the full sample rather than the subsample in the regression which prevents
perfect correlation. However, multicollinearity may render the estimate on the mean peer
variable imprecise.

estimates can not be obtained due to the incidental parameters problem.41 To remedy the

situation we run school type fixed eﬀects (provincial vs. lower ranked schools). In the first

column we omit teacher quality variables which vary across schools within school types.

The pattern across both columns is consistent with the OLS results. Peer eﬀects enter

significantly in a convex manner and the peer variance remains negatively and significantly

related to higher scores on the college entrance examination.




5     Conclusions

In this paper, we employ a unique and rich dataset from a county in China’s Jiangsu

province to investigate whether peer group eﬀects exist. The secondary school system in

China diﬀers markedly from that of the United States and its features and institutional

structure yield significant benefits to identify the impacts of peer group characteristics on

student achievement. In particular, i) we are able to separate the eﬀect of teacher quality

from peer eﬀects ii) attrition bias is of little concern iii) we have valid outcome measures

that are accurate and comprehensive and iv) students are assigned into schools based

primarily on observables. Therefore, the majority of cross sectional variation in students’

peers is not generated by self-selection in our setting. Our methodology overcomes the
 41
    Asymptotics require either the number of students within a school or the number of
schools to go to infinity. There exists substantial Monte Carlo evidence that fixed eﬀects
estimates perform poorly when neither dimension is greater than 50. In our subsample
the number of students within a school averages 58 with 3 schools having fewer than 40
students.

reflection problem and deals with the possibility that the school quality variables may be

measured with error.

   We find strong and robust evidence that peer eﬀects exist. We find that peer groups

contribute significantly and positively to student performance measured by test scores.

Our evidence is strongest in showing that peer groups operate in a nonlinear manner and

all individuals respond negatively to an increase in the variation of peer quality. The

marginal eﬀect of a one percent increase in the quality of peers on student achievement is

equivalent to between 8 − 15% of a one percent increase in one’s own earlier achievement.

   We find that peer eﬀects operate in a heterogenous manner. High ability students

benefit more from having higher achieving schoolmates and from having less variation in

peer quality than students of lower ability. Further, our semiparametric estimates clarify

the trade-oﬀs facing educational policy makers in constructing a policy that exploits the

existence of peer eﬀects to increase future average test scores.

   Finally, we demonstrated that the magnitude of our results are sensitive to the school

quality variables included in the estimating equation. The plausible economic significance

of the peer eﬀects relies on the use of teacher quality variables that are strongly correlated

with actual teaching performance.

   While we argue that our data and methodology overcome the majority of statistical

problems associated with peer eﬀects estimation, we are aware of the limitations of this

study. First, there is substantially less variation in student ability in China than that


                                             33
in the US public high schools. Second, the county is only representative of the aﬄuent

coastal regions of China.

   To summarize, this study provides the most compelling evidence to date on the exis-

tence of peer eﬀects at the secondary school level. The institutional structure of China’s

secondary education system mitigates traditional biases related to selection of schools and

attrition assisting in identifying the role of school inputs including peer groups. All stu-

dents appear to benefit from having higher achieving schoolmates in a non-linear manner

and from having less variation in the quality of students within their schools. Hetero-

geneity arises from students of diﬀerent abilities responding to same peers diﬀerently and

same students responding to diﬀerent peer qualities diﬀerently.
