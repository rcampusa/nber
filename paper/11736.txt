                                           ABSTRACT

We explore the macro/finance interface in the context of equity markets. In particular, using half a
century of Livingston expected business conditions data we characterize directly the impact of
expected business conditions on expected excess stock returns. Expected business conditions
consistently affect expected excess returns in a statistically and economically significant counter-
cyclical fashion: depressed expected business conditions are associated with high expected excess

returns. Moreover, inclusion of expected business conditions in otherwisestandard predictive return

regressions substantially reduces the explanatory power of the conventional financial predictors,

including the dividend yield, default premium, and term premium, while simultaneously increasing

R-squared. Expected business conditions retain predictive power even after controlling for an

important and recently introduced non-financial predictor, the generalized consumption/wealth ratio,

which accords with the view that expected business conditions play a role in asset pricing different

from and complementary to that of the consumption/wealth ratio. We argue that time-varying

expected   business   conditions    likely capture     time-varying    risk,   while   time-varying

consumption/wealth may capture time-varying risk aversion.

1. Introduction

       The equity market macro-finance interface presents a clear puzzle: Many have argued

that business conditions should be linked to expected excess returns (e.g., Fama and French,

1989, 1990; Chen, Roll and Ross, 1986; Barro, 1990 ), yet the standard predictors are not

macroeconomic, but rather financial: dividend yields, default premia, and term premia. Several

authors have claimed that the standard financial predictors may serve as proxies for expected

business conditions, and they interpret their predictive power through that lens.1 In the absence

of direct expectations data, however, the claim that expected excess equity returns are driven by

expected business conditions remains largely speculative.

       Against this background, we use a well-known survey to provide direct evidence on the

links between expected business conditions and expected excess equity returns over some fifty

years. We ask two key sets of questions. First, are the standard financial predictors related to

expected business conditions, and if so, how?

       Second, do expected business conditions indeed forecast future returns? Are expected

business conditions a useful predictor of excess returns even after controlling for the standard

financial predictors? And conversely, are the standard financial predictors useful even after

controlling for expected business conditions? If not, do any standard financial predictors retain

power after conditioning on expected business conditions?

Ferson and Harvey (1991), Campbell (1991) and Lettau and Ludvigson (2005).
       We proceed as follows. In section 2 we describe the data, and in particular our survey-

based measure of expected business conditions. In section 3 we examine the links between

expected business conditions and the standard financial predictors of excess returns. In section 4

we document the effects of including expected business conditions in otherwise-standard return

predictive regressions, at both short and long horizons, and we also examine a recently-

introduced predictor, the consumption/wealth ratio, which turns out to be very important. We

conclude in section 5.

2. Data

       Here we introduce the data on which our analysis is based, with special attention paid to

the Livingston survey, and we briefly document some of their properties.

Excess Returns and Financial Predictors

       We construct excess stock returns using the CRSP value-weighted portfolio and the 90-

day U.S. Treasury bill rate, 1952:1-2003:2. We examine several standard and widely-studied

financial return predictors, the dividend yield (DP, calculated for the CRSP value-weighted

portfolio), the default premium (DEF, calculated as the yield difference between a broad

corporate bond portfolio and the Aaa yield) and the term premium (TERM, calculated as the

yield difference between a ten-year Treasury bond and a one-month Treasury bill), also 1952:1-

2003:2. In Table 1, we present summary statistics for excess returns and all predictors.

The Livingston Forecasts

       Our business conditions expectations data come from the Livingston Survey of

Professional Forecasters. The Livingston survey is widely followed, heavily studied, and




                                               -2-
generally respected.2 Moreover, and importantly, it is available over a long sample period, in

contrast for example to the Survey of Professional Forecasters, which begins only in 1968.3 The

Livingston survey is semi-annual, conducted in June and December. Our sample begins in

1952:1, which matches the beginning of the continuously-recorded Livingston survey data, and

continues until 2003:2.4

          We construct real GDP growth expectations from the nominal GDP and CPI level

expectations reported in the Livingston survey, which solicits respondents’ views regarding

economic variables in six and twelve months’ time.5 We aggregate the Livingston responses into

median forecasts, obtaining, for each series and survey date, a median forecast of the series’

level six and twelve months hence, and we take log differences to obtain an approximate two-

step-ahead growth rate forecast, as in Gultekin (1983).6 The final result is a series of two-step-

ahead real GDP growth forecasts,                                  .

          The two-step-ahead real growth rate forecasts constructed from the Livingston data

appear well-behaved. In Figure 1 we show the actual growth rates, the Livingston forecasts, and


          2

(1997).
          3
         It would be interesting, but beyond the scope of this paper, to attempt to replicate its
results using expectations from the Survey of Professional Forecasters.
          4
        Note the timing convention associated with our use of semi-annual data: 2001:2, for
example, refers to the second half of 2001, i.e., 7/1/2001 through 12/31/2001.
          5
         Unfortunately, the Livingston survey does not ask participants about expectations of
current GDP of CPI levels, so we can not use it to construct one-step-ahead forecasts (a step
being a six-month interval).
          6
         Presumably one could also make some use of the distribution of forecasts, but we have
not yet explored that avenue. See Miller (1977) and Guo and Savickas (2005).

                                                    -3-
the corresponding forecast errors. The forecasts move with the actual growth rates but are

smoother, which is a well-known property of optimal forecasts of stationary series.7 Moreover,

the forecast errors appear to have zero mean and display no obvious predictable patterns.8 The

sharp cutoff in the sample autocorrelation function of the forecast errors beyond displacement

one, as shown in Figure 2, indicates first-order moving average structure, which is consistent

with optimality of the two-step-ahead forecasts. The mean Livingston (annualized) real GDP

growth rate forecast in Table 1 is 2.54 percent, which closely accords with historical growth

realizations.

       Ultimately, however, the issue of whether the Livingston forecasts are fully optimal is of

limited relevance for our purposes. They simply are what they are, and we take them at face

value, asking whether and how they are linked to expected excess equity returns. The first step

of that inquiry involves characterizing the links between the Livingston expectations and the

standard financial excess return predictors, to which we now turn.

3. Expected Business Conditions and Financial Predictors of Excess Returns

       In their classic assessment of the predictability of excess stock returns, Fama and French

(1989) find that excess returns are indeed predictable, with most predictive power coming from

the dividend yield, the default premium, and the term premium. More precisely, they estimate

regressions of the form

                                                                     ,                    (1)


       7
           See Diebold (2004).
       8
        Moreover, even if the errors did have a non-zero mean, they would not necessarily be
suboptimal, because biased forecasts are optimal under asymmetric loss. See Leitch and Tanner
(1991) and Christoffersen and Diebold (1997).

                                               -4-
and they document a strong relationship in terms of the usual t-statistics,        values, and so forth,

where          is the excess return on a broad stock portfolio over    periods, for     ranging from

one quarter to several years.

        The key open question is why financial variables should predict excess returns. Fama

and French (1989) suggest that the predictive power may derive from correlation with expected

business (macroeconomic) conditions. Notoriously little direct evidence exists, however, as to

whether the financial variables actually are linked to expected business conditions. In this

section we provide precisely such direct evidence, examining the extent to which the Livingston

real growth expectations are linked to the standard financial predictors, both pairwise and jointly.

We estimate regressions of Livingston expected business conditions                    on the dividend

yield        , the default premium         , and the term premium          . In Table 2 we show

results from both simple and multiple regressions.

        First consider the simple regressions, which reveal some links between the financial

variables and expected business conditions, although the strength and statistical significance

vary across variables and specifications. First, the dividend yield is negatively related to

expected business conditions. This accords with the dividend discount model, which predicts

that the dividend yield should fall when necessary to offset higher expected growth in

dividends.9 Second, the term premium is positively related to expected business conditions.

This accords with the basic notion that the yield curve slope is a leading indicator, with inverted



        9
            That is, the dividend yield,       , is equal to the difference between the required rate of
return and the growth rate of dividends,         . Hence an increase in     will reduce        , other
things equal.

                                                    -5-
yield curves indicating a likely future recession, due for example to tightening of monetary

policy, which increases short rates. Finally, the default premium appears positively associated

with expected business conditions. This seemingly anomalous result may be due to the short

horizons associated with the Livingston forecasts; that is, notwithstanding the positive

correlation between default premia and expected business conditions at short horizons, default

premia may be negatively correlated with expected business conditions at longer horizons of,

say, two or three years.

       Now consider the multiple regressions, which provide a summary distillation of the links

between expected real business conditions and the financial variables, taken jointly as a set. The

results show that expected business conditions are indeed systematically linked to the financial

variables, with    s of nearly thirty percent. This is particularly noteworthy given the short

horizons of the Livingston expectations, because the dividend yield and term premium variables

– in addition to the default premium as already discussed – are often thought to have maximal

predictive value at much longer horizons.

       In summary, the results of this section help us to understand why the standard financial

variables “work” in predictive regressions for excess stock returns: they are correlated with

expected business conditions, as conjectured by Fama and French (1989). Crucially, however,

the correlation is far from perfect (       ). That is, the financial variables, even when taken

jointly as a set, provide only highly noisy proxies of expected business conditions. This suggests

that, to the extent that expected excess returns are driven by expected business conditions,

superior return predictions may be produced via a direct measure of expected business

conditions. We now provide precisely such a direct assessment of the effects of expected


                                                -6-
business conditions on expected excess stock returns.

4. Expected Business Conditions and Expected Excess Returns

        We now consider the central question of whether and how expected business conditions

are linked to expected excess returns. We extend the approach of Fama and French (1989) to

include the Livingston expected business conditions as a predictor, estimating regressions of the

form

                                                                                  ,           (2)

where the timing of the excess return         matches that of expected business conditions

          , and where we standardize all predictors to facilitate comparison of coefficient

magnitudes.

        Note that the predictive regression (2) involves a two-step-ahead forecast rather than the

one-step-ahead forecast commonly employed in the literature. We focus on two-step-ahead

forecasts for two reasons. First, there is some uncertainty as to the precise time when the growth

forecasts are made, because they are constructed from surveys, and some forecasts may in fact be

made after the end of June or December, resulting in an overlap in the information sets from

which           and        are derived. Focusing on forecasts of          rather than         guards

against this possibility. Second, and most importantly and obviously, pairing           with

          matches the timing of the excess return to the horizon of the growth forecast.

Basic Results

        We show the results in Table 3. First consider the simple regressions in the upper panel,

in which we include the various predictors one at a time, and consider in particular the results for

expected business conditions. The point estimate indicates an economically important negative


                                                -7-
relationship between expected excess returns and expected business conditions, with a one

standard deviation decrease in               producing roughly a 0.2 standard deviation increase in

expected excess returns. The relationship is highly statistically significant at any conventional

level, and the       is quite high (for the return-prediction literature) at 4.74 percent.

           The simple regression results for the standard financial predictors,      ,          , and

      , are comparatively lackluster. The coefficient point estimates for the financial predictors

are all smaller than that for            ; indeed, those for         , and        are less than half that

of             . Similarly, the significance levels for the conventional predictors are weaker than

that for             , and         and        are statistically insignificant at any conventional level.

Finally, the       values for the conventional predictors are all smaller than that for             , and

those for            and        are negligible.

           Now consider the multiple regression results reported in the lower panel of Table 3.

Regression of excess returns on the three standard financial predictors yields an            of 6.28. The

size, significance, and negative sign of the coefficient on growth expectations from the multiple

regression match that of the earlier-discussed simple regression. The multiple regression also

makes clear that the key financial predictor, whether based on coefficient size or significance, is

dividend yield. Crucially, however, introduction of growth expectations as a predictor reduces

both the dividend yield coefficient point estimate and its t-statistic by roughly one third, while

simultaneously raising the        by more than fifty percent.

           All told, the results of our generalized Fama-French analysis clearly point to expected

business conditions as a key determinant of expected excess returns, and moreover, they support

our earlier argument that the standard financial predictors are largely proxies for expected


                                                    -8-
business conditions: Once expected business conditions are included, the contribution of the

standard financial predictors is sharply reduced, if not completely eliminated.

Including the Consumption/Wealth Ratio

       In recent years        , the generalized (log) consumption-wealth ratio of Lettau and

Ludvigson (2001a, b), has received attention as a predictor of excess returns.10         is partly

non-financial insofar as it is driven partly by consumption, and partly financial insofar as non-

human wealth depends partly on equity holdings. Here we assess its marginal predictive content

relative to the standard financial predictors and expected business conditions.

       First consider the correlation between expected business conditions and the

consumption/wealth ratio. We showed in section 3 that expected business conditions are

correlated with the standard financial predictors, which emerge as (noisy) proxies for expected

business conditions. The question immediately arises as to whether the consumption/wealth

ratio is just another noisy proxy for expected business conditions.

       As reported in Table 2, the coefficients from simple regressions of              on           are

small and insignificant, and the associated      values are small. In addition, multiple regressions

of           on          and the standard financial predictors produce insignificant

coefficients. Overall, then, both the simple and multiple regression analyses suggest that the

relationship between              and        is likely non-existent, and at any rate certainly much

weaker than the relationship between               and the standard financial predictors. Hence,

although the financial predictors appear to proxy for expected business conditions, the



       10
              is the residual from a regression of log consumption on log human wealth (labor
income) and log non-human wealth (assets).

                                                  -9-
consumption/wealth ratio appears to capture something else.11

        Now consider predictive regressions for excess returns, beginning with the simple

regression of            on        reported in Table 3. Interestingly, the regression coefficient is

large, the significance level is high, and the      is high. Indeed, the        regression produces

the largest absolute coefficient, the highest marginal significance level, and the highest        of

any simple predictive regression. These results essentially confirm the findings of Lettau and

Ludvigson (2001b), using a different sample and semi-annual rather than quarterly returns.

        The predictive multiple regressions reported in Table 3 reveal equally interesting

patterns. First, including         in the standard regression on financial predictors reveals a strong

and significant role for         in predicting excess returns, increasing the     by more than thirty

percent. Interestingly, inclusion of          along with the traditional financial predictors results in

a slightly smaller increase in predictive content than does inclusion of               (          vs.

             ).

        Second, inclusion of both           and expected business conditions in the standard

regression on financial predictors renders the financial predictors irrelevant, leaving just

and               . Interestingly, the consumption wealth ratio and expected business conditions

alone have more predictive content for excess returns than do all three financial predictors. In

particular, the specification including only         and            has an      more than 50 percent

larger than the        from the specification including only the traditional financial predictors. All

told, it seems clear that             and        play important and complementary roles in


        11
          This result corroborates Lettau and Ludvigson (2001b), who find that      has no
predictive power for non-financial macro variables such as aggregate labor income or
consumption.

                                                   -10-
determining expected excess returns, whereas the financial predictors largely “work” because of

their links to           and/or      .

        Finally, in discussing the results in Table 3 it is noteworthy that, even in the presence of

     , expected business conditions continue to exhibit a strong and statistically significant effect

on future excess returns. Lettau and Ludvigson (2001b, 2005) have previously shown that a

large array of excess return predictors are rendered impotent when jointly analyzed alongside the

consumption wealth ratio. The results in Table 3 indicate that the predictive content of expected

business conditions is robust to and largely independent from the inclusion of the consumption

wealth ratio. These findings suggest that the channel through which expected business

conditions affect expected returns is distinct from the channel through which the consumption

wealth ratio operates.

Long-Horizon Analysis

        The results thus far provide clear evidence that expected business conditions help to

forecast excess returns at a six-month horizon. Here we examine the value of expected business

conditions in forecasting excess returns at various longer horizons. We measure the long-

horizon regression coefficients using Hodrick’s (1992) unified vector autoregression (VAR)

methodology, which produces predictive regression coefficients and other model diagnostics at

all horizons from a single underlying VAR.

        In Table 4 we report long-horizon regression statistics for horizons ranging from six to

sixty months. As before, we standardize each predictor, so that we can compare the imputed

long-horizon regression coefficients across predictors. In the top and bottom panels of Table 4

we present long-horizon multiple regression statistics implied by the Hodrick VAR system,


                                                -11-
excluding and including expected business conditions, respectively. Each panel contains

multiple regression coefficients for each forecasting horizon and the implied      .12

       The patterns in the multiple regression coefficients indicate that the effect of including

expected business conditions dissipates as the forecasting horizon lengthens. This is most

evident when looking at the dividend yield coefficient. Inclusion of expected business

conditions reduces the dividend yield coefficient by 33 percent at the six month horizon, whereas

it reduces it by only five percent at the sixty month horizon. A similar pattern arises for the

long-horizon     s. At the six month horizon, adding expected business conditions to the set of

predictors increases the     by roughly 32 percent. At horizons beyond eighteen months,

including expected business conditions results in no appreciable increase in return predictability.

       The general pattern in coefficients and predictability at horizons beyond six months

indicates that expected business conditions are most useful for predicting excess returns over the

six to eighteen month horizon. This finding is appealing. It is consistent with both the short to

medium term nature of the Livingston forecasts, and with the possibility that other predictors

contain information, not contained in the Livingston forecasts, of relevance for forecasting

longer-term excess returns. Quite naturally, then, the information content of the Livingston

forecasts appears most relevant over the horizons to which they are tailored.

Expected Business Conditions and Stock Market Volatility13

       We have shown that expected business conditions forecast excess stock returns at short

         In Tables 6 and 7 we provide estimates of the “Hodrick VARs” and associated residual
covariance matrices from which we produce the results of Table 4.

                                                -12-
and medium horizons. Here we examine a possible reason why expected business conditions

forecast stock returns: expected business conditions may forecast future volatility and hence

may be linked to perceived systematic risk and expected excess returns.

        The claim that business conditions are linked to stock market volatility is certainly not

new. In particular, as persuasively documented in an extensive study by Schwert (1989) and

echoed in subsequent work by Hamilton and Lin (1996) using very different and complementary

methods, stock market risk increases in recessions. Indeed, it is fair to say that business

conditions are the only important and robust covariate of stock market volatility identified thus

far, notwithstanding the many investigations.

        In Table 5 we examine the link between expected business conditions and realized stock

market volatility. We use two data sources to compute realized semi-annual stock return

volatility. The first is the daily CRSP value-weighted index, which is available since 1963,

resulting in a sample from 1963:1 through 2003:2. The second is the daily S&P 500 index,

which is available since 1951, resulting in a sample from 1951:2 through 2003:2. Then we

regress realized volatility,       , on expected business conditions,             , and the other

predictors considered earlier.

        Consider first the regression results for CRSP-based realized volatility in the top panel.

The univariate results indicate that expected business conditions, the dividend yield, and CAY

have highly statistically significant predictive ability for future volatility. The estimated

relationship between expected business conditions and future volatility, in particular, agrees with

the findings of previous research: low growth expectations forecast high stock return volatility.

Moreover, when the predictors are considered jointly in a multiple regression, expected business


                                                 -13-
conditions emerge as the most highly significant predictor of volatility, with a t-statistic in

excess of 4.0. As in the univariate case, low growth expectations presage high future volatility.

       Now consider the results for S&P-based realized volatility in the bottom panel of Table

5. The signs of the univariate coefficient estimates match those of the CRSP-based estimates in

the top panel, although the magnitudes of the univariate estimates are generally smaller for the

longer S&P-based sample. The multiple regression results, however, are considerably more

uniform across the two samples. In particular, the estimated coefficient for expected business

conditions changes only slightly from -0.42 in the top CRSP-based panel to -0.36 in the bottom

S&P-based panel, and in each case t-statistic exceeds 3.0. The estimated coefficients for the

remaining predictors are also very similar in terms of sign, magnitude and statistical significance

across the top and bottom panels, indicating that the relationship between stock return volatility

and the predictors is robust to changes in the sample period and the index used to construct the

volatility measure.

5. Concluding Remarks

       We found two key excess return predictors, Livingston business conditions expectations

and Lettau-Ludvigson generalized consumption/wealth. Presumably, however, the time-

variation in expected excess returns is ultimately driven by time-varying expected risk and/or

time-varying risk aversion. Hence the question naturally arises as to whether and how our

predictors are linked to equity market risk and risk aversion.

       We believe that the Livingston business conditions expectations likely capture time-

varying risk, as we discussed earlier in detail. But what of the Lettau-Ludvigson generalized

consumption/wealth ratio,        ? We believe that         likely captures time-varying risk


                                                 -14-
aversion, via the following logical chain:

       (1) Theoretically, time-variation in expected excess returns is ultimately driven by time-

                 varying expected risk, time-varying risk aversion, or both;

       (2) Empirically, time-variation in expected excess returns is driven by two key

                 predictors, expected business conditions and          ;

       (3) Expected business conditions are linked to risk;

       (4) Expected business conditions and              are largely unrelated;

       (5) Hence, by elimination,          must be linked to risk aversion.

Our assertion that        captures time-varying risk aversion matches that of Lettau and

Ludvigson (2001b) and provides a largely independent confirmation of their work, insofar as we

arrive at the insight via a very different route. Note, however, that we do not assert that

movements in          are exclusively driven by movements in risk aversion. In particular, our

volatility forecasting results indicate that movements in          are also related to movements in

risk. Accordingly, we suggest that           measures both risk aversion and a risk component

unrelated to the risk component forecasted by the Livingston expectations.

       Both our results and our interpretation are very much in agreement with the emerging

empirical consensus that expected excess returns are counter-cyclical – not only for stocks, as in

Lettau and Ludvigson (2001b), but also for bonds, as in Cochrane and Piazzesi (2005).14

Interestingly, part of the literature emphasizes higher risk in recessions, as in Constantinides and

Duffie (1996), and another part emphasizes higher risk aversion in recessions, as in Campbell

and Cochrane (1999). Our results unify those two literatures, suggesting that the cyclicality of

both risk and risk aversion contributes to the counter-cyclicality of expected excess returns:

growth expectations are procyclical and have a robust negative impact on expected excess

returns, and CAY is countercyclical and simultaneously has a robust positive impact.

Notes: We report the sample autocorrelation function of two-step-ahead Livingston real GDP
growth forecast errors, 1952:1-2003:2, along with approximate ninety-five percent confidence
intervals under the null hypothesis of white noise. The forecasts are made semi-annually, so the
autocorrelation displacement is measured in units of six months. Hence, for example, a
displacement of two corresponds to one year. The Ljung-Box statistic for testing the hypothesis
of zero autocorrelations at displacements 2 through 25 is 18.76, which is insignificant at any
conventional level. See text for details.
