     DO THE BENEFITS OF FIXED EXCHANGE RATES OUTWEIGH THEIR COSTS?
                       THE FRANC ZONE IN AFRICA

                                ABSTRACT

      We develop a simple formal framework to clarify the trade-offs
involved in the choice between a fixed and flexible exchange-rate

system. We then apply the framework to the CFA Zone countries in
Africa, which have maintained a fixed parity with the French Franc

since independence. Thanks to the predominance of a few agricultural
products and natural resources in their exports, CFA member countries

have suffered frequent shocks in their terms of trade. A flexible
exchange rate could have possibly alleviated the costs of these
external shocks. On the other hand, CFA member countries have managed
to maintain lower inflation levels than their neighbors. Our
framework provides a way of weighing these costs and benefits.
     The inflation differential between CFA and non-CFA African
countries has been around 14 percentage points. We attribute this
differential to the standard time-consistency problem inherent in

discretionary macroeconomic policy. Nonetheless, our highly stylized
calculations suggest that fixed exchange rates have been, on the
whole, a bad bargain for the CFA member countries. Under reasonable
output-inflation tradeoffs, the output costs of maintaining a fixed
exchange rate have outweighed the benefits of lower inflation.

                       Shantayanan Devarajan and Dani Rodrik

A primary reason for structural adjustment in agriculture is the wide

fluctuation in the world prices of agricultural commodities, which
                                                                          cause sharp
swings in the terms of trade of countries that rely on these commodities for

their export earnings. A key instrument in structural adjustment is the

exchange rate. How and whether this instrument is used, however, depends           on
the    "rules of the game,"   that is, the particular exchange.rate regime the

country is in. This    paper addresses the question of how small, open economies
that   are subject to sharp swings in their terms    of   trade should select an

appropriate exchange rate regime. We develop a framework to clarify the

trade-offs involved, and apply it to the CFA Zone countries in Africa, which

have maintained a fixed parity with the French Franc since independence.

       Thanks to the predominance of a few agricultural products and natural

resources in their exports, CFA member countries have suffered frequent shocks

in their terms of trade. A flexible exchange rate could have
                                                                    possibly
alleviated the output costs of these external shocks. On the other hand, a

fixed exchange rate has enabled these countries to maintain lower inflation

levels than their neighbors. Our framework provides a way of weighing these

costs and benefits. Using our model as a guide, we investigate whether their

choice of a fixed exchange rate was (and remains) a wise one.

I. The Issues

       The selection of an appropriate exchange-tate regime has aroused

considerable academic interest over the last three decades, and the answers

provided have shifted with academic fashions.1 Throughout much of the l9SOs
                                        -2-




 and l960s, in line with prevailing wisdom
                                              (and practice) in the international
monetary system as a whole, developing countries
                                                    maintained fixed exchange
 rates. More flexible arrangements started
                                              to become commonplace by the late
1960s and l970s. As the currencies of
                                         industrial countries started to float
vis-a-vjs each other after 1971,
                                   flexibility became a necessity: pegging to
any of the major currencies implied floating against others.
                                                                 During the
l980s, exchange-rate flexibility continued to gain ground among develo√ßing

countries. In particular, many governments experimented with market-based

exchange rate regimes, such as auction-based
                                                systems, interbank markets, or
pure floats.

     But by the mid-1980s, the tide turned.
                                                Floating exchange rates began to
lose much of their lustre in the
                                   eyes of industrial-country policy makers.
The wide gyrations of the dollar during the l9BOs and the short-term

volatility of the key currencies eroded confidence in markets'
                                                                  ability to
foster adjustment with no (or little)
                                        tears. The Europeans linked their
currencies tighter, and proposals to limit flexibility became widespread. In

many parts of the developing world, exchange-rate flexibility became another

name for inflation. In Bolivia, Brazil, Argentina,
                                                      Mexico, Israel and Poland,

governments introduced stabilization programs based on fixed exchange rates.

    There are basically two ways of looking at exchange rates, with divergent

implications for desirable exchange rate regimes.
                                                     Borrowing Corden's (1990)
terminology, we can call these the "real targets" approach and the    "nominal
anchor" approach. The real targets school views the exchange rate as an

indispensable policy instrument in attaining equilibrium in the "real"
                                     -3-




economy, such as in domestic activity, the current account, or the rate of

growth. This is the view of the exchange rate embedded in the textbook

exposition of the dependent economy model with its juxtaposition of

expenditure switching (i.e., devaluation) and expenditure changing (i.e.,

fiscal policy) as the two independent policies needed to achieve the twin

goals of internal and external balance. The real targets approach inevitably

leads to an activist, discretionary stance. The exchange rate has to be

managed flexibly: the authorities need to respond to external shocks (such as

terms of trade changes) or domestic price shocks by undertaking the requisite

combination of expenditure-switching (i.e., exchange rate) and expenditure-

changing policies to reattain macroeconomic equilibrium.

     Implicit in the real targets approach are two   notions:   first1 that the

macroeconomy cannot be relied on to generate on its own    the j exchange rate
changes required by shocks to the system; second, that a nominal devaluation

will have real effects (i.e., it will lead to a depreciation of the the real

exchange rate), at least in the short- to medium-run. These two      notions   of
how the economy works are encapsulated in the textbook model by the assumption

that home-good prices are rigid (upward as well as downward). Putting the two

together, we obtain the activist role for the exchange rate called for by the

real targets approach.

     The alternative, nominal anchor approach is based on a rejection of the

efficacy of nominal exchange rate adjustments. The case for this approach can

be constructed at several levels. At the simplest level, one can deny the

effectiveness of nominal devaluations in achieving real depreciations, thereby
                                      -4-




denying flexibility of the currency any serious economic purpose. But even if

it is granted that nominal exchange rate policy has some power in the short-

to medium-run, it is possible to argue that the
                                                  inflationary costs are high
enough to render it a bad bargain. The passthrough from the
                                                               exchange rate to
domestic prices arises from the openness of the
                                                  economy and/or from the

effective indexing of home goods prices to the value of the currency. When

the pass through coefficient is below unity but high, nominal exchange rate

changes large enough to be "effective" in the sense of the real
                                                                   targets
approach will come at the cost of unacceptable jumps in domestic
                                                                   prices.
     A more recent strand of theorizing has added a new twist to the nominal

anchor approach. The literature spawned by the discovery of rational

expectations has stressed that the policy regime in place will shape the way

the private sector sets wages and prices in the economy. In a flexible-rate

regime, domestic price setters will take into account the policymakers'

incentive to alter the nominal exchange rate in order to achieve some "rear'

objective, an incentive that typically undercuts the price setters' desire to

maintain their relative prices. Moreover, any pronouncement that the

authorities' discretion over the exchange rate will not be "abused" is not

credible for standard time-inconsistency reasons, as long as the value of the

currency can be adjusted at more frequent intervals than wages and domes tic

prices. Consequently, the economy will settle at a high rate of inflation,

with no guarantee that the authorities will end up any closer to their real

targets. In this view, then, exchange-rate flexibility has a cost and no

benefits. It is better to give up discretion and subscribe to a fixed
                                     -5-




exchange rate regime, thereby "anchoring" the domestic price level.2

     Clearly, both approaches capture some of the reality in developing

countries, and neither can be judged right or wrong in the abstract. The

weight of arguments on the two sides will depend on the particulars of each

case. Here, we will lay out a simple, formal framework which captures the

essence of the arguments listed above and provides guidance as to how the

weighting of pros and cons can be done explicitly. We will then apply the

framework to the African member countries of the CFA Franc Zone. We will ask:

knowing what we do about their terms-of-trade history and their (as well as

their neighbors') performance over the lest three decades, did their decision

to join a currency union with France make sense?

II. The CFA Zone

     The CFA Franc Zone consists of thirteen African countries which3 are

divided into two currency unions: the Union Monetaire Ouest Africaine and the

members of the Banque des Etats de l'Afrique Centrale. Each union issues its

own currency. Since both currencies are the CFA Franc, the two unions are

referred to jointly as the "CFA Franc Zone."

     The Zone is an extension of the monetary authority which governed these

former French colonies prior to independence. In the late l9SOs, the two

currency unions were set up, and the newly-independent Francophone countries

of Africa were given the option of joining. All but Guinea, Madagascar and

Mauritania did4 Membership in the Zone afforded these countries the

opportunity to pool their foreign exchange reserves. In addition, the Zone

was governed by certain rules which could be interpreted as a means of guiding
                                      -6-




monetary policy in thes,a fledgling nation-states.5 First,
                                                                    government
borrowing from the Central Bank could not exceed 20 percent of the previous

year's tax receipts. Second, the French government guaranteed the

convertibility of the CFA Franc. Member countries had to convert 65 percent

of their foreign exchange reserves into French Francs     and deposit them with
the French Treasury. Third, and most relevant to our study, the exchange rate

between the French and CFA Francs was fixed at 50 CFAF ‚Äî        1   FF, the rate which
had prevailed since 1948. Changes in this parity required the unanimous

consent of all Zone members, including France. In other words, the rules of
the Zone made a nominal devaluation virtually
                                                  impossible.

     While other aspects of the CFA Zone have changed over the last 30 years,

these three rules have remained intact. Several studies have asked whether

the rules have led to a difference in the economic
                                                       performance of Zone members
vis-a-vis some group of "comparator" countries.     Devarajan and de Melo (1987)
showed that CFA countries had a slightly higher growth rate of GDP than their

sub-Saharan African (hereafter "African") counterparts in the period 1960-82.

Guillaumont et al. (1988) obtained a similar conclusion by examining a richer

set of indicators. Both sets of authors attributed the differential

performance to the monetary and fiscal discipline engendered
                                                                     by membership in
the CFA Zone.

     However, in updating their study to include the 1980s, and looking at         a

broader set of indicators, Devarajan and de Melo (1990) arrived at more

equivocal results. While CFA countries continued to enjoy a slightly higher

GDP growth rate than their African neighbors, this difference was no longer
                                      -7-




statistically significant for the l980s. Furthermore, along some other

dimensions, the CFA Zone's performance was noticeably worse. CFA countries

had lower export growth and investment levels in the l980s compared with other

African countries. When controlling for the size of the external shocks faced

by these groups of countries, Devarajan and de Melo found that CFA countries

achieved less current account reduction than their African neighbors.

Moreover, they experienced greater variability in growth than non-CFA

countries.6 On one dimension, however, the CFA countries continued to shine:

their average inflation rate was roughly half that of other African countries

in the 1970s, and one-seventh that of these countries in the l9BOs.

Furthermore, the degree of inflation-reduction between the l970s and l98Os,

controlling for external shocks, was significantly higher in the CFA Zone than

outside it.

     In sum, both the rules of the CFA Zone and the performance of its members

make it an ideal case with which to study the pros and cons of fixed exchange

rates. The Zone has maintained a fixed parity with the French franc

throughout its history. The relative performance of Zone members vis-a-vis

their African counterparts illustrates the tradeoffs involved. On the one

hand, Zone members enjoyed lower inflation thanks to the fixed exchange rate

regime. On the other hand, they have apparently been unable to adjust their

economies to the large terms of trade shocks of the l98Os and have experienced

greater variability in output. One reason, no doubt, is their inability to

use nominal devaluatLons as an instrument of adjustment. Finally, the

comparison between CFA and other African countries is especially apt. For the
                                      -8-




other African countries share most of the salient features with the CFA Zone

except the fixed exchange rate. They obtained independence at similar times

and are roughly at the same level of developments. All
                                                         are primary producers,

as are the CFA members. Since they produce similar goods, they faced the same

external shocks as the CFA countries during this period. In short, the other

African countries provide CFA members with a relatively accurate picture of

"life outside the Zone". The fact that these two groups of countries are

distinguished by exchange rate regime brings us as close to a controlled

experiment as economists could hope for.

III. The Framework

     The experience of the CFA Zone illustrates the main tradeoff involved in

the choice of exchange rate regimes as indicated in section I: By committing

themselves to a fixed-rate regime, these countries could anchor their price

levels and maintain inflation close to the rate experienced by the country

whose currency serves as the peg. However, by doing so they lost the ability

to adjust to terms of trade shocks. Had they selected a flexible-rate
                                                                         regime,
they would have been able to limit the damage done to the real economy by the

ups and down in the world prices of their main imports and exports. That, in

turn, would have come at the expense of a higher rate of inflation, as

domestic wage and price setters would have lacked the discipline, and domestic

monetary authorities the credibility, provided by an irrevocably fixed

exchange rate.7

     Did these countries "do the right thing" by joining a currency union with

France? We will set up a simple model here to provide a partial answer to
                                         -9-



this question.

      Assume that the policymaker is interested in maximizing an objective

function in which both a nominal and a real variable play a role. The real

variable could be the current account1 output, or the growth rate. The

nominal variable could be the price level or inflation. Since presumably what

matters most to policymakers are growth and inflation, we will cast the model

in terms of these two variables. We express the objective function in

quadratic-loss form:


(1) W ‚Äî   - ((it   -
                       *)2   + (y -


where W denotes welfare, it is inflation, y is the growth rate,      is the weight

attached by the authorities to the real target relative to the nominal one,

and     and y* are the policy maker's targets for inflation and growth,

respectively.      (ic* can of course be zero,) A welfare maximum is attained when

inflation and growth hit their target levels (it ‚Äî      and y ‚Äî   y*)8   The

quadratic-loss formulation has well-known problems, chief among which is its

symmetric treatment of over- and under-shooting of targets. But for our

purposes, such problems are of secondary importance.

      The equilibrium level of growth is determined by two variables, the

change in the real exchange rate and the terms of trade:


(2) y‚Äî5√∑a(e - p)             +fl(r -


where    is the (exogenously given) "naturalTM rate of growth, e and p are (log

differences in) the exchange rate and the home-goods price, respectively, r is
                                     -10-




the (log) terms of trade, and r is the mean level of the (log) terms of

trade. The parameters a and fi are positive. The terms of trade, T,
                                                                        is   taken
to be random, with variance 2 Note that (e-p) stands for the
                                                                 percentage
change in the real exchange rate. An equation like (2) follows from

expressing the level of output as a function of the level of the real
                                                                         exchange
rate and the terms of trade.

     To complete the model, we have to specify how domestic prices are

determined. We assume that domestic price (or wage) setters   are rational and

forward-looking, but that they can change their prices less frequently than

the authorities can adjust the exchange rate. Domestic prices   are therefore

set taking into account the government's exchange rate policy, but without

actually observing the exchange rate that will prevail. This provides policy

makers in principle temporary leeway in determining the real exchange rate by

altering the nominal exchange rate. Further, we assume that terms of trade

shocks are revealed after domestic prices are set. The. timing therefore is     as
follows:

           1. p is set;

           2. r is revealed;

           3. e is set.

     .1e assume that domestic price setters (e.g., urban workers) are rational

and forward-looking. In setting their prices, they are concerned both with

maintaining their relative prices and with adjusting to shocks. In reduced

form, their behavior can be summarized by expressing the change in domestic

prices as follows:
                                        -Il-




(3)    p‚Äî E(e) +WE(T -

where E(x) stands for the expected value of x. The first term here
                                                                   captures
the relative-price motive,9 while the second term captures the desired

adjustment in home prices in response to the expected terms-of-trade shock.

(u is a parameter representing the elasticity of the desired adjustment with

respect to the shock.) Note that p is set before r is revealed, and E(r -

‚Äî 0.    Therefore, (3) boils down to:


(4)    p ‚Äî E(e).


Hence, home-goods prices (or, equivalently, wages) increase at the expected

rate of nominal depreciation.

       Finally, inflation is a weighted average of the increases in the prices

of home goods and traded goods:1¬∞


(5)    it   ‚Äî pp   + (l-p)e.

We are now ready to analyze the behavior of the economy under the two exchange

rate regimes.



(a) Fixed Exehanee Rates. The analysis of this case is very simple. Under

fixed exchange rates, the government irrevocably fixes the value of the

currency, giving up its discretionary power to alter it. As mentioned above,

rational expectations in this context imply p ‚Äî   E(e).   Given the inflation

target of irk, then, the optimal policy for the government is to set e ‚Äî   w.
                                               -12-




This gives:


      p ‚Äî E(e) ‚Äî e ‚Äî    it*

That in turn implies that the equilibrium value of the real variable is


(6) y‚Äîy+(r -r).

Under this policy regime, then inflation stays on target while growth

fluctuates with the terms of trade,



(b) Flexible Exchan2e Rates. Under flexible rates, the government behaves in

a discretionary manner and determines the value of e to maximize its objective

function as expressed in Cl). When it does so, it takes home-goods prices (p)

as given (as they have been pre-set). Moreover, having observed the tens of

trade, it selects an exchange rate that is contingent on the realized value of

r. Substituting (2) and (5) into (1), we can write the objective function in

terms of e, p. and r:

                                                                    +


Maximizing this expression and solving for e yields:


(1) e ‚Äî          +    (l-p)21   {(a2# -   p(l-p))p    +   (lp)r* + a#(y*)   -




Assuming that the policymaker places sufficient weight on the real target
(growth) so that [a2 -        M(l-p)J > 0,     we get the following results:


Ci)    de/dr   < 0;
                                      -13-

(iii) de/dw* >   0;
(iv) de/d(y*.) >


     For ease of exposition1 assume an initial equilibrium where e ‚Äî
                                                                     p ‚Äî    0.
The first of these inequalities states that the policynaker will react to

terms of trade shocks by compensatory exchange rate policy; a deterioration in

the terms of trade will be met by a depreciation. This is of course the main

advantage of flexibility in the exchange rate regime. The second result

states that an increase in home-goads prices will be accommodated by a

depreciation, but only partially. The reason for the partial accommodation is

the inflationary cost of depreciation. Third, a reduction in the target value

of inflation will call for an appreciation of the
                                                    currency.

     The fourth result links exchange-rate policy to the relationship between

the government's target for growth and the natural level of growth. When the

government has an expansionary motive (y* > y), exchange-rate policy will

have a bias towards depreciation. For the rest of the analysis, we will

assume that this is indeed the case. There are two possible justifications

for this. First, for many reasons, we could think that the economy's natural

rate of growth is sub-optimal from a social standpoint. That could be due to

pre-existing rigidities in labor markets or various kinds of distortionary

(and unremovable) taxation. The government's desire to push the economy

beyond the rate at which the economy would settle on its own, then, would be a

well-meaning response to this sub-optimality. The second justification is
                                               - 14-



based on a much less benign view. In this view, the bias towards                 depreciation

derives from naughty motives: gaining political advantage by giving the

economy a temporary boost, or allowing inflationary finance of budget

deficits.

       Under rational expectations, domestic price setters will take into

account the government's behavior, as captured by equation (7). Setting p ‚Äî

E(e)   and taking the expectation of (7), we can derive the following expression

for the expected change in the exchange rate (and therefore the level of home-

goods prices):


(8) E(e) ‚Äî p ‚Äî       + (a/(liL)](y*        -
                                               y)

where we have used the fact that E(r -              r)   ‚Äî 0.   This is the rule followed by

the private sector in setting p. Note that home-goods inflation will be

higher, the greater the divergence between the target level of growth and its

natural level. That is because price setters will want to cover themselves

against currency depreciations that erode their relative prices. In turn, the

equilibrium level of depreciation of the exchange rate will be (by plugging

[8] into [7]):


(9) e ‚Äî       + [a/(lp)](y*   -
                                  y)   -
                                           (afl/[a2         √∑   (l-p)2])(r   -



Note that (9) differs from (8) only by the last term, which is the terms of

trade shock that cannot be anticipated by price setters. Therefore, domestic

price behavior fully takes into account the systematic component of exchange

rate policy (the part due to the gap between y* and y), which implies that
                                          -15-




the government's expansionary motive creates only inflation and no output

gains.

     But discretionary policy does buy the economy something, and that is the

ability to alter the real exchange rate (and hence smooth output) in the face

of unanticipated terms of trade disturbances. This can be seen by solving for

the equilibrium level of y:


(10) y ‚Äî    + ((l-M)2/(a2#    +(l-p)2])$(r -     7).

Since Ul-p)2/(a2 +(l-p)2fl <      I,   exchange rate flexibility enables growth to

be less sensitive to fluctuations in the terms of trade than in the fixed

exchange rate case (as can be seen by comparing (10] with (6]).



(c) Welfare Comnarison of the Two Policy Rezimes. Table I summarizes the

inflation and growth consequences of the two policy regimes. The fixed

exchange-rate regime does better on the inflation front (on average), while

the flexible-rate regime does better on the real side of the economy by

reducing the fluctuations in growth rate. The next step is to derive an

explicit cost-benefit criterion for choosing between the two regimes.
                                              -16-

      The appropriate way to do so is to take an ex-ante stand and ask: which

of the two regimes provides a higher level of expected welfare, in light of

the structure of the economy, policy preferences of the authorities, and the

anticipated pattern of exogenous (in this case terms of trade) shocks? It is

possible to answer this question using the results obtained so far. For each

policy regime, we can plug the equilibrium outcomes for y and ir into the

objective function (1) and take the mathematical expectation.

      Let   us   denote expected welfare under the fixed exchange-rate regime by

EWf   and the corresponding variable under the flexible exchange-rate regime by
                                                   -17-




EWnf‚Ä¢ Then after some algebra and simplification, the difference between the

two can be expressed as:


(11) EWf -        EWf ‚Äî                  with
(12) A ‚Äî      ((y*5;)/(l,L)J2        -
                                         fl2o2/(a2 +

We   will refer to (EWf - EWnf) as the net benefits of the fixed rate regime.

The composite parameter A is of ambiguous sijn, reflecting the tradeoff

between the costs and benefits of the two regimes. The first term
                                                                                   making up ts
captures the benefit of the fixed-rate regime, while the second term

represents the cost. A fixed rate is preferable to a flexible rate regime

whenever A is positive.

        Note first that the variance of the terms of trade (2) enters on the

cost side. That is, the higher is 2, the less likely that a fixed rate

regime will be preferable to a flexible rate regime. Second, the higher is

(y* -   5;) the   more likely that a fixed exchange rate will be desirable. This

follows from the greater temptation of policy makers with expansionary

ambitions to inflate the economy (and depreciate the currency). A fixed

exchange rate rules out such depreciation, and leaves policy makers better

off, jg when judged by their own welfare criterion. Third, a high fi makes

flexible rates more desirable. That is, when the real economy is highly

susceptible to terms of trade shocks, flexible exchange rates have the edge.11

        Next, we turn to the effect of .                It can be verified that:
        d(EWf -   EWf)/d# > 0              whenever a   > 0;   and

        d(EWf -   EWf)/d         0         whenever A C   0.
                                            -18-




In words, when a fixed rate is preferable (A > 0), an increase in the weight

placed on the real target makes a fixed rate regime even more beneficial.

When a flexible-rate regime is preferable (A C 0), an increase in the weight

attached to the real target has ambiguous effects on the net benefits. With

respect to A itself, we can see from (12) that dA/d4 is unambiguously

positive: that is, there must exist a sufficiently high          such that a fixed

rate regime becomes preferable to a flexible rate one. This may Sound

paradoxical, because the benefit of a fixed-rate regime is lower inflation,

not higher growth. But it is an extension of the same logic: when policy

makers put a large weight on output relative to inflation, there will be

greater temptation to abuse the discretion allowed by flexible exchange rates

and a higher inflationary cost. Countries where economic policy is highly

politicized, where the central bank lacks autonomy, or where inflation has

become chronic and its perceived costs low are settings where we would expect

  and          to be high.

     In the preceding paragraph, we looked at the relationship between # and

the choice of policy regimes while holding constant all other parameters, and

(y*.5) in particular.         An alternative approach, and one that we will rely on

in our empirical analysis, is to ask how the choice of policy regimes is

affected by variations in ,        while   holding the inflation differential between

the two regimes constant. From Table 31. we can see that the averaee

inflation differential under the two regimes is given by:


 (13) 'nf -   lrf   ‚Äî
                        [a#/(l.pfl(y*i)
                                               -19-




where the subscripts "nf" and "f" once again refer to the flexible and fixed

regimes respectively. This implies

                  2 *‚Äî2              -         2
      (a#/(l-M)) (y -y) ‚Äî    (irnf       Wf)

Substituting into (11) we get:


                      - Xf)2
(11) EWf - EWnf ‚Äî (Itnf              -
                                         (a#fl)2c2/(a2 +       (l,)2].
It can be shown that the second term on the right-hand side is increasing in

.   Thus, holding nf - wf) constant, EWf - EWnf is decreasing in .

Therefore,   controlling for the inflation differential, an increase in the

weight placed on the real target renders fixed rates jj advantageous. Note

that controlling for the inflation differential means in this context

adjusting (y*s) pan passu with            to maintain the difference between the

inflation rates fixed (see (13]).

     We will use the formulation in (11') when we turn              to   the empirical

application to the CPA case. The reason is that we can get a rough handle on

the inflation differential under the two              regimes by comparing CIA Zone
countries    with other sub-Saharan countries with flexible exchange rates. By

contrast, (y*.5) is unobservable.

IV. The Tradeoffs: Empirical Application to the CIA Zone

     As we mentioned earlier, there are at least two reasons why a model like

that described above is relevant and applicable to the case of the CIA Zone.

First, since CIA Zone countries are highly dependent on primary exports, terms
                                        -20-




of trade shocks are the main exogenous force that buffets their economies.

Therefore our focus on the terms of trade would appear well placed.
                                                                          Second,

the presence of neighboring countries with similar economic structures but

different exchange rate regimes allows us to construct a reasonable

counterfactual. In particular, we can derive some ballpark estimates of the

inflationary cost of exchange-rate flexibility by looking at the experience of

these comparator countries.

     We proceed as follows. We first note that the choice of a fixed
                                                                           exchange
rate regime implies a certain preference for price-stability over the real

target (or, in the language of the model in section III, a particular value of

  in the objective function [1]). We then ask: Given the evolution of these

economies and of their external terms of trade, what does the fact that
                                                                             they
joined the CFA Zone say about their revealed, ex ante valuation of the output-

inflation tradeoff? Finally, we compare the range of revealed output-

inflation tradeoffs we obtain in this manner with what we consider to be

"reasonable" tradeoffs.

      We proceed by determining the critical level of        at which the policy

maker would be indifferent between fixed and flexible exchange rate regimes.

As discussed in the previous section, it is convenient to work with equation

(11'). Setting this equation equal to zero and solving for , we obtain the

critical value of ,.   #c.   This critical rate is a function of the inflation

differential under fixed and flexible rates nf -
                                                      rf),   as well as the other

parameters of the model. As implied by the earlier discussion, c is

increasing in the inflation differential and decreasing in           In words, as
                                          -21-




the inflation cost of exchange-rate flexibility rises, the weight placed on

the real target must increase for the policy maker to remain at the same

margin of indifference. Conversely, as the terms of trade become more

variable, the weight placed on the real target must diminish for continued

indifference. Holding everything else constant, a #         higher than c would
imply that a flexible exchange rate regime would be preferable to a fixed rate

regime. We now proceed to calculate              We will need empirical estimates of

all the other parameters in equation (11').

     To get a handle on (rnf -   Irf).   we exploit the structural similarity

between the CFA member countries and their neighbors. That is, we use the

difference between the average inflation rate inside the CFA Zone and in the

rest of sub-Saharan Africa as an estimate of (Wf -
                                                           'rf).   For the COP

deflator, this difference is IS percentage points (the CFA average rate

between 1973 and 1987 was 9 percent. the non-CFA average 24 percent). For the

consumer price index, the difference is close to 12 percentage points. We use

a figure which lies in between these two differences, with a slight bias

towards the GDP deflator: 13.8 percentage points.

     As for the    term in equation (11'), this is obtained by taking the

(unweighted) average of the variances of the logarithms of the terms of trade

of all the CFA countries during 1965-87. The base data and the variances are

given in Table 2. We also present the levels of a2 for various sub-periods

and individual countries. With the former, we can ask whether the terms of

trade have become wore volatile so that the decision to fix the exchange rate

in 1965 no longer makes sense. With the latter, we calculate the revealed
                                           -22-




inflation-output      tradeoffs for individual     countries   to see if   Zone membership

continues      to be optimal for some countries but not others.

       The parameters a, fi and p are difficult to estimate precisely. Hence, we

vary them parametrically in our calculations. The parameter a represents the

increase in growth for an additional one percent depreciation of the real

exchange rate. We vary this from a low of 0.05 to a high of 0.20 in our

sensitivity tests. Note that a ‚Äî 0.20 implies that a ten percent real

depreciation will spur growth--temporarily--by two percentage points. The

parameter fi is the impact of a terms of trade shock on real income. As a

first approximation, the direct effect of the shock will be to reduce real

income by the share of imports in GDP. Note that this share is also linked to

(l-p), the share of tradables in the price index. Under some conditions, the

two are equal (see Devarajan, Lewis and Robinson [1991]). Therefore, we set

i-p ‚Äî   fi   in our calculations and vary fi from 0.10 to 0.40.

       One last step is needed before we can interpret our calculations. It

will be convenient to state our results in terms of implied output-Inflation

tradeoffs, rather than         itself. The tradeoff can be recovered from 0c by

calculating the marginal rate of substitution between w and y along an

indifference curve (i.e., holding dW ‚Äî       0).     Differentiating the objective

function (I):


(14)         dr/dyI_0 ‚Äî

This    gives us the revealed inflation-output tradeoff along the locus on which

the country would have been indifferent between a fixed and flexible exchange
                                     -23-




rate regime. Remember that     is the maximum # for which fixed rates still

make sense (holding the inflation differential and other parameters constant).

Therefore the expression dw/dyldw_o answers the following question: what is

the maximum increase in inflation that the government is revealed to be

willing to trade off against a single percentage point increase in growth,

given that it has chosen to join the CFA Zone?

     In order to map the values of    to this inflation-output tradeoff, we

need to know y, y, r and     in (14). It is reasonable to take as the target

level of inflation, w ‚Äî 0.   For the actual level, we take iv   ‚Äî 0.08, which is
about the average for CFA countries throughout the post-independence period.

The target GDP growth rate (y*) is taken to be 0.0$, which is at the lower end

of the range of targets in the (usually optimistic) Five-Year Plans of thse

countries. The actual (y) will be 0.03, which is about the average

performance of CFA countries in this period.

     Incorporating these assumptions, table 3 presents the revealed inflation-

output tradeoffs for the countries which chose to join the fixed exchange rate

regime. Note that for most values of a and fi, the implied tradeoff between

growth and inflation is exceedingly steep. For example, when a ‚Äî     0.1$   and p ‚Äî

0.25, dr/dyp,_0 is 1.51. The interpretation is that for the decision to join
the CFA Zone to have made sense (given these particular values of a and fi),

member countries should have been willing to tolerate no more than a one and a

half percentage point increase in inflation for a one percent increase in

their average annual GD? growth rate. In other words, the implied preference

for price stability over output is extremely high. If they were willing to
                                      -24-




tolerate a higher inflation rate for this boost in their growth rate, they

should not have opted for a fixed exchange rate regime.

     The revealed tradeoff is even steeper for a country like Cabon. which

suffered the largest terms of trade shocks in the CPA Zone (see Table 2).

This is intuitive. The costs of a fixed exchange rate regime rise with the

variance of the terms of trade. For Cabon to have joined the CFA Zone,

therefore1 it must have had an exceptionally low tolerance for inflation vis-

a-via growth (see second panel of Table 3). Likewise, Senegal's tradeoff is

the least steep, because it enjoyed the lowest variance in its terms of trade

(bottom panel of Table 3).

     Sensitivity analysis with the inflation differential (not reported here)

does not significantly alter the results. For example, raising the inflation

differential to its "high" estimate, 15 percentage points, raises Senegal's

tradeoff for the intermediate values of a and ft   (0.15 and 0.25, respectively)
to 6.4 percentage points. That is, even if the gains from joining the Zone

were 15 percentage points lower average inflation, the Senegalese revealed

that they were only willing to tradeoff 6.4 percentage points of inflation for

one percentage point increase in their CD? growth rate.

     Our impression is that most African policymakers would be willing to

trade up to about 10 percentage points of inflation for a one percentage point

increase in their CD? growth rate--that is, to increase their growth from 3 to

4 percent per annum on average. Given that most of the numbers in Table 3 lie

below this figure, it appears that the decision to join the CPA Zone reflects

an excessive anti-inflation bias. Put another way, if the future is going to
                                        -25-




be anything like the past, CFA countries should perhaps seriously evaluate

whether they wish to remain in a fixed exchange rate regime.

V. Concludinp Remarks

        We should stress that we have concentrated here on only some aspects of

the costs and benefits of the CFA Zone. We have ignored some important

benefits, including the savings obtained by pooling reserves and the

attractiveness to foreign investors of a convertible currency. In addition, we

have left unmentioned the special relationship with France (and the French

treasury) implied by the existence of the Zone. Depending on one's

perspective, the latter consideration can be viewed as either a net gain or

loss.

        Our focus instead has been on the costs of maintaining a fixed exchange

rate regime in the context of highly variable external terms of trade. We

have attempted to measure the welfare costs arising from the inability to

adjust the exchange rate, and to pit these costs against the benefits of lower

inflation. The inflation differential between CFA and non-CFA African

countries has been around 14 percentage points. We attribute this

differential to the standard time-consistency problem inherent in

discretionary macroeconomic policy. Nonetheless, our highly stylized

calculations suggest that fixed exchange rates have been, on the whole, a bad

bargain for the CFA member countries. For most of the CFA members, the

inflation benefits do not appear to have been large enough to offset the costs

on the output side. Under "reasonable" output-inflation tradeoffs, these

countries would have been better off having the flexibility to adjust to
                                      -26-




external shocks.

    This   conclusion needs one important caveat. Our counterfactual

effectively assumes that CFA policy makers would have followed the appropriate

exchange rate policies in response to terms of trade shocks, had they had the

freedom to do so. In light of experience with exchange rate policy in the

rest of Africa, this is perhaps a doubtful supposition. Possibly, exchange-

rate flexibility would have brought only inflation, and no output benefits.

Senegal and Togo. Mali left the Zone in 1965 and rejoined in 1984.

Equatorial Guinea became a member in 1985.

in 1963.

5. For wore detailed descriptions of the institutional arrangements in the

CFA Zone, see Ehatia (1985) and Guillaumont and Cuillaumont (1984).

6.   The unweighted average of the standard deviation of growth for the CFA

countries is 7.2 percentage points over the entire 1973-87 period. The

comparable average for other African countries is 5.4 percentage points.

7. Our approach is somewhat related to that taken in the literature   on the

insulating properties of fixed and flexible exchange rates in the presence of

domestic and external shocks of different kinds (see for example Boyer, 1978,

and Aizenman and Frenkel, 1985). However, this literature focused on the   goal
of stabilizing output only, and neglected the price discipline argument for

fixed rates.

8. With a slight reinterpretation of variables, the model can also be stated

in tens of the levels of output and prices, rather than their growth rates.
                                          -28-




We chose the latter because thay are the more relevant variables for policy.

9. There is actually a slight conceptual problem here. Since p and e stand

for the changes in the exchange rate and home prices, the relative-price

motive is stated in proportional, rather than absolute, form. This implies

that price setters let bygones be bygones, and do not attempt to make up for

previous losses (or gains). Tracking these dynamic effects would complicate

the model considerably.

10. Note that inflation has no direct effect on the equilibrium growth rate

(2). Of course, in the long run, persistent inflation will undermine economic

activity and growth, which is one of the reasons why inflation is included

separately in the objective function (1).



11.   fi   is   likely to be large in economies that are very open. Openness

therefore increases the desirability of flexibility in exchange rates. This

is at odds with the usual conclusion drawn in the literature on optimum

currency areas, wherein greater openness is taken to imply less latitude in

manipulating the real exchange rate through changes in the nominal rate,

making flexibility less desirable.
