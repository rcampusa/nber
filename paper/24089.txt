                                            ABSTRACT

Using trade-level data, we study whether brokers play a role in spreading order flow information.
We focus on large portfolio liquidations, which result in temporary drops in stock prices, and
identify the brokers that intermediate these trades. We show that these brokers’ best clients tend
to predate on the liquidating funds: at the beginning of the fire sale, they sell their holdings in the
liquidated stocks, to then cover their positions once asset prices start recovering. The predatory
trades generate at least 50 basis points over ten days and cause the liquidation costs for the
distressed fund to almost double. These results suggest a role of brokers in fostering predatory
behavior and raise a red flag for regulators. Moreover, our findings highlight the trade-off
between slow execution and potential information leakage in the decision of optimal trading
speed.

1    Introduction
Large institutional orders are typically split in smaller amounts over time to avoid market-impact
(see Garleanu and Pedersen, 2013, Di Mascio et al., 2016). One concern when executing an order
slowly over time is that other traders might anticipate the intent to trade the stock in the near future
and take advantage by trading in the same direction to benefit from the future price impact.
Predatory trading has strong theoretical support (Brunnermeier and Pedersen, 2005) and is borne
out by anecdotal evidence. For example, during the unwinding of LTCM’s portfolio in 1998, the
fund’s typical trading and lending counterparties, which were privy to its portfolio positions, also
sold the same assets. Given that predatory trading can make the market more illiquid at times of
crisis and amplify adverse shocks, some observers suggest that reducing the frequency of portfolio
disclosure can be desirable (Brunnermeier and Pedersen, 2005). Accordingly, hedge funds support
regulations that limit the granularity of their reporting (IAFE, 2001).

    One wonders, however, if restricting the diffusion of public information is a sufficient measure
to prevent predatory behavior. In fact, the anecdotal evidence mentioned above suggests that
market participants possess information about forced liquidations thanks to their close relationship
with the liquidating managers. Among all actors in the market, brokers are in the privileged
position of observing the daily trades of a fund. In the case of hedge funds, prime brokers operate
also as lenders and risk managers, so that they are aware whether the fund is about to breach some
risk limit and deleverage its portfolio. They can also observe the trading habits of their clients,
such as whether they tend to cut trades in small orders over several days when executing a large
order. In sum, brokers are in a privileged position to predict the future trades of their clients.

    Brokers may decide to spread the news that a client’s large trade is likely to extend over several
days to other traders. They may have an incentive to do so in order to establish a reputation as a
source of valuable information and attract new business. On the other hand, brokers may care about
the long-term relationship with their clients. Hence, brokers may be reluctant to foster predatory
trading against a client. Rather, according to this argument, they should invite other traders to
provide liquidity and take the other side of the slow trade. It remains, therefore, an open empirical
question whether brokers foster predatory trading or liquidity provision in case of slow trading by
a client. The paper aims to address this question.




                                                   1
   Forced liquidations of portfolio holdings offer an ideal setting to investigate these issues. Other
traders, if made aware of the liquidation, can exploit these opportunities to sell the same assets in
anticipation of the price drop and reverse the trade once the price has fallen. This opportunistic
behavior makes liquidations more costly for the liquidating manager because it exacerbates the
adverse price move. We decide to focus on large liquidations (which we label “fire sales” for
convenience), and do not include large purchases in our analysis, because we aim to have a clean
identification of liquidity-motivated trades. First, in our data, the majority of institutional investors
are long-only (about 90%). Hence, it is somewhat less likely for a sale to be information motivated
(as the manager would need to have the stock already in the portfolio) than for a buy transaction.
Second, large cash inflows can be allocated slowly over time and are, therefore, less likely to
impose a concentrated liquidity demand on the market than large outflows.

   Specifically, we exploit proprietary trade-level data and focus on asset managers that sell a
significant fraction of their portfolio during a relatively short amount of time. We restrict attention
to asset managers whose order flow is abnormally negative for at least five days in a row.
Moreover, we focus on managers that liquidate multiple stocks (on average about 20 stocks) at a
significantly faster pace than usual. We identify about four hundred of these events in the period
between 1999 and 2014. Because we are only interested in fire sales due to purely liquidity
motives, such as the need to meet large redemptions, we verify that the stock price movements
resulting from this sale are only temporary and that the asset managers do not buy back those
stocks. Price impact would have to display a permanent component, if sales were motivated by
fundamental reasons. Interestingly, controlling for the portfolio weights, we show that managers
are more likely to sell large, liquid, and low-volatility stocks, as well as past winners. This evidence
can inform the theoretical debate on optimal liquidation policy (e.g. Scholes 2000, Brown, Carlin,
and Lobo 2010).

   Our empirical strategy takes advantage of two key sources of variation. First, not all brokers
employed by the liquidating fund are going to be aware that the fund is in distress. The liquidating
fund has little incentive to disclose its intention to liquidate a large fraction of its portfolio; in fact,
it is likely to use multiple brokers to minimize price impact and info leakage. Hence, only brokers
that observe a large enough fraction of the liquidation are deemed aware. Second, we should not
expect all traders to predate; in fact, brokers are likely to selectively disclose the order flow
information to maximize their rents.


                                                     2
    Our first result is that there is a significantly higher probability of predatory behavior for orders
executed through aware brokers. Specifically, the clients of the aware brokers are significantly
more likely to execute sell trades in the same stocks with the same broker over the same period.
We also show that the clients of the aware brokers are not only more likely to sell the same stocks
of the liquidating funds, but also sell a higher volume in those stocks.

    Next, we explore the heterogeneity across the different clients of the aware brokers. If the
brokers are spreading information about order flow, they are more likely to do so with their best
clients, from which the brokers can extract the highest rents. As a proxy for the strength of the
investor-broker relation, we use the trading volume and the commissions generated by a client.1
Our baseline specification focuses on an event window starting ten days before the beginning of
the fire sale up to five days afterwards. We control for time, manager, event, stock, and broker
fixed effects. Hence, differences across stocks, such as their liquidity, or across brokers, such as
their ability to execute, cannot explain our results.2

    The main result of this analysis is that the best clients of the aware brokers are significantly
more likely than other clients to sell the stocks that the liquidating manager is offloading during
the fire sale with respect to immediately before the fire sale. Additionally, extending the analysis
to all brokers, we find this effect to be present only among aware brokers. The results are also
economically significant, in fact, on average the best clients of the aware brokers are about 50%
more likely to follow a predatory strategy.3

    Then, we test whether the same asset managers that are predating during the fires are also likely
to cover their positions by repurchasing the stock in the following days. Consistent with this
hypothesis, we find that a significant fraction of their positions, ranging from 12% to 40%, are
covered in the ten days following the fire sale. This gives strong indication that these managers
were motivated by the prospect of short-term gains at the expense of the liquidating fund.

    One potential concern with our results is that fire sales might cluster in some periods and be
correlated across funds. For instance, during the financial crisis most asset managers were trying


1 We show that these relations are extremely persistent, consistent with the findings in Goldstein, Irvine, Kandel, and Wiener
(2009), corroborating the hypothesis that brokers might have an incentive to nurture such relations.
2 We also provide a specification in which we control for broker-times-manager fixed effects, which controls for the matching

between asset managers and brokers. These results are in the Online Appendix.
3 We also exploit the granularity of our data to corroborate our interpretation of the results by showing that the hedge funds, rather

than the mutual funds or pension funds, are those for which the evidence of predation is most significant.


                                                                  3
to offload their positions in financial stocks. We address this concern in several ways. First, we
show that our definition of fire sales leads to relatively short-term price reversals, rather than the
prolonged asset prices swings that occurred during the crisis. In fact, our events are randomly
distributed across time, showing no significant increase during the 2001 or the 2008-09 crises.
Then, we also focus on events that are likely driven by funds’ idiosyncratic shocks by excluding
from our sample months in which there are more than five different fire sales. In addition, our
results are conditional on the predators executing their orders with the same broker that is
employed by the liquidating fund, while a correlated response to a common shock would predict
trades that are more diffuse across brokers. The evidence, therefore, corroborates the hypothesis
of a quid pro quo between investors and brokers and points out an active role of the broker in
leaking the news of a fire sale. Similarly, we provide an array of additional robustness checks to
rule out the possibility that the originator of the fire sale and the followers are trading as a response
to the same public news. For instance, we exclude from our sample all the events that occurred
during recessions and show that the results are unaffected. We also exclude all events occurring
around earning announcements, changes in analyst recommendations, or any other type of negative
news as reported by the press and classified by Ravenpack.4 We also exclude stocks with negative
momentum and high short interest to address the concern that selling managers follow similar
trading strategies founded on a negative view on the stock.

    Another way to rule out the alternative hypothesis that the observed predatory trading is due to
a reaction to stock-specific news is to look at the number of stocks involved in the fire sale that
the best clients also sell. The idea is that if sales were motivated by stock-specific news or similar
trading strategies, we should observe the best clients focusing on one or two stocks, whereas if
they knew about the liquidation, it would be more profitable to prey on multiple stocks at the same
time. Consistent with predatory behavior, we find that the best clients of the aware brokers are
significantly more likely to sell a higher number and a higher fraction of stocks involved in the
liquidation event.

    To strengthen the identification of fire sale events, we focus on a natural experiment in which
a few funds were forced to liquidate their holdings. Specifically, on September 3, 2003, the New
York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer announced the issuance of a complaint due to the discovery

                                                               4
of illegal late trading and market timing practices on the part of certain hedge fund and mutual
fund companies. As a consequence of the scandal, twenty-seven fund families experienced
significant outflows. Anton and Polk (2014) use these outflows to identify an exogenous driver of
mutual funds’ selling activity. Kisin (2011) estimates that funds of implicated families lost 14.1%
of their capital within one year and 24.3% within two years. These outflows continued until the
end of 2006. We start by matching the names of these fund families with the manager names in
our trade-level dataset to identify the brokers employed by these funds to liquidate their portfolios
to meet investors’ redemption demands. Crucially, the brokers were aware of the specific stocks
that were being sold and of the timing of these liquidations. We then show that the clients of the
relevant brokers were significantly more likely to liquidate the same stocks after the scandal broke
out on the same days on which the implicated funds are also selling. This test reassures us that,
even when we consider plausibly exogenous variation in the source of the liquidation, we find very
similar behavior.

    An important question at this point, and one of the key contributions of the paper, concerns the
value of the order-flow information. Recent anecdotal evidence about Citadel paying about $100
million upfront to eTrade to receive their retail order flow would suggest that having access to this
information in real time might be a very valuable piece of information. We are in a unique position
to address this question by investigating whether the asset managers that receive the information
from the aware brokers are able to generate higher returns. We compute the profits that these asset
managers make during the fire sales and show that those who prey on the liquidating managers,
e.g. the best clients of the aware broker, are able to generate between 45 and 70 bps in the few
days of the fire sale, compared to the other asset managers. Given average fund performance, these
results suggest that being able to predict fire sales can be quite profitable.5

    We also provide evidence on the externalities arising from the previous findings, i.e. the losses
incurred by managers exposed to predation. We focus on the execution shortfall, computed as the
percentage difference between the execution price and a benchmark price. We find that price
impact is significantly higher when the trades are executed through brokers that are aware of the
large liquidation. These estimates allow us to compute the counterfactual cumulative return in a


5 A placebo test in which we show that the profits of these two groups are indistinguishable in a random sample of event windows
reassures us that the additional profits are indeed driven by the access to the fire sales information, and not by manager
characteristics.


                                                               5
hypothetical scenario in which none of the brokers is aware. We can then show that the transaction
cost of the liquidating funds almost doubles in the presence of predatory trading.

    We conclude by addressing another important question: Do brokers gain from leaking order
flow information? We compute the brokers’ commissions and show that the clients who take
advantage of the order flow information by preying on the liquidating funds pay 10%-25% higher
commissions after these fire sales events compared to the months before. This finding confirms
that the brokers get rewarded by their clients for the order flow information they provide.

    Overall, our evidence highlights and quantifies one important amplification mechanism for
asset price fluctuations. Brokers can disseminate order flow information for opportunistic reasons.
This behavior reinforces the price dislocations due to fire sales.

    Another general implication of our findings is that there exists an important trade-off between
slow trading execution meant to reduce price impact, e.g. as in Kyle (1985), and leakage of order
flow information. The latter becomes more likely when the asset managers trade in the same
direction over an extended period of time. This consideration is not confined to fire sales events.
In fact, we find that the autocorrelation among large trades in our data is about 35%. Hence, as a
rule, managers tend to trade in the same direction over multiple days, which opens the possibility
for the brokers to predict order flow, and for the order flow information to be disseminated from
the brokers to other market participants.

    Finally, our findings also have important implications for regulation. For instance, our results
shed light on a recent debate over the exchanges’ use of their access to market data to sell data
products. The most recent dispute involves NASDAQ seeking the SEC’s approval for an options-
data service called the “Intellicator Analytic Tool.” This new service would provide market color
to subscribers by revealing whether a trade was initiated by a small investor or a big money
manager.6 Critics maintain that pension funds and other institutional investors, who routinely need
big trades to be executed anonymously, can be negatively impacted as the new service could be
used to “reverse-engineer” their strategies and lead to front-running. Our findings show that, even
in the absence of such supplemental information, a number of large investors, who entertain a
strong business relation with brokers, are able to exploit order flow information at the expense of

those seeking liquidity provision. Our estimates might serve as a benchmark, and probably a lower
bound, for the costs associated with releasing such data products. 7

    Our paper bridges two strands of the literature. First, there is a vast literature on fire sales.
Theoretically, Shleifer and Vishny (1992, 1997) and Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) suggest that fire
sales occur when the natural buyers are unable to purchase the assets due, for instance, to agency
problems. However, Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2005) and Di Maggio (2016) show that the
market might become illiquid exactly when liquidity is needed most due to unconstrained
arbitrageurs taking advantage of the temporary price pressure by selling and then buying back the
asset only after the fire sale has ended.8 Second, there is a growing number of studies investigating
the importance of the network of relations among market participants in various domains, e.g. Li
and Schürhoff, 2014; Di Maggio, Franzoni, Kermani, Sommavilla, 2016; Di Maggio, Kermani,
and Song, 2017; Hollifield, Neklyudov, and Spatt, 2016; Afonso, Kovner, and Schoar, 2013;
Hendershott, Li, Livdan, and Schürhoff, 2016. Our novel contribution is to highlight the key role
played by brokers during fire sales, which might be amplified due to brokers leaking order flow
information.

    Our findings are also related to a growing literature examining the way in which information
spreads in financial markets due, for instance, to information percolation (Duffie, Malamud, and
Manso, 2009, 2014), or network effects (Babus and Kondor, 2016 and Walden, 2016). We
contribute to this literature by providing empirical support to the notion that information can be
readily disseminated through interactions between intermediaries and market participants.
Furthermore, our results can also inform the theoretical developments of this literature as we point
out that this information dissemination is strategic. In fact, the brokers selectively disclose order
flow information only to some of their clients. This key feature is missing in the existing theoretical
literature and might drive how networks emerge in financial markets. Also related to our paper,


7 Our results also highlight the importance of the fiduciary duty between broker-dealers and their clients. A few states in the U.S.
are moving in the direction of tightening such duty for brokers. For instance, Nevada is considering an expanded interpretation of
fiduciary duty in which the brokers would be required to “disclose to a client, at the time advice is given, any gain [the broker] may
receive, such as profit or commission, if the advice is followed.”
8 See Shleifer and Vishny (2011) for a survey of this literature. A complete list of works on fire sales and price dislocations in

financial markets is beyond the scope of the paper, but it includes among others Allen and Gale (1994), Gromb and Vayanos (2002),
Geanakoplos (2003), Lorenzoni (2008), Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2009), Acharya, Gale, and Yorulmazer (2011), Garleanu and
Pedersen (2011), Stein (2012), and Diamond and Rajan (2011). Recently, Yang and Zhu (2016) provided a two-period Kyle (1985)
model of “back-running,” where in addition to informed and noise traders there is an investor who learns from the order-flow
generated by the informed speculator after the order is filled.


                                                                  7
Farboodi and Veldkamp (2017) provide a long run growth model where traders have the option to
extract information from order flow data mining and study the implication for price
informativeness and market liquidity. Our results suggest that, indeed, order flow information is
important in generating investors’ returns and might significantly impair liquidity provision when
liquidity is needed the most.

    Also related to our work, the empirical paper by van Kervel and Menkveld (2016) studies the
behavior of high-frequency traders (HFTs) around large institutional orders. Using Swedish data,
the authors find that HFTs provide liquidity if the order is short-lived (below one hour), but they
back-run on the order if it lasts for several hours within a day. The latter behavior increases the
trading costs for the institution, as predicted by the theory of Yang and Zhu (2016). We find
consistent evidence from a lower frequency perspective, as we analyze orders spanning multiple
days. The original contribution of our work is the focus on the role of brokers in leaking the
information about large institutional orders.9

    The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the data sources and
summary statistics and Section 3 discusses our main results on the behavior of asset managers and
the role of brokers during fire sales. Section 4 presents the results on the value of order flow
information, Section 5 provide further evidence to corroborate the mechanism identified in the
paper, while Section 6 concludes.



2    Data and summary statistics
In order to analyze whether and how brokers leak order flow information during fire sales, one
needs a detailed trade-level dataset that also reports information on the institutional investors and
brokers involved in each trade. Abel Noser Solutions, formerly Ancerno Ltd. (we retain the name
‘Ancerno’ for simplicity), fittingly provides this information. Ancerno performs transaction cost
analysis for institutional investors and makes these data available for academic research under the
agreement of non-disclosure of institutional identity.




9 Our results are also consistent with Chung and Kang (2016), who use monthly hedge fund returns to document comovement in
the returns of hedge funds sharing the same prime broker.


                                                            8
     We have access to identifiers for managers that initiate the trades and brokers that intermediate
those trades from 1999 to 2014.10 There are several advantages to this dataset. First, clients submit
this information to obtain objective evaluations of their trading costs, and not to advertise their
performance, suggesting that the data should not suffer from self-reporting bias. Furthermore,
Ancerno collects trade-level information directly from hedge funds and mutual funds when these
use Ancerno for transaction cost analysis. However, another source of information derives from
pension funds instructing the funds they have invested in to release their trading activities to
Ancerno for an independent check. Third, Ancerno is free of survivorship biases as it includes
information about institutions that were reporting in the past but at some point terminated their
relationship with Ancerno. Finally, the dataset is devoid of backfill bias, as Ancerno reports only
the trades that are dated from the start of the client relationship.

     Previous studies, such as Puckett and Yan (2011), Anand, Irvine, Puckett, and Venkataraman
(2012, 2013), have shown that the characteristics of stocks traded and held by Ancerno institutions
and the return performance of the trades are comparable to those in 13F mandatory filings.
Furthermore, Goldstein, Irvine, Kandel, and Wiener (2009), using an earlier version of our data,
provide a useful description of the institutional brokerage industry. They show that institutions
value long-term relations with brokers. Also, consistent with our results, the best institutional
clients are compensated with the allocation of superior information around changes of analyst
recommendations.

     Ancerno information is organized on different layers. At the trade-level, we know: the
transaction date and time at the minute precision (only for a subset of trades), the execution price;
the number of shares that are traded, the side (buy or sell) and the stock CUSIP. We also know
whether the trades are part of a unique ticket (i.e. an order with a broker). Our analysis is carried
out at the ticket level. We therefore aggregate all trades belonging to the same order, by the same
manager, executed through the same broker, on the same day.

     Next, we provide the definition of a fire sale event. Our goal is to identify liquidity-motivated
sales that attract brokers’ attention and are likely to generate a significant price impact. Hence, we
impose two requirements. For a given manager, the selling amount needs to exceed the manager’s

10 Relative to the standard release of Ancerno that is available to other researchers, we managed to obtain manager and broker
identifiers also for the latest years (that is, after 2011), under the agreement that no attempt is made to identify the underlying
institutional names.

standard trading volume for a protracted period. At the stock level, the sale volume needs to make
a sufficient fraction of total trading volume.

   In more detail, to identify liquidating funds we start by computing the signed volume Z-score

                                     Ztm =                       ,                                  (1)
                                                 𝜎(𝐷𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑡𝑚 )

where 𝐷𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑡𝑚 is the portfolio level dollar volume traded by manager m on day t, and its mean and
standard deviation are estimated over a rolling window of 120 trading days ending one week before
day t. Then, for a given manager, we require that during a fire sale event if Ztm is below -0.25 for
at least five trading days in a row. This requirement ensures that the sale is taking place on a
sufficiently long period of time for the broker to realize about the fire sale and for it to represent a
significant event in the life of the fund. In addition, we impose a filter at the stock level to ensure
that the sale volume is large enough to generate price pressure. For stock j to be part of the fire
sale event, we require that the volume traded by the manager is at least 1% of the CRSP volume
on day t for at least four out of the five fire sale days.

   We decide to keep events in which at least 10 stocks are involved in a fire sale. The goal is to
reduce the probability that liquidating funds are selling as a consequence of stock-specific
information. Focusing on liquidations of a large number of stocks makes it less likely that the sales
are information driven.

   We distinguish between aware and unaware brokers. Intuitively, we define a broker as aware
of the fire sale if it intermediates a sufficiently large volume of a stock that is involved in a fire
sale, as well as if the broker intermediates a sufficiently large volume of the fire sale basket of
stocks. The second condition is imposed to ensure that the broker realizes that the liquidating fund
is engaging in a large-scale portfolio liquidation, as opposed to trading a single stock for
fundamental reasons.

   In detail, the variable aware is a dummy, defined at the event-broker-stock-day level, indicating
that the broker is aware of the fire sale happening on a given stock-day. That is, for broker B, stock
j on day t, the aware dummy equals one if the aware-broker quantity

                                                                            𝐵𝑗
is above the 10% threshold. In equation (2), 𝐴𝑤𝑎𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑡 is the stock-level awareness, defined as
the ratio between the turnover intermediated by broker B on stock j up to day t and the total turnover
on stock j up to day t (across all active brokers). Stock-level awareness is meant to capture the fact
that an aware broker observes an abnormal volume at the stock level. 𝐴𝑤𝑎𝐸𝑣𝑡𝐵 is the event-level
awareness, i.e. the ratio between the turnover intermediated by broker B on all the fire sale stocks
up to day t and the total turnover on all the fire sale stocks up to that day (across all the brokers
that intermediate those stock on day t). Event-level awareness is meant to allow the broker to
realize that a manager is engaging in a portfolio-level liquidation. The functional form in Equation
                                                                                                        𝐵𝑗
(2) is imposed simply to require that the aware-broker variable 𝐴𝑤𝑎𝐵𝑟𝑜𝑡 is between 0 and 1.
Finally, the 10% threshold is chosen to have a sufficiently large level of awareness. This choice
flags as ‘aware’ roughly 3.4% of the broker-stock pairs involved, which correspond to 6.6% of the
liquidation volume on average across fire sales. Although the threshold is arbitrary, results are
robust to variations between 1% and 30%.11 To be clear, once a broker becomes aware on day t, it
                                                                                                                               𝐵𝑗
remains aware for the following days in the fire sale event, given that 𝐴𝑤𝑎𝐸𝑣𝑡𝐵 and 𝐴𝑤𝑎𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑡 are
increasing over time by construction.

      Panels A and B of Table 1 provide the summary statistics for the key variables in our analysis.
We identify 385 fire sale events over the 1999-2014 period, each lasting at least 5 days and with
the liquidating funds selling on average $377 million worth of stock (median: $177 million). Figure
1 displays the distribution of events over our sample period. It shows that the events are evenly
distributed over time; in fact, even during the recessions highlighted in red, the number of events
does not spike. This confirms that our methodology identifies funds subject to idiosyncratic shocks
rather than market-wide events. Moreover, we can compute the fraction of the liquidated portfolio
that the liquidation volume represents. In particular, we estimate the liquidating funds’ portfolios
by cumulating their trades over the two years prior to the fire sale. Then, we divide the total volume
of sold stocks by the reconstructed portfolio size. We find this fraction to be sizeable at 9.16%, on
average. Arguably, this methodology tends to underestimate the liquidating managers’ actual
portfolio because we do not know their positions at the beginning of the estimation period, so that


11   Appendix Table A1 provides the robustness tests for our main result (Table 2) with respect to different levels of this threshold.


                                                                   11
the fraction provides an upper bound. In any event, this evidence suggests that these large sales
are unlikely to be inspired by stock-specific information.

   On average, 22 stocks are heavily sold during a fire sale event, with about $17.2 million sold in
each stock, which indicates that these events involve more than just isolated stocks. Figure 2 shows
the distribution of these events as a function of the number of stocks, from events involving 10 to
50 stocks, as well as the distribution of the volume of trades by the liquidating fund that can even
reach more than two billion dollars in some cases. By cumulating trades over a two-year period,
we impute a portfolio to each manager.

   Fire sales are intermediated by an average of 29 brokers, while the number of aware broker per
event is on average less than 2. Furthermore, the price of the stocks sold in the fire sale declines
by 1% on average during the first five days of the event, but there is significant variation. In fact
for the bottom quartile, the price drops by more than 5%.

   Finally, we provide evidence on the type of stocks the liquidating managers are selling. We
construct a proxy for the portfolios of the liquidating managers by cumulating their trades over the
prior 2 years. Then, for each stock in the fire sale, we compute the fraction of the total volume in
the fire sale that it represents (in dollar terms). Panel C of Table 1 shows the results from
regressions of the fraction of the fire sale that stock j represents on its weight in the selling
manager’s portfolio, market capitalization, volatility, the Amihud (2002) ratio, and various
measures of past performance at different horizons. We find that, after controlling for the quantity
held by the manager (i.e. portfolio weight), the funds tend to sell the larger, more liquid, and less
volatile stocks in their portfolio. Also, asset managers tend to sell the stocks with higher past
performance. These findings resonate with the predictions of theoretical models discussing the
optimal liquidation strategies in case of distress (Scholes 2000, Brown, Carlin, and Lobo 2010).

   Corroborating our identification strategy for fire sales, the highly significant positive coefficient
on the portfolio weight suggests that the liquidating funds are not building short positions; rather,
they are selling positions that are already present in their portfolio.

3     Main Results
This section starts by discussing our empirical strategy and then presents the main evidence on the
role of brokers in spreading order flow information during fire sale events.



3.1    Fire Sales
We start our analysis by characterizing the fire sale events. Figure 3 plots the average (across
stocks and events) daily signed volume (i.e. order imbalance) for the liquidating fund during the
event window, where the zero is defined as the first day of the five-day window over which we
identify the fire sale. The large negative volume before day 0 is due to the fact that, while
liquidations likely start earlier, we impose stringent criteria for them to be defined a fire sale. We
note that, although order imbalance starts recovering after about five days, it is still below zero
after about fifteen days. This is important, because it highlights the nature of the sale: the
liquidating fund does not repurchase the stocks back (even when we extend the horizon further
out). Hence, this fact weakens the possibility that the liquidating fund is short selling the stock
because it expects the price to decline, and then buys the stock back.

    Figure 4, instead, plots the average DGTW adjusted cumulative returns for the stocks included
in the fire sales across all the events. The returns are mostly flat pre-event and then start
precipitating quite rapidly while the liquidating fund (for simplicity, the originator) is selling most
intensely, i.e. during the five-day interval [0,4], then to slowly recover over time. Specifically, we
find that after about twenty days they are back to the pre-event levels. This is a faster reversal than
what is found in the existing literature on fire sales (Coval and Stafford, 2007). On average, the
price drops by almost 1% during the five-day event-time interval [0, 4], which we label liquidation
period. Importantly, the fact that we observe a reversal over such a short horizon tends to rule out
the possibility that the liquidation and the price decline are due to negative fundamental news on
the stock. On the contrary, the price path is strongly consistent with price pressure following
liquidity motivated trades.

    Next, we turn to the tests trying to detect information leakage by brokers. First, if brokers are
exploiting their privileged position, we should expect the trades that go through aware brokers to
be more subject to predation than those that go through unaware brokers. We can formally test this
hypothesis by estimating the following specification


                                                  13
                             𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑚,𝑖,𝑏,𝑡 = 𝛽1 𝐴𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑏,𝑡 + 𝜀𝑚,𝑖,𝑏,𝑡 ,                          (3)

where Aware is a dummy equal to one if the broker executing the trades is aware on day t. The
dependent variable, 𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑚,𝑖,𝑏,𝑡 , is a dummy equal to one if the client m of broker b trades
in the same direction as the originator, i.e. demanding liquidity, on a stock i on day t. The dummy
equals zero if the client provides liquidity by trading in the opposite direction of the originator or
the client does not trade on that stock-day. We also estimate specifications in which the dependent
variable is defined as the predation dummy multiplied by the ratio of dollar volume of the broker’s
clients to the market capitalization of the stock (this variable is standardized by subtracting the
mean and dividing by standard deviation). The sample includes trades executed by all managers
with all brokers in the database on the fire sale stocks. These specifications rely on heterogeneity
across brokers for identification: some brokers are more exposed to order flow information as they
intermediate a higher fraction of the liquidation by the liquidating fund. Standard errors are
clustered at the broker level.

   We present the results in Table 2. Columns (1)-(4) focus on the predation dummy, while
columns (5)-(8) present the results for the volume-weighted dependent variable. Each column
modifies the baseline specification (1) by adding different fixed effects. In the most conservative
specification, we include day, manager, broker, and fire-sale event fixed effects, which ensure that
our estimates are not driven by unobservable broker or manager characteristics.

   We find that trades executed by aware brokers have 6% higher probability of predation, or
equivalently, the volume of predatory trades is about 14% of a standard deviation larger for the
clients of aware brokers. This is the first step towards a better understanding of the role of brokers
in fostering predatory trading. The results show that the brokers who are more likely to realize that
the fund is engaged in a large liquidation are also more likely to intermediate trades that are
consistent with predatory trading.



3.2   Best Clients and Predatory Trading
To sharpen our identification, we focus on the aware brokers and test yet another implication of
our information leakage hypothesis. If the aware brokers provide information about order flows
from liquidating managers, and if the information rents can be dissipated by leaking to too many



                                                 14
traders, we should expect this disclosure to be selective and to allow the broker to extract the
highest rents. Thus, we should expect the brokers to favor their best clients. To proxy for the
strength of the manager-broker relationship, we use information about both the volume and the
commissions generated by manager m with broker b in a window of 6 months ending one month
before the fire sale event. We use this data to form five different proxies for “best clients”, which
we employ throughout our analysis.

   First, we look at clients that generate at least 5% of the total volume intermediated by the broker,
which results into about 6% of managers tagged as best clients, on average. Second, we divide the
volume originating from a given manager by the total volume intermediated by the broker, thus
obtaining the percentage volume. Then, for each broker, we sort the managers in increasing order
of volume and assign to each manager a score equal to the cumulative percentage volume
generated by that manager and all the managers below. The third measure is computed in a similar
fashion, but the dollar volume is replaced by the dollar trading commissions generated by the
manager. Finally, we also consider two dummies that equal one if the last two variables are in the
top decile. We compute these variables over the six months preceding the month in which the
trading takes place.

   To show that these variables identify a meaningful source of variation across managers, Table
3 regresses each measure on its previous quarter lag, controlling for broker and manager fixed
effects. Consistently across proxies, we find that the manager-broker relationships are very
persistent. This fact suggests that brokers might have an incentive to nurture these relationships
over time and that the heterogeneity across clients of the same broker might be a relevant source
of variation for identifying the effect of interest.

   Having established the importance of these manager-brokers relationships, we can now
introduce our baseline specification:

          𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑚,𝑗,𝑏,𝑡 = 𝛽1 𝐵𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝐶𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑚,𝑏,𝑡 × 𝐿𝑖𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑𝑡 +
                                                                                                   (4)
                                𝛽2 𝐵𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝐶𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑚,𝑏,𝑡 + 𝛽3 𝐿𝑖𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑𝑡 + 𝜀𝑚,𝑗,𝑏,𝑡 ,

where, as before, our main dependent variable is the dummy indicating that manager m sell its
holdings of stock j with the broker employed by the liquidating fund. This dependent variable has
the advantage of being scale independent, i.e. the size of manager m does not matter for our results.



                                                   15
Best Client is a dummy in the first three columns and a continuous measure in Columns (4) and
(5), depending on the measure employed to proxy for the strength of the relationship. Liquidation
period is a time dummy equals to one for the first five days of the fire sale, that is, for the period
of most intense liquidation by the fund in distress. The reference period is the time before the
beginning of the fire sale. All specifications include time, manager, event, stock and broker fixed
effects. We conservatively double-cluster the standard errors at both the stock and manager level,
which allows for arbitrary correlation within trades in the same stock and by the same manager.

     Table 4 presents the results. We find that the asset managers that are in a tighter relationship
with the fire-sale-aware broker are significantly more likely to sell their holdings of the fire-sale
stock with the same broker during the liquidation period. The results are both statistically and
economically significant with the best clients being about 2% to 3% more likely to prey on the
liquidating fund, which is equivalent to about half of the baseline predation probability, whose
average is about 5%. The results are also very consistent across proxies, which reassures us of the
robustness of the estimates.12

     A more stringent identification strategy exploits variation across managers as well as across
brokers. That is, we compare the difference between the behavior of the best clients of the brokers
that are aware of the fire sale and the behavior of the best clients of the brokers that are unaware,
relative to the non-best clients of both types of brokers. Formally, Panel B of Table 4 reports the
results from the following specification

        𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑚,𝑗,𝑏,𝑡 = 𝛽1 𝐵𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝐶𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑚,𝑡 × 𝐴𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑗,𝑏 × 𝐿𝑖𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑𝑡

                              + 𝛽2 𝐵𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝐶𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑚,𝑡 × 𝐴𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑗,𝑏

                              + 𝛽3 𝐵𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝐶𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑚,𝑡 × 𝐿𝑖𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑𝑡 &                                                      (5)

                              + 𝛽4 𝐴𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑗,𝑏 × 𝐿𝑖𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑𝑡

                              + 𝛽5 𝐵𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝐶𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑚,𝑡 + 𝛽6 𝐿𝑖𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑𝑡 + 𝛽7 𝐴𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑗,𝑏 + 𝜀𝑚,𝑗,𝑏,𝑡 .




12To sharpen the identification, Table A2 in the appendix also reports the same specification with higher-dimensional fixed effects.
Specifically, we include broker-manager and broker-originator fixed effects. This allows us to keep the pair broker-manager or
broker-originator constant in our analysis: the variation comes from changes in the trading patterns between before and after the
start of the liquidation, controlling for the typical trading pattern that characterizes a given pair. The results are unaffected.




                                                                16
   This specification confirms that the best clients of the aware broker are significantly more likely
to sell the stock involved in the liquidation compared to the best clients of the other brokers
involved in the liquidation. The results are consistent across measures of relationship, with the
largest effects for the first measure based on size: the clients that submit at least 5% of an aware
broker’s volume are 11% more likely to prey on the liquidating fund. In the next set of robustness
checks, for ease of exposition, we are going to present the results focusing on the set of aware
brokers and exploit only variation across clients in terms of the strength of the broker-client
relationship.



3.3   Robustness to Aggregate and Stock-Specific News
Having established that the best clients of the aware brokers are more likely to sell the same stock
as the distress fund during the liquidation period, we examine whether the results can be driven by
other factors than information leakage by the broker. The main alternative hypothesis that might
explain these results is that asset managers are responding to the same common shock occurring
during the same event windows. This might occur for two reasons. First, there might be a common
disruption in the market that leads funds to offload their positions. Alternatively, news about the
specific stocks might be released, triggering the funds’ trading behavior.

   We provide several direct tests to rule out these alternative explanations. The first step to ensure
that the correlation among traders is not due to general disruption in the market is to exclude the
two recessions in our sample, i.e. the tech crunch and the financial crisis. Panel A of Table 5
presents these results. It shows that the results are robust to this change in the estimation sample,
with both the economic and statistical significance being unaffected.

   Next, we test whether negative stock-specific news might explain our baseline results. To do
so, we collect information about earnings announcements and changes in analyst
recommendations. Intuitively, earning announcements might work as a catalyst, and a negative
surprise might trigger a series of liquidations. We exclude ten trading days around the
announcements. Another important piece of fundamental information that might drive funds’
behavior is changes in analyst recommendations. One might reasonably expect that multiple
liquidations might follow a downgrade, especially an unexpected one. Therefore, we also exclude
these events from our sample. Earnings announcements and analyst recommendations are not the


                                                  17
only news that might trigger a coordinated response from market participants. In order to have the
most comprehensive information about stock-specific news, we use the data provided by
Ravenpack. The dataset is generated as the result of a comprehensive analysis of all types of
information from newswires about each stock, from lawsuit to mergers and acquisitions. A
machine learning algorithm is then employed to classify the news in good and bad on a scale from
0 to 100, where 50 is the cutoff below which news are identified as bad. Even in the restricted
sample excluding bad news, we confirm in Panel B of Table 5 that the best clients of aware brokers
are more likely to predate on the liquidating manager.

   Another instance in which fund managers might find themselves trading in the same direction
is when the stocks belong to the same strategy, e.g. momentum, which might be commonly adopted
by multiple funds. Furthermore, asset managers might be liquidating underperforming stocks.
Then, as an additional robustness check, in Panel A of Table 6 we exclude from our sample all
stocks exhibiting negative momentum. Specifically, we compute the returns of the stocks sold
during the fire sale and exclude those with negative returns in the week preceding the fire sale.
The results are unaffected.

   To check whether our results could be driven by changes in investors’ expectations about the
stocks, Panel B of Table 6 also considers short selling data from Markit (formerly DataEx
database). Intuitively, stocks with high short interest might be subject to correlated sales across
funds, which might be triggered by company specific events or investors’ common beliefs about
the stock performance, rather than by the desire to take advantage of a liquidating fund. Then, we
show the robustness of our results to the exclusion of events where the liquidated stocks exhibit a
significant level of short interest, defined as a utilization ratio (i.e. shares on loan divided by shares
available to lend) in the top quartile.

   As an additional test to rule out the alternative hypothesis that funds are responding to similar
shocks rather than deliberately taking advantage of the fire sale, we explore the number of stocks
that are affected by the predatory behavior of the aware broker’s clients. The idea is that if investors
are simply responding to a common shock to a stock, we might find that their sales are concentrated
on that particular stock. On the other hand, if multiple stocks out of the 20 that are involved on
average in a fire sale are sold by the best clients of the aware broker, predation on the liquidating
fund seems more likely. To test this conjecture, Table 7 reports results where the outcome variable



                                                   18
is the number of fire-sale stocks for which the manager sells its holdings (Panel A), and the fraction
of stocks involved in the fire sales for which we observe predatory behavior (Panel B). We find
that best clients of the aware brokers tend to sell their holdings on 3 to 4 more stocks, and to predate
about 15% more of the stocks involved in the fire sale.13



3.4     Evidence of Trade Reversion
To corroborate the hypothesis that our results are driven by predatory behavior by the asset
managers who are able to acquire order flow information via the broker, we test whether these
same asset managers are also likely to cover their positions by repurchasing the stock in the
following days. As predicted by Brunnermeier and Pedersen (2005) and Di Maggio (2016), asset
managers who prey on liquidations should sell the asset while its price is moving away from
fundamentals and then revert their positions once the liquidating fund has stopped exerting selling
pressure pushing the price upwards.

     To this purpose, we compute the fraction of a manager’s negative position that is subsequently
reversed. In detail, the percentage of position reversed for manager m during event e for stock j is
defined as the ratio 𝑅𝑒𝑣𝑒,𝑚,𝑗 = 𝐵𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡𝐵𝑎𝑐𝑘𝑒,𝑚,𝑗 / 𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑑e,m,j , where 𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑑e,m,j is the dollar sum of
all sell orders in that period, and 𝐵𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡𝐵𝑎𝑐𝑘𝑒,𝑚,𝑗 is the dollar sum of buy orders during the
period, where we sum only the buy orders that are preceded by a negative cumulative order flow.
Our motivation is to avoid counting as reversals the buy orders that occur before sales have taken
place. We compute this measure around each fire sale event, for the ten days before and after the
fire sale. We then compare the percentage of position reversed by Best and Non-Best clients of the
aware brokers before and after the fire sale events. The liquidating funds are excluded from the
sample.

     In Table 8, we find that a significant fraction of the predating managers’ positions, ranging from
12% to 40%, is covered in the ten days following the fire sale. We interpret this evidence as strong

13 As further robustness test, in Table A3 in the appendix, we report the baseline regressions of Table 4 using as main dependent
variable the predation dummy multiplied by the trading volume as a fraction of the stock market capitalization. Panel A shows the
results for the whole sample, while, for brevity, Panel B shows the results for the most restrictive subsample, i.e. the one excluding
at the same time recession, negative news, as well as high short interest and negative momentum stocks. The results are statistically
significant, with best clients generating larger selling pressure in dollar terms during the liquidation period. This wedge is also
economically significant, as it corresponds to an average increase of up to 13% of a standard deviation of their order flow in the
direction of the originator.




                                                                 19
indication that the predating managers were motivated by the prospect of short-term gains at the
expense of the liquidating fund.



3.5   Late-Trading Scandal as a Natural Experiment
We can envisage two alternative interpretations to the proposed view that order flow leakage by
brokers explains our evidence. First, selling pressure on a stock might be generated by changes in
market sentiment about that stock rather than by a shock to the fund holding that stock. Second,
the intermediating broker can be the original source of the information about the liquidated stocks,
which then triggers the large sale as well as smaller sales by other managers in the same direction.

   The evidence so far seems to weaken the validity of these alternative explanations. First, our
identification of fire sales suggests that these liquidations involve a large fraction of a manager’s
portfolio (9.16% on average) and involve at least 10 different stocks (on average 22 stocks). Hence,
it is unlikely that the liquidating managers are responding to stock-specific information or to a
broker trading tip. Second, the robustness tests in Tables 5 and 6 show that the evidence remains
unchanged when removing stock-specific and aggregate informational events from the sample.

   To further rule out these alternative explanations, we identify an exogenous determinant of fire
sales. In particular, we need a driver of liquidations that is manager-specific, i.e. it is not inspired
by the broker, and which does not depend on the identity of the liquidated stocks or the composition
of the manager’s portfolio.

   Anton and Polk (2014) use the liquidations triggered by outflows following the late-trading
scandal as a natural experiment to identify exogenous selling activity (also see, Kisin 2011). We
follow these authors and focus on the mutual fund scandal that erupted in September 2003. At the
time, the New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer announced the discovery of illegal late trading
activities and market timing practices on the part of several hedge fund and mutual fund
companies. The scandal had a significant impact on the 27 fund families involved: they
experienced significant outflows as they lost 14.1% of their capital within one year and 24.3%
within two years (Kisin, 2011). This is an ideal experiment for our purposes because it allows us
to identify stocks that for exogenous reasons are subject to selling pressure. Although market
participants were aware that these fund families were experiencing investors’ outflows, the



                                                  20
brokers’ vantage point allows them to pin down when these funds were liquidating and which
stocks were involved in the liquidation. Both pieces of information are fundamental in making the
predation profitable and they are not publicly available.

     To test whether even in this case, the brokers are responsible for leaking information about the
stocks that are liquidated and the timing of these liquidations, we manually match the identity of
the fund families included in Spitzer’s complaint with our trade-level dataset, in order to identify
the sales trades of these fund families and the brokers through which they execute them.14
Corroborating the validity of our matching procedure, we find that the matched managers rank in
the top quartile by sales in the two-year period following the breakout of the scandal.

     Then, we focus on daily transactions of the managers that are not involved in the scandal for a
period of four years centered on the month of the announcement of the complaint by Spitzer
(September 2003) and define a dummy 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 𝑆𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑙𝑡 , indicating the two years after the
complaint broke out. Next, we define a broker-stock-day level dummy variable, 𝑆𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑏,𝑗,𝑡 ,
indicating that at least one of the charged funds is selling stock j on day t through broker b. Then,
we define the dependent variable Probability of Predation as a dummy variable that equals 1 if a
non-charged manager is selling stock j on day t through broker b. The dependent variable equals
0 if a non-charged manager trades on a different day, or on a different stock, or with a different
broker. In a difference-in-differences setting, we regress the probability of predation on the
interaction between 𝑆𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑏,𝑗,𝑡 and the dummy 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 𝑆𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑙𝑡 .

     Table 9 reports the estimates. Consistently with the previous baseline results, we find that the
clients of the brokers employed by the funds involved in the scandal were significantly more likely
to liquidate the same stocks after the scandal broke out. For example, in Column (1), there is a
4.3% higher probability of non-charged managers to trade in the same direction as a charged
manager on the same day through the same broker.

     These results corroborate the interpretation that the clients of the aware brokers adopt predatory
trading strategies to take advantage of temporary price movements due to fire sales, and that these
results cannot be explained away by shocks to the market or to the single stocks as well as by a

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2003_mutual_fund_scandal#List_of_implicated_fund_companies.5B4.5D.5B5.5D. Out of the 27

                                                            21
common response to the release of public information, given that the timing of the sales and the
identity of the stocks that are sold is information to which only the intermediating brokers have
access. Moreover, the interpretation relying on the idea that brokers are generating stock-specific
trading ideas seems implausible, given that there is no reason for this activity to increase after the
breakout of the scandal.



3.6    Heterogeneity
We exploit the granularity of our data to further explore whether the predatory trading behavior
depends on the characteristics of the clients.

    We should expect the most active managers in the sample to be the ones more willing and
capable of taking advantage of the liquidating funds’ trades. To proxy for these characteristics, we
can investigate whether the results differ for hedge funds and other institutions. Intuitively, hedge
funds are more likely to have the ability to promptly react to information released by the brokers
than mutual funds or pension funds. We manually identify the hedge funds in Ancerno following
the procedure in Franzoni and Plazzi (2015).

    Panel A of Table 10 reports the baseline specification in Equation (1) for hedge funds, while
Panel B focuses on other institutions. The results clearly show that the hedge funds are the main
driver of our results. In fact, the magnitude of the coefficients is higher than in the baseline
regressions of Table 4, while the statistical significance, as well as the economic significance, is
weaker for the non-hedge funds. This evidence corroborates the hypothesis that the behavior we
observe is a deliberate attempt by the smart money to take advantage of temporary price
fluctuations.



4     The Value of Order Flow Information

4.1    Profitability of Predatory Strategies
    An important question at this point is whether the asset managers that receive the information
from the broker are able to generate higher abnormal returns. Hence, we study whether predatory
trading is indeed profitable.



                                                 22
     To address this question, we compute the profits that asset managers generate during the fire
sales. In particular, starting from the first day of the liquidation (day 0), at the close of each day
we compute the marked-to-market value of the net position in a given stock and subtract from this
value the net cash amount that was necessary to build that position over the period. To express
these profits as a fraction of capital at risk, we divide them by the absolute value maximum dollar
outlay over the period in which the profits are computed. 15

     We start by showing in Figure 5 the profits of managers that are best clients of aware and
unaware brokers at the daily frequency after the start of the fire sale. Intuitively, if as shown in
Table 2 the trades executed by unaware brokers are significantly less likely to be predatory, we
should find that their clients are also less likely to profit from these fire sales events. Indeed, the
figure shows that the clients of aware brokers are able to capture significant returns after the start
of the liquidation, while the trades of the clients of unaware brokers do not generate significant
profits. The profits for the best managers peak at about 50 bps 17 days after the start of the fire
sale.

     Next, to provide more systematic evidence from regression analysis, we estimate the following
specification:

          𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑡𝑠𝑚,𝑖,𝑏,𝑡 = 𝛽1 𝐵𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝐶𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑚 × 𝐿𝑖𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑𝑡 + 𝛽2 𝐵𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝐶𝑙𝑖𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑚
                                                                                                                               (6)
                               + 𝛽3 𝐿𝑖𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑑𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑃𝑒𝑟𝑖𝑜𝑑𝑡 + 𝜀𝑚,𝑖,𝑏,𝑡 ,


which tests whether a manager m’s profits are significantly higher in the ten days after the start of
the fire sale relative to the prior ten days, whenever the manager is one of the best clients of the
aware broker. Intuitively, as with the estimation of the predation probability, we are comparing the
behavior of managers that should be aware of the fire sale, given their relationship with the broker,
with those who are likely not, before and after the beginning of the fire sale. We allow for a ten-
day window to allow managers the time to close their predatory short positions that they likely




15To be clear, we subtract stocks that are sold from stocks that are bought to compute the net position, which can end up being
negative, as in a short sale. The net cash amount to build the position can also be negative if the buy transactions exceed in dollar
value the buy transaction. This fact implies that when we compute the maximum exposure, we need to use the absolute value.


                                                                23
accumulate during the first five days of the fire sale, which is the period over which on average
the stock price declines (see Figure 4).16

     Table 11 reports the results showing that aware brokers’ best clients exhibit significantly higher
profits than other managers. On average, the best clients are able to generate between 47 and 74
basis points in five days, depending on the relationship proxy. Considering the low average
performance of institutional asset managers (see, among others, Busse, Goyal, and Wahal, 2010)
these higher returns are, indeed, highly economically significant.

     One might wonder whether the clients of aware brokers are always able to generate higher
profits than the clients of unaware brokers. If this were the case, then what we have shown in the
previous table could be explained by the different characteristics of the managers rather than by
the privileged access to order flow information. Although we already control for manager-fixed
effects, we also directly test for this possibility in Figure 6, which provides a placebo test. The
figure reports the profits for the two groups of managers, but for a random sample of event
windows other than the ones included in our fire-sale analysis. We show that the two groups are
indistinguishable in terms of their performance during these other times, which corroborates the
interpretation that the superior performance we document in Table 11 is made possible by the
access to the fire sale information.



4.2     Price Impact
Having established that the predatory traders are able to capture significant returns, we investigate
the dark side of predation. The conjecture is that predatory volume causes stock prices to decline
significantly more than what they would do in the absence of predation. In turn, this steeper decline
in prices leads the liquidating fund to achieve lower returns on its sale trades.

     Testing this conjecture requires the specification of a counterfactual. Fortunately, we can
identify fire sales events for which there are no aware brokers. These are 29 events (i.e. 7.5%) out
of a total of 385 events. In these situations, no broker observes a large enough fraction of the
liquidation to be deemed aware according to the criteria specified in Section 2. According to our



16Of course, the positions could be closed before day 5 and still be profitable. Our methodology for computing profits is flexible
enough to allow for all such possibilities.


                                                               24
identification strategy, no information leakage occurs on these events. More realistically, the
information leakage is expected to be significantly lower.

   Based on this strategy, we run event-stock level regressions of price impact onto the broker
awareness dummy. The broker awareness dummy denotes situations in which there is at least one
aware broker for that stock-event. The price impact is computed as execution shortfall, i.e. the
percentage difference between the execution price and a benchmark price (e.g. Keim and
Madhavan, 1997).

   We use three different benchmarks to show that our results do not crucially depend on a single
measure. Specifically, we use the price at the placement time of the first fire sale trade, the open
price of the day of the first fire sale trade, and finally the transaction price of the first fire sale
trade. In all specifications, we control for the volume in the fire sale, the volume of the following
trades (i.e. the trades in the same direction over the same five-day window), and the liquidity of
the stock (Amihud, 2002, Illiquidity Ratio), as they are all potentially important drivers of price
impact. In more detail, for each benchmark price we compute the implementation shortfall at the
ticket-level for the sales by the liquidating funds during the liquidation period as

                           𝑇𝑟𝑎𝑛𝑠𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 − 𝐵𝑒𝑛𝑐ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒
                                                             .                                    (7)
                                    𝐵𝑒𝑛𝑐ℎ𝑚𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑃𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒

We then average this quantity at the event-broker level, using as weights the volume of each
transaction, to obtain an event-broker level measure of price impact.

   Results are reported in Table 12. In Panel A, we regress these price impact measures on the
aware broker dummy. Consistently across measures, we show that the price impact costs borne by
the liquidating funds are significantly higher when they trade with brokers who are aware of the
liquidation event. The estimates are also economically significant as the price impact increases by
at least 22 bps and up to 40 bps. These numbers amount to between 11% and 26% in standard
deviation units. In Panel B, we exploit the granularity of our data and run a similar specification
in an event-stock-broker level sample. In this case, for the same stock-event, we can have aware
and unaware brokers. We can then include broker fixed effects to control for the possibility that
heterogeneity in price impact results from difference in broker execution quality. The results
remain significant and the magnitude decreases only slightly.




                                                  25
    Finally, we can provide a graphical description of the difference in price paths between the case
in which brokers have the possibility to leak (aware brokers) and the case in which brokers do not
have information about the liquidation (unware brokers). Figure 7 plots the cumulative return of
the fire sale stocks during fire sale events. The red line with squares represents the cumulative
return averaged across these stocks and events for the aware brokers. The green line with circles
is an estimation of the counterfactual cumulative return, based on unaware brokers. The series
draw on estimates from a regression specification similar to the one reported in Table 12, Panel B,
but run on daily observations starting on day 0. More precisely, the vertical distance between the
two series is the estimate of the aware broker dummy for a specific day of the interval.

    Figure 7 is a useful way to show that the transaction cost of the liquidating funds almost doubles
in the presence of predatory trading. At the trough of price impact, day 3, the cumulative return is
about -70 bps with aware brokers and about -35 bps in case of unaware brokers, i.e. the case in
which we conjecture that no leakage occurs.



5     Further Evidence
In this section we provide further evidence that is consistent with the interpretation founded on
order flow leakage and predatory trades.



5.1    Persistence in the Number of Brokers

One could wonder why the liquidating funds do not better hide their trades to avoid this higher
price impact. There are several non-mutually exclusive explanations. First, the evidence suggests
that in fact they try to hide their trades as they tend to employ an average of about 29 brokers to
intermediate these trades. Second, the funds are most likely in a rush to liquidate, which makes
them prioritize execution speed over price impact. For the same reason, they are likely to rely on
familiar brokers, as opposed to search for other brokers, which can take time. Third, there is a
significant amount of stickiness in the trading relationships between brokers and their clients. We
reported in Table 3 the persistence of these relationships. Here, we provide information on the
persistence in the number of brokers that managers use. Table 13 reports the autocorrelation of
various measures of concentration, such as the number of brokers and the Herfindahl index, both



                                                  26
on average and during fire sales events. The striking result is that indeed asset managers tend to
concentrate their trades among few brokers, and they do it both when they are seeking liquidity
and when they are not. It appears, therefore, that managers find it difficult to start interacting with
new brokers, i.e. building new relationships with brokers, at the time when a timely execution of
their trades is needed to meet investors’ redemptions demands.

5.2     Quid Pro Quo
Another natural question is whether brokers gain from leaking order flow information about their
clients. One might argue that it would be in their best interest to build a reputation as a loyal trading
partner by keeping the order flow information private. On the other hand, brokers have an incentive
to increase the volume they intermediate as they are paid on commissions. We can address this
question by exploiting the granularity of our data and testing whether best clients tend to reward
the brokers by channeling more trades to them. Table 14 regresses the average
𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑝𝑒𝑟 𝑑𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑒,𝑚,𝑏,𝑡 paid by manager m to broker b during month t, defined as the ratio
of the total amount in dollars paid in commissions and the total dollar volume traded by manager
m and intermediated by broker b in that month, on the interaction of the dummy variable
identifying the two years following the fire sale event with each of our Best Clients proxies.17 We
find that the clients who are more likely to receive order flow information tend to increase their
commissions to the brokers, which strongly suggests a quid pro quo between these parties.



5.3     Hedging Trades
Finally, the predatory trading strategy which seems to emerge from the main findings of this paper
is not devoid of risk, as prices may fail to drop. Also, this is not a risk that can be diversified within
a portfolio of similar trades, given that there are hardly multiple liquidations occurring at the same
time and, even if there were multiple liquidations, a manager is unlikely to have contacts with
multiple leaking brokers. Then, a smart way to implement this strategy would be for the predators
to hedge their short positions on the fire sale stocks with long positions on other similar stocks.


17 We have performed a similar analysis in which, instead of the proxies for best clients, we look at the clients that are more likely
to predate on that stock in that event, which we identify as those that are in the top half of the distribution of profitability in the ten-
day window after the event. Also, we run the same analysis focusing on brokers’ clients that trade in the same direction as the
liquidating fund during the liquidation periods. In both cases, the results (reported in Appendix Table A4, Panels A and B) are very
similar to those in Table 14.


                                                                    27
This would also allow the asset managers to reduce exposure to aggregate risk. To search for
evidence of hedging trades, we first define substitute stocks as those belonging to the same industry
or industry group as the fire sale stock, as identified with the 4-digit Standard Industry
Classification Code (SIC4) or by the SIC3, respectively.

    For each fire sale event, we consider ticket-level transactions of the best clients of aware brokers
(as defined by our awareness measure and the five Best Client proxies) on all the stocks other than
those that are involved in the fire sale, in a window of 5 trading days on each side of the start of
the liquidation event. Fire sale originators are excluded from the sample. The dependent variable
is a dummy variable 𝐻𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑒,𝑖,𝑚 defined at the event-manager-stock level indicating buy trades
of manager m on stock i such that manager m sold stock j during event e and the stocks i and j are
substitutes. The variable takes the value of zero for buy trades that are not in substitute stocks and
for sell trades. We regress the dependent variable on the interaction of the aware dummy and the
liquidation period dummy. In this case, the aware dummy is constructed at the manager-stock level
and indicates whether the manager is a best client of an aware broker intermediating a fire sale in
the same industry as that of the stock under consideration.

    In Table 15, consistent with a hedging strategy by the asset manager predating on the fire sales,
we find that predating managers are significantly more likely to buy substitute stocks in the five-
day window after the beginning of the fire sale. This evidence further corroborates the
interpretation of a deliberate predatory behavior by the best clients of aware brokers.



6    Conclusion
This paper studies whether brokers’ incentives to attract and retain clients crucially induce sharing
of flow information with other market participants. The evidence suggests that brokers tend to
reveal the occurrence of a fire sale to their best clients, allowing them to generate significant profits
by predating on the liquidating fund. Furthermore, this information leakage comes at the expense
of higher price impact, and leads to a more costly liquidation for the fire sale originator.

    These findings have implications for academics, practitioners, and policy makers. First, our
results indicate an important cost associated with slow execution. Slow execution has been widely
advocated by academics as a way to minimize price impact since Kyle (1985) and routinely



                                                   28
implemented by practitioners. In fact, according to our results, executing large trades over multiple
days allows the brokers to forecast order flow and to trigger predatory behavior by other market
participants. This might adversely affect price impact.

   Information leakage might be a source of concern for regulators as well, since it might
exacerbate the costs associated with fire sales, especially at times of scarce liquidity. Regulations
are unclear on what type of information the brokers can and cannot share with their clients.
Specifically, brokers have an obligation of “best execution”, which has two dimensions: price and
speed. Leaking information about a stock involved in a fire sale can worsen the price at which the
liquidating fund is able to execute its trades, as it appears from our evidence. On the other hand,
leaking brokers can always appeal to the defense argument that they spread the information in an
attempt to rapidly find trading counterparties for the liquidating fund. This defense argument is
weak, however, given the evidence of a quid pro quo that we present in the paper. That is, the
predatory managers seem to reward the leaking brokers with more revenues in the future. Yet, a
regulatory attempt to stop information leakage is likely to be challenging, because it will have to
deal with the brokers’ need to operate as deal-makers, as well as with the reluctance of many asset
managers to disclose more information about their trading activities.

   A fruitful avenue for further research is to build upon the insights of this paper towards a more
articulated theory of how the relationship between asset managers and intermediaries, such as
brokers, affects trading behavior and asset prices. Specifically, one could structurally estimate how
the flow of information diffuses among market participants and address questions about the
efficiency of such strategic behavior by the brokers for price discovery and asset allocation, as
well as providing insights into the counterfactual results in the presence of new regulations aimed
at curbing this practice.

                                                   Summary Statistics
Panel A and Panel B report summary statistics for the 385 fire sale events identified by our methodology. In Panel C
we regress the amount sold of each stock as a fraction of the total fire sale volume on a set of stocks characteristics.
Standard errors are clustered at the event level. T-stats are reported in parentheses. Asterisks denote significance levels
(***=1%, **=5%, *=10%). To identify fire sale events, we start by computing the signed volume Z-score 𝑍𝑡𝑚 for each
manager m on day t as Ztm = ( 𝐷𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑡𝑚 – 𝐸(𝐷𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑡𝑚 ) )/𝜎(𝐷𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑡𝑚 ), where 𝐷𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑡𝑚 is the portfolio level dollar volume
traded by manager m on day t, and its mean and standard deviation are estimated over a rolling window of 120 trading
days ending one week before day t. Then, at the portfolio level, we define manger 𝑚 as liquidating if 𝑍𝑡𝑚 is below -
0.25 for at least 5 trading days in a row. Next, we impose a filter at the stock level: for stock j to enter the fire sale
basket we require that the volume traded by the manager is above 1% of the CRSP daily volume for at least 4 of the
fire sale days. Finally, we keep events in which at least 10 stocks are sold by the liquidating fund.

                                      Predatory Behavior and Broker Awareness
The table reports results on the likelihood of a broker to attract predatory trades. The regressions are run at the ticket-
level, excluding trades by managers originating the fire-sale of interest or another overlapping fire-sale. In Columns
(1)-(4), the dependent variable is a dummy indicating predation, i.e. it takes value one when the trade is in the same
direction of the volume by the liquidating fund for that stock on that day (i.e. it is a sell trade), while it equals zero if
the trade is in the opposite direction (i.e. a buy trade), or if the liquidating fund is not trading that stock on that
particular day. The independent variable Aware is a dummy, defined at the event-broker-stock-day level, indicating
that the broker is aware of the fire sale happening on the traded stock on that day. Precisely, this means that for broker
B, stock j on day t the variable 𝐴𝑤𝑎𝐵𝑟𝑜𝑡 = 0.5  𝐴𝑤𝑎𝐸𝑣𝑡𝐵 ( 1 + 𝐴𝑤𝑎𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑡 ) is above the 10% threshold.

               𝐵𝑗
Here 𝐴𝑤𝑎𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑡 is the stock-level awareness, defined as the ratio between the turnover intermediated by B on stock j
up to day t and the total turnover on stock i up to day t (over all the active brokers). 𝐴𝑤𝑎𝐸𝑣𝑡𝐵 is the event-level
awareness, i.e. the ratio between the turnover intermediated by B on all the fire sale stocks up to day t and the total
turnover on all the fire sale stocks up to that day (over all the active brokers). In Columns (5)-(8), we weight the above
described dependent variable by the volume of the trade as a fraction of market capitalization, standardized. Standard
errors are clustered at the broker level. T-stats are reported in parentheses. Asterisks denote significance levels
(***=1%, **=5%, *=10%).

                                      Persistence of Broker-Client Relationship
The table reports results on the persistence of our proxies for the strength of the broker-manager relationship, defined
as follows:
     (1) Dummy variable indicating that the manager generated at least 5% of the total volume intermediated by the
         broker over the previous semester
     (2) Dummy variable indicating that the manager is in the top decile of managers ranked by the volume generated
         for the broker over the previous semester
     (3) Dummy variable indicating that the manager is in the top decile of managers ranked by the commission paid
         to the broker over the previous semester
     (4) Continuous variable with values in the unit interval, ranking of the manager in terms of the volume generated
         for the broker over the previous semester
     (5) Continuous variable with values on the unit interval, ranking of the manager in terms of the commission paid
         to the broker over the previous semester.
For each of the above proxies of relationship strength, we run a panel regression of the proxy onto its one-month
lagged value. The panel is not fully balanced due to the fact that not all months record a broker-manager interaction.
Thus, we fill with zeros the manager-broker pairs for which there is no transaction but for which at least one transaction
with another manager or broker is present in Ancerno in that period. Manager and broker fixed-effects are included in
the regression. Stardard errors are double-clustered at the manager- and broker-level. T-stats are reported in
parentheses. Asterisks denote significance levels (***=1%, **=5%, *=10%)

                        Probability of Predation and Broker-Client Relationship Strength
The table presents evidence of the effect of broker-client relationship strength on the probability of predatory behavior.
The regressions are run at the ticket-level, excluding trades by managers originating the fire-sale of interest or another
overlapping fire-sale. In all specifications the dependent variable is a dummy indicating predation, i.e. it takes value
one when the trade is in the same direction of the volume by the liquidating fund for that stock on that day (i.e. a sell
trade), while it equals zero if the trade is in the opposite direction (i.e. a buy trade) or if the liquidating fund is not
trading that stock on that particular day. In Panel A we regress the dependent variable on the dummy Best Client
indicating if the manager is among the best clients of the broker intermediating the transcation, the dummy Liquidation
Period indicating the first 5 days of the fire sale, and the interaction of the two dummies. We consider all trades on
stock j intermediated by brokers that eventually become aware that the stock is subject to fire sale pressure, i.e. brokers
                                   𝐵𝑗                         𝐵𝑗
B for which 𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑡∈[0,4] (𝐴𝑤𝑎𝐵𝑟𝑜𝑡 ) = 1, where 𝐴𝑤𝑎𝐵𝑟𝑜𝑡 is defined as above. The regression is run on a sample
that includes five days before the fire sale and five days from the start of the fire sale, defined as the first day in which
our liquidation measure crosses the threshold. In Panel B we regress the dependent variable on the triple interaction
of the following dummies: Aware Broker indicating if the broker is aware, Best Client indicating if the manager is
among the best clients of the broker intermediating the transcation, and Liquidation Period indicating the first 5 days
of the fire sale. We include manager, broker, stock, day and event fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the
event-stock-manager level and T-stats are reported in parentheses. Asterisks denote significance levels (***=1%,
**=5%, *=10%)

The table reports results on a first set robustness checks on the baseline results presented in Table 4. In the
specifications of Panel A we exclude the fire-sale events happening during NBER recession periods, which in our
sample include the burst of the dot-com bubble (March 2001 – November 2001) and the global financial crisis
(December 2007 – June 2009). In the specifications of Panel B we exclude stocks subject to negative fundamental
news in a window of 5 days before and after the start of the fire-sale event, as proxied by (i) negative earning surprises,
(ii) Raven Pack news index in the bottom quartile, (iii) negative analyst reccomendation changes. We include manager,
broker, stock, day and event fixed effects and we cluster standard errors at the event-stock-manager level. T-stats are
reported in parentheses. Asterisks denote significance levels (***=1%, **=5%, *=10%)

                                   Robustness: Excluding Underperforming Stocks
The table reports results on a set of robustness checks on the baseline results presented in Table 4. In the specifications
of Panel A we exclude stocks expriencig negative returns in a window of 10 days preceding the start of the fire-sale
event. In Panel B, we exclude stocks with high short interest in the 2 weeks preceding the fire sale event, as proxied
by a value of utilisation ratio, computed using data from Markit as shares on loan / shares available from lending, in
the top quartile of the cross-sectional distribution in the CRSP universe. We include manager, broker, stock, day and
event fixed effects and we cluster standard errors at the event-stock-manager level. T-stats are reported in parentheses.

                                       Evidence of Predation on Multiple Stocks
The table reports results on the number of stocks experiencing predatory pressure. For each fire sale event we consider
the basket of liquidated stocks, and for each manager actively trading at least one stock in the basket we count the
number of stocks traded in the same direction of the fire sale originator. In Panel A, we consider event-manager
observations and we regress the number of predated stocks on best client proxies. These are constructed by interacting
the original best client proxies with the broker awareness dummy at the ticket-level, and then by taking the maximum
value at the event-manager level. In Panel B, we repeat the exercise by adopting as dependent variable the fraction of
predated stocks relative to the stocks in the fire sale basket. Event, manager and day fixed effects are included in the
regressions and standard errors are double clustered at the manager and event level. T-stats are reported in parentheses.

                                              Predators Position Reversal
The dependent variable is the fraction of sales in a given stock that a given manager subsequently reverses. In detail,
in a given time period, either before or after the beginning of the fire sale, the percentage of position reversed for
manager m during event e for stock j is defined as the ratio 𝑅𝑒𝑣𝑒,𝑚,𝑗 = 𝐵𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡𝐵𝑎𝑐𝑘𝑒,𝑚,𝑗 / 𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑑e,m,j , where 𝑆𝑜𝑙𝑑e,m,j
is the dollar sum of all sell orders in that period, and 𝐵𝑜𝑢𝑔ℎ𝑡𝐵𝑎𝑐𝑘𝑒,𝑚,𝑗 is the dollar sum of buy orders during the
period, where we sum only the buy orders that are preceded by a negative cumulative order flow. We compute this
measure around each fire sale event, for the event time periods 𝑃𝑟𝑒 = [−10, −1] and 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 = [1,10], considering all
trades on stock j intermediated by brokers who eventually become aware that the stock is subject to fire sale pressure.
We then compare the percentage of position reversed by Best and Non-Best clients of the aware brokers before (𝑃𝑟𝑒)
and during (𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡) the fire sale events. Liquidating funds are excluded from the sample. Time, stock and manager
fixed-effects are added to the regression and standard errors are clustered at the manager level. T-stats are reported in
parentheses. Asterisks denote significance levels (***=1%, **=5%, *=10%)

                                   Evidence from the 2003 Mutual Fund Scandal
We first match the list of 27 mutual fund families involved in the 2003 late-trading scandal with managers in our
dataset and mark them as charged. We focus on daily transactions of the managers that are not involved in the scandal
for a period of four years centered on the month of the announcement of the complaint by Spitzer (September 2003)
and define a dummy 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 𝑆𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑙𝑡 , indicating the two years after the complaint broke out. Next, we define a broker-
stock-day level dummy variable, 𝑆𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑏,𝑗,𝑡 , indicating that at least one of the charged funds is selling stock j on day
t through broker b. Then, we define the dependent variable Probability of Predation as a dummy variable that equals
1 if a non-charged manager is selling stock j on day t through broker b. The dependent variable equals 0 if a non-
charged manager trades on a different day, or on a different stock, or with a different broker. In a difference-in-
differences setting, we regress the probability of predation on the interaction between 𝑆𝑒𝑙𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑏,𝑗,𝑡 and the
dummy 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 𝑆𝑐𝑎𝑛𝑑𝑎𝑙𝑡 . We include an increasing sequence of day, manager, stock and broker fixed effects. Standard
errors are clustered by manager-stock to and T-stats are reported in parentheses. Asterisks denote significance levels
(***=1%, **=5%, *=10%)

The table reports results on the heterogeneity of the predatory behavior with respect to the characteristics of the clients.
We run stock-level regressions with the same specification as in the baseline version of Table 4, but restricting to
managers identified as hedge funds in Panel A and to the complementary set of other institutions in Panel B. We
include manager, broker, stock, day, and event fixed effects and we cluster standard errors at the event-stock-manager
level. T-stats are reported in parentheses. Asterisks denote significance levels (***=1%, **=5%, *=10%)

                                           Profitability of Predatory Trades
The table reports results on the profitability of trades by predators around the fire sales events. We divide each event
into a pre-fire sale period [−10, −1] and a post-fire sale period [0,9], where zero denotes the day on which the fire
sale starts. We then compute the profitability of trades by manager m on stock j over the window 𝜋 = [𝑡0 , 𝑡1 ], which
denotes either the pre or post fire sale period. Profitability is defined as
                 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑓𝑖𝑡𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑦𝑚,𝑗,𝜋 = ( 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑇𝑜𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑒𝑡𝑚,𝑗,𝜋 − 𝐶𝑎𝑠ℎ𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑠𝑚,𝑗,𝜋 )/𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑚,𝑗,𝜋 .
Here, 𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑇𝑜𝑀𝑎𝑟𝑘𝑒𝑡𝑚,𝑗,𝜋 is the marked-to-market dollar value of the position at time 𝑡1 , defined as the product of
the share position cumulated from 𝑡0 to 𝑡1 with the market price of stock j on day 𝑡1 . 𝐶𝑎𝑠ℎ𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑠𝑚,𝑗,𝜋 is the dollar
amount spent to build the position, i.e. the opposite of the dollar volume of each transaction in the stock (based on
execution prices) from from 𝑡0 to 𝑡1 . 𝐸𝑥𝑝𝑜𝑠𝑢𝑟𝑒𝑚,𝑗,𝜋 is the maximum dollar outlay over the relevant period, defined
as max t∈π |𝐶𝑎𝑠ℎ𝐹𝑙𝑜𝑤𝑠𝑚,𝑗,[𝑡0,𝑡] |. We compare the profitability (expressed in basis points) of trades by best clients of
aware brokers to that of other managers, in the pre and post fire sale periods, using event-manager-stock level
observations. Time and manager fixed-effects are added to the regression and standard errors are clustered at the
manager level. T-stats are reported in parentheses. Asterisks denote significance levels (***=1%, **=5%, *=10%)

                                          Price Impact and Broker Awareness
This table reports results on the price impact experienced by the fire sale originators. We construct the following price
impact measures: (i) the execution shortfall based on the first placement price, (ii) the execution shortfall based on the
first open price, (iii) the execution shortfall based on the first transaction price. We aggregate the measures taking
their volume-weighted average across transactions and express them in basis points. In Panel A, we regress the price
impact measures on a dummy indicating the presence of an aware broker at the event-stock level and the total volume
of other managers (followers) relative to the stock market capitalization. We control for the originator volume relative
to the stock market capitalization and the Amihud ratio of the stock, estimated on the previous six months. Time and
stock fixed effects are added to the regression. In Panel Bb we repeat the exercise at the event-stock-broker-level and
we add broker fixed effects. Continuos explanatory variables are standardized and standard errors are clustered by
event. T-stats are reported in parentheses. Asterisks denote significance levels (***=1%, **=5%, *=10%)

This table reports results on the concentration of brokers employed by asset managers in our sample. We construct
three proxies of broker concentration: (i) the Herfindahl Index (HHI) of the trading volumes at the monthly frequency,
(ii) the normalized Herfindahl Index (HHI) of the trading volumes at the monthly frequency and (iii) the number of
brokers intermediating at least one trade of the manager in the given month. In Panel A, we regress each proxy on
their one-month, six-months and one-year lags using observations at the manager-month level. In Panel B, we repeat
the same exercise restricting to the sample to fire sale events. All the specifications include month fixed effects. T-

                                       Commissions Paid to Aware Brokers
The table presents evidence on the post-event increase of commissions paid by predators to aware brokers. For each
month t on a window starting two years before and ending two year after each fire sale event e, we define the average
𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛_𝑝𝑒𝑟_𝑑𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑒,𝑚,𝑏,𝑡 paid by manager m to broker b as the ratio 𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑒,𝑚,𝑏,𝑡 /𝐷𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑒,𝑚,𝑏,𝑡 , where
𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑒,𝑚,𝑏,𝑡 is the total amount in dollars paid in commissions by manager m to broker b during month t and
𝐷𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑒,𝑚,𝑏,𝑡 is the total dollar volume traded by manager m and intermediated by broker b in that month. For each
event, we consider brokers which are marked as Aware on at least one of the fire sale stocks and managers whose
trades are intermediated by at least one of these broker in the ten trading days around the event. We then regress
𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛_𝑝𝑒𝑟_𝑑𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑒,𝑚,𝑏,𝑡 on the interaction of the dummy variable 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑒,𝑡 , indicating the two years following
the fire sale event, with each of our Best Clients proxies. We add event, manager, and brokers fixed-effects to the
regression and we cluster standard errors by event-broker-manager to account for time-series autocorrelation in
commissions paid. T-stats are reported in parentheses. Asterisks denote significance levels (***=1%, **=5%, *=10%)

                                            Hedging of Predatory Trades
The table presents evidence on predators hedging their short positions on the fire sale stocks with long positions on
substitue stocks. We define substitute stocks those belonging to the same industry or industry group as the fire sale
stock, as identified with the 4-digit Standard Industry Classification Code (SIC4) and by the SIC3, respectively. For
each fire sale event, we consider ticket-level transactions of the best clients of aware brokers (as defined by our
awareness measure and the five Best Client proxies) on all the stocks other than those involved in the fire sale, in a
window of 5 trading days on each side of the start of the liquidation event. Fire sale originators are excluded from the
sample. The dependent variable is a dummy variable 𝐻𝑒𝑑𝑔𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑒,𝑖,𝑚 defined at the event-manager-stock level indicating
buy trades of manager m on stock i such that manager m sold stock j during event e and the stocks i and j are substitutes.
The variable takes the value of zero for buy trades that are not in substitute stocks and for sell trades. We regress the
dependent variable on the interaction of the aware dummy and the liquidation period dummy. In this case, the aware
dummy is constructed at the manager-stock level and indicates whether the manager is a best client of an aware broker
intermediating a fire sale in the same industry as that of the stock under consideration. T-stats are reported in
parentheses. Asterisks denote significance levels (***=1%, **=5%, *=10%)

                                       Robustness: Broker Awareness Threshold
The table reports results on the likelihood of a broker to attract predatory trades. The regressions are run at the ticket-
level, excluding trades by managers originating the fire-sale of interest or another overlapping fire-sale. The
independent variable Aware is a dummy, defined at the event-broker-stock-day level, indicating that the broker is
aware of the fire sale happening on the traded stock on that day. Precisely, this means that for broker B, stock j on day
t the variable 𝐴𝑤𝑎𝐵𝑟𝑜𝑡 = 0.5  𝐴𝑤𝑎𝐸𝑣𝑡𝐵 ( 1 + 𝐴𝑤𝑎𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑡 ) is above a given threshold. We test the robustness of
                         𝐵𝑗                                     𝐵𝑗

the main results reported in Table 2 with respect different levels of the threshold, ranging from 1% to 30%.
                𝐵𝑗
Here 𝐴𝑤𝑎𝑆𝑡𝑜𝑡 is the stock-level awareness, defined as the ratio between the turnover intermediated by B on stock j
up to day t and the total turnover on stock i up to day t (over all the active brokers). 𝐴𝑤𝑎𝐸𝑣𝑡𝐵 is the event-level
awareness, i.e. the ratio between the turnover intermediated by B on all the fire sale stocks up to day t and the total
turnover on all the fire sale stocks up to that day (over all the active brokers). In Panel A, the dependent variable is a
dummy indicating predation, i.e. it takes value one when the trade is in the same direction of the volume by the
liquidating fund for that stock on that day (i.e. it is a sell trade), while it equals zero if the trade is in the opposite
direction (i.e. a buy trade), or if the liquidating fund is not trading that stock on that particular day. In Panel B, we
weight the above described dependent variable by the volume of the trade as a fraction of market capitalization,
standardized. Standard errors are clustered at the broker level. T-stats are reported in parentheses. Asterisks denote
significance levels (***=1%, **=5%, *=10%).

                                       Robustness: Broker-Manager Fixed Effects
The table presents evidence of the effect of broker-client relationship strength on the probability of predatory behavior.
The regressions are run at the ticket-level, excluding trades by managers originating the fire-sale of interest or another
overlapping fire-sale. In all specifications the dependent variable is a dummy indicating predation, i.e. it takes value
one when the trade is in the same direction of the volume by the fire-sale originator for that stock on that day, while
it equals zero if the trade is in the opposite direction or if the originator is not trading that stock on that particular day.
We regress the dependent variable on a dummy indicating if the manager is among the best clients of the broker
intermediating the transcation, a dummy indicating the first 5 days of the fire sale, and the interaction of the two
dummies. This dummy equals zero for the five days before the fire sale. We consider all trades on stock j intermediated
by brokers that eventually become aware that the stock is subject to fire sale pressure, i.e. brokers B for which
                       𝐵𝑗                        𝐵𝑗
𝑚𝑎𝑥𝑡∈[0,4] (𝐴𝑤𝑎𝐵𝑟𝑜𝑡 ) = 1 where 𝐴𝑤𝑎𝐵𝑟𝑜𝑡 is defined as above. The regression is run on a 5 days window centered
at the beginning of the fire sale (t=0), defined as the first day in which our liquidation measure crosses the threshold.
We also include Broker×Manager and Broker×Originator fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by event-stock-
manager and T-stats are reported in parentheses. Asterisks denote significance levels (***=1%, **=5%, *=10%)

                                     Evidence of Predation from Trading Volume
The table presents results on the likelihood that managers engage in predation trading in the same direction of the fire-
sale originator, weighted by the trading volume. The regressions are run at the ticket-level, excluding trades by
managers originating the fire-sale of interest or another overlapping fire-sale. In all specifications the dependent
variable is the product of the predation dummy defined in Table 4 multiplied by the volume of the transaction as a
fraction of the market capitalization of the traded stock. The independent variables are the same as in the previous
specifications. The regression is run on a window of five days on each side of the beginning of the fire sale (t = 0),
defined as the first day in which our liquidation measure crosses the threshold. In specifications of Panel B we repeat
the exercise excluding the NBER recession periods and stocks experiencing negative fundamental news, high short
interest or negative momentum. We include manager, broker, stock, day, and event fixed effects and we cluster
standard errors at the event-stock-manager level. T-stats are reported in parentheses. Asterisks denote significance
levels (***=1%, **=5%, *=10%)

                                          Commissions Paid to Aware Brokers
The table presents evidence on the post-event increase of commissions paid by predators to aware brokers. For each
month t on a window of two years around each fire sale event e, we define the average 𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛_𝑝𝑒𝑟_𝑑𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑒,𝑚,𝑏,𝑡
paid by manager m to broker b as the ratio 𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑒,𝑚,𝑏,𝑡 /𝐷𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑒,𝑚,𝑏,𝑡 where ratio 𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑒,𝑚,𝑏,𝑡 is the total amount in
dollars paid in commissions by manager m to broker b during month t and 𝐷𝑉𝑜𝑙𝑒,𝑚,𝑏,𝑡 is the total dollar volume traded
by manager m and intermediated by broker b in that month. For each event, we consider brokers which are marked as
Aware on at least one of the fire sale stocks and managers whose trades are intermediated by at least one of these
broker in the ten trading days around the event. We then regress 𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑚𝑖𝑠𝑠𝑖𝑜𝑛_𝑝𝑒𝑟_𝑑𝑜𝑙𝑙𝑎𝑟𝑒,𝑚,𝑏,𝑡 on the interaction of
the dummy variable 𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑒,𝑡 , indicating the two years following the fire sale event, with each of our Best Clients
proxies. In Panel A we look at the clients that are more likely to predate on that stock in that event, which we identify
as those that are in the top half of the distribution of profitability in the ten-day window after the event. In Panel B we
run the same analysis focusing on brokers’ clients that trade in the same direction as the liquidating fund during the
liquidation periods. We add event, manager, and brokers fixed-effects to the regression and we cluster standard errors
by event-broker-manager to account for time-series autocorrelation in commissions paid. T-stats are reported in
parentheses. Asterisks denote significance levels (***=1%, **=5%, *=10%)
