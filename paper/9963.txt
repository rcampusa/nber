                                         ABSTRACT

In this paper we examine the relationship between marijuana use and human capital formation by

examining performance on standardized tests among a nationally representative sample of youths

from the National Education Longitudinal Survey. We find that much of the negative association

between cross-sectional measures of marijuana use and cognitive ability appears to be attenuated

by individual differences in school attachment and general deviance. However, difference-in-

difference estimates examining changes in test scores across 10th and 12th grade reveal that

marijuana use remains statistically associated with a 15% reduction in performance on

standardized math tests.

I. Introduction

       There is a generally held notion that early involvement with marijuana will negatively

impair human capital formation and result in poor schooling outcomes because marijuana use

impairs memory and attention and thus interferes with learning. Indeed, there is a large literature

documenting a significant positive correlation between early involvement with marijuana and

high school dropout status as well as other negative schooling outcomes (Bray et al., 2000;

Ellickson et al., 1998; Yamada, Kendix and Yamada, 1996; Mensch and Kandel, 1988). The

causality of the relationship between marijuana use and schooling, however, has been brought

into question by empirical evidence showing that poor schooling outcomes precede regular

and/or heavy marijuana use (Sander, 2000; Fergusson and Horwood, 1997; Hawkins et al, 1992;

Newcomb & Bentler, 1988).

       The question of causality is further complicated by conflicting findings from clinical

studies that examine the impact of persistent and heavy marijuana use on individual cognitive

functioning (Solowij, 1998). Although neuroscientists have been able to identify the part of the

brain that is affected by marijuana use and have shown that activation of cannabinoid receptor

sites in the part of the brain that control memory interrupts normal brain cognitive functioning

and memory (Matsuda, Bonner and Lolait 1993; Heyser, Hampson, and Deadwyler 1993),

studies examining the effects of cannabis on cognitive functioning in specific small populations

have not consistently shown a negative long term effect of persistent and/or heavy marijuana use

(Solowij, 1998). Some studies have shown that heavy and regular marijuana use do impair long

and short term cognitive functioning (Block et al, 1990; Pope and Yurgelun-Todd, 1996;

Solowij1998), while others show no statistically significant effect (Lekitsos et al, 1999;

Mendelson, Rossi and Meyer, 1974; Dornbush et al, 1972). A number of factors appear to be



                                                 3
related to these mixed findings, including the length of time the individual has been using

cannabis heavily and measurement of the actual doses taken (Solowij, 1998). Thus, the long-term

consequences of regular and heavy use of marijuana on cognitive functioning are still being

explored.

       Given the uncertainty of a long term association between marijuana use and cognitive

functioning from the physical sciences, the proper interpretation of a negative association

between early marijuana use and subsequent academic achievement identified by the social

sciences remains in question. The possibility of an unobserved underlying third factor

explaining 100% of the association between poor academic performance and marijuana use

behavior cannot be easily refuted.

       In this paper we revisit the question of whether marijuana use causes cognitive

impairment using a large, nationally representative sample of youths from the National

Education Longitudinal Survey (NELS:88). Unlike previous analyses examining this association

in large populations, we examine the association between marijuana use and students’

performance on standardized tests, a more direct measure of the student’s cognitive ability and a

variable that is less sensitive to other individual psychosocial behaviors. Moreover, studies have

shown that standardized test scores are predictive of future earnings lending weight to the

argument that test scores are important variables to examine.

       We begin our examination by presenting cross-sectional models of the effects of

marijuana use on standardized test scores in the 10th grade. We find that marijuana use has a

small and statistically significant negative association with composite, math, and reading

standardized test scores. However, the statistical significance of these findings goes away when

potentially endogenous variables capturing general academic performance, deviant behavior, and




                                                4
school attachment are included as additional regressors in the model. Given that the inclusion of

these endogenous variables are likely to bias coefficient estimates from this long form model, we

also consider difference-in-differences (DD) analyses, which reduce potential biases associated

with time-invariant unobservable characteristics. These difference-in-difference models confirm

that the association between marijuana use and test scores is substantially reduced; the negative

association between marijuana use and math scores, however, remains.

        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section II we discuss the literature

examining the relationship between marijuana use and schooling, highlighting the fact that many

previous analyses focus on obtuse measures of cognitive function (high school drop out status)

and exclude important school-level measures associated with schooling performance. In Section

III we present our empirical modeling approach in light of the previous literature. In Section IV

we discuss the specific variables being used from the National Educational Longitudinal Survey

(NELS:88). The results and some additional sensitivity analyses are presented and discussed in

Section V and we conclude in Section VI with a summary and policy implications.



II. The Literature on Marijuana Use and Schooling

       If marijuana use truly does impact cognitive functioning, then one would expect that

heavy marijuana use during adolescence would reduce general performance in school and

educational achievement. The empirical relationship between marijuana use and school

performance, however, is confounded by a number of other factors, including desire to fit in,

reliance on coping mechanisms, natural ability, tastes for deviance, and rates of time preference

(Fergusson & Horwood, 1997; Farrell & Fuchs, 1982; Schulenberg, et al 1994; Sanders, 2000).




                                                 5
These confounding factors make it difficult to interpret the true nature of the relationship

between marijuana use and schooling.

        The limited economics literature that has explicitly examined the relationship between

marijuana use and educational attainment has generally focused on the impact of marijuana use

on high school completion (Yamada, Kendix and Yamada, 1996; Bray et al, 2000; Register et al,

2001), presuming the causal relationship is one way. Yamada, Kendix and Yamada (1996), for

example, employ a subsample of 1035 twelfth grade students from the 1982 National

Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY) to examine the impact of current alcohol and marijuana

use on the probability of high school graduation. Although information on current/recent

marijuana use was not obtained in the 1982 survey, it could be reconstructed using retrospective

data collected in 1984. They estimate various models of high school graduation, entering recent

alcohol and marijuana use into different model specifications, and find that marijuana (as well as

alcohol) use diminishes the likelihood of graduating from high school. Additional controls in

their model include gender, race, family structure, number of siblings, parental income, poverty,

and ability (as measured by ASVAB scores). There are a number of significant limitations with

this study, however, including the fact that recent alcohol and marijuana use are treated as

exogenous variables without explicitly showing tests supporting this assumption. In addition, the

sample size is relatively small given the number of individuals in the NLSY who could have

been used for this analysis. Finally, the data set precluded them from including information on

important school factors that are likely to be related to both high school completion and

individual substance use.

       Mensch and Kandel (1988) use a much larger sample of 12,000 young adults from the

1984 NLSY to estimate the impact of cigarette, alcohol, marijuana, and other illicit drug use on




                                                 6
high school dropout status. They estimated models that accounted for parent’s education, race,

ethnicity, family structure, self-esteem, academic ability and delinquency and found that prior

use of cigarettes, marijuana and other illicit drugs each increased the propensity to drop out of

school. They did not find a significant relationship between prior alcohol use and dropping out,

which they interpreted as evidence of the pervasiveness of alcohol use in American high schools.

Here again, however, substance use is treated as an exogenous predictor without a test of this

assumption and important school characteristics are omitted.

       Bray et al. (2000) examine the relationship between marijuana initiation and dropping out

of high school for a sample of 1392 students who participated in a longitudinal study in a

Southeastern U.S. school system. In their analysis, they examine the effects of age of initiation

of alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana and other illicit drugs on age-specific probabilities of dropping

out of high school controlling for a series of sociodemographic variables including race, gender,

enrollment in a rural versus an urban school, parents’ education, number of parents living in the

household, and the youths’ self-report of typical grades earned in school. Marijuana initiation

prior to the age of dropout has a positive and statistically significant effect on the probability of

dropping out at age 16 and at age18 even after you control for age of initiation of cigarettes,

alcohol, and other drugs. Marijuana initiation only affects dropping out for 17 year olds when

other substance use is omitted from the equation; however it remains negative and significant in

the model for the combined sample. They conclude from their results that marijuana initiators

are 2.3 times more likely to subsequently drop out of high school than nonusers.

       Following on work by Mensch and Kandel, Register, Williams & Grimes (2001)

differentiate the effects of “hard drugs” from “soft drugs” in their examination of the impact of

early illicit drug use on subsequent educational attainment. Using a sample of young males from




                                                  7
the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth, they employ a two stage regression model that first

predicts separate likelihood functions for the probability of using any illicit drug, any hard drug,

and marijuana use only using data from 1984 when the respondents were 18 years of age or

younger. Variables in the first stage include urbanicity (at age 14 and in 1992), family structure

(living with both parents, number of siblings), parental education, age, ethnicity, marital status,

number of dependents, region, religiosity, and an indicator of living in a state where marijuana

has been decriminalized at age 14. They then construct predicted probabilities for each of these

measures and evaluate their effects on subsequent total educational attainment in 1992, when the

respondents are between the ages of 27 and 34 years of age. The models are also presented

separately for Whites, Blacks and Hispanics. For each measure of drug use they find a negative

and statistically significant effect on educational attainment in the full sample. However, when

the models are run for specific ethnic groups, it shows that the negative and statistically

significant effect only holds for the sample of Whites. The effects generally remain negative for

the other groups, but they are not statistically significant.

        A problem with the economic literature so far is its focus on drop out status as its main

measure of educational attainment. Although completion of high school does have important

economic implications on future earnings, it is also an outcome that is significantly confounded

by other underlying behavioral factors that are difficult to statistically differentiate from

observed drug use behavior. More importantly, high school drop out status is an imprecise

measure of the impact of marijuana use on cognitive functioning because the decision to drop out

is often based on a culmination of events, only one of which may be related to low or impaired

cognitive ability.




                                                   8
         In this paper, we propose examining the effects of marijuana use on a more direct

measure of cognitive functioning, performance on standardized tests. By focusing on

standardized test scores, we can assess whether regular marijuana use impacts performance and

to what extent, looking for both big and small effects. Real effects of marijuana use on

performance that are small might easily go unnoticed or be undetectable because of differences

in natural ability across students. In addition, we consider a continuous measure of marijuana

use that enables us to distinguish between light infrequent use of marijuana and more regular,

frequent use, enabling us to differentiate the possible effects of light and heavy use. Finally, we

include additional school-level measures that have been found to be important correlates of

educational attainment and school performance, such as school environment. School

environment has been found to have a significant impact on both adolescent substance use and

educational attainment (Bachman, Johnston and O’Malley, 1998; Curran, Stice, and Chassin,

1997).



III. The Empirical Model

         One could construct a theoretical framework demonstrating a causal relationship

between marijuana use and student achievement by modifying the standard model of human

capital formation. Ultimately, however, the relationship between marijuana use and educational

achievement is an empirical question. If we assume that marijuana use is exogenous to the

process determining student achievement, then we can express the relationship as follows:

(1)      Yijt = β 0 + β1 X ijt + β 2 Z jt + γ 1MJijt + ε ijt

where Yijt represents the measure of student achievement (ie. test score) for individual i in school

j at time t, Xijt is a vector of individual-level characteristics measured at time t, Zjt is a vector of



                                                               9
school-level characteristics measured at time t, MJijt represents the use of marijuana by

individual i in school j at time t, and εijt is a random error term. The parameter γ1 measures the

effect of marijuana use on student achievement.

         As discussed in the previous literature, there are at least two problems that could cause

standard OLS estimation of γ1 to generate a biased estimate of marijuana use on student

achievement. First, it may be the case that low academic achievement encourages some youth to

get involved with marijuana, in which case corr(Mijt, εijt) ≠ 0. If this is the case than marijuana

use is structurally endogenous and the causality could run both ways. We use a simple Hausman

test of exogeneity to determine if this problem does indeed exist. Instruments used to perform

this test are described in detail in the next section.

         A second sort of bias can result if academic achievement and marijuana use are both

associated with a common, but yet unaccounted for, third factor that generates a spurious

correlation between these two observed variables. Plausible sources of unobserved heterogeneity

include differences in ability, rates of time preference, coping mechanisms, and tastes for

deviance. Unlike other measures of academic achievement that are more closely tied to student’s

behaviors, standardized test scores are expected to be less correlated with some of the

unobserved factors that are more behaviorally based. Nonetheless, the potential for an omitted

variable bias still remains.

         To overcome bias that may be caused by an omitted variable problem, we employ two

alternative approaches. First, we consider a “long form specification” of equation (1) that

includes additional individual-level variables capturing observable aspects of the hypothesized

source of the unobserved heterogeneity (Wit). The model can be written as follows:

(2) Yijt = β 0 + β1 X ijt + β 2 Z jt + β 3Wit + γ 1MJijt + ε ijt



                                                          10
       Although the inclusion of these variables may reduce the bias caused by an omitted

variable problem, they may also introduce new bias due to the probable endogeneity of these

new variables. So while the estimates from the long-form model can be suggestive, they must be

interpreted with some caution. An alternative method for addressing the omitted variable

problem employs a difference-in-differences (DD) estimation strategy, which takes advantage of

the panel nature of the data. The DD model that we estimate can be written as follows:

(3)       ∆Yijt = β1∆X ijt + β 2 ∆Z jt + γ 1∆MJijt + eijt

where ∆Yijt is the change in student achievement between time t and t-1, ∆Xijt is a vector of the

changes in individual-level variables over the same time period, ∆Zjt is a vector of the changes

in school-level variables over the same time period, ∆MJiit represents the change in marijuana

use over the same period, and eijt is a random error term. The principal advantage of this model is

that it will remove the influence of time-persistent unobserved heterogeneity without introducing

any new bias to the estimates.



IV. The Data

       The data we examine are taken from the National Education Longitudinal Study of 1988

(hereafter NELS:88), conducted by the National Center for Education Statistics. NELS:88 is a

two-stage stratified, nationally representative sample of approximately 1,052 schools and 24,500

students who were eighth graders in 1988. The first follow-up included approximately 19,000

students, of which slightly more than one thousand had dropped out. The NELS:88 is designed

to collect information regarding the educational experiences, aspirations, and activities of

American eighth graders, as well as their immediate transition to high school. Students were

resurveyed in 1990, 1992, and 1994, allowing researchers to track students from 8th grade



                                                     11
through high school, including those who dropout, up through their post-high school

experiences. In addition, additional students were surveyed in 1990 and 1992 to enable

nationally representative cross sectional analyses of 8th, 10th, and 12th graders.

       In each of the first three waves, respondents completed a questionnaire and a battery of

cognitive tests that were administered by the Educational Testing Service. Standardized tests

were given in reading, mathematics, history and science. In this analysis we use performance on

these standardized tests as a measure of academic achievement. To consider the possible

differential influence marijuana could have on specific cognitive skills, we examine performance

in terms of three different scores: their composite score, their math score, and their reading score.

       While the primary focus of NELS:88 is on students’ school experiences and achievement,

there is a good deal of information available on students’ substance use. In the 10th and 12th

grade questionnaire information was collected on the number of times the person used marijuana

in the past 30 days, the past 12 months and in their lifetime.       We use the responses to these

questions to generate two different measures of marijuana use for the contemporaneous

(henceforth “10th grade”) analyses of test scores and one measure of marijuana use for the DD

models. For the 10th grade analyses, we first construct a simple dichotomous indicator of use in

the past 30 days. This is the measure of use most commonly employed in the literature and is

therefore used for the purposes of comparing our results to those of the previous literature. A

second measure, which we refer to as the marijuana index variable, is constructed so that we can

capture both the timing and intensity of marijuana use. The index can take a value from 0 to 4,

where 0 represents having never used marijuana, 1 indicates lifetime use, but no use in the past

year, 2 indicates use in the past year, but not in the past 30 days; 3 represents use of marijuana

one to two times in the past 30 days, and a value of 4 indicates use of marijuana three or more




                                                 12
times in the past month. The advantage of using the marijuana index is that it allows us to

distinguish between light or infrequent users and heavy users.

         For the DD models we drop individuals who report ever using marijuana in the 10th grade

and construct a new dichotomous indicator of marijuana initiation that is set equal to 1 if the

individual reports using marijuana in the past year or in the past month in the 12th grade and zero

otherwise. This variable therefore captures the behavior of those individuals who chose to

initiate marijuana use between 10th and 12th grade although it provides no information on the

degree of involvement.1

         To control for the socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the individual

NELS respondents, we also include the following measures in all of our models: race/ethnicity,

age, sex, a composite measure of socioeconomic status2, number of parents in the household,

parent’s highest educational attainment, a measure of religiousity (how often the respondent

attends religious services), number of older siblings, and the type of high school program the

student is enrolled in (i.e. college prep, vocational, regular). In the long form specification of

our 10th grade model we include a wider array of individual characteristics that are frequently

omitted in economic analyses because of their probable endogeneity.3 Additional measures

include current use of alcohol and frequency of binge drinking, 8th grade GPA, hours spent on

homework in 8th grade, time spent working at a job, an index of 8th grade negative behaviors (i.e.

getting sent to the office, disrupting class), the number of stressors that a student faced over the


1
  Individuals who report in 12th grade that they used marijuana in their lifetime were coded as non-users in the
analyses presented here. The results presented here are not sensitive to how we code these individuals.
2
  The SES composite is created by NCES using information from questions on the parent questionnaire in 1988. It
includes information on the parents’ education level, parents’ occupation, and family income. If all information on
these items were missing from the parent’s response then information from the student questionnaire on these items
were used to generate the SES variable.
3
  Although we recognize that all of these variables are likely to be endogenous our purpose in including them is to
test the sensitivity of the coefficients on the marijuana use indicators to their inclusion to help us understand the
reliability of estimates obtained in the short form models.


                                                         13
past two years (i.e. parental divorce, death in the family, school change, serious illness), and

indicator of whether the student had ever been offered drugs at school, a baseline assessment of

the individual’s risk of dropout, and an indicator for whether the student had initiated cigarette

consumption in the 8th grade.

        One of the principal advantages associated with using the NELS data is the wealth of

information on the characteristics of the respondent’s school, which enable us to develop fairly

reasonable proxies for school quality that are known to have a statistical association with student

achievement (e.g. Lee and Bryk, 1989; Card and Krueger, 1992). In all of our analyses we

include measures of percent of the student body that is white, the percent of the student body

receiving free or reduced-price lunches, the percent of 10th graders in the 1988-1989 school year

that dropped out by 1990, the minimum salary paid to teachers in the school, the type of school

(i.e., Catholic, other private, public), and a measure of the urbanicity of the school location.

        For the purposes of testing the exogeneity of marijuana use, various price and policy

variables that have been shown to be important for predicting marijuana use are merged into the

NELS based on the county and state fipscodes of the respondent’s address. Specific variables

used as instruments include the geometric mean price of an ounce of commercial grade

marijuana, the maximum fine and minimum jail time statutorily imposed for marijuana

possession offences involving 10 grams of marijuana, and state decriminalization status.

Information on the price of marijuana is available for 19 cities using various publications of the

Drug Enforcement Agency’s Office of Intelligence or Intelligence Division.4 Given that missing

data is reported for many regions in specific quarters, regression techniques are used to impute

quarterly prices from 1985 through 2000. These imputed prices are then matched to students

4
  The name of the publication including the price data has changed over time. In 1990, the publication was entitled,
“Illicit Drug Wholesale/Retail Price Report.” Price information for wholesale and retail level sinsemilla marijuana
is also available in this report.

based on the student’s proximity to one of the satellite offices of the 19 division offices.

Statutory penalty information (i.e. minimum jail, maximum fine and state decriminalization

status) was obtained through original legal research conducted by the MayaTech Corporation for

the purposes of this project.

        The 10th grade analyses use data on all students surveyed in 1990 (10th grade) who had

complete information on standardized test scores and had responded to questions pertaining to

marijuana use in the 10th grade. For the DD analysis, the sample is further restricted to students

that were still enrolled in school in 1992 (12th grade), had complete information on 12th grade test

scores and marijuana use, and who did not use marijuana during the 10th grade year. Table 1

provides descriptive statistics for the samples used in the 10th grade and DD analyses. The

means presented in Table 1 and all estimates presented in this paper are weighted so that the

sample is nationally representative. The 10th grade sample includes 10,018 individuals. A sizable

number of observations are lost from the original sample due to missing values. In an effort to

maintain the sample size we have imputed values for some of the individual and school

characteristics.5 In such cases, we include the measure with imputed values and a dummy

variable indicating observations for which the value was imputed. We, however, do not impute

values for the main variables of interest, test scores or marijuana use.

        As shown in Table 1, only 7.2% of our 10th grade sample has reported use of marijuana in

the past 30 days. Annual prevalence among these 10th graders, which can be calculated by

summing up the last three components of the MJ Index (past year use, past month use, 3+ times

in the past month), is equal to 13.3%. These prevalence rates are slightly lower than the annual

Survey, the first year in which data on the 10th graders was collected. These differences may be

due to differences in sampling, however, since the MTF does not include youths from schools in

each state in each year. Table 1 also shows that 12.1% of the nonusers in 10th grade initiated use

by 12th grade.

        Table 2 provides a preliminary look at the relationship between marijuana use and test

scores for our sample of 10th graders. The first row shows average 10th grade composite, math

and reading test scores for the full sample. It then shows how these average test scores vary by

marijuana use involvement. The difference in test scores across use categories is statistically

significant. Specifically, we find that those individuals reporting having never used marijuana in

their lifetime (MJ index = 0) have higher average test scores across all tests. Average test scores

generally decline as marijuana involvement increases, with the exception of lifetime users, who

have lower test scores than respondents reporting use of marijuana in the past year and the past

month. Given that our measure of lifetime use represents those that reported use in their lifetime,

but not in the past year, this may be picking up the negative effect of being an early experimenter

with marijuana. Heavier marijuana users who report use on three or more occasions in the past

month have lower test scores than non-users, past year users, and past month users for all three

scores. Only lifetime users have lower test scores, and this is only for math and the composite

test score.

        If we simply look at mean test scores by marijuana prevalence in the past thirty days, we

again see that marijuana use is associated with lower test scores across all tests, although the

differences between users and nonusers are not as large in absolute magnitude as those seen

between never users and heavy users in the previous rows. Although the differences in mean test

scores are suggestive, there are numerous confounding factors that may be generating these




                                                 16
differences. In this next section we consider the extent to which these observed trends remain

once confounding factors have been accounted for.

V. Results

       We begin our exploration of the relationship between cognitive ability and marijuana use

using simple OLS estimation of various forms of equation (1). Table 3 presents results from

models examining performance on composite, math, and reading tests using three alternative

measures of marijuana use. All models are weighted and adjust for the clustering observations at

the school level using the svyreg command in STATA 7.0.

       The results presented in Panel A of Table 3 represent the short form specification of our

10th grade model.   The first three columns present results of different marijuana use measures

on the combined score for all the standardized tests, while the next three show results of these

same marijuana use measures on standardized math scores and the final three show results on the

standardized reading scores. In columns labeled “M1” the marijuana use index is entered

linearly into the model, and in columns labeled “M2” it is entered as a series of dummy

variables, with nonuse as the omitted category. Finally in columns labeled “M3” a simple

dichotomous indicator of marijuana use in the past 30 days is used. All models in Panel A

include as additional controls age, race, gender, socioeconomic status, number of siblings,

religiousity, single parent household indicator, type of high school program, school ethnic

composition, percent of students receiving reduced or free lunches, minimum salary paid to

teachers, private school indicators and a measure of urbanicity of the school.

       The results in Panel A are consistent with the literature. Generally we show a negative

and statistically significant association between marijuana use and test scores regardless of how

marijuana use and test scores are measured. When entered linearly, our marijuana index shows a




                                                17
smaller association than implied by either the series of dummy variables (M2) or our indicator of

use in the previous thirty days (M3). The results presented in the columns labeled M2 suggest

that the relationship between marijuana use and test scores is likely to be nonlinear, with

experimenters (lifetime users) and heavy users (3+ times in the past 30 days) having an even

lower test score than past year users for all three test scores. All marijuana users, regardless of

their level of involvement, have lower scores on average than nonusers, however, as all of the

dummy variables are negative and statistically different from zero. When only use in the past

thirty days is considered (M3), we see that current marijuana users have lower scores, with their

marijuana use influencing their math score more than reading scores.

          A Hausman test is used to test the exogeneity of the marijuana use index and the

dichotomous indicator of use in the past 30 days. Instruments for this test include the geometric

mean price of an ounce of commercial grade marijuana, an indicator for decriminalization, the

maximum fine and minimum jail time statutorily imposed for possession of 10 grams of

marijuana. We verified the validity of these instruments using an overidentification test.6 The

computed test statistic for the Hausman tests of the marijuana index and 30-day prevalence

measure were 0.24 and 0.31, showing that we could not reject the exogeneity of either of these

measures. We therefore conclude that the single-equation estimates presented in Table 3 do not

suffer from a structural endogeneity bias.

          Although the inclusion of these marijuana use measures in the test score equations may

    not generate bias due to structural endogeneity, bias may still exist due to omitted confounding

    factors. As was described earlier, one way of dealing with this problem is to include observable

    aspects of potential confounding factors directly in the model. In Panel B of Table 3 we adopt


6
  The Hansen J statistic for the overidentifcation test was 3.388 (p-value= 0.495) in the model with the marijuana
index treated as endogenous and 3.115 (p-value=0.539) in the model with the 30-day prevalence measure.


                                                         18
 this approach to the problem and include as additional regressors indicators of early school

 performance (base year grades), school attachment (time spent doing homework in 8th grade,

 hours worked, 8th grade risk of dropping out of school), general tastes for deviance (use of

 cigarettes in 8th grade, 10th grade use of alcohol, 10th grade frequency of binge drinking, 8th

 grade index of negative behavior), and a measure of general life stress that captures the number

 of stressful events that occurred between 8th and 10th grade.

       The inclusion of these additional regressors eliminates the association between marijuana

 use and performance on standardized tests. The marijuana use index (M1) and indicator of use

 in the past thirty days (M3) become positive and statistically insignificant in all three test score

 equations. When the marijuana use index is entered as a series of dummy variables (M2), only

 the indicator for lifetime use is negative and statistically significant, but this appears to be

 driven by an association with performance on the math test. The association is not statistically

 significant for reading tests. Additional sensitivity analyses conducted on the long form

 specification reveal that the main variables reducing the association between marijuana use and

 test scores are deviance measures (10th grade alcohol use, frequency of binge drinking and

 index of negative behaviors), base year grades, and school attachment measures (hours spent on

 homework and risk of drop out in the 8th grade) suggesting that these variables capture

 important aspects of unobserved heterogeneity that attenuate the relationship.

       One interpretation of the findings presented in Panel B of Table 3 is that unobserved

heterogeneity causes a spurious correlation between marijuana use and measures of cognitive

functioning and that no real association exists. This is entirely plausible. However, one must be

careful drawing such a conclusion from the evidence presented in Panel B, as the inclusion of

these additional endogenous variables in the long form model may cause OLS methods to




                                                  19
generate biased estimates. The nature of this bias cannot be precisely determined because of the

different dimensions of unobserved heterogeneity that appear to attenuate the relationship.

       We therefore also explore the robustness of these findings using an alternative approach

for dealing with unobserved heterogeneity: difference-in-difference modeling.        The primary

advantage of this approach is that it enables us to control for unobserved factors without

generating biased coefficient estimates. However, it is limited in that it can only account for

unobservable factors that do not change over time.

       In Table 4 we take a preliminary look at the average change in test scores for the

combined, math and reading scores by level of marijuana use in the 10th grade. Although there

was a slight negative change on average in the composite test score between 10th and 12th grade,

the students on average saw an increase in their math and reading scores. When we look at the

relative changes in test scores by level of use, we see that individuals who used marijuana

monthly or more frequently in the 10th grade had smaller changes in math scores and larger

changes in reading scores on average. These differences in average changes in test scores are not

statistically significant from each other in the case of the marijuana use index, but they are in the

case of our measure of thirty-day prevalence. This may be due to the fact that we have so few

observations in the top two use categories of our marijuana use index and that we get more

statistical power by grouping them. If we presume that this is the case, the results in Table 4

suggest that individuals who use marijuana more regularly in 10th grade do relatively poorer on

standardized math tests over time than non-current users, while they do better on reading tests,

suggesting that marijuana use may have differential effects on specific cognitive skills. One

needs to control for other facts that may be confounding these results, however.




                                                 20
        There is a problem when you try to look for the impact of changes in marijuana use over

time when use is measured as a simple dichotomous indicator. Individuals who do not use in

both periods get assigned the same numerical value as individuals who use the substance in both

periods because MJ(t) – MJ (t-1) = 0 in both these cases. To avoid problems with interpretation

and to make sure we focus on the behavior of interest, we narrow our sample to just individuals

who report having never used marijuana in their lifetime in the 10th grade for the DD models. We

then differentiate initiators, or those who reported using marijuana at least once in the past year

in the 12th grade, from non-users, or those who report never using marijuana in the 12th grade.

Table 5 examines the simple changes in mean test scores between 10th and 12th grade for these

two separate groups. Here we see by comparing the average grade 10 score in row (2) to that in

row (1), that on average individuals who initiated marijuana use between 10th and 12th grade

have slightly lower combined, math and reading test scores in the 10th grade than those students

who never initiate marijuana. Furthermore, the change in test scores between 10th and 12th grade

is smaller on average. When we estimate the impact of marijuana use on changes in test scores

(DD estimates) for these simple averages, we find that the only statistically significant difference

in test scores over time is that for math scores. The other differences in changes in test scores are

not statistically significant.

        In Table 6 we repeat the examination of difference in test scores between initiators and

non-users over time, but now we control for other individual and school level factors that are

known to change over time. Results are only shown for math and reading scores given that the

combined test score is a composite of all tests taken and these two tests have previously shown a

potential for a differential relationship with marijuana use.7 In Model 1 we simply examine the


7
  We find a negative but insignificant impact of marijuana initiation on changes in the combined test score. These
results are available from the authors upon request.


                                                        21
impact of being an initiator on changes in test scores, ignoring the level of the individual’s

baseline score. We find that individuals who initiate marijuana between 10th and 12th grade have

significantly lower improvement in standardized math test scores than non-users. In addition we

see a negative association between marijuana initiation and changes in reading scores, but this is

not statistically significant.

        A problem with the results presented in Model 1 is that they ignore the heterogeneity in

individuals’ baseline scores and the possibility of regression to the mean in test scores over time.

Say, for example, that marijuana initiators have higher math test scores to start with. If this is

indeed the case, then there is less room for improvement among marijuana users than non-users

and that would generate a negative result. The results presented in Row (2) of Table 5 do not

actually support this, but to account for the possible confounding effect of regression to the

mean, we include in Model 2 two additional variables. The first is the average score of the

individual’s 10th and 12th grade subject-specific test. We use the average test score across the

two grades as opposed to the individual’s score in 10th grade score to reduce the negative

correlation between change scores and initial values that might exist because of measurement

error in the test score variable. The second term is simply the square of the first term, enabling a

quadratic relationship between changes in test scores and levels of test scores.

        The results presented for Model 2 in Table 6 confirm previous findings. Marijuana

initiators again are found to have lower changes in math scores than non-users. Although the

statistical significance of the effect is reduced slightly in Model 2, the magnitude of the effect

remains relatively unchanged and is surprisingly consistent with the simple average difference-

in-difference results presented in Table 5. Marijuana initiation between 10th and 12th grade is

associated with a 0.65 percentage point smaller change in test scores. Given the average change




                                                 22
in test scores for the sample is 4.415, this represents a 15% reduction. According to a paper by

Murnane et al (1995) this could translate into a reduction in wages six years after high school

from anywhere between 0.5 – 1.9% for those not going on to college. 8 We find no significant

association between marijuana initiation and changes in reading (or composite) test scores.



VI. Conclusions

     The results from all of our models combined suggest that much of the negative association

between marijuana use and cognitive ability appears to be attenuated by individual level factors

that are often not captured in empirical models, particularly individual differences related to

school attachment and general deviance. Results from the long form specification of our model

show that the negative association between marijuana use and test scores disappears when these

additional measures are included in the model in almost all of the models. However, it is

possible that these long form models suffer from endogeneity bias due to the inclusion of the

additional variables. An alternative specification of the model that addresses unobserved

heterogeneity by differencing it out shows that the negative association between marijuana use

and math scores remains. The effect could translate into much as a 2% decline in wages after

high school. (Murnane, Willett and Levy, 1995).

     As we explained previously, there are strengths and weaknesses with each of the approaches

that are employed. The use of a long form method for addressing unobserved heterogeneity

introduces new bias due to endogeneity while DD models cannot account for unobserved

heterogeneity that changes over time. Neither of these methods are perfect. Nonetheless, they


8
 Findings suggest that a 10 point reduction in standardized math score translates to a 7% reduction in wages six
years after high school for men graduating high school in 1980 and not going on to college. The effect of math
scores on wages for females not going on to college was even higher, with a 10 point reduction in math scores
associated with a 19% reduction in wages six years after high school (Table 6, p. 263).


                                                        23
do tell a relatively consistent story in terms of the association between marijuana use and

composite and reading test scores. The association between marijuana use and these measures of

cognitive functioning appear to be explained by third factors. The association between

marijuana use and math scores, however, remains an issue.

       There are at least two limitations of the current study. First, standardized test scores are

used as the only measures of cognitive ability. Test scores may be a weak measure of cognitive

ability for a number of reasons, such as school teacher’s “teaching to the test.” However, we

believe that standardized test scores are a substantially better indicator of cognitive ability than

high school drop out status and are generally free of many of the problems associated with

student grades. Nonetheless, further investigation using alternative measures of schooling

performance is probably warranted.

       Second, the study only considers the short-term effects of teenage marijuana use on

cognitive functioning, examining performance on school tests in one grade and then looking at

changes over a two-year period. The clinical research suggests that the harmful effects of

marijuana use are typically seen in longer-term evaluations. This suggests that the results

obtained in this study showing a short-term impact of marijuana use on test scores probably

underestimate the true effect of marijuana use on cognitive functioning in the long run.
