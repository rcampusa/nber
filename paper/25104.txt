Do Fire Sales Create Externalities?

                                        ABSTRACT

We develop three novel measures of how much of the price impact of their trading different
mutual funds internalize. We show that mutual funds that internalize more of their price impact
hold larger cash buffers and use these buffers more aggressively to accommodate inflows and
outflows. As a result, stocks held by these funds have lower volatility, and flows out of these
funds have smaller spillover effects on other funds holding the same securities. Our results
provide evidence of meaningful fire sale externalities in the mutual fund industry.

       Fire sales are at the center of our understanding of financial stability problems in securities
markets. Instability arises because there are spillover effects: forced sales by one market
participant tighten constraints on others and thereby lead to further forced sales (e.g., Geanakoplos,
2009; Stein, 2012). For instance, redemptions from an open-end mutual fund can force sales of the
fund’s portfolio securities. These sales depress security prices, hurting the performance of other
funds holding the same securities and thus stimulating redemptions at these funds through the
performance-flow relationship. These redemptions lead to further sales, amplifying the initial
shock. The key conceptual feature of such amplification cycles is that they can generate
externalities: if funds internalized the effect of their sales on other funds, they would change their
flow management policies to dampen the feedback effects that arise from their forced trading.

       A large empirical literature documents the existence of some of the main ingredients of the
fire sales mechanism. In instances when forced sales happen, they can result in depressed security
prices (e.g., Coval and Stafford, 2007; Ellul, Jotikasthira and Lundblad, 2011; Greenwood and
Thesmar, 2011; Merrill et. al., 2012; Hau and Lai, 2017; Choi and Shin, 2018). Furthermore, in
these instances, there can be spillovers: depressed prices created by one fund’s sales can affect
other funds holding the same securities (Lou, 2012; Falato et. al., 2016).

       However, the empirical literature has yet to directly address the main conceptual question
about fire sales: is there an externality? In other words, would funds act differently if they cared
more about the spillover effects of their trading? This need not be the case – if spillovers are
infrequent or mild, individual funds will act the same whether they care about other funds or not.
Although the question of whether there are externalities has important implications for both our
conceptual understanding of fire sales and for the regulation of asset managers, it cannot be
answered from the existing literature.

       In this paper, we take on this empirical challenge and provide evidence that mutual funds
do indeed manage their flows differently when they care more about the impact of their trading on
other funds. We construct three novel, theoretically motivated measures of how much of the price
impact of their trading different mutual funds are likely to internalize. We then relate these
measures to funds’ liquidity management policies, the volatility of the securities they hold, and the
spillover effects they impose on each other. We find that funds that internalize more of the price
impact of their trading, which we refer to as high internalization funds, do behave differently from


                                                                                                    1
those that do not, suggesting that there are indeed meaningful fire sale externalities in the mutual
fund industry.

        We begin by writing down a simple model of funds choosing optimal cash buffers and flow
management policies. The model motivates our empirical tests, which we implement by
introducing three new empirical measures of internalization of price impact. These measures are
based on a fund’s incentive to care about the performance of other funds. The first measure
leverages the fact that many portfolio managers manage multiple funds, and therefore care about
the adverse price pressure that trading by one of their funds exerts on their other funds. Our second
measure exploits the idea that a fund may be cautious about exerting price impact when it would
adversely affect other funds managed by the same investment adviser. 1 Our third measure is
similar to the second one, but excludes funds managed by the same portfolio manager to focus on
incentives at the investment adviser level. Throughout our analysis, we use all three internalization
measures, with all three delivering similar results.

        To test the predictions of our model, we use SEC form N-SAR filings to build a novel data
set on the cash holdings of open-end domestic equity mutual funds over the 1994 – 2016 period.
Our first main result concerns how a fund’s management of the inflows and outflows it receives
varies with its internalization. We find that high internalization funds use their cash buffers more
aggressively to accommodate flows. The economic magnitudes are significant. Going from the
25th to 75th percentile of internalization is associated with being 50% more aggressive in using
cash to accommodate fund flows. The magnitude of the effect of internalization is similar to the
impact of asset liquidity on flow management. Our evidence suggests that there are significant
price impact externalities: when a fund internalizes more of the price impact of its trading on other
funds, it follows a different strategy for accommodating inflows and outflows.

        These results are robust to a variety of controls for alternative explanations. Specifically,
we provide evidence that our results cannot be explained by asset liquidity, market timing, fund
strategy, variation in investor clienteles across funds, or manager characteristics.

        To further rule out alternative explanations, we use variation in internalization driven by
two types of structural changes: one at the portfolio manager and one at the investment adviser

1
  Throughout the paper, the phrase “investment adviser” refers to the firm providing investment management services
to the fund, while the phrase “portfolio managers” refers to employees of the investment adviser who are actually
managing the fund.

                                                                                                                 2
level. First, we examine cases in which a fund’s portfolio manager is assigned an additional fund
to manage. The idea is that because fund managers internalize the impact of decisions to trade
across all of their funds, being assigned an additional fund increases internalization. We examine
variation in flow management within the same fund before and after the assignment of the new
fund. After fund managers are assigned a new fund, they become more aggressive in using cash to
accommodate flows into the old fund, consistent with them caring more about the price impact of
their trading because it impacts their new fund.

        The second structural change we investigate is mergers of investment advisers, which
increase our adviser-level measures of internalization. We examine variation in flow management
within target and acquirer funds before and after the merger. After a merger, the same fund
becomes more aggressive in using cash to manage flows, consistent with it caring more about the
price impact of its trading on the funds added through the merger. Our analyses of these two
structural changes give us confidence that we are capturing differences in flow management due
to internalization, not alternative explanations.

        Our second main result is at the stock level. We show that when the same stock is held by
high internalization funds, its realized volatility is lower over the following quarter. High
internalization funds trade less in response to flows, thus reducing the volatility in the stock that is
induced by trade. The magnitude of the effect of internalization is modest in absolute terms, but
significant relative to the total excess volatility that is induced by trading in response to flows
(Greenwood and Thesmar, 2011). Our stock-level analysis suggests that the price impact
externality that funds impose on one another has meaningful consequences for the behavior of
asset prices.

        Our third main result concerns the degree to which flows into one fund impact the
performance of other funds holding the same securities. We show that flows into high
internalization funds exert a smaller spillover effect on the returns of other funds than flows into
low internalization funds. Specifically, we show that when a given fund f’s securities are held by
other funds that internalize more of their price impact, the relationship between flows into these
other funds and f’s returns is diminished because the other funds trade less in response to flows.
In addition, we show that the internalization of other funds holding the same securities impacts
fund f’s overall performance. When holders of the same securities are high internalization funds,


                                                                                                      3
fund f’s returns tend to be higher and less volatile. Thus, the internalization of other funds holding
the same securities aggregates to affect f’s average performance.

        Finally, we examine the relationship between our internalization measures and the fund’s
cash-to-assets ratio. We find that high internalization funds hold larger cash buffers. The
magnitudes are economically significant and comparable to the variation in the cash-to-assets
ratios induced by variation in asset liquidity.

        Overall, our results provide evidence that fire sale externalities operate across equity
mutual funds. Our paper is related to several strands of the literature. First, there is a large
theoretical and empirical literature studying fire sales in debt and equity markets, including
Shleifer and Vishny (1992), Shleifer and Vishny (1997), Coval and Stafford (2007), Ellul,
Jotikasthira and Lundblad (2011), Greenwood and Thesmar (2011), Merrill et. al. (2012), Hau and
Lai (2017), and Choi and Shin (2018). 2 These studies, which frequently examine specific events
to causally identify fire sales, show that funds’ liquidation policies create spillovers: they affect
asset prices and the performance of other funds. For instance, Hau and Lai (2017) show that during
the 2007-2009 financial crisis, funds with high exposure to financial stocks sold nonfinancial
stocks, depressing their prices. In contrast, we are interested in how equilibrium forces determine
liquidation policies in the first place. In particular, we show that when funds internalize more of
their price impact, spillovers are smaller because funds choose different liquidation policies: they
rely more on cash and less on sales of non-cash assets. These results show us that, on average
across our 1994-2016 sample, funds perceive fire sale risk to be significant enough that they act
differently when they internalize their price impact.

        In addition, we contribute to a small but growing literature on the determinants and effects
of mutual fund cash holdings, including Yan (2006), Simutin (2014), and Hanouna, et. al. (2015).
This literature focuses primarily on funds’ market timing ability and the impact of cash holdings
on a fund’s own returns. In contrast, we use cash holdings along with our internalization measures
to empirically explore the extent to which a fund internalizes the price impact it exerts on security
prices and other funds.

  In addition, there is a broader literature on debt and equity market liquidity, including Roll (1984), Amihud and
Mendelsohn (1986), Chordia, Roll, and Subrahmanyam (2001), Amihud (2002), Pastor and Stambaugh (2003),
Longstaff (2004), Acharya and Pedersen (2005), Bao, Pan, and Wang (2011), Dick-Nielsen, Feldhütter, and Lando
(2012), Feldhütter (2012), and many others.

                                                                                                                 4
          The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section I presents a simple model to
 motivate our empirical tests. Section II describes the data. Section III presents our main results,
 and Section IV concludes.

                                                   I. Framework
          This section outlines the economic logic behind our empirical tests.

     A. Model
          We present a stylized model that highlights the intuition behind our empirical tests. For
 expositional simplicity, the benchmark model focuses on how funds manage liquidity to deal with
 outflows. In the appendix, we show that similar comparative statics apply when we write down a
 similar model of how funds deal with inflows. 3

          Suppose there are f = 1,…, F funds, which invest in an illiquid asset and hold some cash
 reserves. Fund f faces uncertain redemptions xf. To obtain simple closed form solutions, we begin
 by assuming that redemptions are perfectly correlated across funds so that xf = x for all f, and that
 redemptions follow an exponential distribution with probability distribution function

g ( x ) λ −1 exp ( −λ −1 x ) . The cumulative distribution function is then G ( x ) =
=                                                                                   1 − exp ( −λ −1 x ) , so

 larger values of λ are associated with a longer right tail for the distribution of redemptions.

          Funds may accommodate redemptions in two ways. First, they may choose to hold cash
 reserves cf. These reserves are liquid claims that are available in elastic supply and that can be sold
 costlessly to meet outflows. Each dollar of cash reserves is associated with carrying cost i. One
 may think of i as the cost to the fund of the tracking error generated by not being fully invested in
 the illiquid asset.

          Second, if it does not have sufficient cash reserves, the fund meets outflows by selling
 quantity s=
           f x f − c f of its illiquid asset holdings. 4 When it does so, the fund incurs liquidation

 costs that depend on the aggregate sales of the illiquid asset by all funds. We think of these


 3
   The two problems differ in that the treatment of inflows in a purely ex-post problem: once a fund receives an inflow
 of cash, it must decide what to do with it. In contrast, the treatment of outflows requires an ex-ante choice of a cash
 buffer.
 4
   Because this is a simple one-shot model, where cash serves no other purpose, the policy of first using cash reserves
 to meet redemptions and then selling the illiquid asset is optimal.


                                                                                                                      5
liquidation costs as arising from the fact that sales temporarily move prices – that is, we think of
the fundamental value of the illiquid asset as being fixed, but its market price as depending on
aggregate sales by funds. For simplicity, we assume that the liquidation cost per dollar is

l   ( ∑ s ) / F , where l indexes the illiquidity of the asset.
        f   f
                                                                        5
                                                                            This formulation implies that there are

spillovers for l > 0. When l > 0, sales by one fund affect the liquidation costs of other funds. As
we will see, however, l > 0 is not sufficient for funds that internalize more of their price impact to
act differently than other funds. We normalize liquidation costs by the total number of funds F so
that aggregate liquidation costs across funds do not mechanically change with F.

            We start by solving for optimal cash holdings in two settings. First, we consider the private
market equilibrium, in which each individual fund wishes to minimize its total liquidity
management costs, including the carrying costs of cash, taking as given the actions of other funds:

                                                    l            
                             E  L f=
                                      ic f + Ex  s f
                                                    F
                                                          ∑ (  s
                                                              h h 
                                                                  
                                                                    )
                                                        l
                                                        (       )
                                                ∞
                                     = ic f + ∫ s f
                                                cf      F
                                                          ∑ h sh dG ( x ) .
            Second, we consider the solution that would be chosen by a planner coordinating across
funds. The planner’s objective is to minimize the sum of the expected liquidity management costs
across all funds:

                                         F  ic f + s f l ( Fs f ) dG ( x )  .
                                                       ∞
                               E  ∑=
                                    L                ∫c f F
                                  f f
                                                                              

Note that this formulation of the planner’s problem does not imply a welfare statement. For there
to be a welfare loss from the behavior of low internalization funds in general equilibrium, the
liquidation costs borne by mutual funds when they sell illiquid assets must not simply be a transfer
to an outside liquidity provider. 6 Moreover, our formulation of both the individual fund’s problem
and the planner’s problem only focuses on the costs of liquidity management. In reality, a fund’s



5
  Funds can be liquidity demanders or liquidity suppliers (Anand et. al., 2018); we are focused on liquidity demand.
6
 For example, losses and redemptions by high yield mutual funds can negatively affect the investment of speculative-
grade firms (Chernenko and Sunderam, 2012). Even highly rated firms that borrow in money markets may find it
difficult to immediately substitute to other sources of financing when money market mutual funds experience large
redemptions (Chernenko and Sunderam, 2014).

                                                                                                                  6
behavior is determined by many other considerations, most notably the risk and return of the
illiquid securities it holds.

        Proposition 1 characterizes the symmetric equilibrium, obtained by taking the first order
condition with respect to cf and imposing symmetry across funds so that c=
                                                                         f c=
                                                                            h c* for all f, h.

Proposition 1. Optimal cash holdings in the symmetric private market equilibrium are given by

                                     i F 
                              −λ ln            if i < λl ( F + 1) / F
                                      λl F + 1 
                            *
                           c =                                           .
                                      0          if i ≥ λ l ( F + 1) / F
                              

The planner chooses cash holdings of

                                     i 
                            **−λ ln       if i < 2λl .
                           c =       2λl 
                                    0       if i ≥ 2λl
                              

Proof: All proofs are given in the Appendix.

        Intuitively, in both cases, there is a tradeoff between the carrying costs of cash reserves and
the expected liquidation costs of selling the illiquid asset. Cash holdings are zero if the carrying
costs of cash are high relative to liquidation costs, which are determined by the size of the right
tail of redemptions (λ) and the illiquidity of the asset (l). In the limit, as redemptions become large
( λ → ∞ ) or the asset becomes very illiquid ( l → ∞ ), cash holdings become large. In contrast, for
small values of λ and l, cash holdings go to zero in both the private market and planner solutions.

        The key difference between the individual fund’s problem and the planner’s problem is the
following. In the private market equilibrium, an individual fund does not internalize the positive
effect its cash holdings have on the marginal liquidation costs faced by other funds, while the
planner does. As such, funds hold more cash in the planner’s solution: c** ≥ c* .

        The extent to which the planner’s solution differs from the private market’s depends on the
parameters. There is no difference between the planner’s solution and the private market solution
when λ and l are sufficiently small – when the probability of large redemptions is small or the non-
cash asset is very liquid, both solutions involve no cash holdings. If l > 0, λ > 0, and 2λl ≤ i , there
will be spillovers across funds – funds will sell the illiquid asset when faced with redemptions and


                                                                                                      7
their sales will affect the liquidation costs of other funds. However, there will not be an externality
– the spillovers are small enough that the planner chooses the same outcome as the private market.

        In contrast, when λ and l are large (i.e., 2 λ l > i), so that spillovers across funds are frequent
and costly, the planner’s solution involves larger cash holdings than the private market’s. In
addition, the difference between the planner’s problem and the private market solution is large
when F is large. Intuitively, when there are many funds, none of the funds internalize the effect
that their forced sales will have on the other funds.

       Our empirical internalization measures aim to capture the idea that some funds put a
positive weight on the price impact of their trading on other funds. A simple way to capture this in
the model is to think of fund f as minimizing an objective that puts weight α on the planner’s
objective and weight (1-α) on the objective in the fully private market:

                                                                              l

                                                                                      ∞
                                                                          +       ∫       s f (1 − α )               2        dG ( x ) .
                                                                              F   cf                        h h           f   
For 0 < α < 1, the fund internalizes the positive effect its cash holdings have on the liquidation
costs faced by other funds, but not as much as the planner. Proposition 2 shows that the properties
of the symmetric equilibrium vary intuitively with the level of internalization.

Proposition 2. Optimal cash holdings in the internalization equilibrium are given by

                                                   i 
                                     ***    −λ ln  η  if i < λl / η

                                                  0      if i ≥ λl / η
                                            


                                               η=
                                                       ( (1 − α ) + α F ) F       .
                                                    (1 − α )( F + 1) + 2α F 2
We have c*** = c* when α = 0 and c*** = c** when α = 1. In addition, we have dc*** / dα ≥ 0.

       Cash holdings are lowest in the private market equilibrium where α = 0 and highest in the
planner’s solution where α = 1. In between, they increase monotonically with α. The extent to
which the solution with α > 0 differs from the private market equilibrium with α = 0 again depends
on the parameters λ and l. When large redemptions are infrequent and the illiquid asset is relatively
liquid (i.e., λ and l are sufficiently small), both solutions again involve no cash holdings.



                                                                                                                                      8
               With this set up in place, we can now derive the comparative statics that motivate our
   empirical tests. We first show that the sensitivity of the change in cash holdings to flows is
   increasing in internalization. The change in cash holdings in response to redemptions x is given by

=∆c max {c*** − x, 0} . The proposition then characterizes the covariance between the change in

   cash and flows, which are the negative of redemptions -x.

   Proposition 3. The covariance between the change in cash holdings and flows is given by

                                         Cov ( − x, ∆c ) =− exp ( −c*** )(1 + c*** ) + 1 > 0

   if i < λl/η and is zero otherwise. This covariance is increasing with internalization:
   dCov ( − x, ∆c ) / dα > 0 if i < λl/η.

               Intuitively, redemptions x are negatively correlated with the change in cash holdings: the
   larger the redemption, the more that cash holdings fall. Thus, flows –x are positively correlated
   with cash holdings, and the strength of this correlation increases with internalization. Funds that
   internalize more of their price impact will meet redemptions with more cash and fewer sales of the
   illiquid asset. This is a key prediction of the model that we will test in our empirical work. 7 Again,
   this is only the case when λ and l are large (i.e., λ l/η > i), so that spillovers across funds are
   sufficiently frequent and costly. If λ and l are small but nonzero, there are spillovers across funds,
   but they are too rare and infrequent for high internalization funds to behave differently.

               Next, we compute the impact of flows faced by other funds on fund f’s liquidation costs.
   To vary other funds’ flows without varying f’s, we loosen the assumption that redemptions are
   perfectly correlated across funds. We instead assume that redemptions for each fund h are

                                            g ( xh ) λ −1 exp −λ −1 xh . Let − x− f=
   independently exponentially distributed: =                                       (        )                 ∑   h≠ f
                                                                                                                          − xh be the

   total flows out of all funds except fund f. In addition, let

                                                                      l
                                                                          ( ∑ s ) dG ( x ) ...dG ( x
                                                      ∞    ∞

   7
       It is also the case that the sensitivity of cash to flows increases with illiquidity ( dCov ( − x, ∆c ) / dl   > 0 ), consistent
   with what we find in the data.

                                                                                                                                     9
be the liquidation costs incurred by fund f in the internalization equilibrium. Proposition 4
characterizes the covariance between f’s liquidation costs and flows into other funds.

Proposition 4. The covariance between flows into other funds and fund f’s liquidation costs is

               (          )
negative: Cov − x− f , L***
                         f  < 0 if i < λl/η. Because liquidation costs lower fund returns, the

covariance between flows into other funds and fund f’s returns is positive. This covariance gets

                                      (
weaker with internalization: dCov − x− f , L***
                                             f   )
                                                / dα > 0 if i < λl/η. Moreover, this comparative

static obtains holding fixed f’s own cash holdings.

        Intuitively, larger redemptions from other funds x-f cause them to sell more of the illiquid
asset, raising liquidation costs for fund f. Thus, flows –x-f are negatively correlated with liquidation
costs for fund f. If λ and l are sufficiently large, the more other funds internalize their price impact,
the less they sell the illiquid asset when faced with flows –x-f, weakening this correlation. These
comparative statics obtain holding fixed fund f’s cash holdings, showing that they are driven by
the behavior of other funds, not by the way f’s behavior changes as we change internalization.

        Finally, we relate internalization to overall measures of fund performance: the mean and
variance of the liquidation costs the fund incurs. Again, let L***
                                                                f  be the liquidation costs incurred

by fund f in the internalization equilibrium.

Proposition 5. The expected liquidation costs faced by fund f are decreasing in internalization:

        f  / dα < 0 if i < λl/η. In addition, the variance of liquidation costs is decreasing in
dE  L*** 

                           f  / dα < 0 if i < λl/η. Because liquidation costs lower fund returns, fund
internalization: dVar  L*** 

f’s expected return is increasing in internalization and the volatility of its returns is decreasing in
internalization. Moreover, these comparative statics obtain holding fixed f’s own cash holdings.

        Intuitively, if λ and l are sufficiently large, when other funds internalize their price impact
more, they use cash to meet redemptions rather than selling the illiquid asset. As a result, fund f
faces lower and less volatile costs when it sells its holdings of the illiquid asset. Again, these
comparative statics are driven by the behavior of other funds, not by the way f’s behavior changes
as we change internalization.




                                                                                                      10
    B. Measures of Internalization

        Throughout the paper, we use three empirical proxies for internalization. We describe the
construction of these variables in more detail in Section II below. Our focus here is on the
economic motivation for examining each variable. The common thread in our measures is that they
capture cases where funds face incentives to care about the price impact they exert on other funds.

        Our first internalization measure leverages the fact that many mutual fund managers
manage multiple funds. Our Manager internalize variable measures the overlap in portfolio
holdings across multiple funds managed by a given portfolio manager. The idea here is that fund
managers care about the joint performance of all of the funds they manage. Thus, managers will
be reluctant to trade if the price impact generated by the trading of one of their funds adversely
affects the performance of their other funds. The scope for such adverse impact is greater when
portfolio holdings overlap a lot across the manager’s funds. In the model, this overlap is assumed,
since there is only one illiquid asset.

        Our two other measures of internalization are based on the idea that investment advisers
may create incentives for funds to partially internalize their price impact on other funds and
accounts under their management. This kind of internalization is sometimes incentivized by the
compensation contracts of fund managers. 8 For instance, according to the prospectus of
Metropolitan West Funds, “Many portfolio managers participate in equity incentives based on
overall firm performance of the TCW Group and its affiliates, through ownership or participation
in restricted unit plans that vest over time or unit appreciation plans of the Adviser's parent
company.” 9 Similarly, the prospectus of Oppenheimer Rising Dividends Fund states, “the long-
term award component consists of grants in the form of appreciation rights in regard to the common
                                                              10
stock of the Sub-Advisers holding company parent.”                 Thus, if a fund holds assets that are also
held by other funds run by the same investment adviser, then the fund may be more likely to
internalize the price impact of its trading on those funds, than on funds run by other investment
advisers. Our Adviser internalize measures capture the overlap in portfolio holdings across
multiple funds managed by the same investment adviser.

                                                      II. Data
     A. Cash Holdings

         We combine novel data on the cash holdings of open-end mutual funds with several other
data sets. Our primary data comes from the SEC form N-SAR filings. 11 These forms are filed semi-
annually by all mutual funds and, among other things, provide data on asset composition, including
holdings of cash and cash substitutes. Specifically, we measure holdings of cash and cash
substitutes as

         cash (item 74A) + repurchase agreements (74B) + short-term debt securities other than
         repurchase agreements (74C) + other investments (74I) – securities-lending collateral.

Short-term debt securities have remaining maturities of less than a year and consist mostly of US
Treasury Bills and commercial paper.

         The other investments category (74I) consists mostly of investments in money market
mutual funds (MMMFs), 12 other mutual funds, loan participations, and physical commodities. The
last three apply mostly to funds of funds, loan funds, and commodity funds that are excluded from
our sample of domestic equity funds. Using hand-collected data, we have examined the
composition of the other investments category for a random sample of 320 funds for which other
investments accounted for at least 10% of total net assets. The mean and median fractions of
MMMFs in other investments were 75% and 100%. Holdings of other mutual funds accounted for
most of the remaining value of other investments. We use our security-level holdings data,
described below, to subtract holdings of long-term mutual funds from other investments.
Otherwise, we treat the other investments category as consisting entirely of MMMFs. This should
only introduce measurement error into our main dependent variable, and thus inflate our standard
errors, biasing us against finding statistically significant results. 13


11
   We discuss parsing of N-SAR filings in the Internet Appendix.
12
   Holdings of MMMFs are reported either under short-term debt securities other than repurchase agreements (74C),
based on the underlying assets of these funds being short-term debt securities, or alternatively under other investments
(74I), since MMMFs do not naturally fit in the other categories.
13
   The CRSP Mutual Fund Database includes a variable called per_cash that is supposed to report the fraction of the
fund’s portfolio invested in cash and equivalents. This variable appears to be a rather noisy proxy for the cash-to-
assets ratio. Aggregate cash holdings of all long-term mutual funds in CRSP track aggregate holdings of liquid assets
of long-term mutual funds as reported by the Investment Company Institute (ICI) until 2007, but the relationship
breaks down after that. By 2014, there is a gap of more than $400 billion, or more than 50% of the aggregate cash


                                                                                                                    12
        Cash holdings reported on a fund’s balance sheet include cash collateral received when
lending out portfolio securities. This cash collateral is usually legally segregated and not available
to meet redemption requests. We use a Python script to extract the amount of securities lending
collateral from N-CSR filings, and subtract securities lending collateral from the gross value of
cash holdings reported in N-SAR filings.

        Our dependent variable is thus the sum of cash and cash equivalents, net of securities
lending collateral, scaled by TNA (item 74T). We winsorize this cash-to-assets ratio at the 1st and
99th percentiles.

        In addition to data on asset composition, form N-SAR contains data on fund flows and
investment practices. Gross and net fund flows for each month since the last semi-annual filing are
reported in item 28. Item 70 reports indicators for whether the fund uses various types of
derivatives, borrows, lends out its securities, or engages in short sales.

    B. Link to CRSP Mutual Funds and Thomson Reuters Mutual Fund Holdings Databases

        We link our N-SAR data to the CRSP Mutual Fund and Thomson Reuters Mutual Fund
Holdings Databases for additional fund characteristics and security-level holdings data that we use
to construct our measures of internalization. Our matching algorithm is described in detail in the
Internet Appendix; here we provide a brief overview. In linking N-SAR data with CRSP, we
leverage the CRSP_CIK_MAP file provided by WRDS. This file maps CRSP share class
identifiers (crsp_fundno) to the CIK of the trust offering the fund and, for a subset of funds, to the
fund’s SEC series identifier that is used after 2006. Given that the series identifier is not used prior
to 2006, our matching algorithm proceeds in two main steps. First, we try to match funds based on
their series identifier. Second, prior to 2006 or when matching based on series identifier is not
successful, we match based on the trust’s CIK and fund’s TNA. Specifically, we first link each
fund-date observation in N-SAR to all fund-date observations in CRSP that share the same trust
CIK as the fund in N-SAR. We then keep the closest match in CRSP in terms of TNA provided
that the difference in TNA is less than 1% or the difference in TNA is less than 10% and fund
names in CRSP and N-SAR match exactly. The advantage of matching based on TNA as opposed


holdings reported by ICI. At a more granular level, we calculated cash holdings from the bottom up using security-
level data from the SEC form N-CSR for a random sample of 200 funds. The correlation between the true value of the
cash-to-assets ratio computed using N-CSR data and our N-SAR based proxy is 0.93. The correlation between the true
value and CRSP is 0.57.

                                                                                                               13
to fund names is that we do not have to deal with alternative abbreviations and conventions about
the reporting of fund names in CRSP versus SEC. Finally, we use MFLINKS to link N-SAR to
Thomson Reuters.

           After linking N-SAR data to CRSP and Thomson Reuters, we limit the sample to open-end
domestic equity funds. 14 These are the funds for which we can fairly accurately measure
internalization and portfolio illiquidity. The effect of internalization on flow management should
be even stronger for funds that invest in less liquid securities, such as emerging market equity
funds and corporate bond funds. However, there is less data available on the security holdings of
these funds and their liquidity.

       C. Portfolio Holdings
           Our key explanatory variables of interest are measures of internalization that are based on
the overlap in holdings between a given fund and either (i) other funds managed by the same
portfolio manager or (ii) aggregate assets under management of the fund’s investment adviser. To
make sure that we have the most comprehensive and up-to-date data on portfolio holdings, we
combine mutual fund holdings data from Thomson Reuters and CRSP. For each fund-quarter
observation, we first check if one source has more recent data. If for a given fund-quarter, both
sources report as of the same date, we use the source with the larger number of positions; otherwise
we default to Thomson Reuters. Overall, 59% of our fund-quarter observations of portfolio
holdings are from Thomson Reuters, and 41% are from CRSP.

       D. Internalization

           Using our combined CRSP/Thomson Reuters holdings data, we construct three measures
of fund internalization, referred to in the tables as Fund Internalize. All three measures are value-
weighted portfolio averages of the product of a) a fund’s holdings of a security scaled by the
security’s average daily dollar trading volume, and b) holdings of the security by the fund’s
affiliates, also scaled by the security’s trading volume:

                                                       𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓,𝑠𝑠     𝑉𝑉𝑠𝑠 𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎

     Domestic equity funds are identified based on CRSP objective codes that begin with ED.


                                                                                                   14
where f indexes funds, s indexes securities, Vf,s is the value of fund f’s holdings of security s,
Vsaffiliates is the value of holdings of security s by affiliates of f that f has an incentive to care about,

and 𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑠𝑠 is the trading volume. 15

         Internalization thus depends both on the liquidity of the fund’s holdings, measured as
position size relative to trading volume, and the overlap in holdings with affiliated entities. Where
the three internalization measures differ is in the definition of the affiliates that may be affected by
the fund’s trading decisions.

         The first measure, Manager internalize, defines affiliates as other funds managed by the
same portfolio manager:

                                                                         𝑉𝑉𝑓𝑓,𝑠𝑠      ∑𝑗𝑗,𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚(𝑗𝑗)=𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚𝑚(𝑓𝑓),𝑗𝑗≠𝑓𝑓 𝑉𝑉𝑗𝑗,𝑠𝑠

                                                                     𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑠𝑠              𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑉𝑠𝑠
                                                     𝑠𝑠


The measure thus captures the overlap in portfolio holdings across multiple funds managed by the
same portfolio manager. Information on the identity of fund portfolio managers is from
Morningstar. For funds with multiple portfolio managers, we split total holdings of each security
equally among the fund’s managers.

        The other two measures of internalization define affiliates at the investment adviser level.
Investment advisers’ aggregate holdings are from the Thomson Reuters 13F database. 16 The 13F
filings include holdings of stocks both by other mutual funds managed by the same investment
adviser, and by hedge funds, separate accounts, and any other affiliates managed by the fund’s
investment adviser.

       Our second measure, Adviser internalize, uses the difference between adviser’s 13F
holdings of a security and fund holdings to measure the scope for fund trading to impose price
impact externalities on the affiliated entities:




15
   Because it requires data on trading volume, which we measure as average daily trading volume over the quarter,
calculation of internalization is limited to CRSP stocks. We therefore restrict the sample to observations for which the
ratio of the value of stocks in CRSP to the fund’s TNA (from form N-SAR) is within the [3/4, 4/3] interval.

   To help address the data quality issues with the recent updates of the Thomson Reuters 13F data, after June 2013
we supplement Thomson Reuters 13F data with WRDS 13F holdings data. See WRDS Research Note Regarding

       The third measure of internalization takes the difference between the investment adviser’s

By excluding holdings by all funds managed by the same portfolio manager, this measure zeroes
in on adviser-level internalization that is incentivized through compensation linked to the
investment adviser’s overall performance.

        Because the distribution of raw internalization measures is highly skewed and can be
affected by time series changes in data quality, we convert raw internalization measures into decile
ranks within each quarter. This has the further advantage of easing the interpretation of the
economic magnitudes.

        To analyze the effect of internalization on stock price volatility, we construct stock-level
versions of our internalization measures. Referred to as StockInternalize, these measures are value-
weighted averages of Fund Internalize, calculated across all funds holding a given stock. Since
fund internalization is expressed as decile rank within each quarter, a unit change in stock
internalization indicates that all funds holding the stock belong to a higher decile of fund
internalization. Finally, to analyze spillovers across funds, we construct a fund-level measure of
co-holder internalization, CoHolderInternalize. This is the value-weighted average of
StockInternalize across all stocks in a fund’s portfolio, where StockInternalize is calculated while
excluding the fund in question. Thus, CoHolderInternalize measures the propensity of other funds
holding the same securities to internalize price impact. In constructing both StockInternalize and
CoHolderInternalize, we set the internalization of index funds to zero because these funds are
constrained to holding the index and cannot use cash to accommodate fund flows.

        Where does variation in our measures come from? Our measures rely on the size of the
positions individual funds hold in particular stocks. As such, the primary determinant of our


                                                                                                                                16
measures is likely to be the distribution across fund managers of expectations of risk and return
for each stock. If a manager manages two funds and has strong, positive expectations for a stock,
they will likely hold the stock in both funds, driving up their Manager internalize. In addition, the
distribution of fund objectives is likely to play an important role. If a manager manages two large-
cap value funds, overlap is likely to be higher than if they manage a large-cap value and a small-
cap value fund. Overall, we think the distribution of subjective expected returns and the
distribution of fund objectives are unlikely to be correlated with other explanations for our results.
Below we perform a detailed examination of alternative explanations that supports this conclusion.
Furthermore, in Tables 5 and 6 we exploit variation in internalization due to a) portfolio managers
being assigned an additional fund to manage and b) mergers of investment advisers.

   E. Summary Statistics

       Our final data set is a semi-annual fund-level panel that combines the N-SAR data with
additional fund information from CRSP, portfolio holdings from CRSP and Thomson Reuters,
portfolio manager identities from Morningstar, and investment adviser holdings from Thomson
Reuters 13F data. The sample period is January 1994 – December 2016. To make sure that our
results are not affected by fund incubation (Evans 2010), we restrict the sample to funds that are
at least two years old and that have real TNA of at least $10 million, measured in 2016 dollars.

       Figure 1 plots the number of funds and their TNA over time. The average half-year period
has 945 funds with aggregate TNA of $1,748 billion. Table 1 reports basic summary statistics for
funds in our data. Actively managed funds are in Panel A, index funds are in Panel B. Our sample
consists of 37,707 observations on actively managed funds and 5,402 observations on index funds,
which we use for placebo tests. The median actively managed has TNA of almost $350 million,
of which about 2.76% is held in cash and equivalents.

       There is significant variation across funds in the cash-to-assets ratio: the interquartile range
for actively managed funds is 1.15%-5.26%. Index funds hold significantly less cash (the median
is 0.36%) and have a significantly narrower interquartile range of 0.10%-1.79%. Consistent with
an aggregate shift towards index funds, the median actively managed fund in our data experiences
quarterly fund flows of -1.38%, while the median index fund experiences quarterly fund flows of
0.76%. Figure 2 shows the distribution of the cash-to-assets ratio for funds in our sample. The
distribution has shifted to the left and compressed over time. The 50th percentile has declined from


                                                                                                    17
5.62% in 1994H1 to 1.68% in 2016H2, while the interquartile range has shrank from 8.90% to
3.50% over the same period.

        Appendix Table A1 provides formal definitions for the construction of all variables used
in the analysis.

                                                    III. Results
        We now present tests of the empirical predictions outlined above.

     A. Liquidity Management through Cash Holdings

        To ensure that our tests have power, we begin by analyzing the baseline flow management
behavior of mutual funds. We show that cash holdings play an important role in the way mutual
funds manage inflows and outflows, which means that studying the behavior of cash holdings is a
powerful way to detect differences in flow management across funds. We observe fund flows every
month, but only observe funds’ cash holdings every six months. Therefore, in Table 2 we estimate
regressions of the change in a fund’s cash-to-assets ratio over a six-month reporting period on the
net flows received during each of those six months:

                      Cash        Cash                            5

                               −       
                      TNA  f ,m  TNA  f ,m −6
                                                 = α obj ( f ), m
                                                                  + ∑
                                                                    s =0
                                                                         β s ⋅ Flows f ,m − s + ε f ,m           (1)


Fund flows are winsorized at the 5th and 95th percentiles; results are similar when winsorizing at
the 1st and 99th percentiles.

        Columns (1)-(3) examine actively managed funds. In Column (1), the coefficient β0 = 18.51
is statistically and economically significant. Flows equal to 100% of assets increase the fund’s
cash-to-assets ratio by 18.51% (percentage points). For reference, the standard deviation of
monthly fund flows is 2.5%. The coefficient β0 shows that an economically significant portion of
flows is accommodated through cash holdings. Even though stocks are fairly liquid and a month
is a relatively long period, funds do not simply scale their portfolios up and down in response to
fund flows. Instead, the overall composition of their portfolios is changing, becoming more cash-
heavy when funds receive inflows and less cash-heavy when they suffer outflows. 17 At higher


17
   Massa and Phalippou (2005) and Hahouna et. al. (2015) show that mutual funds’ portfolio liquidity decreases
following outflows. This suggests that funds respond to outflows by both drawing down their cash balances and selling
more liquid securities.

                                                                                                                 18
frequencies (e.g., daily or weekly), cash presumably plays an even more important role. The
remaining coefficients show that the effect of fund flows on cash holdings declines over time. By
month m-3, the coefficient is 0.22. The coefficients then turn negative, indicating that over the full
six-month period, the total effect of flows on the cash-assets ratio is essentially zero.

         The second column of Table 3 shows that the results are similar if we include fixed effects
for Lipper objective codes and time, indicating the results are not driven by common trends over
time in cash and flows or by a correlation between average changes in cash and flows across
objectives. Finally, the third column shows that the results remain essentially unchanged if we
include Lipper objective code-by-time fixed effects, indicating that the results are not driven by
relationships between flows and cash holdings in particular fund objectives.

         Columns (4)-(6) examine index funds. These funds are constrained to hold the index, and
therefore have much less scope for managing flows using cash buffers. Consistent with this, the
relationship between changes in cash holds and flows is much weaker for index funds than for
actively managed funds. For instance, in Column (4) we find β0 = 2.58, as compared to β0 = 18.51
for actively managed funds in column (1). The reason the coefficient β0 is not zero is that some
index funds achieve their exposure through derivatives, which require cash collateral. When these
funds receive inflows and outflows, they scale their derivative positions, which in turn affects the
cash collateral that they hold.

    B. Internalization and Flow Management

         We next examine how the propensity to accommodate fund flows using cash holdings
varies with our internalization measures. Table 3 estimates specifications that allow flow
management practices to differ in the cross section of funds based on our internalization measures:

  Cash 
∆                 α obj ( f ),t + β1 Flows f ,t + β 2 Flows f ,t × Fund Internalize f ,t − 2 + β3 Flows f ,t × Illiq f ,t − 2
                    =
  TNA  f ,t − 2:t
                    + β 4 Flows f ,t −1 + β5 Flows f ,t −1 × Fund Internalize f ,t − 2 + β 6 Flows f ,t −1 × Illiq f ,t − 2       (2)
                    + β 7 Fund Internalize f ,t − 2 + β8 Illiq f ,t − 2 + ε f ,t .

For compactness, we aggregate flows into quarters and refer to time in quarters. We interact
quarterly flows with the lagged values of our internalization measures. Thus, the specification
asks: does the way a fund responds to flows depend on how much the fund internalizes its price


                                                                                                                                  19
impact? As Proposition 3 of Section I suggests, if large outflows are frequent enough and the
fund’s non-cash assets are illiquid enough, high internalization funds should behave differently.

         Eq. (2) controls for quarterly flows interacted with the illiquidity of the fund’s holdings, as
measured by the value-weighted average of the square root version of the Amihud (2002) measure
for each of fund’s holdings (Chen et. al., 2010). Controlling for illiquidity helps us separate
liquidity from internalization. Liquidity is essentially independent of who holds the security: l in
the notation of the model we presented in Section I. Any fund holding a given illiquid security will
use cash more aggressively to accommodate fund flows because the fund itself incurs large
transaction costs when it trades that security. Internalization is a holdings-level concept: it is
determined by which funds hold the security and how much they care about exerting price impact
on one another; α in the notation of the model in Section I. Two funds holding the same security
would incur the same transaction costs but may internalize more or less of the price impact they
impose on the other funds.

         The dependent variable in Eq. (2) is once again the change in the fund’s cash-to-assets
ratio. We convert raw values of our internalization measures into decile rankings within each
quarter, so that their coefficients can be interpreted as the effect of a one-decile change in each
variable. Again, all specifications include Lipper objective-by-time fixed effects.

         The first column of Table 3 examines actively managed funds. The coefficient β2 on the
interaction between flows and Manager internalize is positive and significant. To give a sense of
the magnitudes, for a fund in the 25th percentile of Manager internalize, flows equal to 100% of
assets over the most recent quarter t change the cash-to-assets ratio by 4.52 percentage points.18
For a fund in the 75th percentile of Manager internalize, the same flows change the cash-to-assets
ratio by 6.98 percentage points, a 54% larger effect. The effect is comparable to the impact on flow
management of going from the 25th percentile to the 85th percentile of asset illiquidity. Thus, the
impact of our internalization measures is economically sizeable. The reduction in trading we would
observe if funds internalized more of the price impact of their trading is similar to the reduction
we would observe if their assets were substantially less liquid.




18
  A fund in the 25th percentile is in the 3rd decile of Manager internalize, so the total effect of flows is β1 + β2 * 3 =
4.52.

                                                                                                                       20
         Column (2) examines index funds as a placebo test. Here we find no impact of Manager
internalize on flow management, consistent with the idea that index funds have limited
discretion. 19 If anything Manager internalize is associated with slightly less aggressive use of cash
in flow management. 20

         Columns 3—6 of Table 3 show that similar results obtain using our other measures of
internalization: Adviser internalize with manager and Adviser internalize without manager. These
measures are associated with more aggressive use of cash in flow management for actively
managed funds, but not for index funds.

         Our Adviser internalize results are interesting in light of Goncalves-Pinto and Schmidt
(2013), who find that when funds suffering outflows are forced to sell some of their securities,
other funds within the same fund family increase their positions in the fire sold securities. This
kind of cross trading among family funds should be positively correlated with our measures of
internalization, and thus should bias us against finding our results: if funds can cross-trade with
their families, they do not need to use as much cash for flow management. Nonetheless, funds with
high Adviser internalize do manage fund flows more aggressively using cash.

         Overall, all three measures of internalization deliver similar results. Funds that internalize
more of their price impact are more aggressive in using cash to manage inflows and outflows.
These results are consistent with Cella, Ellul, and Giannetti (2013), who show that during episodes
of market turmoil, institutional investors with short trading horizons sell their stock holdings to a
larger extent than institutional investors with longer trading horizons. Since funds that do not
internalize the costs of their trading are likely to trade more, low internalization funds are
endogenously likely to have shorter trading horizons. Thus, they will be more likely to sell their
stocks, rather than draw down their cash buffers in times of market turmoil.

    C. Robustness of Flows Results

         The results in Table 3 show that our measures of internalization strongly affect funds’ flow
management strategies. Funds that score highly on our internalization measures use cash more


19
   Note that though the coefficient β1 is similar for index funds and actively managed funds, the average effect of flows
is quite different. The average fund is in the 5th decile of internalization, and we have β1 + β2 * 5 = 5.5 for active funds
in column (1) and β1 + β2 * 5 = 0.7 for index funds in column (2).
20
   This may be capturing the fact that index funds that rely more heavily on derivatives to maintain exposure to the
index tend to be somewhat smaller funds with lower levels of internalization.

                                                                                                                        21
aggressively to meet inflows and outflows. This is consistent with the idea that they care more
about minimizing the price impact of their trades. However, given that our internalization measures
are proxies, there could be other explanations for these results.

           Table 4 reports a battery of robustness tests that examine these alternative explanations. In
particular, we examine the possibility that our results are driven by market timing, asset liquidity,
fund strategy, variation in investor clienteles across funds, and manager characteristics. Each row
of the table shows the results of a different robustness test for all three measures of internalization.
All specifications include Lipper objective by time fixed effects. Row (1) replicates our baseline
results from columns (1), (3), and (5) of Table 3. For compactness, we only report the coefficient
on our variable of interest, the interaction of fund flows during the most recent quarter with lagged
values of our internalization measures. 21 It is worth noting that some of the alternative explanations
we examine do affect how funds manage their flows. That is, the controls we add to the regression
do themselves enter significantly. However, controlling for these alternative explanations does not
affect our key result that higher internalization is associated with a greater propensity to
accommodate fund flows through cash holdings.

           In Row (2) of Table 4, we control for the fund’s monthly returns during the semi-annual
reporting period. Because of the performance-flow relationship, funds with positive flows are
likely to have generated high returns. These high returns mechanically depress a fund’s cash-to-
assets ratio, and could thereby bias down the coefficient on fund flows. If there are differences in
the strength of the performance-flow relationship between high- and low-internalization funds, the
degree of this bias will vary across funds and could explain our finding of a positive interaction
between fund flows and internalization. Row (2) of Table 4 shows that controlling for past returns
has no impact on our results.

           Whether funds accommodate fund flows through changes in cash or by trading in their
portfolio securities could depend on fund managers’ expectations of future returns. For instance,
if the manager expects future returns to be high, they may want to satisfy redemption requests
using the fund’s cash buffer rather than selling portfolio securities. If our internalization measures
are correlated with expected returns, this could help explain the stronger sensitivity of cash to fund
flows for high internalization funds. Row (3) of Table 4 uses future returns realized over the

21
     The full regression output is reported in the Internet Appendix.

                                                                                                     22
following one, three, six, and twelve months as proxies for expected returns. These controls do not
affect the coefficient of interest.

        We next consider the possibility that our internalization measures are just additional
proxies for the illiquidity of fund holdings. Though Table 3 controls for the interaction of flows
and illiquidity, the effect of illiquidity on cash holdings may be non-linear. Rows (4), (5), and (6)
of Table 4 explore this alternative. Row (4) shows that controlling for five powers of illiquidity
and their interactions with flows has no effect on our results. Row (5) shows that the same
conclusion holds when we control for deciles of illiquidity and their interactions with flows.

        In row (6), we examine the possibility that the weighted average liquidity of a portfolio
may not fully capture the effect of holdings illiquidity on flow management. Consider two funds,
A and B, whose holdings have the same average liquidity. Suppose all securities held by fund A
have the same liquidity, while half of securities held by fund B are very liquid and the other half
are very illiquid. Even though the two funds have the same average liquidity, fund B may trade its
liquid securities and may avoid adjusting its cash holdings in response to fund flows. A negative
correlation between our internalization measures and dispersion in liquidity across securities held
by a given fund could then explain the positive coefficient on the interaction of fund flows and
internalization. To rule out this possibility, row (6) of Table 4 separately controls for the liquidity
of each 10% slice of fund’s portfolio from most to least liquid, and the interaction of each of these
variables with fund flows. Overall, rows (4), (5), and (6) of Table 4 are strong evidence that our
internalization measures are not simply proxies for the illiquidity of fund holdings.

        We next consider the idea that our internalization measures could be correlated with fund
strategies. For instance, a fund manager who tends to make big bets may manage liquidity
differently. We explore this alternative in rows (7), (8), and (9) of Table 4. In row (7), we control
for the concentration of the fund’s holdings, as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschmann Index
(HHI) of portfolio weights, and its interaction with fund flows. This does not affect our results.
The same is true in row (8), where we control for the share of the single largest position in the
fund’s portfolio and its interaction with flows. In row (9), we control for the fund’s active share as
defined by Cremers and Petajisto (2009) and its interaction with flows, and our results are again
unaffected. Overall, rows (7), (8), and (9) of Table 4 provide strong evidence that our results are
not driven by differences in strategies across funds.


                                                                                                    23
         In row (10), we consider the possibility that our internalization measures are correlated
with the investor clienteles that different funds serve. The main concern here is that some clienteles
are subject to stronger strategic complementarities than others. For instance, Chen, Goldstein, and
Jiang (2010) and Goldstein, Jiang, and Ng (2016) argue that retail investors are subject to stronger
strategic complementarities. Thus, funds catering to retail investors may want to be less aggressive
in using cash to manage fund flows, since doing otherwise risks incentivizing shareholder runs
(Zeng, 2016). Correlation between our internalization measures and fund clienteles could therefore
explain differences in flow management. To address this concern, row (10) controls for
institutional share as well as the number of share classes, the concentration of fund assets across
share classes, and whether the fund charges a front load, and the interaction of these clientele
proxies with flows. These controls have no effect on our results.

         In row (11), we consider the possibility that our internalization measures reflect differences
in fund manager characteristics. For example, more experienced portfolio managers tend to
manage more funds, which may have greater overlap in their holdings. It could be that instead of
capturing the effect of internalization, our results are capturing differences in the behavior of more-
versus less-experienced managers. To rule out this possibility, we control for whether the fund is
team managed, the number of managers, the manager’s years of experience, whether the manager
has a CFA, and the interactions of these variables with fund flows. Again, this has no effect on our
main results.

         Finally, in rows (12)-(15), we examine two sample splits: smaller (below median TNA)
versus larger (above median) funds, 22 and the first versus second half of our sample period. Given
the smaller sample sizes, the standard errors here are larger, and statistical significance is weaker.
Overall, however, we find broadly similar results across the sample splits.

         Overall, Table 4 provides strong evidence that we are picking up the impact of
internalization on flow management. Table 4 is inconsistent with a wide variety of plausible
alternative explanations for our results.



22
    While fund size and internalization are positively correlated (0.38-0.56), there is meaningful variation in
internalization within both small and large funds. The standard deviation of Manager internalize for example is 2.36
for small funds and 2.70 for large funds. Small funds can be high internalization if they hold concentrated positions
in illiquid securities and have significant overlap with affiliates who themselves are large.

                                                                                                                 24
       D. Evidence from Structural Changes
           Despite the battery of robustness tests in Table 4, one might still worry that our
internalization variables are endogenous and that our results are thus picking up factors other than
internalization. In this section, we examine whether changes in internalization driven by structural
changes at the portfolio manager or investment adviser level affect the fund’s propensity to use
cash to accommodate fund flows.

           First, we examine cases in which the fund’s portfolio managers are assigned an additional
fund to manage. The basic idea is that the fund manager internalizes the impact of decisions to
trade across all of their funds. Thus, being assigned an additional fund means that Manager
internalize increases, and that the propensity to use cash to manage flows should increase as well.

           To isolate the set of new fund management assignments that are likely to have a sizable
effect on a portfolio manager’s internalization, we focus on cases where the manager initially
manages a single fund and where the size of the new fund is at least 5%, 15%, or 25% of the size
of the existing fund. We identify 454, 411, 389 funds that satisfy these criteria, respectively.

           In Panel A of Table 5, we show Manager internalize increases significantly for the
manager’s existing fund after being assigned a new fund to manage. Treated funds are typically in
the third decile of internalization prior to treatment and increase by two deciles once their portfolio
manager is assigned a new fund. 23 The fact that treated funds are in the middle of the distribution
of internalization suggests that our results are not driven by a small set of funds with very high
values of internalization. Columns (2), (4), and (6) include fund fixed effects, so we are only
identifying off changes in Manager internalize within a fund after the manager is assigned a new
fund to manage. The results are nearly identical when we include fund fixed effects.

           Panel B of Table 5 then reports the results of regressions where we allow the sensitivity of
cash to flows to vary before and after the new fund assignment:

                     Cash 
                   ∆       =   α obj ( f ),t + β1 Flows f ,t + γ 1 Flows f ,t × Post f ,t
                     TNA  f ,t                                                                                   (3)
                                    + β 2 Flows f ,t −1 + γ 2 Flows f ,t −1 × Post f ,t + δ Post f ,t + ε f ,t .




23
     By construction, the raw value of Manager internalize is zero for treated funds prior to treatment.

                                                                                                                         25
The sample is limited to the funds the manager managed before being assigned the new fund. Thus,
the results are not driven by newly assigned funds having different flow management practices. In
addition, we limit the sample to a window of [-24, +24] months around treatment to help ensure
that we are capturing changes due to the new fund assignment. Note that the coefficient β1 on flows
is similar to what we found in Table 3, indicating that the funds we are studying have average flow
management policies before the new fund assignment.

         The coefficient γ1 on the interaction of flows with the post treatment dummy is positive
and significant, indicating that once managers are assigned a new fund to manage and begin to
internalize the price impact of their trading, not only on their old fund but also on the new fund,
their propensity to accommodate fund flows using cash increases. Again, columns (2), (4), and (6)
include fund fixed effects, so we are only identifying off within fund variation. In addition, it is
worth noting that the magnitude of the interaction term increases as we increase the relative size
cutoff for the new fund, consistent with the idea that managers internalize more of their price
impact when the new fund they are managing is larger. However, given the limited sample size,
the difference in the coefficients is not statistically significant.

         In Table 6, we examine a second type of structural change – mergers of investment
advisers. Such mergers have the potential to increase investment adviser internalization. We search
SDC and Capital IQ for mergers of investment adviser firms during the 1994-2016 period. To
focus on mergers that are likely to increase adviser internalization, we a) focus on cases where the
target is initially a stand-alone entity24 and b) require both the target and acquirer to be sizable
relative to the combined firm. Specifically, the target’s funds are considered to be treated as long
as the acquirer accounts for at least 50% (columns 1-4) or 25% (columns 5-8) of combined pre-
merger 13F assets, i.e., acquirer is relatively large compared to the target. Symmetrically, the
acquirer’s funds are considered to be treated as long as the target accounts for at least 50%
(columns 1-4) or 25% (columns 5-8) of combined 13F assets. We identify 56 mergers affecting
133 target and acquirer funds using the 50% criterion, and 61 mergers affecting 185 target and
acquirer funds using the 25% criterion. 25



24
   In other words, we want to avoid acquisitions of subsidiaries as these transactions have an ambiguous effect on the
internalization of the target’s funds.
25
   The sample is fairly small because we look at mergers of investment advisers where target’s and acquirer’s mutual
funds themselves do not merge but continue to maintain their separate legal and economic identities.

                                                                                                                  26
       Panel A of Table 6 shows that our Adviser internalize measure increases by between 0.5
and 1 decile after a merger. In columns (1)-(4) we restrict the sample to cases where the merger
counterparty accounts for at least 50% of combined 13F assets. Columns (1) and (2) examine only
funds managed by targets, while columns (3) and (4) examine funds managed by both targets and
acquirer. In columns (5)-(8), we repeat the exercise, restricting the sample to cases where the
merger counterparty accounts for at least 25% of combined 13F assets. Columns (2), (4), (6), and
(8) include fund fixed effects, so we are only identifying off changes in Adviser internalize within
fund after the merger. Given the significantly smaller sample size – we have roughly 500-1000
observations in Table 6 versus 2400-2800 observations in Table 5 – the statistical significance is
slightly weaker. Nonetheless, of the eight specifications in Table 6 Panel A, five are significant at
the 5% level and one is significant at the 10% level. The effect of mergers on Adviser internalize
is always significant once we include fund fixed effects.

       Panel B of Table 6 then reports the results of regressions, where we interact fund flows
with a post-merger dummy, limiting the sample to treated funds within a window of [-24, +24]
months around treatment as in Table 5. The interaction of fund flows with the post treatment
dummy is positive and significant, indicating that after the merger, funds’ propensity to
accommodate fund flows using cash increases. Again, columns (2), (4), (6), and (8) include fund
fixed effects, so we are only identifying off within fund variation.

       These results give us confidence that we are in fact identifying differences in flow
management practices driven by internalization rather other than factors.

   E. Stock-Level Implications of Internalization

       We next turn to the effects of internalization on market prices and other funds holding the
same securities. We start by examining how differences in flow management practices across
funds with different levels of internalization impact the price behavior of the assets they hold.
Greenwood and Thesmar (2011) show that stocks held by funds with volatile or highly correlated
fund flows experience higher volatility. As these funds trade the same stocks at the same time in
response to inflows and outflows, their trading activity introduces excess volatility in the returns
of the underlying stocks.




                                                                                                  27
         In this section, we ask whether stocks held by high internalization funds experience lower
realized volatility. One might expect this to be the case because high internalization funds are less
likely to trade in response to flows. To test this prediction, we estimate the regression

                         Vols ,t +1 = α s + α t +1 + β ⋅ StockInternalizes ,t + γ ′ X s ,t + ε s ,t +1 ,             (4)

where Vols,t+1 is the realized volatility of stock s in quarter t+1, calculated in daily data and
annualized. StockInternalizes,t is the average of one of our internalization measures across all funds
holding stock s at the end of quarter t, weighted by the share of each fund in total mutual fund
holdings of the security. To ensure we focus on stocks where our measures are meaningful, we
exclude stocks where the total holdings of mutual funds as a fraction of total shares outstanding
are less than 10%. The regression includes stock and time fixed effects. In addition, we include in
the set of controls Xs,t the size (log market capitalization) of the stock, the fraction of the total
market capitalization held by mutual funds, and the fragility measure of Greenwood and Thesmar
(2011). For each stock, the fragility measure combines mutual fund holdings data on the stock with
the variance-covariance matrix of flows faced by each mutual fund to compute the volatility of
flows netted across all funds holding the stock. 26 We follow Greenwood and Thesmar (2011) and
restrict the sample to stocks above the NYSE median size. Thus, our specification asks whether a
stock held by high internalization funds experiences lower volatility, controlling for the volatility
of flows into funds holding that stock. 27

         Table 7 reports the results, with the dependent variable expressed in percentage points and
annualized. In the first two columns, we use our Manager internalize measure. The first column
shows that a one-decile increase in the average level of internalization across holders of a given
stock is associated with a 1.1 percentage point reduction in the stock’s annual volatility. Given that
mean volatility for the stocks in our sample is 36.1%, this is not a large effect in absolute terms.
However, the relevant benchmark here is not overall volatility but excess volatility induced by
mutual fund trading. Internalization cannot affect the part of a stock’s volatility that is generated

26
   Specifically, let Wf,s be the matrix describing holders of stock s by fund f at time t and let Ωt be the variance
covariance matrix of flows across funds. The fragility measure is given by W’ΩW. Given the computational difficulties
of estimating cross-fund correlations in fund flows, we use the “diagonal” version of the Greenwood and Thesmar
(2011) fragility measure that ignores the correlation in fund flows across funds. Column (4) of Table 3 in Greenwood
and Thesmar (2011) shows that the diagonal version of fragility generates similar results to the full version that
accounts for cross-correlation.
27
   Controlling for fragility does not affect the coefficient on StockInternalize. We include it in the regression to have
a benchmark for comparison.

                                                                                                                     28
by news about fundamentals; it can only affect the volatility induced by trading. Thus, it is more
natural to compare the effect of internalization to the effect of the Greenwood and Thesmar (2011)
fragility measure. In the first column of Table 7, the effect of fragility is similar to what Greenwood
and Thesmar (2011) find. The effect of a one-decile increase in Manager internalize is equivalent
to decreasing fragility from the median to the 33rd percentile. Compared to this benchmark, the
effect of internalization is significant.

        In the second column of Table 7, we add stock fixed effects. The effect of a one-decile
increase in Manager internalize is now a 0.9-percentage point decrease in volatility, and it is
equivalent to decreasing fragility from the median to the 29th percentile. The remaining columns
of Table 7 show that we get similar results for our other internalization measures. For our measures
of Adviser internalize, a one-decile increase in internalization is associated with a decrease in
volatility of 0.6 to 1.8 percentage points. In these specifications, our results generally get stronger
once we add stock fixed effects.

        In summary, Table 7 shows that when high internalization funds hold the same stock, that
stock’s volatility is lower.

    F. Internalization and Spillovers on Fund Performance

        Having demonstrated that the price behavior of individual stocks is affected by the
internalization of funds holding those stocks, we now turn to how funds are affected by the
internalization of other funds holding the same securities. As suggested by Proposition 4 of the
model, sales by some funds can exert negative price pressure, thereby driving down the returns of
other funds, an effect that should be mitigated if funds internalize more of their price impact. We
now empirically assess how our internalization measures affect the relation between fund returns
and flows into other funds with overlapping holdings.

        Consider a particular fund f. When other funds that hold the same stocks as f suffer
outflows, their sales of overlapping stocks may drive down prices and thus fund f’s returns (Lou,
2012). However, to the extent that those other funds internalize more of the price pressure from
their trading, they will trade less, and the effect on f’s returns will be smaller. To examine this
prediction, we estimate the regression




                                                                                                    29
                   R f ,m = α m + β1 ⋅ Pressure f ,m + β 2 ⋅ Pressure f ,m × CoHolderInternalize f ,m −1
                                                                                                            (5)
                          + β3 ⋅ CoHolderInternalize f ,m −1 + β 4 ⋅ Flows f ,m + ε f ,m ,

where Rf,m is the return of fund f during month m. Pressuref,m is the average over the securities that
fund f holds of flows into other funds that hold the same security, weighted by the share of each
security in f’s portfolio and the share of each other fund in total mutual fund holdings of the
security. To ensure that we focus on funds for which Pressuref,m is economically relevant, we
exclude funds that hold stocks with an average mutual fund share of less than 10%. Even if the
mutual funds holding such stocks experience large fund flows, their trading is likely to be small
compared to the other investors holding the stocks. CoHolderInternalizef,m is the average over
securities that fund f holds of our internalization measure for other funds that hold the same
security. In addition, we control directly for the flows into fund f and include time fixed effects in
all specifications.

         Table 8 shows the results. The first column reports the results for Manager internalize. The
coefficient β1 on Pressuref,m is positive: when funds that have holdings overlapping with f have
outflows, fund f has lower returns. When the other funds holding the same stocks as f experience
outflows equal to 1% of their TNA, fund f experiences about 1.4% lower returns, a magnitude
comparable       to    Lou     (2012). 28     However,        the    coefficient      β2     on   the    interaction
Pressure f ,m × CoHolderInternalize f ,m −1 is negative, so the effect of outflows from funds with

overlapping holdings is muted when those funds internalize more of their price pressure. A one-
decile increase in the average level of internalization across all funds with overlapping holdings
reduces the effect of a 1% outflow on returns by 0.2 percentage points, a 14% reduction. Column
(2) shows that the results are unchanged when we add fund fixed effects.

         Columns (3)-(6) of Table 8, show that similar results obtain with our Adviser internalize
measures. For these measures, a one-decile increase in the average level of internalization across
all funds with overlapping holdings reduces the effect of a 1% outflow on returns by about 0.1
percentage points.




28
   The main difference between our results here and Lou (2012) is that he is interested in predicting mutual fund
returns based on expected flows into other funds holding the same securities as a given fund. Our focus here is on ex-
post behavior: how does internalization moderate the effect of flow-induced trading on other funds?

                                                                                                                  30
        These results show that when other funds holding the same securities experience flows,
how much they internalize their price pressure affects fund f. We next ask whether fund f’s
unconditional performance is affected by the internalization of other funds holding the same
securities. In other words, do the effects we document in Table 8 aggregate up once we average
across the flows experienced by other funds holding the same securities? Proposition 5 in Section
I suggests they should. If other funds holding the same securities as f internalize more of their price
pressure, they use more cash and less non-cash asset sales to accommodate flows. As a result, fund
f faces lower and less volatile costs when it sells its holdings of illiquid assets, so it has higher and
less volatile returns.

        Table 9 shows the results. In Panel A, we examine fund f’s return volatility, running the
quarterly regression:

        Vol f=
             ,t +1 α obj ( f ),t + α f + β ⋅ CoHolderInternalize f ,t + γ ′ X f ,t + ε s ,t +1 ,   (6)

where Volf,t+1 is the volatility of f’s return over quarter t+1, calculated in daily data and annualized.
We include objective-time fixed effects in column (1) and objective-time and fund fixed effects in
column (2). The results show that higher CoHolderInternalize is associated with lower return
volatility for fund f. A one-decile increase in CoHolderInternalize is associated with annual
volatility that is 1-2 percentage points lower. Columns (3)-(6) of Table 9, show that similar results
obtain when we measure internalization using our Adviser internalize measure.

        In Panel B of Table 9, we run similar regressions with fund f’s return over quarter t+1 as
the dependent variable. Returns are annualized, and the analysis again includes both objective-
time and fund fixed effects. The results show that higher CoHolderInternalize is associated with
higher average returns for fund f. A one-decile increase in CoHolderInternalize is associated with
annual returns that are 0.3 to 0.5 percentage points higher.

    G. Internalization and Cash Holdings

        We have shown that high internalization funds use cash more aggressively to accommodate
fund flows. This decreases the volatility of the stocks they hold and reduces the price pressure
exerted on other funds holding the same stocks. We close by examining the relationship between
internalization and the level of cash holdings. A basic prediction of our model (Proposition 2 in
Section I) is that the level of cash holdings should be positively related to internalization. These

                                                                                                         31
results are also interesting because they speak to the design of regulation. Regulations typically do
not mandate the exact flow management practices of individual financial institutions; they instead
tend to focus on ensuring that the level of liquid assets financial institutions hold is sufficient.29
While evaluating the effects of such rules is beyond the scope of this paper, this subsection
provides some evidence on the funds’ ex-ante choice of the cash-to-assets ratio and its relation to
internalization.

        Table 10 estimates regressions of the cash-to-assets ratio on our internalization measures:

                          Cash f ,t
                                      = α + β ⋅ FundInternalize f ,t + γ ′ X f ,t + ε f ,t .                          (7)
                          TNAf ,t

Controls Xf,t include four sets of variables. The first set is variables that capture the mismatch
between liquidity of a fund’s assets and liquidity demanded by its investors: the liquidity of the
assets and the volatility of fund flows. The second category consists of regressors that capture
economies of scale: the (log) size of the fund and the (log) size of the fund family. In the third
category is the fraction of the fund’s assets that are in institutional share classes, a proxy for
investor behavior and the investor clienteles the fund serves. Finally, we control for a number of
measures of trading practices, including the fund’s asset turnover and indicators for whether the
fund uses various derivatives, borrows, or engages in short sales.

        The first column of Table 10 shows that our internalization measures have a substantial
impact on cash holdings. Going from the 25th percentile to the 75th percentile of our Manager
internalize measures is associated with a 0.40-percentage point higher cash-to-assets ratio. The
effect is comparable to the impact on cash holdings of going from the 25th percentile to the 65th
percentile of asset illiquidity. The specification includes objective-time fixed effects, indicating
that the results are not driven by common time variation in internalization and cash holdings within
fund objectives. Thus, as in our flow management regressions, internalization has an economically
significant effect. A fund internalizing more of its price impact has as much cash as a fund with
significantly less liquid assets.




29
    For instance, the SEC adopted new liquidity                rules   for   open    end       mutual   funds   in   2017:
https://www.sec.gov/rules/final/2016/33-10233.pdf

                                                                                                                       32
        The remaining columns of Table 10 show that results are similar for our other
internalization measures. Overall, these results show that internalization impacts cash holdings.

                                         IV. Conclusion
        Theoretical models of fire sales suggest that investors do not fully internalize the cost of
fire sales they create. They may therefore set their leverage too high or hold too little liquidity to
meet redemption requests. The existing empirical literature documents that forced sales do result
in depressed security prices and that these depressed prices do sometimes spill over, adversely
affecting other investors. However, there is no direct empirical evidence of externalities: are the
frequency and severity of spillovers significant enough that funds would act differently if they
cared more about their impact on other funds?

        We construct three novel, theoretically-motivated measures of how much of the price
impact of their trading different mutual funds are likely to internalize. All three measures deliver
the same message—high internalization funds behave differently from other funds. In particular,
high internalization funds use cash more aggressively to accommodate fund flows. As a result,
stocks held by these funds experience less excess volatility, and flows into these funds have smaller
spillover effects on other funds with overlapping holdings. High internalization funds also choose
to hold larger cash buffers. Overall, these results suggest that there are indeed meaningful price
impact externalities in the mutual fund industry.

        Our results speak to the policy debate among academics, practitioners, and regulators about
liquidity transformation in asset management (e.g., Goldstein et al, 2016; International Monetary
Fund, 2015; Financial Stability Oversight Council, 2014; Feroli et al, 2014; Chen, Goldstein, and
Jiang, 2010). Our results suggest that because individual mutual funds do not fully internalize the
price impact of their trading, giving funds a stronger incentive to care about the spillover effect of
their trading on other funds may lead to changes in liquidity management practices. This in turn
may result in lower volatility at the stock and fund level.

        Finally, the results in this paper contribute to our understanding of the role of large
institutional investors in securities markets (Ben-David et al., 2016). While larger investors have
the potential to generate greater price impact, they may also more fully internalize the price impact
of their trading.

Appendix A. Proofs

A.1.   Proof of Proposition 1
We start with the private market equilibrium. Writing out fund f’s objective in terms of cf, we have

                                                  ∫ ( x − c )( x − c + ∑                    )
                                            l      ∞
                     E  L f  = ic f +                        f        f           x − ch dG ( x ) .
                                            F     cf                           h≠ f


Differentiating with respect to cf, by Leibniz’s rule, the first order condition is

                               ∫ ( x − c ) + ( x − c + ∑ ( x − c ) ) dG ( x ) =
                           l    ∞
                      i−                      f                  f              h 0.
                           F   cf                                      h≠ f



Imposing symmetry so that c=
                           f c=
                              h c* for all f, h, we have

                                                 F +1 ∞
                                                         * (
                                        0=  i −l       ∫     x − c* ) dG ( x )
                                                  F     c

                                                 F +1
                                        0=  i −l      λ exp ( −λ −1c* )
                                                  F
                                                   i F 
                                       c* = −λ ln             ,
                                                   lλ F + 1 
where the second line follows from integration by parts with the exponential distribution. When
the term inside the logarithm is greater than 1, c* = 0.
For the planner’s problem, writing out the objective in terms of cf, we have
                                              l
                                                             F ( x − c f ) F ( x − c f )  dG ( x ) =
                                                       ∞
                                    Fic f +
                                              F    ∫   cf                                          0.

The first order condition is
                                            2l ∞
                                        Fi − ∫ ** F 2 ( x − c** ) dG ( x )
                                       0=
                                            F c
                                        i − 2l ∫ ** ( x − c** ) dG ( x ).
                                                             ∞
                                       0=
                                                             c

                                                i 

                                                2λl 

When the term inside the logarithm is greater than 1, c** = 0.

The numerator in brackets is increasing in α and is equal to 2F > 0 when α = 0. Thus, we have
dc*** / dα > 0.


A.3.    Proof of Proposition 3

For simplicity, we work with the λ = 1 case, which will not alter the signs of any of the comparative
statics. Computing the right hand side of the equation for the exponential distribution gives




                                                                                                                                     38

This is positive so long as 1 + c*** < exp c*** , which is true so long as c*** > 0 . We have

                                       dc

From Proposition 2, we know that dc*** / dα > 0 , so we have dCov ( − x, ∆c ) / dα > 0 .



A.4.   Proof of Proposition 4

The internalization objective is a weighted average of the two. Optimal cash holdings are:

That is, cash holdings are equal to the expressions we had with perfectly correlated flows in
Propositions 1 and 2, divided by F.
With these basics in hand, we can express the covariance between fund f’s liquidation costs and
flows into other funds as

For simplicity, we work with the λ = 1 case, which will not alter the signs of any of the comparative

Imposing symmetry of cash holdings across funds we have

The first term in the square bracket is negative because 1 − exp ( F − 1) c*** is negative so long as       (            )
c*** > 0 . The remaining parts of the first term in the square brackets are positive, so the first term
is negative. Thus, the overall covariance is negative.
We have


dCov ( − x− f , L f   ) = dCov ( − x             −f   , L f ) dc***
      dα                                  dc***                dα

The two terms in square brackets in the expression for dCov − x− f , L f / dc*** are both negative      (           )
                                                                      (                    )
so long as c*** > 0 and F > 1. Thus, dCov − x− f , L f / dc*** is positive. We know that dc*** / dα > 0

            (              )
so dCov − x− f , L f / dα is positive.

We can also compute the covariance of fund f’s liquidation costs and flows into other funds holding
fixed fund f’s choices. Writing the covariance as a function of fund f’s choices (cf) and all other
funds’ choices (c-f), we have
                                        l
         Cov ( − x− f , L=

Differentiating with respect to c-f, we have



dCov ( − x− f , L f   )=
       dc− f
                            (F   2

The two terms in square brackets are both negative so long as c-f > 0 and F > 1, so the overall
expression is positive.

Appendix B. Model of Inflows
        In the main text, we present a model of how a fund manages redemptions. In this section,
we show how to write down a very similar model of how a fund manages inflows. The key
difference between the problems is that redemption management requires an ex ante decision of
how much cash to hold before the redemptions happen. Inflow management is an ex post decision,
made after the quantity of inflows is known.
         Suppose fund f receives inflows xf, which are public information. The fund must choose
between investing in the illiquid asset and holding cash. In buying the illiquid asset, the fund incurs
an accumulation cost. Think of this accumulation cost as reflecting the temporary price pressure
that will revert. In other words, the fund is paying more than fundamental value for the asset. We
assume that the accumulation cost depends on the total purchases by all funds, and parametrize it
       l
as b f
       F
        (       )
          ∑ h bh where bf is the quantity purchased by fund f. As in the model in the main text, l
indexes the illiquidity of the asset and we normalize accumulation costs by F, the total number of
funds, so that aggregate accumulation costs do not change as we vary F.



                                                                                                                                          42
       Holding cash has carrying cost i. A complete model of inflow management would be
dynamic: a fund would hold cash today, planning to invest it in the illiquid asset tomorrow with
lower accumulation costs. For simplicity, we abstract from the dynamic aspects of the problem
and assume that the carrying cost of cash includes expected future accumulation costs.
        The problem of fund f in the private market equilibrium is to pick cash holdings
cf = xf - bf to minimize total liquidity management costs:
                                                        l
                                           ic f + b f
                                                        F
                                                            (∑ b ).
                                                                h    h



The first order condition for cf is
                                           l
                                  0 =−
                                     i
                                           F
                                             (
                                             x f − c f + ∑ h ( xh − ch ) .   )
As in the main text, to simplify the analysis, we assume flows are perfectly correlated so that
xf = x and solve for the symmetric equilibrium. Doing so, we find that
                                                            i F

        The planner’s problem is to minimize total liquidity management costs of all funds:
                                                             l
                                      Fic + F ( x − c )        F ( x − c).
                                                             F
The first order condition is
                                                               i
                                                  c**= x −       .
                                                              2l
The internalization objective puts weight α on the planner’s objective and weight (1-α) on the
private market objective. Taking the first order condition and imposing symmetry we have
                                                          i
                                                 c***= x − η ,
                                                          l
where

                                      η=
                                                 ( (1 − α ) + α F ) F    ,
                                           (1 − α )( F + 1) + 2α F 2
the same expression for η that arises in the main text.
        Clearly, the expressions here are similar to those in the main model and thus similar
comparative statics go through. The key difference is that the problem is ex post as opposed to ex
ante: inflows are known before the decision is made. Thus, we do not need to take expectations.

Variable             Definition
Active share         The percentage of fund holdings that is different from the bench-
                     mark holdings.       Minimum active share across all U.S.-equity
                     benchmarks (activeshare min) is from Martijn Cremers’s website
                     http://activeshare.nd.edu. Active share is generally reported as of De-
                     cember of each year. Observations in N-SAR data are matched (based
                     on wficn fund identifier) to the most recent value of active share, as-
                     suming the latter is within eleven months of the N-SAR reporting date.
Adviser overlap      Value-weighted average of the overlap in fund holdings with the aggre-
                     gate 13F holdings by the fund’s investment adviser:
                                                                         13F

                     the value of the 13F holdings of security s by the fund’s investment
                     adviser, and V olumes is the average daily trading volume calculated
                     over the last quarter. Raw values of Adviser overlap are converted into
                     decile ranks within each quarter.
Adviser overlap      Same as Adviser overlap, except that instead of subtract-

                     ments (74I) − securities lending collateral. For domestic equity funds,
                     other investments (74I) consist mostly of money market mutual funds.
                     Value of securities lending collateral is collected from the N-CSR filings.
                     Cash is scaled by total net assets (74T). Winsorized at the 1st and 99th

Clientele             In Table 4, we control for (a) the number of share classes, (b) HHI of
                      assets across share classes, (c) the fraction of assets in share classes with
                      front load fees, and (d) fraction of TNA in institutional share classes.
                      Beginning of semi-annual period values are interacted with fund flows
                      during the period.
CoHolderInternalize   Value-weighted average of the propensity of other funds holding the
                      same securities as fund f to internalize price impact:
                                                                                        !

                      Internalization of index funds is set to zero.
Experience            Number of years managing mutual funds. Using Morningstar data on
                      the identity of mutual fund managers, we count the number of years
                      since the portfolio manager started managing mutual funds. For team-
                      managed funds, Experience is the average across individual portfolio
                      managers.
Family size           Log of aggregate TNA across all CRSP mutual funds within the same
                      family, with family defined based on mgmt cd in CRSP.
F lows                Net fund flows during each of the preceding six months (N-SAR item
                      28) are scaled by TNA at the end of the previous semi-annual report-
                      ing period. Net flows are calculated as Total NAV of Shares Sold: New
                      Sales (Incl. Exchanges) − Total NAV of Shares Redeemed and Repur-
                      chased (Incl. Exchanges). We exclude the Total NAV of Shares Sold:
                      Other as these generally capture share activity due to mergers.Total
                      NAV of Shares Sold: Reinv. of Dividends & Distributions is excluded
                      to focus on the less predictable component of flows. F lows are win-
                      sorized at the 5th and 95th percentiles.
σ(F lows)             Standard deviation of monthly fund flows (N-SAR item 28) over the
                      preceding six months. Fund flows are scaled by TNA as of the beginning
                      of the semi-annual reporting period.

F ragility           Greenwood and Thesmar (2011) measure of fragility. We calculate
                     the “diagonal” version of fragility that ignores correlation in fund flows
                     across funds. Column (4) of Table 3 in Greenwood and Thesmar (2011)
                     shows that the diagonal version of fragility generates similar results
                     to the full version that accounts for cross-correlation. For each fund
                     holding security s at time t, we calculate the volatility of fund flows
                     over the previous five years, requiring each fund to have at least 12
                     monthly observations. Fund flows are winsorized within each period at
                     the 1st and 99th percentiles before calculating fund flow volatility.
FundInternalize      Fund-level version of one of our three internalization measures. We cal-
                     culate the value-weighted average of raw internalization measures across
                     portfolio securities, with the weights defined relative to the aggregate
                     holdings of securities with valid values of internalization. Raw values
                     of fund-level internalization are converted into decile ranks within each
                     quarter.
Fund manager chars   In Table 4, we include controls for (a) team-managed funds, (b) the
                     number of portfolio managers in charge of the fund, (c) mean experi-
                     ence of the fund’s managers, and (d) CFA credential. Fund manager
                     data are from Morningstar. Beginning of semi-annual period values of
                     fund manager characteristics are interacted with fund flows during the
                     period.
Future returns       In Table 4, we include controls for average monthly returns over the
                     subsequent 1, 3, 6, and 12 months.
Illiq                The illiquidity of portfolio holdings. We first calculate the square-root
                     version of Amihud (2002) liquidity measure for each stock in a fund’s
                     portfolio. Stock-level illiquidity is calculated using daily data for the
                     preceding six months. We then calculate the value-weighted average
                     across all stocks held by the fund. For an N-SAR reporting period
                     ending in month t, we use holdings data from the last of months t,
                     t − 1, and t − 2. Illiquidity is winsorized at the 1st and 99th percentiles.

                      equal to N, or b) fund name includes the word institutional or its ab-

                      daily trading volume calculated over the last quarter. Identity of fund
                      portfolio managers is from Morningstar. For team-managed funds, we
                      split the fund’s holdings equally across the portfolio managers. Raw
                      values of Manager overlap are converted into decile ranks within each

                                           Summary Statistics

This table reports summary statistics for the sample of domestic equity open-end mutual funds studied
in the paper. The sample period is 1994–2016. Illiq is the weighted-average of the square-root version of
Amihud (2002) across all stocks in the fund’s portfolio (Chen et al 2010). F lows is net flows during quarter
t scaled by TNA at the beginning of the six-month reporting period. Fund flows are winsorized at the 5th
and 95th percentiles. T urnover is the minimum of purchases and sales, divided by the monthly average size
of the portfolio. σ(F lows) is the standard deviation of monthly net flows during the semi-annual reporting
period. Shorting/Options/Other are indicators for funds that engage in securities lending/shorting/trading
of options and other derivatives and other investment practices specified in question 70 of form N-SAR.
Internalization proxies are value-weighted averages across fund positions of the product of a) the fund
holdings of a security, divided by its average daily dollar trading volume, and b) holdings of the security by
either other funds managed by the same portfolio manager or other funds in the same family, also divided
by the security’s average trading volume. For funds with multiple portfolio managers, holdings are split
evenly across individual portfolio managers. In calculating Family internalization without manager, we add
up holdings by all other family funds, excluding funds managed by the fund’s portfolio managers.

                    Flow Management and Propensity to Internalize Price Impact

This table reports the results of regressions of the change in the cash-to-assets ratio over the semi-
annual reporting period on quarterly fund flows interacted with internalization proxies:

where f indexes funds and t indexes quarters. Cash-to-assets ratio is expressed in percent. Fund Internalize
captures the fund’s propensity to internalize the price impact it may impose on either the other funds
managed by the fund’s portfolio manager (columns 1–2) or other funds within the same fund family
(columns 3–6). Columns 3–4 consider all funds within the family, while columns 5–6 restrict the calculation
of internalization to family funds that are not managed by the same portfolio managers. Raw values of
Fund Internalize are converted into decile rankings within each quarter. Illiq is the weighted-average of the
square-root version of Amihud (2002) across all stocks in the fund’s portfolio (Chen et al 2010). Raw values
of Illiq are standardized so that the coefficients represent the effect of a one standard deviation change in
portfolio illiquidity. Standard errors are adjusted for clustering by fund. ∗, ∗∗, and ∗ ∗ ∗ indicate statistical
significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%.

                             Flow Management: Alternative Explanations

This table shows the robustness of the results in Table 3 to alternative explanations for the relation
between internalization proxies and a fund’s propensity to accommodate fund flows through changes in cash.
For each regression we report the β2 coefficient on the interaction of fund flows during quarter t with the
beginning of the semi-annual period value of the internalization proxy indicated by the column heading. All
additional controls, except for returns, are interacted with quarterly fund flows. All specifications include
objective-time fixed effects. Standard errors are adjusted for clustering by fund. ∗, ∗∗, and ∗ ∗ ∗ indicate
statistical significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%.

where f indexes funds and t indexes quarters. The sample consists of funds whose portfolio managers go
from managing a single fund to managing multiple funds. The sample is limited to observations within 24
months of the fund manager getting a new fund to manage. Post is a dummy variable equal to one for
months after the fund’s portfolio manager is appointed in charge of another fund. TNA of the new fund
is required to be at least 5% (columns 1–2), 15% (columns 3–4), or 25% (columns 5–6) of the TNA of the
original fund. For funds with multiple portfolio managers, fund assets are split equally across the fund’s
managers. For each fund we keep the first treatment event during the 1994–2016 period. Standard errors
are adjusted for clustering by fund. ∗, ∗∗, and ∗ ∗ ∗ indicate statistical significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%.

In other words, target’s funds are included for mergers in which the acquirer accounts for at least 50% of the
combined 13F assets. Symmetrically, acquirer’s funds are included for mergers in which the target accounts
for at least 50% of the combined 13F assets. In columns 5–8, the relative cutoff is 25%. In columns 1–2 and
5–6, the sample consists of target’s funds only. In columns 3–4 and 6–8, the sample consists of both target

                                   Internalization and Stock Volatility

This table reports the results of regressions of stock volatility during quarter t + 1 on stock-level
measures of internalization:

                      V ols,t+1 = αs + αt+1 + β · StockInternalizes,t + γ 0 Xs,t + εs,t+1 ,

where s indexes stocks and t indexes quarter dates. StockInternalize is the value-weighted average of fund-
level internalization calculated over all funds holding stock s. Fragility is the diagonal version of Greenwood
and Thesmar (2011) stock fragility measure. Following Greenwood and Thesmar (2011), the sample consists
of stocks with market capitalization above the NYSE median. Stocks with a mutual fund share of less
than 10% are excluded. The sample period is 1994–2016. Continuous variables other than internalization
are standardized so that their coefficients represent the effect of a one-standard deviation change in each
variable. Standard errors are adjusted for clustering by stock. ∗, ∗∗, and ∗ ∗ ∗ indicate statistical significance
at 10%, 5%, and 1%.

                          Fund Returns, Flow Pressure, and Internalization

This table reports the results of regressions of monthly fund returns on the flow pressure experienced by
other funds holding the same securities as fund f :

Rf,m = α + β0 · P ressf,m + β1 · P ress × CoHolderInternalizef,m + β2 · CoHolderInternalizef,m−1 + εf,m ,

where f indexes funds and m indexes months. Pressf,m is weighted-average fund flows experienced during
month m by other funds holding the same securities as fund f . First, for each security s held by fund f at the
end of the previous quarter, we calculate weighted-average fund flows into all other funds holding security s.
The weights are each fund’s holding of security s, relative to the security’s market capitalization. Second,
we calculate the weighted-average across all securities held by fund f . P ress × CoHolderInternalizef,m is
constructed similarly to P ressf,m except that each fund’s flow is multiplied by the fund’s internalization,
expressed as the decile rank of the distribution of internalization for that quarter. The sample period is 1994–
2016. Standard errors are adjusted for clustering by fund. ∗, ∗∗, and ∗ ∗ ∗ indicate statistical significance at
10%, 5%, and 1%.

                           Coholder Internalization and Fund Performance

This table reports the results of regressions of buy-and-hold returns and volatility of daily fund
returns on coholder internalization:

                   Rf,t+1 = αobj(f ),t + αf + β · CoHolderInternalizef,t + γ 0 Xf,t + εf,t+1 ,

where f indexes stocks and t indexes quarter dates. In Panel A, the dependent variable is the volatility of daily
fund returns during the quarter. Volatility is annualized and expressed in percent. In Panel B, the dependent
variable is the buy-and-hold return during the quarter, expressed in percent. CoHolderInternalize is
the value-weighted average of StockInternalize for all stocks in the fund’s portfolio. StockInternalize
is the value-weighted average of F undInternalize across all funds holding a given stock. Raw values of
F undInternalize are converted into decile ranks within each quarter. All other continuous variables are
standardized so that their coefficients represent the effect of a one-standard deviation change in each variable.
Standard errors are adjusted for clustering by fund. ∗, ∗∗, and ∗ ∗ ∗ indicate statistical significance at 10%,
5%, and 1%.

where f indexes funds and t indexes time. Cash-to-assets ratio is expressed in percent. Raw values of
Fund Internalize are converted into decile ranks within each quarter. All other continuous variables are
standardized so that their coefficients represent the effect of a one-standard deviation change in each variable.
Illiq is the weighted-average of the square-root version of Amihud (2002) across all stocks in the fund’s
portfolio (Chen et al 2010). Standard errors are adjusted for clustering by fund. ∗, ∗∗, and ∗ ∗ ∗ indicate
statistical significance at 10%, 5%, and 1%.
