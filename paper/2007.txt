                    Tax Policy and International Competitiveness




                                     ABSTRACT




     This paper examines the interactions between tax policy,
international capital mobility, and international competitiveness. It
demonstrates that tax policies which stimulate national investment
without affecting national savings must inevitably lead to deterioration
in a country's trade balance in the short and intermediate run.   This
conclusion, which contradicts a great deal of popular rhetoric highlights
the importance of considering the macroeconomic as well as the
microeconomic aspects of tax changes.
      More generally, the effects of tax policies depend critically on
the extent of the international capital flows which they generate. The
paper examines the issue of international capital mobility both
theoretically and empirically.   A variety of considerations suggest that
while tax policies could generate large capital flows, governments pursue
policies which tend to inhibit capital flows following tax changes. This
makes the analysis of tax policies difficult.

      International considerations are coming to play an increasingly important

role in U.S. tax policy debates. Policy discussions of tax provisions bearing

on foreign investment in the United States and American investment abroad has

long focused on the competitiveness question. Recently reductions in taxes on

business investment have been advocated on the grounds that they will increase

American competitiveness. Excessive tax burdens are frequently blamed for the

poor international performance of some American industries. Indeed the

President's Commission on International Competitiveness recently urged

business tax relief as a major element in a strategy directed at improving the

trade position of the United States. Tax increases to reduce looming budget

deficits are often defended on the grounds that they will reduce trade

deficits.

     While economists have long recognized that increased international

competitiveness is not necessarily a good thing, because it is the mirror

image of a decline in a nation's terms of trade, it is nonetheless an

important policy goal. An analysis of the interrelationships between tax

policy and competitiveness therefore seems worthwhile. This paper provides

such an analysis stressing the crucial role of capital mobility in determining

the impact of tax reforms on an economy's traded goods sector. I begin by

examining theoretically the relationship between tax changes and

competitiveness under various assumptions about international capital

mobility. Finding the conclusions sensitive to assumptions about capital

mobility, I go on to consider empirically the extent of international capital

mobility. Drawing on both the theoretical and empirical analysis, I attempt
                                     -2-


to assess the likely impact of alternative tax reforms on international corn—

petit iveness.

     The common assumption that capital flows freely internationally leads to

striking conclusions regarding the effects of tax policies. Tax measures

which stimulate investment but do not affect savings will inevitably lead to

declines in international competitiveness as long as capital is freely mobile

internationally. The economic mechanism is simple. Measures which promote

investment attract funds from abroad leading to an appreciation in the real

exchange rate and a reduction in the competitiveness of domestic industry.

The accounting identity holding that the current account equals the difference

between national savings and national investment insures that increases in

investment ceteris paribus will be associated with decreases in the trade

balance. Conversely tax policies which promote savings but do not have a

direct impact on investment will improve trade performance.

     These results challenge the commonly expressed view that reductions in

tax burdens on business will improve competitiveness by enabling them to

undertake more productivity enhancing investment. They also raise an

interesting question in political economy. Why do firms in the traded goods

sector whose competitivenes will be hurt by the capital inf lows associated

with investment incentives lobby in favor of them? Consideration of this

question leads naturally to an examination of the premise of free

international capital mobility which underlies the arguments in the previous

paragraph. If capital is not internationally mobile, stimulus to investment

will not lead to capital inflows and therefore will not be associated with

trade balance deterioration.
                                     -3-


     While there certainly is a large pool of internationally mobile capital,

Feldstein and Horioka (1980) and Feldstein (1983) have pointed out an

important puzzle raised by the hypothesis of perfect international capital

mobility. This hypothesis would predict that there should be no systematic

relationship between domestic saving and investment rates, since capital can

flow freely. Yet looking across the OECD nations there is a very strong

positive correlation between savings and investment rates. Looking over long

periods of time cumulative current account deficits or surpluses are quite

small despite large variations in domestic savings rates. On a very consistent

basis, high savings countries are also high investment countries while low

savings countries like the United States have relative low rates of

investment.

     The observation that domestic savings and investment rates are strongly

associated can be interpreted as suggesting tax policies which raise savings

are likely to significantly increase domestic investment. Similarly, policies

directed at investment are unlikely to lead to permanent increases in

investment unless domestic savings are increased as well. Alternatively, as

many international economists argue, the cross-sectional correlation between

national savings and investment rates may be a statistical artifact which does

not call into question the international mobility of capital. Resolving the

issue requires that some interpretation of the close cross-sectional linkages

between national savings and investment be provided.

     I consider three alternative hypotheses regarding the apparent

international immobility of capital. The first is the hypothesis advanced by

Feldstein and Horioka that institutional and legal restrictions of a variety
                                     -4-


of types preclude substantial international capital flows. Second is a

possibility advanced by Obstfeld (1985) among others that the high correlation

between domestic savings and investment rates is an artifact of common factors

such as high population growth which affect both savings and investment. The

third hypothesis is that capital is mobile internationally but that countries

systematically utilize economic policy tools in an effort to achieve

approximate current account balance so that large sustained capital flows are

not observed. My conclusion is that the third hypothesis provides the most

satisfactory available explanation for the observed correlations between

domestic savings and investment rates.     I suggest several reasons why

countries might find it desirable to maintain external balance.

     This conclusion raises an important question. Given that policies to

limit net capital mobility are frequently pursued, how should the effects of

tax policy reforms which affect savings or investment be evaluated? If no

other policy measures are undertaken, their effects should be analyzed under

the assumption that capital is perfectly mobile. But the historical record

suggests that current account imbalances are likely to be offset by other

policy actions. Both these issues have obvious relevance to the current

American situation where business tax reductions appear to have stimulated a

significant amount of capital formation and drawn capital in from abroad in

large quantity; but where the trade deficit is seen as a major problem.

     The paper is organized as follows. The first section examines

theoretically the effects of alternative tax policies on competitiveness under

Different assumptions about international capital mobility. It suggests some

possible explanations for the paradox that firms in traded goods industries
                                          —5—


frequently support tax policies that seem likely to reduce competitiveness.

The second section takes up the question of the extent of international

capital mobility and documents the very high correlation between domestic

savings and investment rates across the OECD nations. The third section

considers alternative hypotheses regarding this phenomenon and concludes that

 it   is   most likely the result of national economic policies directed at

maintaining external balance. Possible reasons why nations might pursue such

policies are considered. The fourth and final section considers the implica-

tions of the results for tax policy in general and the current American

situation in particular.



I.     Tax Policy in an Open Economy


       This section examines theoretically the effects of various tax policies

in an open economy where capital is mobile. In considering taxation in an

open economy it is crucial to distinguish between taxes on savings and

investment. As I use the terms here, taxes on savings refer to taxes on

capital income received by home country residents regardless of where the

capital is located. The U.S. interest income tax is an example of such a tax.

Conversely, taxes on investment refer to taxes levied on capital within the

home country regardless of its ownership. The corporate income tax is an

example of an investment tax. In closed economies it is clear that there is

no important difference between savings and investment taxes. But in open

economies where capital flows are possible they will have quite different

effects. The model presented below makes it possible to analyze the short and
                                    -6—


long run effects of both pure savings and investment taxes. There are a

variety of complexities involved in mapping real world tax structures with

their complex foreign tax credit and deferral provisions into the pure savings

and investment taxes treated here. I bypass these problems.

     The main conclusions of the formal analysis presented below may be

motivated by considering the national income accounting identity S-I = X-M.

This identity holds that the trade balance (X-M) must equal the excess of

domestic savings over investment. Equivalently, as the balance of payments

must balance, the current account (X-M) must be just offset by the capital

account (S-I). It is apparent from this identify that policies which increase

national investment without increasing national savings must necessarily lead

to increases in imports or decreases in exports. In either event, the traded

goods sector of the economy will contract. Conversely policies which increase

national savings without affecting national investment will improve the

current account and, in a fully employed economy, lead the traded goods sector

to expand.

     These results apply in the short and intermediate run. Ultimately, they

will be reversed. Consider again the case where investment is increased with no

change in savings. Foreigners who finance the excess of investment over

savings will accumulate claims on the domestic economy. Ultimately these

claims must be paid back and this will require that the home country run a

trade surplus, exporting more than it imports. Similarly, increases in

domestic savings without changes in investment will lead ultimately to trade

deficits as domestic residents liquidate their claims on foreign economies.

Modelling the Linkages between Tax Policy and Competitiveness

     While a number of studies, notably Feldstein and Hartman (1980) and

Hartman (1983) have examined the effects of tax policy on capital intensity,

they have assumed that there is only one internationally produced good making

it impossible to study issues relating to competitiveness. Goulder, Shoven

and Whalley (1983) examine the implications of international capital mobility

within the context of a computable general equilibrium model and show that

international considerations can have important implications for tax policy.

Because the model they consider is not grounded in intertemporal optimization,

it is not possible to distinguish the short and long run effects of tax

policies. Lipton and Sachs (1983) examine a two country growth model with two

sectors producing traded and non-traded goods and with an investment function

based adjustment costs. Their model is sufficiently complex that it must be

solved by numerical simulation.

     Here I follow very closely Bruno (1982) and less closely Sachs (1981,

1982) in considering a two period model in which the first period corresponds

to the short run and the second period corresponds to the long run.

Consideration of a more realistic infinite horizon model would be analytically

 intractable.   I treat the case of a small open economy which takes both the

price of the traded good and the interest rate as given.    The analysis could

be modified to treat the case of an economy large enough to affect world

 markets.

      Consider a two commodity, two period framework. Tradeables Qf are

 produced in each period according to the production function Q =   Qf(LK)
 which is assumed to have constant returns to scale. The non-tradeable

 domestic good d is produced with the constant returns to scale production
                                                     —8-


function       =                       The price of tradeables is taken as the numeraire
                    Qd(LIK).
and price of the domestic good is denoted ir.                   Increases in ii correspond to

real appreciations of the local currency. Production of tradeable goods is

allocated between consumption Cf ,               investment I, and net exports X which may be
negative. Production of non-tradeable goods is divided between private

consumption Cd and public consumption G. It is examined further below. The

assumed sectoral specialization of investment and government spending

simplifies the analysis, and does not alter the basic conclusions.

      Total labor supply in each period is fixed at [t, ([t =
                                                                                  L + L).   Total

capital is fixed in the first period and cannot be reallocated between

sectors. First period investment or disinvestment augments the second period

capital stock. (K -                +      - Kf   =   I).    Since for simplicity it is assumed

that capital does not depreciate, it is reasonable to allow I to be ne9ative.

No new capital goods are produced in the second period since it represents

posterity.

      Firms maximize the present value of after corporate tax profits:

             PV =
                        (1-T)[Q   +   ir1Q - w1L1    +
                                                           R1(Q+ir2Q-w2L2))
                                                                              -   Ii
where R =    (1+r).       Note that since capital does not depreciate the firm is

allowed no tax depreciation allowances. Maximization subject to the

production functions and factor accumulation constraints yields standard first

order conditions:

where equality of first period marginal products at the point Kd, Kf has been

assumed •1

      At this point, we are ready to examine the implications of a corporate

tax change for factor and product prices in the long run. Figure 1 depicts

the factor price frontiers in the two sectors under the assumption that the

traded goods sector is more capital intensive. Production occurs at the

intersection of the two frontiers. The relative price of the non-traded good,

r, shifts until the factor price frontiers intersect at the world interest

rate. Now consider a corporate tax increase. The factor price frontier for

the tradeable good does not shift but the required pre-tax return on capital

is increased from        to R°/1-T. This necessitates a change in ir to shift the

domestic goods factor price frontier. It is clear from Figure 1 that under

our assumption that the traded good sector is more capital intensive than the

non-traded goods sector, a corporate tax will lower capital intensity in both

sectors and reduce the relative price of domestic goods, thereby causing the

traded goods sector to contract. The last result would be reversed if the

opposite factor intensity assumption was maintained.

      Learner (1980) presents some rather dated evidence on the relative capital

intensities of U.S. traded and non-traded goods in the context of a study of

the Leontief paradox. His data, drawn from Leontief's original work, indicate

that the traded goods sector is much more capital intensive than the

non-traded goods sector. However he notes that the more recent data provided

in Baldwin (1971) suggests the opposite conclusion. At present, I am unaware
                                                  -10-


of more satisfactory evidence on this question for the United States. It

seems appropriate to be agnostic in the relative capital intensity question

and to conclude that capital intensity effects will not lead to large effects

of tax policies on the long run composition of national output.

      As just demonstrated, it is possible to examine the impact of a corporate

tax change on factor and product prices in the long run without specifying

anything about product demands. In order to address the sectoral composition

of output and employment, and to consider short run issues, it is necessary to

specify how demand is determined. For simplicity, I assume that consumers

maximize a Cobb-Douglas utility function:

           U =            +                +             +
(3)                a1nC        (1-c)1nC        D(a1nC        (1—a)1nC]

where 0 is a discount factor, and a is the share of consumption-expenditure

devoted to the foreign good.

      Households maximize utility subject to their budget constraint which

holds that:


           C + 1T1C + ((1—e)R]1 (C +                         =
(4)                                                 nC)
where Q represents the present value of their endowment in terms of the

foreign good, and B is the tax rate levied on savings. Net household wealth fl

is given by:

(5)        Q =
                   (Q+ir1Q)
                                +
                                    ((1—9)R](Q+w2Q)
                                                                 — T -   I

where T = T1 +                = 7rG1 + R7r2G2 is the total cumulative revenue of the

government. Since C + Gt =               Q, it   follows that:

where it can be assumed that Qf is a negative function of it1.

       At this point we are ready to solve the model using the very ingenious

graphical technique developed in Bruno (1982). Equation (6) and the

assumption of Cobb-Douglas utility imply that:

(7)         lT1C = bcl[7r1, R(1-9) G2)


The bQ function is negatively related to all three of its arguments. It is

plotted as the line marked bl in Figure 2.              In order to characterize first

period equilibrium we add a supply function for the total value of Cd:

(8)         ir1C =               -   ir1G'.
                     ir1Q(ir1)

This curve is also depicted in quadrant I of Figure 2.

       Together these two schedules already permit us to characterize the

determination of first period equilibrium. Note that any policy which reduces

first period consumption such as a reduction in the individual tax rate 0,

will lead to a reduction in it1 and an increase in the size of the tradeable

goods sector. Likewise a decrease in public consumption will lead to a

reduction in it, and an increase in competitiveness.

      In what follows it will be useful to examine the behavior of domestic

savings S. Note that S1 =              -        Given our assumption of Cobb-Douglas
                                 Yf        C.
utility,      is proportional to irC. Drawing in the schedule Yf(ir1) where

  =   (1-a)/(a),   we can see that savings is proportional to the vertical distance

between this schedule and the bc schedule. Note that the                 schedule is

steeper than the bQ schedule because b <            .
      We are now ready to consider second period equilibrium and the

determination of investment. The determination of second period factor

and product prices has already been discussed. These serve to uniquely

determine capital-labor and capital-output ratios in both sectors. In

quadrant 2 of Figure 2, the relationship between ir2C2d and K2 is depicted.

The slope of this schedule increases with the period 2 capital output ratio

and the intercept is 2o2. It is possible to put ir1C and ir2C on the same

axis because they are proportional by the Cobb-Douglas assumption.

       The requirement of full employment in period 2 is expressed as the

      The schedules in Figure 2 along with the factor price frontiers in

Figure 1 serve to fully characterize equilibrium. Notice finally that the

current account, CA, is given by S-I which can be read from Figure 2.


Savings Incentives

      At this point, we are ready to consider the effects of policy changes.

The effect of a decrease in period 1 public consumption is depicted in

Figure 3. As already noted, the relative price of non-tradeables, it,

declines.   Employment in the traded goods sector increases, while decreasing

in the non—traded sector. National savings increases. None of the schedules

in the other quadrants shifts. It is apparent that in the long run

K increases and     decreases. Since capital labor ratios are unchanged, it

follows that employment in the traded goods sector will decline in the long

run after its initial increase. Investment will increase (decrease) as the

traded goods sector is less (more) capital intensive than the non-traded goods

sector. As long as the non-traded goods sector is not "far" more capital

intensive than the traded goods sector, savings will increase more than

investment and a current account surplus will result.

     The effects of a decrease in 0, which reduces private consumption,

parallel those of a reduction in public consumption. They cannot be neatly

analyzed diagrammatically because a change in 9 breaks the proportionality

between      and ir2C. Note however that the effect of a savings incentive

will be to raise ir2C, and give rise to second period effects very similar to

those of a change in government spending. The traded goods sector will expand

in the short run and contract in the long run. Investment may rise or fall

but it is unlikely to change a great deal.


Investment Incentives

     The effects of an investment incentive, treated here as a decline in T,

are depicted in Figure 4. The solution is most easily achieved working

backwards. It is clear that with capital mobile, the long run effect of an

investment incentive will be to raise capital intensity in both production

sectors and to raise real wages. Thus the C2 schedule in the third quadrant

shifts downwards. The shift will be parallel in the special case depicted

here where the elasticities of substitution in the two sectors are equal. The

capital output ratio in the domestic goods sector must increase shifting the
                                     -14-


     schedule down and to the left. Finally, the increase in second period

real wages increases human wealth and shifts the bfl schedule in the first

quadrant upwards.

     The effect of an investment incentive is to reduce short run

competitiveness, and to reduce domestic savings. Long run capital intensity

is increased, so the current account unambiguously declines. An investment

incentive has an ambiguous effect on 1r2, the relative price of non-tradeables,

depending on the relative capital intensities of the two sectors. In the

special case where the two sectors have equal capital intensity, an investment

subsidy will increase long run employment in the traded goods sector. More

generally, however, the result is ambiguous.

     In assessing the implications of this theoretical analysis, a crucial

question arises. How much real time corresponds to the short and long run in

the stylized two period model considered here? The issue is difficult to

judge but it seems likely that the model's short run predictions are

applicable over fairly long horizons. Policies directed at increasing the

domestic capital stock are likely to lead to increased net investment for many

years as new capital is accumulated. The available evidence, while weak,

suggests that capital adjusts relatively slowly to its desired level. Likewise

simulations of the type presented by Summers (1979) and Chamley (1981) suggest

that households will take periods of up to a decade to fully adjust their

wealth holding following a change in the available rate of return. These

considerations suggest that with a horizon of a decade or less it is probably

appropriate to use the short run predictions of the economy to tax reforms.

The simulation results of Lipton and Sachs (1983) are consistent with this

suggestion.

The Political Economy of International Competitiveness

     The arguments of this section raise an obvious question. Why is business

tax relief so frequently advocated as a vehicle for increasing international

competitiveness? The analysis here suggests that tax reduction measures,

which encourage investment, inevitably reduce competitiveness and hurt firms

in the traded goods sector as long as capital is mobile internationally. In

part, advocacy of tax relief must result from a failure to consider its

general equilibrium ramifications. With fixed real exchange rates, tax relief

does help the traded goods sector. Its advocates may fail to take account of

the increase in real exchange rates that necessarily accompanies capital

inflows. But economists should be reluctant to assume that self interested

parties are advocating positions contrary to their interests. It is therefore

worthwhile to consider other reasons why those in the traded goods sector

might advocate tax relief.

     A first possibility is that they are motivated by long run

considerations. Accumulating debt to foreigners will eventually require that

we run a trade surplus. But it seems unlikely that such a long run

consideration plays an important role in current policy debates. A second

explanation starts with the recognition that the traded goods sector is not

monolithic. Tax reforms which benefit firms in some but not all of the traded

goods sector may cause their competitiveness to increase even as the total

traded goods sector is shrinking. It might for example be argued that

incentives to invest in plant and equipment benefit American manufacturers at

the expense of farmers. The corporate sector is so large a fraction of the

traded goods sector that it seems unlikely that this is the whole story.
                                      -16-


    A third explanation for the advocacy of investment incentives to increase

competitiveness is that advocates suspect that investment incentives will not

in fact lead to prolonged capital inflows. This may be because capital

mobility is limited and so investment incentives will lead to only small

capital inflows. Alternatively, it may be because governments are perceived

as unlikely to permit large trade deficits to continue for long periods of

time. In either of these cases, tax incentives will raise the after tax

profits of firms in the traded goods sector and will not lead to significant

declines in competitiveness.   I explore the question of the extent of

international capital mobility in the remainder of the paper.



II. National Savings and National Investment


     The preceding section demonstrated that the assumption of perfect

international capital mobility has important implications for the analysis of

competitiveness. It also is important for other fiscal questions. With

internationally mobile capital, taxes on investment will all be borne by

labor. Government budget deficits will not affect national levels of

investment, but will instead reduce investment around the world. More

generally, policies which increase national savings will have no effect on

national investment.

     In provocative recent papers, Feldstein and Horioka (1980) and Feldstein

(1983) point out that if national savings do not affect national investment as

the capital mobility hypothesis implies, one would not expect to see any

strong relationship between national savings and investment rates. Yet, as
                                     —17—


Table 1 demonstrates, there is a very close association between levels of

national savings and national investment. While the long run average net

savings rate varied across countries between 6.5 and 19.6 percent, the largest

average current account deficit was 8.3 percent and the largest surplus was

only 2.3 percent. The correlation between domestic savings and investment

rates was .92.

     Table 2 presents regressions of the national investment rates on national

savings rates for a number of different intervals. Using both net and gross

measures, the data suggest a strong relationship between investment and

savings.2 In all cases, the savings variable is highly significant. It is

noteworthy that there is no evidence that the impact of national savings on

national investment has declined through time, even though institutional

barriers to international capital mobility have been broken down over the past

25 years. There is some evidence however that the correlation between savings

and investment rates has declined through time.

     Comparisons of the size of actual capital flows with those that might be

expected highlight the apparent immobility of capital. Consider a policy

which raises the return on domestic investment by 20 percent. This is about

the right order of magnitude for the 1981 and 1982 United States tax reforms.

Assuming a Cobb-Douglas production function with a capital share of .25, an

increase of about 20 percent in the capital stock would be required to

equalize the return on domestic and international investment. With a capital

output ratio of 1.5, this would mean a capital inflow of close to 30 percent

of GNP. Only one OECD nation, Portugal, experienced a capital inflow of this

magnitude over the 1975-1981 period. Stating the point differently --    the
                                     -18-


capital flows that are observed do not seem to be large enough to have very

large effects on rates of return.

     A number of papers including Sachs (1981, 1982), Feldstein (1983), and

Caprio and Howard (1984) have examined the relationships between changes in

domestic savings and investment rates. While the approaches taken in these

papers differ somewhat, several conclusions emerge. There is a positive

relationship between changes in domestic savings and changes in domestic

investment which is weaker than the relationship between savings and

investment levels. Also, it appears that both shocks to domestic savings and

to domestic investment have significant effects on the current account

although their relative importance is a subject of debate. Finally, there is

very weak evidence that the degree of international capital mobility has

increased somewhat in recent years. But, none of the time series analysis

calls into question the proposition that domestic savings and investment rates

are closely linked.

     One consideration that could account for some degree of association

between domestic savings and investment rates is the fact that countries are

not perfectly "small" on the world capital market. A share of each country's

savings would be invested in it, even if capital was perfectly mobile.     It

seems unlikely that this can account for a large part of the correlation

between savings and investment rates. Even for the United States, a dollar of

savings would be expected to produce only about 25 or 30 cents of domestic

investment if capital were really perfectly mobile. Moreover, this point has

no force in considering the cross-sectional association between domestic

savings and investment rates.
                                     -19-


     Another possible source of association between domestic savings and

investment is Keynesian effects. Increases in investment which raise domestic

income temporarily would be expected to increase domestic savings as well.

The fact that savings and investment rates are about equally highly correlated

over short and long periods of time suggests that this is not likely to be too

important a factor.

     It is not clear how to interpret the observation that savings and

investment rates are highly correlated across countries. The questions of

policy interest concern the allocation of the marginal dollar of domestic

savings, or the financing of a marginal dollar of domestic investment. It is

conceivable that incremental savings are invested in a very different way than

the average dollar of savings. The fact that the linkages between changes in

savings and changes in investment are weaker than those between levels

suggests this view. An argument of this kind must explain however why ongoing

capital flows are not observed between countries with stable high and low

savings rates. In the next section we consider alternative explanations for

the close association between savings and investment rates across nations.

These explanations have differing implications for the hypothesis of marginal

capital mobility and for the effects of fiscal policies.



III. Explaining Apparent Capital Mobility


     The previous section documented the very high correlation between

national savings and investment rates. This section considers three possible

explanations for this phenomenon. These explanations assume in turn that
                                     -20—


capital mobility is greatly limited by institutional factors, that the

correlation between national savings and investment rates is a spurious

reflection of third factors, and that apparent capital immobility reflects the

endogenous adjustment of savings and investment rates. While there is some

element of truth in each of these explanations we are led to accept the third

one as the primary reason for the close association of domestic savings and

investment rates.


Capital Immobility

     A first natural explanation for the observed savings and investment

patterns is that most capital is immobile. While some capital can flow

freely, restrictions in financial institutions, capital controls, and the

perceived risks of foreign investment, greatly reduce the flow of capital. As

Feldstein and Horioka (1960) suggest,

     "official restrictions impede the export of capital. Moreover the fear
     of future capital export controls by potential host countries.. .deters
     investors.... Important institutional rigidities also tend to keep a
     large segment of domestic savings at home. The most obvious of these in
     the United States is the savings institutions that are required by law to
     be invested in mortgages on local real estate."

     There is, of course, a large pool of very liquid international capital.

The argument, however, is that only this money is freely mobile with other

savings being immobile. This raises an immediate problem. If only a small

pool of "hot money" were available to arbitrage large international return

differentials, one would expect that it would all end up in one place. As

long as some mobile funds are located almost everywhere there is a presumption

that rates of return must be equalized.

     The related argument of Feldstein and Horioka that returns on short term
                                     —21—


financial assets are arbitraged but returns on longer term investments are not

equalized is also difficult to accept. Arbitrage like equality is transitive.

As long as there are institutions in each country (e.g., Citibank) which hold

different types of domestic assets and also hold some foreign asset, we can be

sure that the returns on domestic and foreign assets are arbitraged.

Equalization of returns does not require that there be any agent who makes

long term investments both at home and abroad. As long as the standard

assumption of marginal domestic capital mobility is maintained, the existence

of investors at interior solutions holding any domestic and any foreign assets

is sufficient to insure marginal capital mobility on an international basis.3

     A clear piece of evidence suggesting the mobility of capital

internationally is the fact that the relatively small net flows of capital

that are observed reflect large offsetting gross flows. If capital were

immobile one would expect to see small gross as well as net flows.

Unfortunately data on foreign investment by domestic firms and domestic

investment by foreign firms are not available on a consistent international

basis. Therefore, Table 3 presents some information on gross and net flows of

investment for the United States. In 1982, both capital inflows and outflows

for the U.S. were more than ten times the net flow of capital. Even these

figures underestimate the true flows because they fail to take account of

replacement investment by Americans abroad and foreigners here.

     Large reciprocal gross investment flows also call into question

Feldstein's (1983) argument that subjective uncertainties inhibit capital

flows. Feldstein and Horioka argue that foreign investment is typically

directed at exploiting specialized opportunities rather than the general
                                      —22—




pursuit   of higher returns. This claim is difficult to reconcile with the

large volume of portfolio investment and with Hartman's (1983) demonstration

that foreign direct investment is very sensitive to tax considerations.

Recall that no foreign direct investment is necessary for international

arbitrage to equalize returns. Even granting that direct foreign investments

represent special situations, it is still reasonable to expect that increased

domestic savings which reduce domestic rates of return would lead to more

specialized foreign investments.

     This discussion suggests that there exist capital flows which seem to

have the potential to equalize rates of return around the world. A more

subtle explanation for capital immobility, which accommodates this

observation, might suggest that total net capital mobility is limited by fears

of expropriation. This is the essential idea lying behind the burgeoning

literature on international debt. It was first treated formally by Eaton and

Gersovitz (1981). While capital can be freely moved, investors are aware that

if a country has imported too much capital, the gains from expropriating it

will exceed the costs that can be imposed.   In this case, marginal investors

will not invest abroad even if foreign assets are yielding higher returns. At

the margin, capital will be immobile. Changes in domestic saving will affect

international capital flows only insofar as they affect countries' debt

capacity by affecting the size of the "punishment" that can be inflicted on

them for defaulting.

     It would seem likely that arguments of this type would be more applicable

to LOCs than to the OECD nations, where expropriations seem implausible. One

way of testing this explanation for apparent capital immobility is to examine
                                         —23—


the association between savings and investment across a broad range of

countries. If expropriation fears were a major cause of capital immobility,

one would expect to see savings and investment rates even more closely

associated among LDCs than among the OECD nations. This hypothesis was tested

by examining data on national savings and investment rates for 115 countries

using data provided by the World Bank.

     A regression of investment rates on savings rates using data arranged

over the 1973-80 perIod yields:


          I/V   18      +    .311(S/Y)           R2 — .24
                (1.1)       (.051)


These results were almost unchanged *hen the OECD countries were excluded from

the sample. As a further check, the equation was reestimated dropping

observations with large residuals from the sample. Observations with residuals

with absolute value greater than two and three times the standard error of the

regression were omitted. This did not have a significant Impact on the

results. One possible explanation for the low correlation between savings and

investment is that aid flows drive a wedge between Investment and savings even

though capital is Immobile. However, subtracting aid flows from investment

had little Impact on the results. It might be argued that the low correlation

between domestic savings and investment is the result of measurement error.

This seems unlikely. In most cases1 domestic savings Is estimated as a

residual. When this method is used, measurement error may result in a

spurious positive correlation between measured savings and investment.

     The results suggest a much greater degree of apparent capital mobility
                                       —24-


when a large sample of countries is considered. Similar results are reported

by Fieleke (1982) and Frankel (1985). This provides evidence against the

hypothesis of capital immobility which offers exactly the wrong predictions --

that   capital should be most mobile between politically allied developed

countries with well functioning capital markets.

       It does not seem reasonable to conclude that capital immobility is the

right way to explain the close association between national savings and

investment rates.    I therefore turn to other explanations.


Common Factor Explanations

       Another possible explanation for the close association between national

savings and investment rates is the fallacy of the common cause. Perhaps

there is some third factor which determines both savings and investment

leading them to be highly correlated, even though exogenous changes in savings

would have only very small effects on investment. Two such factors suggest

themselves. Countries with high rates of population or productivity growth

would be expected to have high investment rates because of the opportunities

created by a rapidly growing labor pool. Life cycle savings considerations

suggest that such countries should also have high savings rates, as young

savers are more numerous and have more lifetime income than older dissavers.

Thus growth could be a common factor accounting for associations between

savings and investment. Obstfeld (1985) provides a rather elaborate example

illustrating this point.

       A second factor which could lead to a positive association of savings and

investment is initial wealth. A clear example is provided by a nation ravaged
                                                 —25—


by war. Such a country would be expected to have a high investment rate

because of the destruction of its capital stock, and a high savings rate

because of households' desire to rebuild their wealth holdings. Any source of

initial differences in           national   wealth income ratios would tend to work the

same way.

        The growth explanation for the strong association between savings and

investment rates is easily tested. It is only necessary to add measures of

the rate of growth to a regression of the investment rate on the savings

rate.

        A regression of the net investment rate on the net savings rate and the

rates of population growth and productivity growth using the data in Table 1

yields:


             I/Y =   -.015   +    1.02 Sly - .002n    +    .0026g     R2 = .703
                     (.023) (1.39)            (.01)       (.001)


Similar results are obtained reversing the equation, using gross rather than

net concepts and varying the sample period. Adding growth variables actually

increases the coefficient on S/Y. This implies that variations in savings

that are uncorrelated with variations in growth actually have more relation to

investment than variations explained by the growth variables. Growth is not

the spurious factor accounting for the strong correlations between national

savings and investment rates.

        There is no single variable which can capture the possible effects of

initial conditions on both savings and investment. Therefore it is necessary

to take a more indirect approach. Estimating the basic investment—savings
                                                -26-


relationship with instrumental variables, using as instruments any variable

expected to affect savings but not investment, will yield a consistent

estimate of the "pure" correlation between savings and investment. Feldstein

and Horioka report a number of estimates of this type using social security

variables as instruments. They find that this has little effect on the

estimated savings coefficient. Indeed, in several cases it actually

increases. Frankel (1985) presents some corroborating evidence.

       In order to further examine this issue, the basic savings investment

relationship was reestimated using the government budget deficit as an

instrument. Because of data limitations, a smaller sample (14 countries) and

a shorter time period (1973—80) were used in the estimation. For this sample

the net result of an OLS regression was:


            I/Y = .02 + .97 (S/Y)
                 (.03) (.13)


Using the government deficit as a share of GOP as an instrument, the result

was:


            I/V =   -.10   +   1.45     (S/Y)
                               (1.10)


This result is surprising. The coefficient on the savings variable rises

substantially rather than declining. It attains an implausible value

exceeding one. On the "spurious factor" explanation, one would have expected

the savings coefficient to decline.

       There is no evidence here to support the "spurious factor" explanation

for the close association of national savings and investment rates. But the
                                             -27—


last equation does raise a puzzle. Why should purging the savings and

investment variables of the effects of their common causes cause their

estimated association to increase? Clearly the answer must have something to

do with the properties of the deficit variable. This issue is explored in the

next subsection.


The Maintained External Balance Hypothesis

      The assumption has been made so far that national savings and investment

rates are exogenously determined. Feldstein and Horioka treat differences

in national savings rates as a consequence of "basic structural differences

among countries." In their formal model (p. 324), the level of public savings

is an exogenous variable affecting the national savings rate.

      An alternative view is that countries consistently manipulate the levels

of economic policy with a view to maintaining external balance. Such an

argument has been made by Fieleke (1982) and Tobin (1983) among others. In

this case capital appears immobile only because countries pursue policies

which bring savings and investment into balance. Possible rationales for this

behavior are discussed below.

      The endogeneity of budget policy can easily explain the empirical results

in the preceding section. Consider the special case where capital is

completely mobile on world markets and countries set budget deficits according

to:



(9)        Di = a(PS1 —   I)   +   U. with   0      a   1



where D1 is the deficit, PS., is private saving, and u. represents the effect

of other factors on the deficit of country i. The assumption that deficits
                                                    -28-


are exogenous corresponds to a = 0 in this formulation. Standard

calculations suggest that the coefficient on saving in our basic equation will

equal:

                                                     +
(1               —                    (l_a)apsi          cw
             OLS —             2 2        2 2                       2
                                      +   a     +               +
                     (1-a)
                                                    2a(1-a)a1

Notice   that in the special case where a = 1 and                   =   0,   6 =   1, and that
with Feldstein and Horioka's implicit assumptions that a 0 and                               =   0

in a perfect capital market, & =              0.    As these polar cases suggest, increases

in a and reductions in               will tend to raise the value of 6. Direct

estimation of (9) yields:


(11)       0. =
             1
                  -.01     +     .715 (PS.-I.)
                                         1  1
                                                                    = .77
                  (.004)        (.107)                              = .00024


Using this estimated value of a and the observed sample moments

tautologically yields the OLS estimate for 6.                 If we reevaluate (10) assuming

that a = 0 and that a2 =         a, the       implied value of 6 is .597. This confirms

that some of the strength cf the Feldstein and Horioka results arises from

deficit policy actions directed at maintaining external balance. Note that

Feldstein (1983) admits that some positive association between PS. and I is

to be expected, arising from factors such as growth rates which simultaneously

impact both PS and I. And other policy levers besides deficits may be used

to bring savings and investment into balance. Hence the remaining correlation

of .6 should not be treated as evidence of the immobility of capital.

     The maintained external balance hypothesis also explains the paradoxical

results obtained when Di is used as an instrument. In this case, the

probability limit of the coefficient of interest is given by:

                                 a(1_a)a           a(1_2a)a,1

which will be greater than unity as long as:

          a(1—a) var (I-PS) >



The estimates of     and    reported above imply that this condition is

satisfied in practice.

     This section has shown that the maintained external balance hypothesis

can explain how the observed high correlation of national savings and

investment rates could occur in a world with perfect capital mobility. It

also explains an additional finding, the high degree of capital mobility

among less developed countries, which is anomalous on the view that capital is

internationally immobile. In these nations the pressure to maintain external

balance is much weaker, and so fiscal policy actions are not taken to prevent

capital flows. As a consequence, greater current account imbalances and

capital mobility are observed.

     The maintained external balance hypothesis seems on the basis of the

evidence considered here to be the most plausible explanation for the high

cross—sectional correlation between domestic savings and investment rates. By

its nature it is difficult to test, since levels of national savings and
                                     -30-


investment are affected by a wide variety of policy levers, and so the stance

of policy towards saving and investment in any given country is difficult to

evaluate. Below, I discuss a number of plausible reasons why nations might

seek to maintain external balance. The fact that countries so frequently

resort to capital controls which force savings and investment into balance

makes it very plausible that they also use other policy levers to achieve the

same purpose.

     Capital will be effectively immobile internationally if nations act so as

to avoid either capital outflows or capital inflows. Either would be

sufficient to preclude capital flows. Consider first the incentives nations

might have to avoid capital outflows. The fundamental reason why nations

might prefer to do this is that the social return to domestic investment

exceed the social return to foreign investment even when their private returns

are equated. Most obviously, this will be the case where there are taxes on

domestic investment. More subtly and more importantly, there is the risk

associated with capital expropriation by government action or by labor.4

Keynes (1924) puts the argument well:

     "Consider two investments, the one at home and the other abroad
     with equal risks of repudiation or confiscation or legislation
     restricting profit. It is a matter of indifference to the
     individual investor which he selects. But the nation as a whole
     retains in the one case the object of the investment and fruits of
     it; whilst in the other case both are lost. If a loan to improve
     South American capital is repudiated we have nothing. If a Poplar
     housing loan is repudiated, we as a nation still have the houses."


     Note that the phrase "legislation restricting profit" covers a host of

possibilities far short of outright nationalization. There is also the

possibility that capital expropriation will take the form of actions by
                                        —31—


 workers to raise wages and capture the rents that can be earned from

 irreversible capital investments. Together these Possibilities seem likely to

 be of substantial importance. They provide a motivation for countries which

 find themselves exporting capital on a substantial scale to pursue measures

 directed at spurring domestic investment.      In so far as they suggest that the
 social return to foreign investment
                                       may be rather low, they also suggest the

 possible desirability of reducing savings when they are primarily flowing

 abroad. Certainly this was Keynes's view regarding the huge British capital

outflows in the early part of this century.

      It is noteworthy in this regard that
                                               capital exporting nations tend to be
 large countries with substantial international
                                                   power. The British in the
Victorian era and the US during the post World War II period are obvious

examples. The current Japanese situation is less clear.       Where capital
Outflows are made by dominant international
                                                powers they may confer external
benefits which raise their social return by increasing international

influence. Large countries may also regard themselves as relatively immune

from expropriation risks. The striking feature of Table 2 is that almost all

of the small countries are capital
                                     importers. With large countries unwilling
to export capital in large quantities however, the scope for international

capital mobility is relatively limited.

     Keynes went on to provide an additional reason why a nation might want to

limit its capital exports.5 He wrote that

    "Foreign investment does not automatically expand our exports by a
    corresponding amount. it so affects the foreign exchanges that we
    are compel led to export more -in order to maintain our solvency.
    It may be the case--I fancy that it now is the case--that we can
    only do this by lowering the price of our products in terms of the
    products of other nations, that -is by allowing the ratio of real
    interchange to move to our disadvantage."
                                       —32-


    This consideration which is important only for countries with some market
                                      large capital outflows are so rare. A
power may also help to explain why
                                      efforts of the United States to limit
possible example is provided by the

capital outflows in the early 1960s in an effort to maintain the value of the

dollar. Whether the motivation for maintaining the value of the dollar was

enjoying favorable terms of trade is not clear.

     There are also reasons why countries would be reluctant to accept large

capital inf lows. Where these are associated with large movements in real

exchange rates, they are likely to damage severely an economy's traded goods
                                                  to increase domestic savings or
sector. This may generate political pressures

to reduce the rate of investment. These pressures are likely to be

particularly serious in situations where the real exchange rate changes

quickly or where the traded goods sector is not benefiting from the capital
                                                      inflows into Canada to
inflows. It should not be surprising that capital

finance development of its natural resources have proved more politically

 acceptable than recent inflows into the United States to finance budget

deficits.

      These arguments are suggestive as to why we see such a small volume of

 net international capital mobility. Evaluating their relative importance is

 left for future research. In the next section, we tentatively accept their

 validity and explore their implications for economic policy.

 IV.    Conclusions

        Our analysis of the historical experience of the last twenty years

 suggests that capital was internationally mobile but that governments acted so

 as to permit only relatively small capital flows. This makes it difficult to

 analyze the effects of tax policy changes. Such changes, if not accommodated

by other policies, would lead to significant capital flows with associated

 implications for competitiveness. But the historic record suggests that

policy changes would be adopted to maintain external balance. If such changes

are always adopted, capital is effectively immobile. National investment

cannot be increased without increasing national savings. The effect of any

policy depends on the policies it engenders. Consider, for example, an

investment tax credit. The resulting capital inflow would lead to a trade

deficit. If this created pressures which led to an increase in public

savings, the ultimate result would be more domestic investment and only small

effects on the traded goods sector. If, on the other hand, other countries

responded to their capital outflows by strengthening capital controls, the

result would be increased domestic interest rates and only relatively small

investment increases. In this case short run competitiveness might actually

be improved by investment tax incentives.

       Clearly there are no general principles which can be used to assess the

effects of different policies in all situations. Neither the analytic

benchmark of perfect capital mobility, nor the polar opposite assumption that

capital is immobile seems appropriate in assessing the effects of tax reforms.
                                    -34-


    These points are well illustrated by considering the current American

situation. The dollar is extremely strong, having risen by about 60 percent in

the last four years. This has led to the large trade and current account

deficits, which are regarded by many observers as a cause for grave concern.

Beyond the direct effects on industries producing traded goods, concerns are

expressed about the United States becoming a debtor nation, and about a

weakening in our national commitment to free trade. Following the Reagan tax

incentives, an increase of close to 25 percent in the capital stock would be

necessary to bring the after-tax return to capital back to its former level.

Since the United States is not a small country on the world capital market,

not all of these funds would come from abroad even if capital were perfectly

mobile. But with mobile capital, one would have to predict a cumulative

current account deficit in excess of 15 percent of GNP in response to the 1981

tax cuts. This is on top of any current account deficit attributable to

federal budget deficits. It seems unlikely that such large sustained capital

inflows will be allowed to materialize. Some combination of increased savings

through reduced budget deficits and expansionary monetary policy is likely to

be used to restore external balance. Thus, the recent u.s. experience is in a

sense the exception that proves the validity of the maintained external

balance hypothesis.

     Note finally that the maintained external balance hypothesis resolves the
                                                                            If
riddle of why firms producing traded goods favor investment incentives.

they expect these incentives to be coupled with other policies directed at

stabilizing the current account, they are rational in advocating investment

 incentives. This is true if investment incentives are accommodated by
                                    —35--



increased public savings expansionary monetary policies, or even protectionist

policies. This point may well be illustrated by the evolution of the U.S.

economy over the next few years.

1.     Note that the formulation here requires that capital invested in either

sector earn the world rate of return R in period 2. As Frankel (1985) has

stressed, there is no reason to expect that real interest rates measured

relative to a domestic price index which includes both tradeable and

non-tradeable goods will be equalized across countries. Indeed as long as

purchasing power parity fails as a description of exchange rate behavior, real

interest rates cannot be equalized measured both relative to price changes in

tradeable goods, and the domestic consumption basket. In the model considered

here despite capital mobility, there is not real interest rate equalization

measured in the standard way using general domestic price indices.

2.     There is no obvious reason for regressing investment on savings rather

than running the reverse regression. The interested reader can compute the

coefficient that would be obtained from the reverse regression by dividing the

reported coefficient into the regression's R2. The reverse regression

coefficients tend to be a little smaller than the reported coefficients.

3.     Zeira (1986) in a very perceptive analysis notes that this conclusion is

only correct if assets are perfect substitutes in individual portfolios. The

empirical   importance of this qualification is however open to question given
the findings of Frankel (1985) that the standard CAPM along with reasonable
assumptions regarding risk aversion implies that assets are in fact very close
substitutes.

4.     I am indebted to Jeff Sachs for bringing Keynes discussion of this issue

to   my attention.

 Current Account Balance*
                                                   4.5       —8.1
 Net Foreign Investment
                                                   4.1       —4.6
 Increase in U.S. Assets Abroad**
                                                 109.3      118.3
   (capital outflows)

Increase in Foreign Assets in the 1J.S.**         77.9       84.5
  (capital inflows)


 *The Current Account Balance and
                                  Net Foreign Investment are
conceptually the same, differing only by the allocations of SORs
("capital grants" in the NIPA) and some small definitional
differences.

**The net increase over the
                            year; that is, conceptually, the
difference between the value of assets at the end of the year
and the value at the 'ar's
                              beginning.
The reason that the difference of
                                  the gross flows is not equal
to the reported net flows is a Sizable statistical discrepancy.
