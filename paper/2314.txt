             Income Originating in the State and Local Sector




                                    ABSTRACT




       In this paper we develop an accounting framework for the state
and local sector which is consistent with the accounting framework for
the private sector of the economy. We show that the public sector cap-
ital stock generates an imputed return which takes the form of a re-
duction in local taxes and that failure to recognize this income distorts
the measurement of the output of this sector, confuses the debate over
federal tax reform, and hides the distinction between general subsidies
for capital formation. Our implementation of those accounts for the 1959-
1985 period indicates that current national income accounting procedures
misstate the amount of income originating in the state and local sector;
in recent years this misstatement has been on the order of $100 billion.
We also show that the state and local sector is one of the more capital
intensive sectors of the economy.

                                  I. Introduction



     Viewed as an industry, state and local governments constitute one of the

largest sectors of the U.S. economy.     In 1985, state and local governments

accounted for 8 percent of GNP and 13 percent of total employment, according

to data from the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts (NIPA). Only two

two-digit SIC industries, real estate and retail trade, contributed more to

GNP, and only retail trade accounted for more employment.

     State and local government is, however, not generally regarded as an

industrial sector of the economy. Whereas analysis of industry data proceeds

within the framework of production theory, analysis of the state and local

sector is typically based on the theory of demand. The theoretical literature

stresses problems of demand revelation for public goods (e.g., the literature

inspired by Tiebout), and the empirical literature is oriented toward

explaining the demand for public expenditures with a heavy emphasis on the

median voter model.

     This difference in perspective is doubtless the result of institutional

differences between the public and private sectors. Private goods are

exchanged in voluntary transactions between consumers and producers, and it

is natural to separate supply and demand decisions. Public sector goods, on

the other hand, are generally distributed directly to consumers and "paid

for" indirectly through taxation. Since supply decisions are made by

govErnments controlled by consumer-voters, it is easy to ignore the

distinction between production and consumption and to focus only on the

demand for public sector goods.



                                  1
   • This demand-side focus obscures some important supply-side aspects of the

state and local sector. In particular, the demand-side approach fails to

account for the income flows originating in the sector, and this failure has a

number of important implications. First, conventional measures of income

originating in the general component of the state and local sector only

include wages and salaries. Capital income is implicitly assumed to be zero,

despite the fact that (as we show below) this sector is one of the most

capital intensive in the U.S. economy. Consequently, NIPA dramatically

understates the relative size of the sector.

     Second, the failure to account for capital income obscures the true

nature of federal government subsidies. In the recent debate over federal tax

reform, termination of the tax exempt status of municipal bond interest and

the elimination of the deduction for state and local taxes were two options

considered. It was not generally recognized that the subsidy to the sector

arises from the nonrecognition of the "equity" income accruing to state and

local capital. State and local capital is treated like owner-occupied housing

under the federal tax code; the noninterest portion of income accruing to

capital is excluded from the tax base.

     Third, the demand-side approach to the state and local sector

cannot readily deal with the distinction between general subsidies, such as

the deductibility of state and local taxes and general revenue sharing, and

subsidies for capital formation, such as the exemption of municipal bond

interest and matching capital grant programs. This distinction is

important, because capital subsidies encourage the use of capital through

output and factor substitution effects while general subsidies only involve

output effects. The inability to distinguish between the two types of

subsidies is analogous to the inability to distinguish between excise taxes

and an investment tax credit in the private sector.



                                 2
     Fortunately, there is no inherent reason to exclude supply-side

considerations from the analysis of the state and local sector. As shown in

Hulten (1984), the production of public sector goods is analogous to the

production of household goods (including owner-occupied housing); capital,

labor, and intermediate inputs are purchased and transformed into output,

which is distributed directly within the household. There is no explicit

measure of output in either case, but in both cases a shadow value of output

is implicit in the maximization of utility subject to the relevant expenditure

constraint.

     This shadow valuation of output gives rise to an implicit system of

income and product accounts for the state and local sector. The purpose of

this paper is to develop this accounting framework. The remainder of the

paper has the following organization. In Section II, we develop a theoretical

model of a simple economy in order to clarify the role of capital income in

the state and local sector. Section III implements the accounting framework

developed in II. We present aggregate estimates of the gross output of state

and local governments for the 1959-1985 period and then compare them to the

estimates in NIPA. Section IV offers a brief summary and conclusions.




                                3
                      II. Theoretical Considerations



    Nearly all local public goods and services are provided directly to

consumers without charge and then financed indirectly through taxes. Since

these goods are not bought and sold in markets, no direct measure of the value

of the goods and services produced in this sector is available. It is

therefore impossible to develop independent measures of both sides of the

conventional accounting equation which relates the value of output to the

value of inputs.

     This observation does not, however, imply that it is impossible to

construct an appropriate income and product account for the state and local

sector. In this section of the paper we show that such a system of accounts

is implicit in standard optimization models of state and local governments.

In order to make our argument clear, we first develop a very general model of

a simple economy. We then add important institutional details to our model

which allow us to focus on the provision of local public goods.



A Static One Sector Model

     We begin with a one good model in which output Q is produced with

capital K and labor L via a production function QF(K,L). Under constant

returns to scale, Euler's equation yields Q — FKK+FLL, where FK and FL are

the marginal products of capital and labor. This expression implies a

rudimentary accounting framework which allocates the value of output to the

inputs since FK and FL can be interpreted as the shadow prices of capital

and labor.

     Profit maximization adds additional structure to this simple accounting

framework. If product and factor markets are perfectly competitive, then the

necessary conditions for profit maximization require firms to hire each input



                                 4
up to the point that the value of the marginal product of that input equals

its factor price. Thus FK —            and
                                             FL
                                                  L1Q where K L and       are

the prices of capital, labor, and output. Euler's equation then implies that



          (1) PQQ_PK+PLL


for each firm. Aggregating over firms yields the fundamental equation of

income and product accounting. It states that the value of output (revenue)

observed from market transactions equals the payment for capital services

(dividends, interest, rents, retained earnings, etc.) and the wage bill. This

equation therefore generates a simple "T" account and corresponds to Section

A, Table 1, of the U.S. National Income and Product Accounts.

     Households play two roles in such a model. First, they supply capital

and labor to firms. Second, these households purchase a quantity of Q which

satisfies the constraint that their expenditures equal the sum of their

capital and labor income. The aggregation of this budget constraint requires

that pQQ equals the sum of PKK and PLL and therefore generates a set of

personal income and outlay accounts which are analagous to Table 2 of Section

A of NIPA. Factor and goods prices are determined through the interaction of

supply and demand. We can characterize this economy with a familiar "circular

flow" diagram shown in Figure 1.

     This simple accounting model could be generated without the assumption of

optimizing behavior by tracking commodity and money flows between agents in

the economy. It is important to stress, however, that such a set of accounts

also arises from optimizing models where markets are not present. In an

optimally planned economy without money or markets, the clockwise flow of

commodities would be generated by the planners, but an implicit

counterclockwise flow of values exists via shadow prices implied by

public goods for which there are no explicit markets.



Intertemporal Aspects of the Simple Model

     The model presented in the preceding section is essentially static in

that the capital stock is fixed and the technology is constant. We can

introduce dynamic aspects into the model by allowing consumers to make

intertemporal decisions, either because they live for more than one period

or because they wish to leave a bequest to their heirs.

     In such a model, consumers can trade consumption in one period for

consumption in another by setting aside some of one period's output to

increase the stock of capital. Society faces two constraints. First, the

aggregate production function constraint in this model requires that Qt+I

F(Kt,L,t), where      is consumption at time t   and    is the amount of the

homogenous good set aside for investment. Second, society is constrained by

the identity that the stock of capital at the end of year t-'-l is equal to the

existing stock after depreciation plus any investment made during the year.

We assume that capital depreciates at a constant rate 6, and therefore the

perpetual inventory equation can be written1



          (2) K+i 1t +      (l6)K.

     The dynamic version of our simple model requires us to draw a distinction

between the asset price of capital and the user cost of capital. A consumer

who purchases a unit of capital for his portfolio pays the asset price P,

which in our one good model must equal the price of the consumption good P.

The replacement value of the capital stock held by the household sector, which

owns all factors of production, is therefore PKt.



                                 6
     The price of capital from the standpoint of the producer is the cost of

using (or, renting) one unit of the consumers' capital for one period. It is

this price, P, which is equated to the value of the marginal product of

capital under profit maximization.       is also the amount which is received by

households (in the form of dividends, interest, rents, etc.). Therefore, the

value of owning one unit of capital W is the present value of the P

generated over the life of the asset. Since capital depreciates at the rate

6, this must be given by2




                       (l&)1PK
           (3)
                            (l+r)T


The discount rate r in equation (3) is derived from the intertemporal utility

maximization problem and represents the tradeoff between consumption in

successive years. That is, the marginal rate of substitution between

consumption in year t and year t+l is l/(l+r). For simplicity, we assume that

r is constant.

     The capital values P and        are not necessarily equal. Tobin's

marginal "q" ratio is, indeed, defined as the ratio of the two values:



                  wt
     (4)
                   t


However, the optimal investment program implied by the optimization of the

intertemporal utility function has the property that, in the absence of

adjustment costs in changing the stock of capital, q — 1,    That is, the

value of the income generated by the stock of capital is equal to the




                                 7
reproduction cost of the stock.

     When                 If the economy is in equilibrium and therefore prices
                  W=P.
are constant, equation (3) yields the well known Hall and Jorgenson (1967)

expression for the user cost of capital.3



            (5)    =   P(r+6).


As we argue in subsequent sections of this paper, the public sector analog to

(5) is extremely useful in attributing capital income in the state and local

sectors, since communities typically own the capital they use and annual

payments to capital are not observed.

     A balance sheet for our simple economy is embedded in the framework

underlying equation (4). The 'tasset" side of the ledger contains the

reproduction value of the capital stock,        this is the amount that

could be obtained if the physical capital were sold. The "liability" side

of the ledger contains claims on the income flow generated by the capital,

Wt; this is the amount that could be obtained if the rights to the income

were sold. This distinction is somewhat artificial in our simple model, but

takes on significance when we allow consumers to transfer physical capital

to firms in exchange for financial claims against the capital (e.g. stocks

and bonds).

     Intertemporal considerations also influence the structure of the income

and product accounts. The flow of capital payments from firms to households

must now include a depreciation component. Net national income in this

economy will then equal gross income, measured either as the sum of factor

payments or as the value of output, less depreciation. An investment and

saving account must be constructed to balance the production of investment

goods with consumer saving.



                                  8
A Three Consumer Good Model with a Public Sector

      The jump from a one sector accounting model to an N sector model is, in

principle, straight forward. Each sector is characterized by its own

technology and its own income and product account, each developed along the

lines set out above. The separate sectoral flows can then be aggregated to

form an economy-wide set of accounts. The main complication arises when

some sectors use the output of other sectors. In this case, intermediate

inputs must be netted out in the aggregation across sectors.4 We ignore

this complication in this discussion.

      With this in mind, we turn to the problem of accounting for public

sector output. For reasons which will become apparent below, we begin

with a simple model in which three goods are produced; a private sector

good Z, housing H, and a local public good X. As above, Z and H are

produced by profit maximizing firms operating in perfectly competitive

markets.

      Initially we assume that communities rent capital and that they charge

a user fee equal to marginal cost, P. If a community is to attract

households it must produce local public goods at minimum cost. The

necessary conditions for cost minimization imply that marginal cost equals

the price of each input divided by that factor's marginal product, and

therefore PX equals PK/FK and PL/FL. Under constant returns, marginal cost

is independent of the scale of output and the value of the output equals the

value of the inputs used to produce that output:



            (6) PX   —   PKKX   +   pLX
It   is therefore clear that the fact that one of the goods is produced by

state and local governments does not in any fundamental way change the set



                                          9
of accounts we would construct to characterize this economy.

     Suppose, now, that instead of renting capital, the community buys the

stock of capital it needs for the production of local public goods. By

analogy to the private sector, the change in the form of ownership will have

no impact on the nature of our accounting framework.   Private firms typically

own the capital they use. The implicit income from this capital equals the

explicit rent that would be charged in competitive markets; in a simple world

without taxes, the appropriate per unit rental would be the Hall and Jorgenson

user cost in (5).

     This may seem a trivial observation, but it contains a fundamental

insight that is lost in most analyses of the public sector; the allocation of

capital to the public sector production implies a return to capital. This

return is equal to PKKX, and reflects the fact that consumers allocate their

capital so that at the margin the net return from all uses is equal, i.e., the

income from allocating capital in one use equals the opportunity cost of using

capital in other uses.

     This is a rather unconventional view of the public sector, in that it

suggests that income should be attributed to the residents of a community

because they "own" streets, schools, etc. Clearly, communities never send

their citizens a check which represents a payment for the use of capital; how,

then, can it be claimed that capital "income" from schoo]s and streets should

be attributed to the local citizenry?

     In order to address this issue, it is helpful to again consider the

private sector for the moment. A share of stock represents a claim to a

portion of the future income of a corporation and, equivalently, a claim to a

portion of the corporation's physical stock of capital. These shares can be

bought and sold and their value is determined in a stock market.

     Is there a public sector analog to the stock market? When a consumer



                                10
purchases a home in a community, that consumer simultaneously purchases a

share in a corporation which produces goods, i.e., the consumer purchases a

share of the community's capital stock. These shares may be bought and sold,

though the market does not function quite like a stock market since the shares

in these public corporations can only be transferred when a home is

transferred. These public corporations also differ from private corporations

in that the goods they produce are only consumed by the owners of the

enterprise. These differences aside, the value of a house must equal the

value of housing capital and the value of a share, i.e., the value of a

community's public capital stock (net of outstanding debt) is capitalized into

the value of homes in that community.

      This capitalization argument allows us to characterize the user cost for

a community which owns the stock of public capital. Suppose a community

purchases a unit of capital at the beginning of a year with F' tax dollars.

The community uses the increment to its capital stock to produce local public

goods and, in the process, the unit of capital depreciates to (1-6); housing

values are thus higher by (l-6)P' at the end of the year as a result of the

unit investment. The community incurs an opportunity cost of rP' since the P1

dollars required to purchase the capital could have been invested at the rate

r. Therefore the cost of using this unit of capital for one year is

P1+rP1-(l-6)P', or (r+6)P'. But clearly this is equivalent to the user cost

   in (5) given capitalization, the cost of capital facing communities who

own   capital   is the same as the imputed user cost.   can then be interpreted

as the additional end-of-year rent that the community would charge for the

rental of its housing, in view of the additional public capital owned by the

community.

      Now consider the form of this payment. We could think of local

governments setting a tax on its citizens as consumers equal to the cost of



                                    11
producing local public goods PKK   + PLL and then using a part of those tax
proceeds to pay a "dividend" to its citizens as shareholders equal to PKK.

Of course, communities do not do this; they simply net out the dividend and

set a tax of PLL. Therefore the returns on public capital take the form of

lower taxes. It then becomes necessary to impute the income generated by the

public capital stock, just as the income from owner occupied housing must be

imputed.

     Finally, as we noted above, state and local governments rarely rely on

user fees. But a local government acting solely in the interest of its

citizens will act "as if" decisions were made by a utility maximizing

representative voter. In a median voter model, this representative voter is

the one who prefers the median level of local public goods; in a Tiebout

model, communities are homogeneous and therefore any voter can be considered

as the representative voter. The relevant cost of local public goods

in this maximization problem is its shadow price P>. Therefore local taxes in

these models are equivalent to user fees and all of the points that we made

above in a world where governments set user charges equal. to the unit cost of

production continue to hold.



Bond Financed Public Capital

     It is not difficult to show that in the context of our simple model the

method of financing the acquisition of public sector capital has no impact on

the cost of using that capital. Suppose the community we have considered had

issued P' dollars of bonds when it bought a unit of capital. The interest on

those bonds would be rP1 dollars. The value of housing in this community

wou].d rise by P'(l-5) dollars as a result of the larger capital stock and fall

by P1 dollars because of the debt which must be repaid. These three terms

together represent the cost of using capital for one period; they equal



                                12
        as in the all equity case.



The Federal Government

    The federal government influences the cost of local public goods in at

least two important ways. First, local taxes are deductible. Therefore, if

the federal tax rate is t, then the marginal cost of local public goods from

the perspective of the community is (lt)PK/FK and (lt)PL/FL. From society's

perspective, marginal cost is unchanged and therefore federal taxation

introduces a wedge between the social cost of producing local public goods and

their benefits.

     We might then ask; how we should treat this implicit subsidy in our

system of accounts if we wish to put the state and local sector and the

private sector on the same footing? From the perspective of an income and

product account, the inputs used in the state and local sector must be valued

at their market prices. This follows directly from the fact that these

accounts are derived from Euler's equation. The value of output received by a

producer equals the cost of inputs purchased by that producer. Thus if a firm

receives $100 in revenue, which is then paid to the owners of the labor and

capital used to produce the firm's output, the set of accounts should value

that output at $100, even if a subsidy to the buyer reduces the net cost to

$50.
     The federal government also influences cost by offering grants to state

and local governments which offset part of the cost of acquiring public sector

capital. These grants typically take one of three forms.

     As Bradford and Oates (1971) argue, nonmatching grants are equivalent to

an increase in income for the citizens of a community. An open ended matching

grant under which the federal government pays 6 percent of the cost of all

units of capital effectively reduces the cost of acquiring capital to (1-8)P'.



                                13
Therefore a more general expression for the cost of public sector capital is



     (7)    —   P'(l-0)(r+6).


Matching grants thus play the same role in the cost of capital in the public

sector as do investment tax credits in the private sector.

     The effects of closed ended matching capital grants depend on

the level of capital chosen by the community. If a community purchases less

capital than the maximi.un level the federal government will subsidize, then the

program is functionally equivalent to an open ended matching grant; in this

case the price of public sector capital is P'(l-O)(r+&). If a community

purchases more capital than the federal government will subsidize, then the

program is functionally equivalent to a norimatching grant; the relevant

price of capital is P1(r+&) and the community receives additional income

equal to the subsidy on capital. Finally, if the community chooses exactly

the quantity the federal government will subsidize, we can show that it

behaves "as if" it faces a shadow price of capital 7P1(r+&), where y lies

between (1-0) and 1.

     By analogy to the private sector, we calculate a cost of capital which

fully reflects the implications of federal taxes and subsidies to producers.

Thus, for example, the Hall and Jorgenson user cost incorporates tax rates,

the investment tax credit, and the present value of depreciation deductions.

Therefore, because our objective is to develop accounts for the state and

local sector which parallel those for the private sector, our imputed cost of

capital is net of capital grants.

               III. The Production of State and Local Public Goods



     An important implication of the preceding analysis is that an income

and product account can be constructed for the state and local government

sector even though there is no independent measure of sectoral output. In

this section of the paper we develop estimates of state and local output and

input for the period 1959 to 1985. We then compare our results to those

obtained directly from NIPA.

     We begin by examining the technology used in the production of local

public goods. The relationship between purchased inputs and output can change

for two reasons. First, technical and managerial innovation may occur. Thus,

for example, computers may allow communities to better regulate the flow of

traffic, police to respond more quickly to emergencies, and teachers to

improve their students' understanding of algebra.

     Second, the production of local public goods depends on purchased inputs

as well as the characteristics of the citizens. Bradford, Malt, and Oates

(1969) drew the important distinction between what they termed D-output and

C-output. D-output is the direct output of a local public agency, such as the

number of city blocks patrolled, the average time to respond to a reported

fire, and the number of hours of mathematics instruction in the public

schools. The amount of D-output produced depends only on purchased inputs.

C-output is the public service output that enters citizens' utility functions,

and would include the level of public safety and the level of education

achievement. The level of C-output depends on the amount of D-output and the

characteristics of the population. For example, with identical expenditures

for education, children in white-collar or upper-income communities may show

greater educational achievement than children in blue-collar or low-income

communities.



                                  15
     Both effects may alter the quantity of output obtained from a given

amount of input. To allow for this possibility, we define A as an index of

total factor productivity and assume that A enters the production function

as a Hicks neutral change parameter. We also extend our previous

specification of technology by including services S and non-durable

intermediate goods C as well as labor L and capital K as inputs. The

technology can then be written as



            (8) X — AF(K, L, S, C).



We continue to assume that the production function exhibits constant returns

to scale and that communities hire each factor of production up to the point

that the value of the marginal product of that factor equals its price, and

that output is priced at marginal cost, P. As noted above, this implies

that the value of output must equal the value of the inputs required to

produce that output:



            (9) px pl + pL + pS +                 pCc



     In the construction of private sector accounts, an independent estimate

of PX is available. Data on the current account inputs PLL PSS, and            are

also available and capital stock K can be estimated using the perpetual

inventory method (2), given estimates of investment spending. The user cost

can therefore be estimated as the residual that causes (9) to hold.

    The situation is obviously different for the public sector.

independent estimates of PX are not available, but PX can be imputed given

estimates of the values on the right hand side of (9). The values PLL, pS

and PG are available from NIPA, and K can be estimated using a perpetual



                                         16
inventory method. This implies that PX can be imputed given an imputed value

for the unobserved user cost              This procedure is thus the converse of the

procedure for constructing the private sector account, and the "value" of

output constructed in this way is a cost based measure.

     Equation (9) defines the value of the goods and services produced by

state and local governments in a manner which is consistent with theory and

the underlying technology. It differs from the total purchases of state and

local governments E which is the measure of output in many studies, and

which is defined as



          (10) E —     P'I   + P1L + PS + pG



The difference between these two concepts is (P'I - PKK); purchases are not an

adequate measure of output because they include the acquisition of capital and

exclude the cost of using the services from the existing stock.

     The estimation of real output X also requires indirect methods. Total

differentiation of the technology in (8) implies



          (11) din X —       din A + sKdln i + sLdin LX
                                 + sCdin c +   Sdl   S



       KL C

          s   ,   ,
                             S
                      and s represent output elasticities. The marginal

productivity conditions imply that these output elasticities equal each

factor's share of the community's cost of producing local public goods, e.g.,
K —
    (PKKX) / (PXX).

     If X were a private good, then we would have independent estimates of the

growth rates of X, K, L, S, and C. In that case we could infer productivity

growth (the growth rate of A) as a residual. But X cannot be observed



                                        17
directly; we can estimate PX but we cannot separate price and quantity

without additional information.

     We are therefore forced to construct our accounts in a somewhat

different way. We impose an estimate of productivity growth (zero in the

estimates presented below), and then infer the growth rate of output as the

share weighted growth rates of inputs.6 While this is clearly an arbitrary

assumption, it is consistent with the estimates in Hulten (1984) and

elsewhere. We choose 1982 as our benchmark and then use these growth rates

to estimate constant dollar aggregate output for the state and local sector

for the 1959 to 1985 period.

     The estiina..ion f via (11) permits PX to be separated into price

and quantity compo.3nts.       has the ready interpretation as the marginal

cost of producing X. We therefore rely on the assumption that

communities are cost minimizers in our estimation of the real output of the

state and local sector.

     The assumptions underlying our estimates are clearly arguable. It may

not be appropriate to characterize the various functions of state and local

governments by a single production function. Furthermore, public decision

makers may have objectives other than the efficient production of goods and

services. The assumption of a zero rate of productivity growth is at best a

compromise between competing points of view.

     The framework of this paper is not, however, without merit. As Solow

(1957) argues, the production theoretic framework should not be viewed as

true ,       but   rather as a systematic and explicit framework for

organizing data. In this context, it should be noted that this framework,

however imperfect, has the virtue of defining the theoretically correct

measure of public sector output. It is clearly superior to a framework which

implicitly assumes that there is no public sector capital (or that it has no



                                  18
value); police officers ride in squad cars, children sit in classrooms, and

water flows through pipes. While our estimates of         and    may be

problematic, they must represent an improvement over current practice.

       Moreover, the total purchases approach to output measurement will almost

never yield a valid measure. While total purchases may be the right

concept for the analysis of cash flow and budget constraint problems, it is

hard to justify its use in problems relating to the demand for and

production of goods and services, except in the extreme circumstance of

steady state growth.

       In a more positive vein, our approach (embedded in the identity in (9)),

has the sensible property that it defines the value of gross output as the

value of resources withdrawn from the production of other goods and services.

While this value is not necessarily equal to the value to the consumer of the

goods produced, it does focus on the cost of producing those goods.



Data

       The basic data source for our estimates is Part 3 of the U.S. National

•Incoine and Product Accounts. NIPA provides data on various aspects of state

and local economic activity, including the purchases of goods and services,

transfer payments, and the activities of government enterprises. Since the

focus of the paper is the production of goods and services, we omit transfer

payments from the analysis and include government enterprises with general

government.

       Table 1 sets forth state and local current dollar expenditures on

structures and equipment, employee compensation, and purchases of

intermediate   goods and services;    Table 2 presents the corresponding data in

constant 1982 dollars. It is clear from Table 2 that real gross investment

fell sharply after 1968, and this decline has sparked a deep concern over

 the condition of the public infrastructure.7 Real labor compensation

continued to rise through the 1970's and then remained roughly constant

until 1985.

     Table 3 expresses the expenditure data as shares. It shows that relative

expenditures on services and nondurables rose very rapidly over the period.

In 1959, these two categories together represented 18.7 percent of total state

and local expenditures; by 1984 this figure had risen to 28.8 percent.

Labor's share remained roughly constant during this time. In sharp contrast,

the share of state and local expenditures devoted to capital expenditures fell

from 30.0 percent in 1959 to 14.5 percent in 1985, a decline of more than

one-half.

     As we argued above, the basic difference between the total purchases

concept of expenditure summarized in Tables 1 through 3 and the value of

gross output lies in the treatment of capital. In particular, the

theoretically correct measure of output requires us to replace investment

expenditures (column 6 in Tables 1 and 2) with an estimate of the value of

the current flow of capital services.

     The valuation of capital services requires two steps; (i) the

calculation of constant dollar stocks of each of three types of capital

assets, and (ii) estimation of the per unit service price for each asset. The

stocks of depreciable assets, structures and equipment, can be estimated

through the perpetual inventory method in equation (2); the capital stock in

the current year equals the capital stock in the previous year less

depreciation plus investment during the previous year. The real investment

series in (2), It' for structures and equipment are based on columns 6 and 7

of Table 2 for the 1959-1985 period and unpublished data from the Bureau of

Economic Analysis (BEA) for the earlier period. Sufficiently long time series

are available so that the initial stocks can be ignored in the recursive

application of (12).

     The estimation of the rate of depreciation, 6, is another matter,

however. No systematic data are available and therefore indirect methods are

required. The study by Boskin and Robinson (1986), based on the depreciation

study of Hulten and Wykoff (1981), estimates depreciation rates of

approximately 13.1 percent for equipment and 1.9 percent for structures, and

we have used those estimates in our work. These rates of depreciation are

somewhat lower than the rates implied by the BEA assumptions on asset life and

retirement distribution.

     BEA provides unpublished estimates of current dollar land purchases.

We use a 1958 benchmark from Goldsmith (1962) and a price deflator for land

based on Bureau of the Census index for land in the non-agricultural sector

and Department of Agriculture estimates of the value of rural land.

     Table 4 presents estimates of the stocks of structures, equipment, and

land in current and constant dollars. The deflators for structures and

equipment are obtained from NIPA, and refer to the replacement cost of these

assets.9

     If all assets were rented in competitive markets, then the observed

rental prices would serve as the appropriate rental prices in the

calculation of the value of local public goods as specified in (10) and the

growth of output as specified in (11). Unfortunately, this is not the case

and we must therefore impute these rental prices.

     Equation (7) provides the basis for this imputation. The user cost of

capital, as shown in (7), equals P'(l-9)(ri-6), where 9 is the federal

matching rate, r is the discount rate, 6 is the rate of economic

aepreciation, and P' is the asset price of capital. The estimates of the

rate of depreciation and the asset price embedded in our user cost

calculations are the same as those we discussed above. Estimates of the

     As noted above, the user cost of capital is determined endogenously in

growth analyses of the private sector. Specifically, the private rate of

return in (5) is allowed to adjust so as to equate the right and left hand

sides of (9). This procedure yields an     iost estimate of the rate of

return which can be shown to provide an adjustment for capacity utilization

(Berndt and Fuss (1986), Hulten (1986b)). This approach is not available in

the public sector and we require an exogenous value of r in order to impute

   on the right side of (9).

     The choice of an appropriate discount rate is not clear. In

equilibrium, arbitrage should insure that the rate of return on all capital

in the same risk class is the same. But, recent work by Cordon and Slemrod

(1983, 1984) and Hulten (1986a) suggests that the arbitrage assumption may not

be a good guide to the selection of an appropriate discount rate. Lacking a

better alternative (or, at least, one that commands wide spread acceptance),

we select the long term nominal interest rate on municipal bonds, less long

term expected inflation, as our rate of discount for public sector capital

income. This assumption is attractive in that the municipal bond market is

the major source of funds for the acquisition of public sector capital.

     We thus require a measure of long term expected inflation. There has

been a great deal of research on the formation of short term expections, and a

number of alternative approaches have been developed, including distributed

lag models, rational expectations models, and the use of survey data.11 Long

term expected inflation, however, has received less attention. We have used

the following procedure. Joseph Livingston, a Philadelphia journalist, began

in 1946 to survey roughly 50 economists for their forecasts of inflation (as

measured by the Consumer Price Index) for the coming 6 and 12 months. We base



                                22
our long term estimate of inflation on these short term forecasts, using the

following method. We denote the 12 month Livingston forecasts made in period

t by           We assume that the Livingston respondents form their expectations

by looking at past actual inflation, nt-s' according to the process



                         —
            (13)
                    +1       a0 + E a1r.


We estimate the parameters of (13) and then generate forecasts for future

periods 1r+2, t+3' etc. by replacing past actual inflation in (13) with

forecasts for earlier years. Long term expected inflation is the average

forecast rate for the coming five years.

       Our estimates of long term expected inflation are shown in the second

column of Table 5. Standard and Poor's nominal interest rates on high grade

municipal bonds are shown in the third column. The last column represents

our estimates of the real interest rate in the state and local sector.

These estimates are consistent with the patterns noted by Blanchard and

Summers (1984) and others; real interest rates remained roughly constant

through the 1960's, fell during the 1970's, and then rose sharply in the

first half of the 1980's.

       Inasmuch as the choice of appropriate discount rate is problematic, we

present alternative estimates (which parallel the calculations presented in

the text) in an Appendix.        These alternative calculations assume that the

appropriate discount rate is the real        Dost return in the private sector.13

The estimates of gross product in the Appendix can then be interpreted as the

marginal opportunity cost of resources employed to produce local public goods.

Table 6 and represents our implementation of equation (9). The last column

is the sum of the implicit rentals on three types of capital; structures,

equipment, and land. The third, fourth, and fifth columns show employee

compensation, expenditures on nondurable goods, and services. The second

column is the sum of the last four, i.e., the value of output equals the sum

of the factor payments given Euler's theorem (under constant returns to

scale). Table 7 presents the corresponding factor shares.

     Tables 6 and 7, which focus on gross output, present a rather different

picture of the state and local sector than do Tables 1 and 3, which focus on

expenditure. As shown in Table 3, capital's share of expenditures fell by

nearly 16 percentage points from 1959 to 1985; in contrast, capital's share

of gross output was unchanged.

     This pattern reflects the rapid accumulation of capital in the state

and local sector during the 1950's and 60's. This was a period when the

baby boom generation began to reach school age and therefore the needs for

additional educational facilities rose sharply. Further, the ambitious

interstate highway program was begun during this period, while rapid

suburbanization led to additional infrastructure requirements. These

factors led to an investment boom. After the boom ended, the consequent

larger capital stock continued to generate the capital income imputed in this

paper. Therefore capital's share of output remained roughly constant while

its share of expenditures fell sharply. High real rates in the 1980's also

played an important role.

     These considerations have some important implications for measuring the

growth of output over time. As shown in Tables 1 and 6, current dollar

gross output in 1959 was about 15 percent lower than expenditure; in 1985

it was 6 percent higher. our estimates therefore imply that the production of

local public goods grew faster than the total purchases approach suggests.

This result has important implications for econometric work on state and local

governments; those studies which rely on expenditures as a measure of the

output in this sector have systematically mismeasured their dependent

variable.

     This pattern is more dramatic if we focus on value added rather than

gross output. Value added in the private sector is the sum of compensation

of employees and the value of capital services, i.e., the private sector

analogs to the sum of the third and sixth columns in Table 6. NIPA defines

value added for the state and local sector as the sum of compensation of

employees and the adjusted current surplus of government enterprises.

     Table 8 compares these two measures. Our 1985 estimate of value added

for the state and local sector is 122 billion dollars greater than the

corresponding NIPA value. Figure 2 presents our estimates of value added as

a percentage of the NIPA numbers for the 1959-1985 period. It shows that in

1985 NIPA understated the output of this sector by nearly 40 percent.



Constant Dollar Accounts

     The preceding sections developed a set of current dollar gross output

accounts for the state and local sector. We now turn to a corresponding set

of constant dollar accounts. The key issue here is the separation of value

into prices and quantities.

     We outlined our approach to estimating the growth rate of output

earlier; assuming productivity growth is zero, it equals the share weighted

growth rates of the inputs.14 The growth rates of labor, intermediate goods,

and intermediate services are based on the factor payments in Table 5 and

price indices from NIPA; the required share estimates are reported in Table

7.

     For capital, we use 1982 as our benchmark and expand our benchmark to

where i refers to structures, land, and equipment and v equals the ith

factor's share of total rentals PK1/EPK1. Output is also bencbmarked to

1982.

        The prices and quantities of output and inputs are shown in Table 9.

That table suggests that we divide 1959-1985 into two sub-periods. As shown

in Table 10, from 1959 to 1975, the real gross output of state and local

governments grew at an average rate of 5.3 percent per year. In sharp

contrast, output grew only 2.3 percent per year from 1975 to 1985. This

reflects the slower growth of real input used in this sector, which in turn is

linked to the slowdown in the growth of government in the 1970's (and possibly

to the slowdown in growth throughout the economy during this period).

                         IV. Summary and Conclusions



     We have developed in this paper an accounting framework for state and

local governments which is consistent with representative voter models of this

sector. We have shown that this framework is in principle the same as the

accounting framework for other sectors of the economy. We have also shown

that the capital income in this sector appears as a reduction in taxes, to the

extent that capital is not financed by debt. We have also found that the

nondebt value of the public capital stock should be capitalized in housing

values, and that the analysis of housing values can yield the implicit rent on

public capital.15

     We have not implemented a complete accounting framework; this would

involve the construction of income, expenditure, and wealth accounts for the

state and local sector, and substantial revisions in other sectoral accounts

(particularly housing). This is beyond the scope of this paper and we have,

instead, limited our empirical work to constructing an income and product

account for the state and local sector. This has involved the measurement of

capital stocks and the imputation of capital income to the sector.

     Our empirical results indicate that current national income accounting

procedures substantially underestimate the amount of income originating in the

state and local sector. In recent years, the size of this understatement is

on the order of $100 billion. This can hardly be considered a negligible

amount. There is, correspondingly, an overstatement of income in the

housing sector, but we have not estimated the size of this effect.

     This missing income has important policy implications. The debate over

tax reform focused on the various ways that the federal government

sudsidizes the production of local public goods. The federal tax treatment

of part of the income accruing to state and local capital was discussed -   the


                                27
income reflected in municipal bond interest -   but,   since less than half of

state and local capital formation is financed by debt, a large portion of the

capital income originating in the sector was ignored.

     Our results also present a rather different picture of the sector than

might be obtained, for example, from the well-known study by Baumol (1967)

or from NIPA. We find that labor productivity -    output   per unit of

labor input - grew at an average annual rate of 0.6 percent, even under our

assumption that there was zero total factor productivity growth; by contrast,

NIPA procedures imply that labor productivity growth was virtually zero.

     Moreover, we find that the state and local sector is in fact relatively

capital intensive. According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the

capital-output ratio in private business was approximately 3.1 in 1982. For

the state and local sector, we find that the ratio of capital to gross output

was 4.1 in that year; the ratio of capital to value added was 5.6. If

productivity growth in this sector has in fact been slow, it cannot be

attributed to the fact that the production of local public goods is labor

intensive.

     The asssumptions underlying some of our methods and some of our

conclusions are clearly arguable. But our point is not that NIPA misstates

the size of the state and local sector by $75 billion, $100 billion, or $150

billion. Rather, our point is that capital income in the state and local

sector is not zero, and that our estimates suggest that the magnitude of the

measurement error for this sector is large.

                                    APPENDIX

     This Appendix presents an alternative set of accounts based on the

assumption that the appropriate discount rate for the state and local sector

is the real ex post return in the private sector. The numbering of these

tables parallels the text. Thus, for example, Table A-6 in this Appendix

(which presents estimates of current dollar gross output based on the constant

real rate) is the analog to Table 6 in the text.

     As can be seen, the estimates in the Appendix and the estimates in the

text of the paper are very similar. For example, as shown in Table A-8, 1985

value-added in the state and local sector under our ex post real rate series

is $415.7 billion; under our    ante real rate series, value-added is $428.3

billion.

* We thank Joan Soulsby for her very fine work as a research assistant on this

project and Helen Ladd and John Haltiwanger for their comments and

suggestions.



1. In a discrete time model, it is important to specify the timing of all

transactions. We have adopted the following convention. At the beginning of

period t, firms "inherit" a stock of capital Kt and contract with labor Lt.

Production takes place during the period. At the end of the period, output is

sold, workers are paid, and an investment I is made. The perpetual inventory

equation in (2) and the cost of capital discussed below are consistent with

this convention.

2.   The P in (3) refers to the user cost of a new asset r years in the

future. The expression (ltc)P+is thus equal to the user cost of a r year

old asset which has "shrunk" to (15)T   of   its original "size."

3. We assume that there is no inflation so that the distinction between

nominal and real rates of return can be ignored, and that there are no taxes

or subsidies. Our assumption about inflation implies that the investment

good price does not change, and therefore that there is no capital gain term

in (5). The implicit rental payment is assumed to occur at the end of the

year.




                                30
L. There   are actually two types of "T" accounts that can be constructed at the

sectoral level; (i) gross output accounts that include the value of

intermediate inputs, and (ii) value added accounts which net out intermediate

inputs and which therefore measure the sector's contribution to total CNP.

The latter measures the income which originates in the sector (i.e., capital

and labor income); the former measures the output which is produced and the

allocation of the value of this output to the factors of production. Except

under certain restrictive assumptions, gross output is the appropriate concept

in the econometric estimation of production functions.

5. To see this point in another context, consider other federal programs which

subsidize consumption directly (such as food stamps) or indirectly (such as

the deduction for medical expenses). The national accounts would measure the

output of the food and medical sectors as the sum of the payments to factors

of production.

6. As we argued above, din A captures productivity growth as we normally

think of it in the private sector as-well as the effects of changes in

community characteristics, so a zero rate does not necessarily imply a static

technology. For example, a change in society which increases criminal

activity could offset technical improvements in law enforcement, leaving

output (public safety) unchanged.

7. See for example The National Council on Public Works Improvement (1986)

and Hulten and Peterson (1984).

8. The investment series extends back to 1850 for structures and back to 1902

for equipment. Since the capital stock estimates in this paper begin in

1958, the influence of the initial benchmark is very small. At a 1.9

percent rate of depreciation, only 12.4 percent of the 1850 structures

benchmark survives in 1959.




                                  31
9. 1t should be noted that the estimates in Table 4 refer to stocks rather

than to a flow of services. In the absence of data or procedures (e.g.

Berndt and Fuss (1986)) to correct for variations in the rate of

utilization, we are forced to assume that the utilization rate remains

constant. This may be a highly dubious assumption for public sector

capital, since much of this capital is in networks (e.g. roads, sewers,

water distribution) and it is frequently cost effective to build capacity in

advance of need. Conversely, it is hard to expand existing capacity as

demand increases (roads in crowded urban areas), or to reduce the capital

stock as demand decreases. Returns to scale in the construction of

infrastructure, and regional and demographic shifts, almost certainly lead

to variations in the utilization of the measured stock of capital.

10. By law, virtually all capital grants are matching grants. It might be

reasonable, however, to argue that in fact these grants have many of the

characteristics of lump sum grants. Under this view, the federal government

establishes an aggregate level of funding and invites communities to compete

for these funds. Our formulation of the user cost implicitly assumes that the

grants are in fact matching grants.

11. See }iuizinga and Mishkin (1986) for a review of the literature in this

field.

12. See Carlson (1977) for a discussion of the Livingston survey.



13. We thank Barbara Fraumeni for providing this series to us.

14. Our calculations are based on the discrete approximation to (9) in which

differences in logarithms weighted by the average share in two successive

periods replace the share weighted logarithmic differentials. Diewert (1976)

research; hedonic studies of housing values may ultimately lead to direct

estimates of user cost of capital and thus obviate the need for the imputation

methods developed in this paper. But, even if this proves to be impossible,

future research should examine the imputation of rental income to the housing

sector. Part of the income and wealth attributed to the housing sector

properly belongs in the government sector, and this may suggest a revision of

current national income accounting procedures.
