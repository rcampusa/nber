Exchange Rate Disconnect in General Equilibrium
Oleg Itskhoki and Dmitry Mukhin
NBER Working Paper No. 23401
May 2017
JEL No. E30,F30,F4

                                         ABSTRACT

We propose a dynamic general equilibrium model of exchange rate determination, which
simultaneously accounts for all major puzzles associated with nominal and real exchange rates.
This includes the Meese-Rogoff disconnect puzzle, the PPP puzzle, the terms-of-trade puzzle, the
Backus-Smith puzzle, and the UIP puzzle. The model has two main building blocks — the
driving force (or the exogenous shock process) and the transmission mechanism — both crucial
for the quantitative success of the model. The transmission mechanism — which relies on
strategic complementarities in price setting, weak substitutability between domestic and foreign
goods, and home bias in consumption — is tightly disciplined by the micro-level empirical
estimates in the recent international macroeconomics literature. The driving force is an exogenous
small but persistent shock to international asset demand, which we prove is the only type of shock
that can generate the exchange rate disconnect properties. We then show that a model with this
financial shock alone is quantitatively consistent with the moments describing the dynamic
comovement between exchange rates and macro variables. Nominal rigidities improve on the
margin the quantitative performance of the model, but are not necessary for exchange rate
disconnect, as the driving force does not rely on the monetary shocks. We extend the analysis to
multiple shocks and an explicit model of the financial sector to address the additional Mussa
puzzle and Engel’s risk premium puzzle.

1    Introduction
Exchange rate disconnect is among the most challenging and persistent international macro puzzles (see
Obstfeld and Rogoff 2001). The term disconnect narrowly refers to the lack of the correlation between
exchange rate and other macro variables, but the broader puzzle is more pervasive and nests a number
of additional empirical patterns, which stand at odds with the conventional international macro models.
We define the broader exchange rate disconnect to include:
    1. Meese and Rogoff (1983) puzzle: nominal exchange rate follows a volatile random walk process,
      which is not robustly correlated, even contemporaneously, with macroeconomic fundamentals
      (see also Engel and West 2005).
    2. PPP puzzle (Rogoff 1996): real exchange rate tracks very closely the nominal exchange rate at
      most frequencies and, in particular, exhibits a similarly large persistence and volatility as the
      nominal exchange rate. Mean reversion, if any, takes a very long time, with half-life estimates in
      the range of 3-to-5 years, much in excess of conventional durations of price stickiness (see also
      Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan 2002).
      A related Mussa (1986) puzzle emphasizes a stark change in the properties of the real exchange
      rate associated with a change in the monetary regime to/from a nominal exchange rate peg (see
      also Mussa 1990, Monacelli 2004).
    3. Terms of trade are positively correlated with the real exchange rate, yet exhibit a markedly lower
      volatility, in contrast with the predictions of the standard models, suggesting a particular pattern
      of the law of one price violations (Atkeson and Burstein 2008). In addition, the real exchange rate
      dynamics at most horizons is almost fully accounted for by the law of one price violations for
      tradable goods, while the relative non-tradable prices explain little variation in the real exchange
      rate (Engel 1999).
    4. Backus and Smith (1993) puzzle: the international risk-sharing condition that relative consump-
      tion across countries should be strongly positively correlated with the real exchange rates (im-
      plying high relative consumption in periods of low relative prices) is sharply violated in the data,
      with a mildly negative correlation and a markedly lower volatility of relative consumption (see
      Kollmann 1995 and also Benigno and Thoenissen 2008).
    5. Forward premium puzzle (Fama 1984), or the violation of the uncovered interest rate parity (UIP)
      condition: the UIP prediction that a relatively high interest rate should predict a nominal ex-
      change rate devaluation is violated in the data with an opposite sign, but a nearly zero R2 (see also
      Engel 1996). A related set of puzzles explores further the dynamic comovement between interest
      rate differential and exchange rate changes, or risk premia (see Engel 2016, Valchev 2016).
We summarize the above puzzles as a set of moments characterizing comovement between exchange
rates and macro variables (see Table 2), and use them as the quantitative targets in our analysis.
    Existing general equilibrium international macro models either feature these puzzles, or attempt to
address one puzzle at a time, often at the expense of aggravating the other puzzles, resulting in a lack
of a unifying framework that exhibits satisfactory exchange rate properties. This is a major challenge


                                                    1
for the academic and policy discussion, since exchange rates are the core prices in any international
model, and failing to match their basic properties jeopardizes the conclusions one can draw from the
analysis. In particular, would the conclusions in the vast literatures on currency unions, international
policy spillovers and international transmission of shocks survive in a model with realistic exchange
rate properties? Furthermore, what are the implications of such a model for the numerous micro-level
empirical studies that treat exchange rate shocks as a source of exogenous variation?
    The goal of this paper is to offer a unifying theory of exchange rates that can simultaneously account
for all stylized facts introduced above. Such a model of exchange rate disconnect must have two fea-
tures. First, it should specify the driving force (that is, the shock process) for nominal and real exchange
rates, which cannot simultaneously have a strong direct effect on contemporaneous consumption, out-
put, prices and interest rates. Second, it should specify the transmission mechanism, which mutes the
effect of volatile exchange rate fluctuations on local prices and quantities. Violation of either of these
two properties would break the disconnect. While the literature has provided a lot of empirical evi-
dence on the transmission mechanism, we currently lack direct empirical information on the details
of the shock process, which could account for the bulk of the exchange rate fluctuations. Given this
state of affairs, we adopt the following strategy. From the outset, we tightly discipline the transmission
mechanism with the empirical estimates from the recent literature. In contrast, we initially impose no
restriction on the nature of the shock process, and show theoretically that only one type of shocks can
produce the exchange rate disconnect properties in general equilibrium.
    In particular, as a diagnostic tool for shock selection, we consider a near-autarky behavior of the
economy, and require that the shock process produces a volatile exchange rate behavior with a van-
ishing effect on the economy’s quantities, prices and interest rates, as the economy becomes closed to
trade. Indeed, in the limit of the closed economy, any exchange rate volatility (real or nominal) should
be completely inconsequential for allocations. Not surprisingly, productivity and monetary shocks, as
well as the majority of other shocks, violate this intuitive requirement. We show that the one shock
that satisfies this requirement, and additionally produces the empirically relevant signs of comovement
between exchange rates and macro variables (consumption and interest rates), is the shock to the inter-
national asset demand.1 We then demonstrate how this shock can have a variety of microfoundations
in the financial market, including noise trading with limits to arbitrage (e.g., Jeanne and Rose 2002),
heterogeneous beliefs (e.g., Bacchetta and van Wincoop 2006) and financial frictions (e.g., Gabaix and
Maggiori 2015), as well as time-varying risk premium (e.g., Alvarez, Atkeson, and Kehoe 2009, Colacito
and Croce 2013, Farhi and Gabaix 2016).
    Further, we show that the model with a single financial shock is consistent both qualitatively and
quantitatively with the exchange rate disconnect properties. In particular, small persistent shocks to
international asset demand result in a volatile random-walk-like behavior of both nominal and real
exchange rates. As the economy becomes closed to international trade, this shock still generates volatile
exchange rate fluctuations, which however have a vanishingly small effect on the rest of the economy.
   1
     An exogenous foreign asset demand shock has been widely used in the portfolio models of the exchange rate (e.g. Kouri
1976, Blanchard, Giavazzi, and Sa 2005), and it is also isomorphic to a UIP shock, as for example in Devereux and Engel (2002),
Kollmann (2005) and Farhi and Werning (2012).



                                                              2
Furthermore, the transmission mechanism in the model ensures that exchange rates exhibit empirically
relevant comovement properties with macro variables, even when the economy is open to international
trade in goods and assets. In particular, the transmission mechanism features four realistic ingredients:
   1. significant home bias in consumption, consistent with the empirical trade shares in GDP, which
         limits the effects of expenditure switching on aggregate consumption, employment and output;
   2. pricing to market and law of one price violations due to strategic complementarities in price
         setting, which limit the response of prices (terms of trade) to exchange rate movements;
   3. weak substitutability between home and foreign goods, which limit the extent of expenditure
         switching conditional on the terms of trade movements; and
   4. monetary policy that stabilizes domestic inflation (as opposed to a nominal exchange rate peg).
Interestingly, nominal rigidities are not an essential part of the transmission mechanism for generating
a disconnect behavior, and therefore we omit them in the baseline model. Later, we generalize our anal-
ysis to an environment with nominal stickiness and conventional Taylor rules, and show the robustness
of the quantitative properties of the model.
       Furthermore, the results of a single-shock baseline model are robust to the introduction of additional
shocks, including productivity and monetary shocks. We calibrate a multi-shock version of the model to
match the weak correlations between exchange rates and macro variables. Using this calibrated model
we conduct a variance decomposition of the equilibrium exchange rate volatility into the contribution
of various types of shocks, and find that financial shock still accounts for the bulk of its variation, while
both monetary and productivity shocks play limited roles. Since the structure of our model is rather
standard, the transmission mechanism for monetary and productivity shocks is not different from a
conventional international macro model. What sets our model apart, however, is the emphasis that
monetary and productivity shocks cannot be the key drivers of the exchange rate, if the model is to
feature the disconnect properties.2
       The tractability of the baseline model allows us to solve it in closed-form and emphasize four novel
mechanisms. The first new mechanism is the equilibrium exchange rate determination, which combines
a financial model of the exchange rate with the general equilibrium discipline of a macro model. A small
persistent increase in demand for foreign assets results in a sharp depreciation of the home currency and
a slow but persistent appreciation thereafter. The expected appreciation increases the relative return
on home asset in order to ensure equilibrium in the asset market. In turn, the intertemporal budget
constraint requires that these future appreciations are balanced out by an unexpected depreciation on
impact. The more persistent is the shock, the larger is this initial depreciation, and thus the closer is
the behavior of the nominal exchange rate to a random walk. Indeed, our calibration shows that the
equilibrium exchange rate is indistinguishable from a random walk in finite samples.
       The second mechanism concerns the real exchange rate, and in particular the PPP and related puz-
zles, which are often viewed as the prime evidence in support of long-lasting real effects of nominal
rigidities (as surveyed in Rogoff 1996). The alternative interpretation in the literature is that, given the
   2
   Therefore, while we emphasize the same empirical patterns as Alvarez, Atkeson, and Kehoe (2007), our conclusions are
markedly different from theirs (summarized in their title).


                                                          3
moderate empirical durations of nominal prices, sticky price models are incapable of generating persis-
tent PPP deviations observed in the data (see Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan 2002). Both of these views
adopt the baseline assumption that monetary shocks are the main drivers of the nominal exchange
rate, and that nominal rigidity is the key part of the transmission mechanism into the real exchange
rate. We suggest an entirely different perspective, which deemphasizes nominal rigidities, and instead
shifts focus to the nature of the shock process. We argue that the behavior of the real exchange rates
— both in the time series (PPP puzzle) and in the cross-section (see e.g. Kehoe and Midrigan 2008) — is
not evidence in favor or against sticky prices, but is instead evidence against monetary shocks as the
key source of exchange rate fluctuations. In contrast, we show that financial shocks drive both nomi-
nal and real exchange rates in concert, resulting in volatile and persistent behavior for both variables,
thus reproducing the PPP puzzle. The only two relevant ingredients of the transmission mechanism
for this result are the monetary policy rule, which stabilizes domestic inflation, and the home bias in
consumption, which limits the pass-through of exchange rate into consumer price levels.
       The third mechanism addresses the Backus-Smith puzzle, namely the comovement between con-
sumption and the real exchange rate. Our approach crucially shifts focus from risk sharing (in the
financial market) to expenditure switching (in the goods market) as the key force shaping this comove-
ment. We show that expenditure switching robustly implies a negative correlation between relative
consumption and the real exchange rate, as is the case in the data. Intuitively, an exchange rate de-
preciation increases global demand for domestic goods, which in light of the home bias requires an
increase in domestic production and a reduction in domestic consumption. We show that this force is
present in all models with expenditure switching and goods market clearing, yet it is usually dominated
by the direct effect of shocks on consumption. With financial shock as the key source of exchange rate
volatility, there is no direct effect, and expenditure switching is the only force affecting consumption,
resulting in the empirically relevant direction of comovement.3 Our transmission mechanism with
substantial home bias and low pass-through into prices and quantities ensures that the movements in
consumption are very mild, much smaller than those in exchange rates, as is the case in the data.
       Lastly, we provide an explicit microfoundation of the financial shock in an extension of the model,
in which risk-averse arbitrageurs intermediate international financial transactions and require a risk
premium proportional to the size of their currency exposure. Without compromising the model’s ability
to match the main exchange rate moments, this extension results in an endogenous feedback from the
net foreign asset position of the country into the risk premium, and allows the model to reproduce the
non-monotonic dynamic comovement between UIP deviations and interest rates, emphasized recently
by Engel (2016) and Valchev (2016). The model further implies that a policy commitment to an exchange
rate peg has a coordination effect on the arbitrageurs, encouraging them to take larger positions and
endogenously suppressing the volatility of the UIP deviations (as in Jeanne and Rose 2002). We show
that this mechanism is important to account for an additional set of stylized facts associated with a
switch in the monetary regime to/from an exchange rate peg, to which we collectively refer as the
Mussa puzzle. As with the PPP puzzle, our explanation here emphasizes the nature of the shock driving
   3
    The analytical tractability of our model allows us to establish the relationship between our results and those in the earlier
Backus-Smith puzzle literature, in particular in Corsetti, Dedola, and Leduc (2008).

the exchange rate and the monetary policy rule, rather than nominal rigidities (cf. Monacelli 2004).
      The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we describe the baseline model and
prove that the international asset demand shocks is the only shock consistent with the exchange rate
disconnect properties. We also discuss in this section various microfoundations for the origin of this
financial shock. Section 3 then explores the qualitative and quantitative properties of the model with
the financial shock alone, addressing in turn all of the exchange rate disconnect puzzles outlined in
the beginning of this introduction. Along the way, we also provide a discussion of the relationship
of our results to the existing literature. Section 4 then describes a number of extensions, including
a full-fledged model with nominal rigidities and conventional Taylor rules, as well as a model with
an explicit financial sector with noise traders and limits to arbitrage. In this section, we also allow for
multiple sources of shocks and provide a variance decomposition of the exchange rate volatility into the
contribution of these various shocks. Lastly, this section addresses the Mussa puzzle and the Engel risk
premium puzzle. Section 5 discusses the implication of our results and concludes, while the appendix
provides detailed derivations and proofs, as well as a number of additional extensions and results.


2      Modeling Framework and Shocks
We start with a flexible modeling framework that can nest most standard international macro models,
which allows us in what follows to consider various special cases and extensions. There are two coun-
tries, home (Europe) and foreign (US, denoted with a ∗). Each country has its nominal unit of account,
in which the local prices are quoted. In particular, the home wage rate is Wt euros and the foreign
wage rate is Wt∗ dollars. The nominal exchange rate Et is the price of dollars in terms of euros, hence
an increase in Et signifies a nominal devaluation of the euro (the home currency). We allow for a variety
of shocks hitting the economy, and proxying in some cases for unmodelled market imperfections. We
then explore which of these disturbances can account for the exchange rate disconnect, as we formally
define it below in Section 2.2.

2.1     Model setup

sumption and labor:

where (χt , κt ) are the utility shocks, σ is the relative risk aversion parameter, ν is the Frisch elasticity
of labor supply, and our results are robust to alternative utility specifications, including the GHH utility
without income effects on labor supply (see Appendix A.11). The flow budget constraint is given by:
                                     ∗ E

(i.e., 1/Rt and 1/Rt∗ are their prices); Πt are the dividends and Tt are lump-sum taxes. Lastly, ψt is a
wedge between the effective return on foreign bonds for the home households and the foreign interest
rate, driven by shocks in the international asset market and with the resulting profits of the financial

    The households are active in three markets. First, they supply labor according to the standard static
optimality condition:
                                                              1/ν         Wt

                                                                          Pt
where the preference shock κt can be alternatively interpreted as the labor wedge, playing an important
role in the closed-economy business cycle literature and capturing the departures from the neoclassical
labor market dynamics due to search frictions or sticky wages (see e.g. Shimer 2009). In addition, we
denote Wt ≡ ewt and interpret wt as the shock to the nominal value of the unit of account, which
captures monetary shocks in our framework.5
    Second, the households choose their bond positions according to the dynamic optimality conditions:
                                                                                                       

                                                                                  −σ

is the stochastic discount factor. The time preference shock χt+1 , as in Stockman and Tesar (1995),
affects the consumption-savings decision and acts as an intertemporal demand shifter. The ψt shock
acts instead as a demand shifter for the foreign-currency bond, and in Section 2.3 we discuss a number
of microfounded financial models which result in a similar reduced form as (4).
    Lastly, the households allocate their within-period expenditure between home and foreign goods:

                                               Pt Ct = PHt CHt + PF t CF t ,

and we assume the good demand is homothetic and symmetric, and given by:

                                               PHt                                                              PF t
               CHt = (1 − γ)e−γξt h                      Ct       and           CF t = γe(1−γ)ξt h                         Ct ,   (5)

where ξt is the relative demand shock for the foreign good (as in Pavlova and Rigobon 2007) and
γ captures the home bias, which can be due to a combination of home bias in preferences, trade costs
and non-tradable goods (see Obstfeld and Rogoff 2001). Note that the demand for the foreign good col-
lapses to zero as γ → 0. The function h(·) controls the curvature of the demand schedule, and satisfies
h0 (·) < 0 and h(1) = 1. We denote its point elasticity by θ ≡ − ∂ ∂loglogh(x)
                                                                           x                       x=1

      We adopt the assumption that a risk-free bond is the only internationally-traded asset because we rely on a log-
linearization for the analytical solution of the model. In Appendix A.6, we explore the role of asset market (in)completeness.

      In Section 4.1 we provide an explicit model with nominal wage stickiness, local-currency price stickiness and a conven-
tional Taylor rule, which offers an example of one typical source of (wt , κt , µt , ηt ) shocks (with µt and ηt defined below).


                                                                  6
tion in (5) emerges from a homothetic and separable Kimball (1995) demand aggregator, as we show in
Appendix A.2, where we also derive an explicit expression for the price index Pt .6 In our analysis, we
focus on the behavior of the economy around a symmetric steady state and make use of the following
three properties of this demand system:

Lemma 1 (Properties of Demand) In a symmetric steady state with ξ = 0 and P = PH = PF :
                                                                                                    PF t CF t
   (i) The expenditure share on foreign goods (the foreign share for brief), defined as              Pt Ct ,    equals the
         home bias parameter γ.
  (ii) The log-linear approximation of the consumer price index around the steady state is given by (where
         small letters denote log deviations from the steady state):

                                                   pt = (1 − γ)pHt + γpF t .                                           (6)

 (iii) The log-linear approximation to demand (5) around the steady state is given by:

                cHt = −γξt − θ(pHt − pt ) + ct                 and      cF t = (1 − γ)ξt − θ(pF t − pt ) + ct .        (7)

         Therefore, cF t − cHt = ξt − θ(pF t − pHt ), and the elasticity of substitution between home and
                                     ∂ log(CF t /CHt )
         foreign goods, defined as   ∂ log(PHt /PF t ) ,   equals the point elasticity of the demand schedule θ.

We show below that the values of γ (trade openness) and θ (elasticity of substitution between home
and foreign goods) play a central role in the quantitative properties of the transmission mechanism.

Production and prices           Output is produced by a given pool of identical firms according to a Cobb-
Douglas technology in labor Lt and intermediate inputs Xt :

                                                    Yt = eat L1−φ
                                                              t   Xtφ ,                                                (8)

where at is the productivity shock and φ is the elasticity of output with respect to intermediates, which
determines the equilibrium expenditure share on intermediate goods. The presence of intermediates
is not essential for the qualitative results, however, is needed to properly capture the degree of trade
openness in our calibration. For analytical tractability, we focus on a constant-returns-to-scale produc-
tion without capital, and show the robustness of our results to an extension with capital and adjustment
costs in Appendix A.11.
       Intermediates are the same bundle of home and foreign varieties as the final consumption bundle,
and hence their price index is also given by Pt . Therefore, the marginal cost of production is:
                                                                    1−φ         φ

                                       M Ct = e                                         ,                              (9)
                                                               1−φ            φ

and the firms optimally allocate expenditure between labor and intermediates according to the following
   6
    Note that the conventional CES demand is nested as a special case with h(x) = x−θ , yet we adopt a more general demand
formulation, which allows to accommodate variable markups.



                                                                7
input demand conditions:

                            Wt Lt = (1 − φ)M Ct Yt                 and      Pt Xt = φM Ct Yt .                             (10)

The expenditure on intermediates Xt is further split between the domestic and foreign varieties, XHt
and XF t , in parallel with the household consumption expenditure in (5). The total production of the
                                                                            ∗ , resulting in profits
domestic firms is divided between the home and foreign markets, Yt = YHt + YHt
that are distributed to the domestic households:7

                                                            ∗               ∗
                                 Πt = (PHt − M Ct ) YHt + (PHt Et − M Ct ) YHt .                                           (11)

       We postulate the following price setting:

                                           PHt = eµt M Ct1−α Ptα ,                                                         (12)
                                            ∗
                                                                         1−α
                                           PHt = eµt +ηt M Ct /Et               Pt∗α ,                                     (13)

where α ∈ [0, 1) is the strategic complementarity elasticity, µt is the markup shock, and ηt is the law
of one price (LOP) shock. Given these prices, the firms satisfy the resulting demand in both markets.
Equations (12)–(13) are ad hoc yet general pricing equations, as the markup terms (together with a
flexible choice of α) allow them to be consistent with a broad range of price setting models, including
both monopolistic and oligopolistic competition models under both CES and non-CES demand. Fur-
thermore, if the time path of (µt , ηt ) is not restricted, these equations are also consistent with dynamic
price setting models, and in particular the sticky price models (with either producer, local or dollar
currency pricing).8
       Strategic complementarities in price setting (α > 0) reflect the tendency of the firms to set prices
closer to their local competitors, a pattern which is both pronounced in the data and emerges in a variety
of models (see Amiti, Itskhoki, and Konings 2016), and we emphasize in our analysis below its role for
the international transmission of shocks. Appendix A.2 discusses a model of Kimball (1995) demand
that is simultaneously consistent with both our choices of elasticity of substitution θ and strategic
complementarity elasticity α. Lastly, we note that the violations of the law of one price:
                                          ∗ E
                                        PHt   t                                           Pt∗ Et
                              QHt ≡             = eηt Qαt ,         where          Qt ≡          ,                         (14)
                                         PHt                                               Pt

arise either due to the LOP shock ηt (capturing, for example, local currency pricing) or due to α > 0
(capturing pricing-to-market). The real exchange rate Qt reflects the differences in the price levels
across the two markets.
   7
      We assume no entry or exit of firms, as our model is a medium-run one (for the horizons of up to 5 years), where
empirically extensive margins play negligible roles (see e.g. Bernard, Jensen, Redding, and Schott 2009).
    8
      Note that ηt can stand in for a trade cost shock, which plays a central role in the recent quantitative analyses of Eaton,
Kortum, and Neiman (2015) and Reyes-Heroles (2016). A combination of ηt and ξt can also stand in for a world commod-
ity price shock, acting as a wealth transfer between countries. These shocks are an important source of volatility for the
commodity-exporting countries such as Canada, Australia, South America, Brazil and Chile (see e.g. Chen and Rogoff 2003).



                                                               8
Government           uses lump-sum taxes to finance an exogenous stochastic path of government expendi-
ture Gt ≡   egt ,   where gt is the government spending shock. For simplicity, we assume that government
expenditure is allocated between the home and foreign goods in the same way as the final consumption
in (5). The government then taxes households Tt = Pt egt to run a balanced budget, which in view of
Ricardian equivalence is without loss of generality.

Foreign     households are symmetric, except that the home (euro) bonds are not available to them, and
their budget constraint is given by:

                                                     ∗F
                                                    Bt+1

                                                     Rt∗

where Bt∗F are the holdings of the foreign (dollar) bond by foreign households.9 The optimal savings
decision of the foreign households is characterized by the Euler equation:

                                                                                                   ∗    −σ

The foreign households supply labor and demand home and foreign goods according to the optimality
condition parallel to (3) and (5) respectively. In particular, the goods demand by the foreign households
is given by:

where ξt∗ is the foreign demand shock for home goods. Lastly, the foreign firms are also symmetric, de-
mand foreign labor and a composite intermediate good, and charge prices according to the counterparts
of (12)–(13) with their own markup and LOP shocks µ∗t and ηt∗ , as we detail in Appendix A.3.

Equilibrium conditions               ensure equilibrium in the asset, product and labor markets, as well as the
intertemporal budget constraints of the countries. The labor market clears when Lt is consistent si-
multaneosly with labor supply in (3) and labor demand in (10), and symmetrically for L∗t in foreign.

and symmetric conditions hold for YF t + YF∗t = Yt∗ . The bonds market clearing requires Bt = 0 for
the home-currency bond, as it is in zero net supply and not traded internationally, and Bt∗ + Bt∗F = 0
for the foreign-currency bond, which is in zero net supply internationally.

    We consider this asymmetric formulation between home and foreign for simplicity, and provide a symmetric version of
the model with a financial sector in Section 4.2.

       Lastly, we combine the household budget constraint (2) with profits (11) and taxes to obtain the

                           − Bt∗ Et = N Xt ,                where                     ∗

                                                                                         YHt − P F t YF t .                       (19)

N Xt is net exports of the home country (in home currency). Note that the relative price at which the
home country exchanges its exports for imports is the terms of trade:

                                                                   PF t

                                                                  PHt   t

       This completes the description of the model environment and the equilibrium system, which we
also summarize in Appendix A.3.

Shocks       are summarizes in Table 1, along with the parameters of the model and their baseline values,
which we use in Sections 3 and 4 for quantitative evaluation of the model. In general, we allow shocks
to follow arbitrary joint stochastic processes with unrestricted patterns of cross-correlations. In this
sense, our shocks are not primitive innovations, but rather disturbances to the equilibrium conditions
of the model, akin to Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2007) wedges.10 We use them differently, however.
Instead of accounting for the sources of variation in the macro variables, we prove two theoretical
results characterizing which subsets of disturbances can and cannot result in an equilibrium disconnect
behavior of the exchange rates, as defined below.
  10
    For example, Eaton, Kortum, and Neiman (2015) is a recent study, which uses wedge accounting in the international
context. Our approach differs in that we do not attempt to fully match macroeconomic time series, but instead focus on a
specific theoretical mechanism, which accounts for a set of exchange rate disconnect moments within a parsimonious model.
This is also what sets our paper apart from the international DSGE literature following Eichenbaum and Evans (1995).




                                                                  10
2.2      Disconnect in the limit
This section uses the general modeling framework to prove two propositions, which narrow down the
set of shocks that can be consistent with the empirical exchange rate disconnect properties. In par-
ticular, we study the behavior of the equilibrium system around the autarky limit, which we use as
a diagnostic device. The autarky limit (as foreign share γ → 0) is interesting for two reasons:
   1. Autarky (γ = 0) offers a model of complete exchange rate disconnect. When countries are in
         autarky, the nominal exchange rate is of no consequence, and can take any values as an outcome
         of arbitrary sunspot equilibria. Therefore, it can be arbitrary volatile, yet have no relationship
         with any macro variables in the two economies (the Meese-Rogoff puzzle). Since price levels
         do not respond to this volatility, the real exchange rate comoves perfectly with these nominal
         exchange rate shocks, and as a result can exhibit arbitrary persistence (the PPP puzzle). This is
         possible because in autarky the real exchange rate does not affect allocations.
   2. Furthermore, away from autarky, the response of macro variables to exchange rate tends to in-
         crease together with the degree of openness γ, resulting in more volatile and less disconnected
         macroeconomic behavior (see Appendix Figure A1 for illustration). Therefore, if the economy
         does not exhibit exchange rate disconnect properties near autarky (for γ ≈ 0), it is unlikely to
         feature them away from autarky (for γ  0).11 In addition, γ ≈ 0 is not an unreasonable point
         of approximation from an empirical perspective, as we discuss in Section 3.
We now extend the autarky logic to study circumstances under which a near-closed economy features
a near-complete exchange rate disconnect. While such continuity requirement may appear natural as the
equilibrium dynamics is continuous in γ, it nonetheless offers a sharp selection criterion for exogenous
shocks. This is because a limiting economy with γ > 0 acts as a refinement on equilibria when γ = 0,
as it rules out the sunspot equilibria with volatile exchange rate dynamics.
       We start by formalizing the notion of exchange rate disconnect in the autarky limit:

Definition 1 (Exchange rate disconnect in the limit) Denote with Zt ≡ (Wt , Pt , Ct , Lt , Yt , Rt )
a vector of all domestic macro variables (wage rate, price level, consumption, employment, output, interest rate)
and with εt ≡ V0 Ωt + V∗ 0 Ω∗t an arbitrary combination of shocks Ωt = {wt , χt , κt , at , gt , µt , ηt , ξt , ψt }.
We say that an open economy (with γ > 0) exhibits exchange rate disconnect in the autarky limit, if the
impulse responses have the following properties:

                            dZt+j                                                     dEt
                          lim     = 0 for all j ≥ 0                 and         lim       6= 0.                     (21)
                         γ→0 dεt                                                γ→0   dεt

                                                   d log Et+j −d log Qt+j
A corollary of condition (21) is that limγ→0                 dεt            = 0 for all j ≥ 0.

In words, a model, defined by its structure and the set of shocks, exhibits exchange rate disconnect in
the autarky limit if the shocks have a vanishingly small effect on the macro variables, yet result in a
  11
    The empirical literature finds that more open economies have less volatile exchange rates, even after controlling for
country size and other characteristics (e.g., Hau 2002), which is a pattern reproduced by our model (see Section 3.1).



                                                           11
volatile equilibrium exchange rate, as captured by the two conditions in (21). This property captures the
exchange rate disconnect in its narrow Meese-Rogoff sense. However, as the corollary points out, this
property also implies the PPP-puzzle behavior for the real exchange rate, which in the limit comoves
one-for-one with the nominal exchange rate.
       Definition 1 immediately allows us to exclude a large number of candidate shocks:

Proposition 1 The model of Section 2.1 cannot exhibit exchange rate disconnect in the autarky limit (21),
if the combined shock εt in Definition 1 has a weight of zero on the subset of shocks {ηt , ηt∗ , ξt , ξt∗ , ψt }.

                                                            t ≡ {wt , χt , κt , at , gt , µt } together with
In other words, this proposition states that the shocks in Ω∅
their foreign counterparts, in any combinations and with arbitrary cross-correlations, cannot reproduce
an exchange rate disconnect property even as the economy approaches autarky. We provide a formal
proof in Appendix A.4, yet the intuition behind this result is straightforward: Any of the shocks in
Ω∅
 t will have a direct effect on real allocations, prices, and/or interest rates, and thus cannot result
in a volatile exchange rate without having a direct effect on the macro variables of the same order of
magnitude.12 Therefore, as an economy subject to these shocks approaches autarky, the disconnect
property (21) is necessarily violated. The proof of this proposition does not rely on the international
risk sharing condition, and therefore this result is robust to the assumption about (in)completeness of
the international asset markets.
       Proposition 1 can be viewed as pessimistic news for both the International RBC and the New Open
Economy Macro (NOEM) models of the exchange rate. It does not imply, however, that productivity
cannot be an important source of exogenous shocks. Instead, it suggests that productivity shocks at
are unlikely to be the dominant drivers of exchange rate movements if the model is to exhibit exchange
rate disconnect.13 The same applies to monetary shocks in a model with nominal rigidities, which we
study in detail in Section 4.1.
       We view Proposition 1 as a diagnostic tool suggesting that the shocks in Ω∅
                                                                                 t are unlikely to be suc-
cessful at reproducing the empirical exchange rate behavior even away from the autarky limit. There-
fore, we should first explore the other three types of shocks — namely, the LOP deviation (or trade
cost) shock ηt , the international good demand shock ξt , and/or the financial shock ψt — as the likely
key drivers of the exchange rate dynamics. The distinctive feature of these shocks is that they affect
the equilibrium system exclusively through the international equilibrium conditions: ψt affects interna-
tional risk sharing (see (39) below), while ηt and ξt affect the country budget constraint (19) through
  12
      Intuitively, the unit of account wt shocks result in wage inflation, the markup µt shocks result in price inflation, the
labor wedge κt shocks result in changes in either employment or consumption, the productivity at shocks result in changes
in either employment or output, the government spending gt shocks result in changes in either consumption or output, and
the intertemporal preference shocks χt result in changes in the interest rate (see illustration in Figure A1). The formal proof
in Appendix A.4 establishes further that no combination of these shocks can be consistent with the disconnect property (21).
   13
      Productivity shocks can have two additional indirect effects, either acting as news shocks about future productivity or by
affecting the risk premium (e.g., rare-disaster or long-run-risk shocks). As the direct effect of the productivity shock becomes
vanishingly small relative to its indirect effects, this shock becomes similar to an Euler-equation shock in that it does not
affect the static equilibrium conditions (see Appendix A.8). Proposition 1 nonetheless applies as long as the direct effect of
the productivity shock is non-trivial.




                                                              12
their impact on export prices (13) and export demand (18) respectively.14 The impact of shocks to these
equilibrium conditions on the macro variables is vanishingly small as the economy becomes closed to
international trade in goods and assets, yet such shocks can have substantial effect on the equilibrium
exchange rates and terms of trade even when γ is close to zero.
       Proposition 1 does not allow us to discriminate between the remaining three types of shocks, as they
all satisfy the autarky-limit disconnect condition (21). Yet, these shocks differ in the implied comove-
ment between exchange rates and macro variables, which we now use as a further selection criterion.
In particular, we explore the comovement between the exchange rates and respectively terms of trade,
relative consumption, and the interest rate differential, near the autarky limit (as γ → 0). Since these
shocks are already consistent with the Meese-Rogoff and the PPP puzzles by virtue of Proposition 1, the
additional moments correspond to the three remaining exchange rate puzzles. We prove the following
result (see Appendix A.4):

Proposition 2 Near the autarky limit (for γ → 0), the international asset demand shock ψt is the only
shock in {ηt , ηt∗ , ξt , ξt∗ , ψt } that simultaneously and robustly produces:
   (i) a positive correlation between the terms of trade and the real exchange rate;
  (ii) a negative correlation between relative consumption growth and real exchange rate depreciation;
 (iii) deviations from the UIP and a negative Fama coefficient.

       The main conclusion is that both the LOP deviation (trade cost) shock ηt and the international good
demand shock ξt produce the counterfactual comovement between the exchange rates and respectively
relative consumption (the Backus-Smith puzzle) and interest rate differential (the Forward Premium
puzzle). The financial shock ψt is instead consistent with both of these empirical patterns, as we explain
in detail in Section 3.
       To summarize, Propositions 1 and 2 explain why most shocks have a hard time at reproducing
the empirical exchange rate properties, and hence why these properties are labeled as puzzles in the
literature. These propositions favor the financial shock ψt as the likely shock to generate exchange rate
disconnect in an equilibrium model. While these propositions are concerned with the autarky limit, the
continuity of the model in trade openness γ suggests that the near-disconnect properties should hold
for γ > 0, but small. In Sections 3, we explore the properties of the model with the ψt shock alone,
away from the autarky limit, and in Section 4 we bring back the additional shocks.

2.3      Models of financial shock ψt
Since Propositions 1 and 2 favor the international asset demand shock ψt as the likely source of the
exchange rate disconnect, we discuss here a number of microfoundations for the origins of this shock. In
view of the parity condition between home and foreign bonds (arising from (4) upon log-linearization),
the ψt is commonly referred to as the UIP shock:

                                              it − i∗t − Et ∆et+1 = ψt ,                                               (22)
  14
    The ξt and ηt shocks are additionally featured in the goods market clearing (17)–(18) and in the price level (6), but in
both cases their effect on these conditions is proportional to trade openness γ, and thus vanishes in the autarky limit.


                                                            13
where it − i∗t = log Rt − log Rt∗ and et = log Et . It follows that the (uncovered) interest rate parity
it − i∗t − Et ∆et+1 deviates from zero by the magnitude of the financial shock ψt , which may have a
number of origins explored in the macro-finance literature (see also Cochrane 2016):
   1. Exogenous preference for international assets, where ψt is an ad hoc shock to the utility from
       holding the foreign bond, as a result of which domestic households are willing to hold the for-
       eign asset with a negative excess return (UIP deviation), as in Dekle, Jeong, and Kiyotaki (2014).
       This approach is closely related to the non-optimizing portfolio balance models of the 1970-80s
       (e.g. Kouri 1976, 1983, Branson and Henderson 1985), revived recently by Blanchard, Giavazzi,
       and Sa (2005) and Gourinchas (2008).
   2. Noise traders and limits to arbitrage in currency markets, as in Jeanne and Rose (2002), where
       all international trade in assets needs to go through risk-averse intermediaries, who are willing
       to be exposed to the currency risk only if they are offered a sufficient compensation in the form
       of a positive expected return. A noise trader shock ψt , thus, needs to be accommodated by a
       UIP deviation. In Section 4.2, we explore a general equilibrium version of this model and its
       implications for exchange rate disconnect and additional exchange rate puzzles.
   3. A related class of models relies on financial frictions to generate upward sloping supply in the
       currency market, where ψt represents shocks to the risk-bearing capacity of the financial sector,
       for example a shock to the net worth of the financial intermediaries limiting the size of the posi-
       tions that they can absorb (see e.g. Hau and Rey 2006, Brunnermeier, Nagel, and Pedersen 2009,
       Gabaix and Maggiori 2015, Adrian, Etula, and Shin 2015).
   4. Incomplete information, heterogeneous beliefs and expectational errors in the currency market,
       as in Evans and Lyons (2002), Gourinchas and Tornell (2004) and Bacchetta and van Wincoop
       (2006), where ψt represents the deviations from the full-information rational expectations.
   5. Time-varying risk premia models, where ψt corresponds to shocks to the second moments of the
       stochastic discount factor, such as rare disasters (Farhi and Gabaix 2016), long-run risk (Colacito
       and Croce 2013), or habits (Verdelhan 2010). For convenience, these models typically assume
       complete markets, while an alternative approach relies on modeling segmented markets, where
       the SDF shocks emerge from the participation margin (see e.g. Alvarez, Atkeson, and Kehoe 2009).
Given our focus on the set of moments characterizing the empirical exchange rate disconnect, all the
approaches to modeling the financial shock ψt listed above are isomorphic, as they all result in a ver-
sion of equation (22), and hence we cannot distinguish between them. The specific models of ψt can
be discriminated based on a richer set of asset market moments, e.g. a term structure of carry trade
returns or a comovement of exchange rate with returns across various asset classes.15 In particular,
in Section 4.2 we address an additional Engel (2016) risk premium puzzle in the context of a specific
financial model of the ψt shock that we adopt.
  15
    See, for example, Farhi, Fraiberger, Gabaix, Ranciere, and Verdelhan (2009), Lustig and Verdelhan (2016) and Du, Tepper,
and Verdelhan (2016).




                                                            14
3         Baseline Model of Exchange Rate Disconnect
Our baseline model features a single shock — the financial shock ψt — and the transmission mecha-
nism, which emphasizes home bias in expenditure (low γ), strategic complementarities in price set-
ting (α > 0), and weak substitutability between home and foreign goods (θ > 1, but small). The other
parameters, including the intertemporal elasticity of substitution (IES) and the elasticity of labor sup-
ply, prove to be less consequential for the results, as we discuss below. Even more surprisingly, nominal
rigidities turn out to be of little importance for generating the quantitative exchange rate disconnect
properties in response to a ψt shock. Therefore, our baseline model does not feature any nominal rigidi-
ties, and for simplicity we assume that the monetary authorities adopt policy rules which fully stabilize
respective wage inflations at zero (specifically, we have Wt ≡ 1 and Wt∗ ≡ 1). We extend our analysis
to allow for nominal rigidities, conventional Taylor rules and multiple sources of shocks in Section 4.1.
         The model of this section is analytically tractable (upon log-linearization), and all our results can
be easily obtained with pen and paper, which allows us to fully explore the intuitions behind various
mechanisms. At the same time, we emphasize the quantitative objective of this section. That is, our
goal is to establish whether a simple one-shock model can be quantitatively consistent with a rich set of
moments describing the comovement between exchange rates and macro variables. In doing so, we tie
our hands from the start, and calibrate the parameters of the model on which we have direct and reliable
empirical evidence. In particular, we set γ = 0.07 to be consistent with the 0.28 trade (imports plus
exports) to GDP ratio of the United States, provided the intermediate input share φ = 0.5.16 We further
use the estimate of Amiti, Itskhoki, and Konings (2016) of the elasticity of strategic complementarities
α = 0.4, which is also in line with much of the markup and pass-through literature and corresponds
to the own cost shock pass-through elasticity of 1 − α = 0.6 (see survey in Gopinath and Itskhoki
2011). In contrast, the value of the elasticity of substitution between home and foreign goods θ is more
contested. We follow here the recent estimates of Feenstra, Luck, Obstfeld, and Russ (2014) and set
θ = 1.5, which is also the number used in the original calibrations of Backus, Kehoe, and Kydland
(1994) and Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2002).17
         For concreteness, we assume the financial shock ψt follows an exogenous AR(1) process:

                                                    ψt = ρψt−1 + εt ,                                                     (23)

with persistence ρ ∈ [0, 1] and variance of innovations given by σε2 . For our quantitative analysis,
we assume that ψt shocks are small, but persistent. While ψt shocks are not directly observable, the
model implies that ρ equals the equilibrium persistence of the interest rates. We, therefore, set ρ = 0.97.
    16
      This value of the trade-to-GDP ratio is also characteristic of the other large developed economies (Japan and the Euro
Zone). Appendix A.3.1 derives the relationship between the value of the trade-to-GDP ratio and the value of γ (steady state
imports-to-expenditure ratio), which we set to be four times smaller. Intuitively, imports in a symmetric steady state are half
of total trade (imports plus exports), and GDP (final consumption) is about one half of the total expenditure with the other
half allocated to intermediate inputs (φ = 0.5). This value of φ is consistent with both aggregate input-output matrices and
firm level data on intermediate expenditure share in total sales. The decomposition of gross exports for the U.S., the E.U. and
Japan in Koopman, Wang, and Wei (2014) suggests this proportion holds for trade flows as well.
   17
      The macro elasticity of substitution between the aggregates of home and foreign goods is indeed the relevant elasticity
for our analysis, while the estimates of the micro elasticity at more disaggregated levels are typically larger (around 4). The
quantitative performance of our model does not deteriorate significantly for elasticities of substitution as high as 3.


                                                              15
For the remaining parameters, we set the relative risk aversion σ = 2, the Frish elasticity of labor supply
ν = 1 and the (quarterly) discount factor β = 0.99, as we summarize in Table 1.18 We show robustness
to alternative parameter values in Appendix A.5.2. Furthermore, our theoretical results require only
a weak parameter restriction, easily met in conventional calibrations, as we discuss in Appendix A.5.1.

3.1      Equilibrium exchange rate dynamics
The model admits a convenient recursive structure, which allows us to solve for the relationship be-
tween exchange rate and macro variables (prices, quantities and interest rates) using static equilibrium
conditions, as we do in turn in Sections 3.2–3.5 and Appendix A.5. We start, however, with the charac-
terization of the equilibrium exchange rate dynamics.
       The equilibrium exchange rate process is shaped by the interplay between the country budget con-
straint (19) and international risk sharing, as captured by the UIP condition (22). Using the static equi-
librium conditions, we solve for the equilibrium relationships between net exports, interest rates and
exchange rate, which allows us to rewrite (22) and the log-linearized version of (19) as:19

                                                                      1
                                                Et ∆et+1 = −               ψt ,                                           (24)
                                                                   1 + γλ1
                                              βb∗t+1 − b∗t = nxt = γλ2 et .                                               (25)

The coefficients λ1 and λ2 depend on the structural model parameters, other than β and ρ. We have
λ1 , λ2 > 0 under mild parameter restrictions, such as the Marshall-Lerner condition, which we assume
are satisfied (see Appendix A.5.1). Equation (25) reflects simply that net foreign assets accumulate with
trade surpluses, which in turn increase with exchange rate depreciations, and more so the more open
is the country to international trade. Equation (24), in turn, suggests that a financial shock ψt > 0 —
that is, an increase in foreign asset demand — requires an expected appreciation of the home currency
to balance the depressed relative demand for the domestic bond.20
       We solve the dynamic system (24) and (25), together with the shock process (23), to obtain:

Proposition 3 (Equilibrium exchange rate process) In the baseline model with the financial shock
ψt ∼ AR(1) with persistence ρ and innovation εt , the equilibrium nominal exchange rate et follows an
ARIMA(1,1,1), or equivalently ∆et ∼ ARMA(1,1), with an AR root ρ and a non-invertible MA root 1/β:
                                                                                    

                               ∆et = ρ∆et−1 +                               εt − εt−1 .                                   (26)

This describes the unique equilibrium exchange rate path, and non-fundamental solutions do not exist.

       We normalize and fix all shocks/wedges of Section 2.1, other than ψt (i.e., wt = at = χt = κt = ηt = ξt = gt = µt ≡ 0).
  19
       In Appendix A.3, we log-linearize the equilibrium system around a symmetric steady steady, and by default use small
letters for log deviations. Since the NFA position Bt∗ and net exports N Xt are zero in a symmetric steady state, we denote
b∗t ≡ P̄ Ē Ȳ Bt∗ and nxt ≡ P̄ 1 Ȳ N Xt .

       Observe from (22) that ψt > 0 must be accommodated either by it −i∗t > 0, or by Et ∆et+1 < 0 (expected appreciation),
both of which moderate the increased demand for the foreign bond. We show in Section 3.5 that both of this occurs in equi-
librium, with the relative importance of the interest rate adjustment decreasing in country openness. In the autarky limit, the
interest rates do not move, and we have Et ∆et+1 = −ψt , consistent with (24) as γ → 0.


                                                              16
An analytical proof of this proposition in Appendix A.5 relies on the Blanchard and Kahn (1980) solution
method, while here we offer a more intuitive explanation. Asset market equilibrium condition (24)
determines the expected path of the future exchange rate changes, as emphasize by Engel and West
(2005), and can be iterated forward to obtain:
                              n                 1    XT          o             1      ψt
                et = lim       Et et+T +                  Et ψt+j = Et e∞ +               .                                 (27)
                       T →∞                  1 + γλ1  j=0                   1 + γλ1 1 − ρ

In contrast to Engel and West (2005), however, the general version of the risk sharing (or UIP) condi-
tion features no discounting, and therefore admits a multiplicity of no-bubble solutions parametrized
by the long-run expectation Et e∞ . Nonetheless, the equilibrium path of the exchange rate is uniquely
pinned down by the intertemporal budget constraint, which obtains from (25) by iterating forward and
imposing the No Ponzi Game Condition on net foreign assets limT →∞ β T b∗t+T +1 = 0. This pins down
the only budget-consistent long-run expectation, and hence the instantaneous level of the exchange
rate et , according to (26).21 Indeed, any deviation from these values of et and Et e∞ would shift the
whole path of the exchange rate, and hence all trade surpluses on the right-hand side of (25), violating
the intertemporal budget constraint. This general equilibrium discipline on the exchange rate determi-
nation is what distinguishes our solution from that in Engel and West (2005), as we discuss in detail in
Appendix A.7.
       An increase in foreign asset demand (i.e., εt > 0 in (26)) results in an instantaneous deprecia-
tion of the home currency, while also predicting an expected appreciation according to (24), akin to
the celebrated overshooting mechanism of Dornbusch (1976). This exchange rate path ensures both
equilibrium in the financial market (via expected appreciation) and balanced country budget (via in-
stantaneous depreciation). Lastly, note that the equilibrium exchange rate process (26) is shaped by
parameters ρ and β, and depends on the other parameters of the model only through the proportional
volatility scaler 1/(1 + γλ1 ). In particular, since λ1 > 0, the exchange rate volatility increases as the
economy becomes more closed to international trade, and it is maximized in the autarky limit.
       Equation (24) suggests departures from the random walk behavior and implies predictability of
the nominal exchange rate. We now explore how pronounced are these properties quantitatively and
whether the equilibrium exchange rate process predicted by our model can be consistent with the
empirical near-random-walk behavior:22

  21
     Iterating (25) forward and applying the NPGC, we obtain b∗t + γλ2 ∞           j
                                                                          P
                                                                             j=0 β et+j = 0, which a fortiori holds in expec-
tations. Combining this with (27), which implies Et et+j = Et e∞ + 1+γλ  1     1
                                                                            1 1−ρ
                                                                                  ρj ψt , we obtain the solution for the level of
                                                                    ∗
exchange rate as a function of the shock ψt and the state variable bt (the predetermined NFA position):
                                                   1       β         1
                                         et =                  ψt −     (1 − β)b∗t .

Lastly, combining with (25), we express (∆et , ∆b∗t+1 ) as a function of exogenous innovations to the financial shock ψt .
  22
     Indeed, there exists empirical evidence on the departure of the exchange rate process from a pure random walk (see e.g.
Lustig, Stathopoulos, and Verdelhan 2016, as well as our discussion in Section 4.2).




                                                               17
Proposition 4 (Near-random-walk behavior) The equilibrium exchange rate process (26) becomes
indistinguishable from a random walk as βρ → 1. In particular, the following properties hold:23
    1. The autocorrelation of exchange rate changes becomes arbitrary close to zero:

                                                cov(∆et+1 , ∆et )    1−ρ
                                          lim                     =−     −−−→ 0.
                                         β→1       var(∆et )          2 ρ→1

    2. The contribution of the predictable component to the variance of ∆et+1 shrinks to zero, or equiva-
       lently the unpredictable component (innovation) fully dominates the variance of ∆et+1 :

                                             var(∆et+1 − Et ∆et+1 )   1+ρ
                                       lim                          =     −−−→ 1.
                                      β→1         var(∆et+1 )          2 ρ→1

    3. The volatility of the exchange rate innovation (surprise) becomes unboundedly large relative to the
       volatility of the financial shock:

                                  var(∆et+1 − Et ∆et+1 )        1      1+ρ
                               lim                       =           2
                                                                            −−−→ ∞.
                              β→1      var(ψt+1 )          (1 + γλ1 ) 1 − ρ ρ→1

    The results in Proposition 4 derive directly from the exchange rate process in (26), and we provide
the formal algebra behind them in Appendix A.5. A simple way to see why the exchange rate process
in (26) approaches a random walk is to rewrite it using the lag operator:

                                                          1       β
                                                                      1 − β −1 L εt .
                                                                                
                                  (1 − ρL)∆et =                                                                            (28)
                                                       1 + γλ1 1 − βρ

As both β and ρ become close to 1, the lag operators on the two sides of the equation cancel out, and
the process converges to a random walk. Intuitively, a more persistent financial shock results in a more
persistent expected appreciation with a larger effect on the cumulative discounted value of future net
exports, especially when β is high. Therefore, when β and ρ are both large, a given shock εt requires
a large contemporaneous jump in the exchange rate et to balance the intertemporal budget constraint
of the country. In other words, the innovation to et is large relative to the innovation to Et ∆et+1 , and
hence the unexpected component of the exchange rate changes dominates the expected component,
making the process more like a random walk.
    We now explore the extent to which Proposition 4 provides an accurate approximation of the ex-
change rate properties away from the βρ → 1 limit. In particular, Figure 1 plots the impulse response of
the exchange rate (left panel) and the finite-sample variance decomposition of exchange rate changes
(right panel) for our baseline case with β = 0.99 and ρ = 0.97. The left panel illustrates that in re-
sponse to a financial shock εt the model produces a large depreciation ∆et > 0 on impact, followed
immediately by small and persistent expected appreciations in all future periods Et ∆et+j < 0 for j ≥ 1,
   23
      Note that we first take the β → 1 limit and then consider the ρ → 1 limit. This is because for β < 1 and ρ = 1
the unconditional second moments are not well-defined for ∆et , as it becomes an integrated process. This sequential limit
provides a good quantitative approximation to our baseline case in which ρ = 0.97 < β = 0.99. For the last two moments,
we assume that {εt , εt−1 , . . .} is part of the information set at time t when constructing Et ∆et+1 , even though the MA root
of the et process is non-invertible, hence offering a conservative lower bound for our results.

to the variance of the exchange rate change ∆k et+k ≡ et+k − et−1 at various horizons k ≥ 0 (the k = 0 case corresponds
to the second moment in Proposition 4). The shaded area is the 95% bootstrap confidence interval in a sample of 120 quarters.


with ∆et about 25 times larger than Et ∆et+1 in absolute value. The right panel further shows that the
unexpected component dominates the variance of the exchange rate at all horizons. In the limit, the
expected future appreciations become arbitrary small relative to the size of the devaluation on impact,
and thus the impulse response converges to that of a white noise for ∆et (or equivalently, random walk
for et ). In our baseline calibration, the autocorrelation of ∆et has a median estimate of −0.02 and is
not statistically different from zero in 30-year-long samples (see Appendix Table A1).
        To summarize, we find that with a conventional value of the discount factor β and the value
of ρ = 0.97, the model reproduces a volatile near-random-walk behavior for the nominal exchange
rate, consistent with Meese and Rogoff (1983). Lastly, we point out that these near-random-walk be-
havior of the nominal exchange rate is a joint equilibrium outcome with the persistent evolution of the
net foreign asset position b∗t (the state variable), which follows an AR(1) process in first differences.
Nonetheless, the response of b∗t to the financial shock is muted quantitatively when the economy is
relatively closed to international trade (i.e., when γ is low; see Appendix A.5).

3.2       Real exchange rate and the PPP puzzle
We next explore the equilibrium dynamics of the real exchange rate (RER) and the associated purchasing
power parity (PPP) puzzle, which we broadly interpret as the close comovement between the nominal
and the real exchange rates, and a volatile near-random-walk behavior of both variables. As emphasized
by Rogoff (1996), the high volatility of RER is at odds with the productivity shocks, including shocks to
the relative productivity of non-tradables, while the high persistence of RER (3–5 year half-lives) is at
odds with the monetary shocks given conventional price durations.


                                                             19
    We start by rewriting the definition of RER in (14) in logs as:

                                                   qt ≡ et + p∗t − pt .                                                  (29)

Combining the definition of the price level (6) with the price setting equations for domestic and foreign
goods ((12) and the foreign counterpart to (13)), we obtain (in the absence of the markup shocks):
                                                             
                                                      1                  1     γ
                                     pt = wt −           at        +                qt ,                                 (30)
                                                     1−φ               1 − φ 1 − 2γ

                 1                                                                1   γ
where (wt −     1−φ at )   is the domestic nominal unit labor cost and           1−φ 1−2γ qt   captures the effect of the
cost of foreign goods (both final and intermediate) on the price of the domestic consumption bundle.24
    A long tradition in international macro literature models the real exchange rate as the relative price
of non-tradables (e.g., the Balassa-Samuelson effect). This approach is, however, at odds with the empir-
ical decomposition in Engel (1999), which finds a negligible role for the relative non-tradable prices in
shaping the dynamics of the real exchange rate. We, therefore, choose to abstract from explicitly model-
ing the relative prices of non-tradables. As a result, the price level in (30) depends on the overall degree
of home bias γ, but not on how the domestic expenditure is split between tradables and non-tradables.
    Combining (30) and its foreign counterpart for p∗t with the definition of qt in (29), we solve for the
relationship between nominal and real exchange rates:
                                                                             
                                1     2γ                 ∗           1   ∗
                           1+                qt = et + (wt − wt ) −    (a − at ) .                                       (31)
                              1 − φ 1 − 2γ                          1−φ t

Intuitively, when γ is small, the real exchange rate approximately equals the differential unit labor costs
in the two countries. In contrast, as the home bias disappears (γ → 1/2), we have qt → 0, and the
purchasing power parity holds in the limit. Recall that in our baseline model we switch off productivity
shocks (that is, at −a∗t ≡ 0) and assume that the monetary policy fully stabilizes wage inflation (namely,
wt = wt∗ ≡ 0), and therefore (31) implies the following result:

Proposition 5 (Real exchange rate) In the baseline model, the relationship between the real exchange
rates qt and the nominal exchange rate et is given by:

                                                               1
                                                 qt =         1   2γ et .                                                (32)
                                                        1+   1−φ 1−2γ

Therefore, qt is perfectly correlated with et , follows the same ARIMA process with a proportionally smaller
innovation, and limγ→0 (qt − et ) = 0. The estimated AR(1) coefficient for qt increases towards 1 with
sample size, and hence the corresponding half-life estimate increases without bound.

    Thus, in response to a financial shocks ψt , the nominal and real exchange rates are perfectly cor-
related, equally persistent, and the real exchange rate is somewhat less volatile:
   24
      Note that the expression for pt does not depend on the strategic complementarity elasticity α, which controls the extent
of exchange rate pass-through. With firms symmetric in α, low pass-through into import prices is exactly offset by the
domestic firm price adjustment (for further analysis see Burstein and Gopinath 2012, Amiti, Itskhoki, and Konings 2016).


                                                             20
                                            std(∆qt )        1

                                            std(∆et )   1 + 1−φ 1−2γ

with this gap vanishing as the economy becomes closed to international trade (γ → 0). Quantitatively,
under our baseline parameterization with γ = 0.07, the real exchange rate is three-quarters as volatile
as the nominal exchange rate. We show in Section 4.1 that nominal rigidities push this relative volatility
close to 1, as in the data. However, we emphasize here that even the simple version of our model without
any price or wage stickiness can account for the bulk of the empirical properties of the real exchange
rate. In particular, if one were to fit an AR(1) process for the real exchange rate, as is conventionally
done in the PPP puzzle literature surveyed in Rogoff (1996), one would be challenged to find evidence
of mean reversion and would infer very long half-lives for the real exchange rate process. In Appendix
Figure A3, we show that under our baseline parametrization with ρ = 0.97, the model reproduces the
3-to-5 year half-lives of the real exchange rate in finite (30-year-long) samples.25
    In summary, our model is consistent with the PPP puzzle in that it reproduces the close comovement
between the nominal and the real exchange rates. Furthermore, this is achieved without any reliance
on nominal rigidities. A natural question then is why the PPP puzzle posed such a challenge to the
literature? Equations (29)–(31) offer an explanation. The close comovement between qt and et suggests
that the price levels pt and p∗t should, in turn, move little with the nominal exchange rate et (see (29)).
The PPP puzzle literature has largely focused on one conceptual possibility, namely that price levels
move little due to nominal rigidities, assuming monetary shocks to be the main drivers of the nominal
exchange rate. The issue with this approach is that monetary shocks necessarily imply cointegration
between relative nominal variables — (wt − wt∗ ), (pt − p∗t ) and et — which results in mean reversion
in the real exchange rate qt . The speed of this mean reversion is directly controled by the duration of
nominal price stickiness, which is empirically insufficient to generate long half lives characteristic of
the real exchange rate.
    We focus on the other conceptual possibility, namely that prices are largely disconnected from
exchange rates, or in other words the low exchange rate pass-through into CPI inflation even in the
long run, due to substantial home bias (small γ; see (30)), as is the case empirically. Importantly, this
mechanism requires that the main drivers of the exchange rate are not productivity or monetary shocks,
which drive a wedge between nominal and real exchange rates independently of the extent of the home
bias, as reflected by (at − a∗t ) and (wt − wt∗ ) terms in (31). Instead, the shock we focus on is the
financial shock ψt , and it drives no wedge between nominal and real exchange rates, even in the long-
run. Home bias is thus the only relevant part of the transmission mechanism, leaving nominal rigidities,
real rigidities (α), or the extent of expenditure switching (θ) largely irrelevant.26 The mechanism does
rely, however, on the monetary policy rule. We show in Section 4.1 that our results are robust to
conventional Taylor rules, but are sensitive to a switch to an exchange rate peg.
   25
      While real exchange rate follows an integrated ARIMA(1,1,1) process in the baseline model, Section 4.2 offers an extension
with a financial sector, in which it follows a mean-reverting ARMA(2,1), yet the two are indistinguishable in finite samples.
   26
      As a result, our model is also consistent with the Kehoe and Midrigan (2008)’s finding of the missing correlation between
price durations and RER persistence across sectors, which is evidence against monetary shocks as the key driver of the
nominal exchange rate rather than against sticky prices as the transmission mechanism.



                                                              21
3.3     Exchange rates and the terms of trade
In this section we explore the joint properties of the equilibrium (CPI-based) real exchange rate, terms
of trade and producer prices. As emphasized by Atkeson and Burstein (2008), the conventional models
imply a counterfactually volatile terms of trade and producer prices relative to consumer prices. In the
data, consumer- and producer-based real exchange rates are equally volatile, while the terms of trade
are substantially more stable — about two-to-three times less volatile than the real exchange rate.
      The results in this section follow from two equilibrium relationships between real exchange rates
(RER) and the terms of trade (ToT):

                                               qt = (1 − γ)qtP − γst ,                                      (33)
                                               st =   qtP   − 2αqt ,                                        (34)

where st = pF t − p∗Ht − et is the log of the ToT in (20) and qtP ≡ p∗F t + et − pHt is the log producer-
price RER. Intuitively, (33) reflects that the relative consumer prices qt differ from the relative producer
prices qtP by the relative price of imports st . Equation (34), in turn, states that the terms of trade reflect
the relative producer prices adjusted for the law of one price deviations of exports (recall from (14) that
the log LOP deviation equals αqt ).
      Conventional models, without strategic complementarities (α = 0), and thus without LOP devia-
tions, imply that the ToT equal producer RER, and both are more volatile than the consumer RER:

                                                                  1
                                                st = qtP =            qt .
                                                               1 − 2γ

Intuitively, consumer prices are less volatile than producer prices as they smooth out the relative price
fluctuations by combining home and foreign goods into the consumption bundle (i.e., a diversification
argument). This is, however, empirically counterfactual, and as explained by Atkeson and Burstein
(2008) is not necessarily the case in the models with pricing to market (PTM), arising, for example, from
strategic complementarities in price setting (α > 0). Combining (33) and (34) together, we arrive at:

Proposition 6 (Real exchange rate and the terms of trade) The real exchange rates and the terms
of trade are linked by the following equilibrium relationships:

                                       1 − 2αγ                           1 − 2α(1 − γ)
                            qtP =              qt      and        st =                 qt .                 (35)
                                        1 − 2γ                              1 − 2γ

The empirical patterns std(∆st )  std(∆qt ) ≈ std(∆qtP ) and corr(∆st , ∆qt ) > 0 obtain when strate-
                                                                                    γ             1
gic complementarities in price setting are significant, but not too strong:        1−γ   α<   2(1−γ) .
               γ
When α >      1−γ ,   the model reproduces the empirically relevant case, in which RER qt is considerably
more volatile than the ToT st . Pricing to market (α > 0) smoothes out the response of ToT to changes in
the producer prices qtP , and hence makes ToT less volatile, as export prices mimic the local competition.
                               1
Very strong PTM, α >        2(1−γ) ,   just like local currency pricing (LCP), can turn the positive correlation
between ToT and RER into negative, which is empirically counterfactual, as emphasized by Obstfeld

                                                             22
and Rogoff (2000). For the intermediate values, α . 0.5, the performance of the model is good on both
margins. Additionally, a low value of γ ensures that std(∆qt ) ≈ std(∆qtP ), as is the case empirically.
Under our baseline parameterization with γ = 0.07 and α = 0.4, the terms of trade are about a third
as volatile as the real exchange rate, yet still positively correlated, exactly as in the data.27 We further
explore these quantitative implications of the model in Appendix Figure A4.

3.4      Exchange rate and consumption: the Backus-Smith puzzle
We now study the relationship between the real exchange rate and aggregate consumption. We start
with the static optimality conditions characterizing equilibrium in the labor and product markets. First,
we combine labor supply (3) with labor demand (10) to arrive at:

                                                              ν+φ γ
                                           σνct + yt = −                   qt ,                                          (36)
                                                              1 − φ 1 − 2γ

where we also used (30) to express the real wage (wt − pt ) on the right-hand side as a decreasing
function of qt . Real depreciation (high qt ) depresses the real wage through the increased cost of foreign
goods. Equation (36) characterizes the locus of allocations consistent with equilibrium in the labor
market, with low consumption associated with high output (for a given qt ), reflecting the income effect
on labor supply.
       Second, we look at the product market clearing condition, which derives from (17)–(18), and upon
log-linearization results in:28
                                                                                   
                                     ∗
                                                        ∗
                                                                         1−γ
           yt = (1 − φ) (1 − γ)ct + γct + φ (1 − γ)yt + γyt + γ 2θ(1 − α)        − φ qt .                                (37)
                                                                          1 − 2γ

 This equation characterizes the locus of allocations consistent with equilibrium in the product mar-
ket. Note that in the closed economy (γ = 0), we simply have yt = ct , which holds in log deviations
independently of the intermediate share φ. In the open economy, the home production yt is split be-
tween final consumption at home and abroad, as well as the intermediate use at home and abroad, as
reflected by the first two terms on the right-hand side of equation (37). The remaining term in the real
exchange rate qt combines the positive effect of expenditure switching from foreign to home goods
and the negative effect of substitution away from the intermediate inputs towards local labor. In par-
ticular, the expenditure switching effect acts to increase the demand for domestic output yt when the
home exchange rate is depreciated (qt is high), and this effect is shaped by θ(1 − α), the product of the
pass-through elasticity (1 − α) of exchange rate into relative prices and the elasticity of substitution θ.
       Now combining (36)–(37) together with their foreign counterparts, we can solve for the equilibrium
relationship between the relative consumption ct − c∗t and the real exchange rate qt (see Appendix
Figure A2 for a simple geometric solution):
  27
     As in Atkeson and Burstein (2008), the lower volatility of the terms of trade results from the markup adjustment by
exporting firms. We check in our quantitative analysis that this does not imply counterfactually volatile aggregate profits.
  28
     To derive (37), we solve out the real wage and relative prices as a function of the real exchange rate. In particular, in
Appendix A.5 we show that the exchange rate pass-through into relative prices is determined by (1 − α), as pHt − pt =
            γ
−(1 − α) 1−2γ   qt and p∗Ht − p∗t = −(1 − α) 1−2γ
                                              1−γ
                                                  qt .


                                                             23
Proposition 7 (Backus-Smith resolution) In the baseline model with financial shocks ψt only, the
relative home consumption declines with real depreciation, according to the following equilibrium relation:

                                                             1−γ
                                                   2θ(1 − α) 1−2γ + ν + ν+φ  2γ
                                                                        1−φ 1−2γ    2
             ct −   c∗t   = −γκq qt ,   where κq ≡                    1   2γ  1 − 2γ > 0.                               (38)
                                                   (1 − φ) 1 + σν 1 + 1−φ 1−2γ

The effect of the real exchange rate on the relative consumption vanishes as the economy becomes closed
to international trade (γ → 0). For γ > 0, the elasticity of the relative consumption with respect to real
exchange rate increases (in absolute terms) in the strength of the expenditure switching effect, θ(1 − α).

    It follows from Proposition 7 that our baseline model robustly reproduces a negative correlation
between relative consumption and real exchange rate, both in levels and in growth rates. That is, our
model predicts that consumption is low when prices are low, in relative terms across countries. This
violates efficient international risk sharing, predicted by the celebrated Backus-Smith condition, yet
is consistent with the empirical patterns (see estimates across countries in Benigno and Thoenissen
2008). This property of our model stands in stark contrast with both the productivity-shock-driven In-
ternational RBC models and the monetary-shock-driven international New Keynesian (NOEM) models,
even when those models assume incomplete markets. What is most striking is that we have derived (38)
using solely the labor and goods market clearing conditions, which are completely ubiquitous in all in-
ternational general equilibrium models. Indeed, the negative correlation between consumption and real
exchange rate is a robust feature of the expenditure switching mechanism: Depreciated real exchange
rate switches expenditure towards the home goods, and in order to clear the markets home output
needs to rise and home consumption, in view of home bias, needs to fall.29 A natural question then is
what makes our model different?
    There are two key features of our model that allow it to produce the empirical negative correlation
between consumption and the real exchange rate. First, we shift the determination of consumption from
asset to product markets. Indeed, in complete market models, partial equilibrium in the asset market
requires a positive correlation between relative consumption and real exchange rate: σ(ct − c∗t ) = qt ,
which is the outcome of the optimal international risk-sharing. Our model instead features incom-
plete markets and a risk-sharing shock, which implies the following relationship between consumption
growth and real appreciation in expectations:

                                        Et σ(∆ct+1 − ∆c∗t+1 ) − ∆qt+1 = ψt .
                                          
                                                                                                                           (39)

Furthermore, the equilibrium relationship between consumption and exchange rate (38) is fully deter-
mined in product market, without reference to asset market and risk sharing.30
   29
      Note also that an increase in consumption is inconsistent with labor market clearing (36), as then labor supply and output
would decline due to both income effect (increase in consumption) and substitution effect (reduction in real wage).
   30
      Asset markets matter in general equilibrium, as both consumption and exchange rate dynamics need to be consistent
with asset market clearing and equilibrium interest rates (see Section 3.5). Equation (38), however, is a static equilibrium
condition, which holds state-by-state and hence determines the correlation between consumption and real exchange rate
independently of their dynamic processes. This is possible because the financial shock ψt does not directly affect the goods



                                                              24
    Second, our model ensures that the key force shaping the comovement between consumption and
the real exchange rate is expenditure switching, emphasized in equation (38). This is in contrast with
the IRBC and NOEM models, where real depreciation is associated with increased supply of domestic
output (either due to a high productivity shock or due to suppressed markups and prices in response to
a monetary easing), while expenditure switching is only a byproduct. As a result, a real depreciation
in these models is associated with an empirically counterfactual domestic consumption boom. The
mechanism in our financial model is different. A real depreciation is not caused by increased supply
of domestic goods, but instead by increased demand for foreign assets. Therefore, the only effect on
the real economy is indirect, induced by expenditure switching arising from a real depreciation, which
causes a decline in real wages and consumption and an increase in employment, output and net exports
(see expressions in Appendix A.5).
    While a negative correlation between consumption and real exchange rate emphasized in Propo-
sition 7 is a desirable property of the model, we are also interested in its quantitative implications.
A salient feature of the data is the much greater volatility of the exchange rate relative to the other
macroeconomic variables, and in particular consumption. From (38), we know that the relative volatil-
ity of consumption tends to zero as the economy becomes closed to international trade (γ → 0). Outside
this limit, for our baseline parameterization std(∆ct )/std(∆qt ) = 0.15. That is, consumption is about
6 times less volatile than the real exchange rate, in line with the empirical magnitudes (for example,
Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2002) target a ratio of 5). We further find that this quantitative perfor-
mance of the model is not very sensitive to the specific values of the relative risk aversion σ and Frish
elasticity of labor supply ν, but is mostly sensitive to trade openness γ and the combined expenditure
switching elasticity θ(1 − α), as we illustrate in the Appendix Figure A4.31 We conclude that the model
is not only consistent with the qualitative negative correlation between consumption and real exchange
rate, but also reproduces quantitatively the relative volatilities of exchange rate and macro variables.

Alternative mechanisms in the literature Naturally, all explanations of the Backus-Smith puz-
zle must relax the straitjacket of the international risk-sharing condition σ(ct − c∗t ) = qt , either by
assuming incomplete markets (e.g. Corsetti, Dedola, and Leduc 2008, Benigno and Thoenissen 2008),
or by departing from separable CRRA utility (e.g. Colacito and Croce 2013, Karabarbounis 2014). The
analytical tractability of our model, coupled with the conventional product and labor market structure,
allows us to shed light on the mechanisms in other papers in relationship to our mechanism.
    For concreteness, we focus on the model with productivity shocks only, as is the case in much of
market, and thus is absent from (38). While we use market clearing conditions to solve for consumption given a value of the
exchange rate, one can do the reverse and solve for prices and exchange rate given a value for consumption. Relationship (38)
can then be interpreted as the Keynes transfer effect: a financial shock makes home agents postpone consumption, resulting
in lower relative demand for home goods and an exchange rate depreciation (see e.g. Pavlova and Rigobon 2008, Caballero,
Farhi, and Gourinchas 2008).
   31
      When we simultaneously reduce σ from 2 to 1 and ν from 1 to 0.5, consumption still remains about 4 times less volatile
than RER. In contrast, if we double γ from 0.07 to 0.14 or increase θ from 1.5 to 5, consumption becomes only about 2.75
times less volatile than RER, which is sizably more volatile than in the data. If θ ≤ 3, however, the model still maintains that
consumption is 4 times less volatile than RER. See Appendix A.5.2 for a more systematic quantitative robustness analysis.




                                                              25
the Backus-Smith puzzle literature. This case results in the following equilibrium relationship:

                                    ct − c∗t = κa (at − a∗t ) − γκq qt ,                             (40)

where κq > 0 is given in (38) and κa > 0 is derived in the appendix (see (A49)). This is the sense in
which the same expenditure switching effect of the real exchange rate on consumption is still present
in the models with other shocks, but these shocks also have a direct effect in product and labor markets.
Importantly, κa does not go to zero with γ → 0, and therefore, the direct effect always dominates the
expenditure switching effect when economies are relatively closed to international trade. While our
mechanism in (38) emphasizes the expenditure switching as the key source of the relationship between
consumption and real exchange rate, other papers have it only as a feedback mechanism, typically not
strong enough to overturn the direct effects of the product market shocks. This explains why Backus-
Smith puzzle proved such a challenge in the literature, despite the natural expenditure switching forces.
      Equilibrium relationship (40) makes clear the two possible ways in which the Backus-Smith puzzle
can be resolved. First, this occurs when exchange rate dynamics is shaped by a shock with a small
direct effect on consumption relative to its indirect (expenditure switching) effect through exchange
rate. The financial shocks emphasized in this paper, as well as the news shocks about future produc-
tivity (e.g., the long-run risk shocks in Colacito and Croce 2013) and labor-wedge shocks under non-
separable utility (Karabarbounis 2014), all operate in this fashion. The alternative way to resolve the
Backus-Smith puzzle, when the direct effect of the shock dominates and consumption increases with
productivity, is to have real exchange rate appreciate in response to a positive productivity shock (that
is, ∂qt /∂at < 0). This may arise due to Balassa-Samuelson forces (e.g., Benigno and Thoenissen 2008),
persistent productivity growth rates and/or low elasticity of substitution between home and foreign
goods (θ < 1), as in Corsetti, Dedola, and Leduc (2008). These alternative mechanisms are, however, at
odds with other exchange rate puzzles, including Meese-Rogoff and the PPP puzzles discussed above.
See Appendix A.8 for two illustrations and a further discussion.

3.5     Exchange rate and interest rates: the UIP Puzzle
Lastly, we explore the equilibrium properties of the interest rates, and in particular the UIP puzzle.
The home Euler equation (4), characterizing demand for domestic bond, yields upon log-linearization
it = Et {σ∆ct+1 + ∆pt+1 }. Combining it with the foreign counterpart for i∗t , and using the solution
for consumption (38) and prices (30) together within (32), we obtain:

                                        it − i∗t = −γλ1 Et ∆et+1 ,                                   (41)

where λ1 > 0 under a mild parameter restriction discussed in Appendix A.5.1. Combining (41) with the
UIP condition (22) results both in the expression for the expected devaluation (24) used in Section 3.1
and in the following solution for the equilibrium interest rate differential:

                                                         γλ1
                                          it − i∗t =           ψt .                                  (42)
                                                       1 + γλ1

                                                       26
As we already discussed, the demand shock for foreign bond ψt > 0 raises the interest rate differential
it − i∗t to balance out the asset markets. Note that this increase in the home interest rate is consis-
tent with the increase in savings and decline in consumption, discussed in the previous subsection.
Equation (42) further implies that, like ψt , the interest rate differential follows an AR(1) process with
persistence ρ, and in addition with volatility declining towards zero in the closed economy limit (γ → 0).
       Next, making use of our characterization in Proposition 3, we study the joint properties of the
interest rate differential and the nominal exchange rate (similar relationships also hold in real terms):

Proposition 8 (Exchange rate and interest rates) The Fama regression, i.e. the projection of the ex-
change rate change ∆et+1 on the interest rate differential (it − i∗t ), has a negative coefficient
βF = −1/(γλ1 ) < 0. Furthermore, around the βρ → 1 limit:
   (i) the R2 in the Fama regression becomes arbitrary small (goes to zero);
  (ii) the volatility of ∆et+1 relative to (it − i∗t ) becomes arbitrary large (goes to infinity);
 (iii) the persistence of ∆et+1 relative to (it − i∗t ) becomes arbitrary small (goes to zero);
  (iv) the Sharpe ratio of the Carry trade32 becomes arbitrary small (goes to zero).

Proposition 8 suggests that our model provides a good approximation to the the observed empirical
patterns. As in the data, positive interest rate differentials predict expected exchange rate apprecia-
tions — a pattern of the UIP deviations known as the Forward Premium puzzle (Fama 1984). This result
follows directly from (41), as a ψt > 0 shock results both in a positive interest rate differential and an
expected appreciation of the home currency.
       At the same time, the predictive ability of the interest rate differentials for future devaluations is
very weak in the data (see e.g. Valchev 2016), and our model captures this with a vanishingly small R2
in the Fama regression as the ψt shocks become more persistent. Recall from Proposition 4 that in this
case the unexpected changes dominate the dynamics of the exchange rate, while the expected changes
play a vanishingly small role. Under our baseline parameterization, the R2 in the Fama regression
is below 0.05, in line with the data. In addition, the interest rate differentials, unlike exchange rate
changes, are very smooth and persistent in the data — another disconnect pattern captured by our
model. For example, under the baseline parametrization, the model produces interest rate differentials
that are less than one-tenth as volatile as the exchange rate changes (see Appendix Table A1). Lastly,
the UIP shock in our model does not result in counterfactually large returns on the Carry trade. In
Appendix Figure A5, we illustrate the small-sample properties of the carry trade returns, along with
the properties of the Fama regression, and show that the associated Sharpe ratio varies between 0.15
and 0.3, in line with the empirical patters.33
  32
      A carry trade is a zero-capital investment strategy, which shorts the low interest rate currency and longs the high interest
rate currency. For concreteness, following Lustig and Verdelhan (2011), we focus on a strategy with an intensity (size of the
positions taken, xt ) proportional to the expected return, i.e. xt = it − i∗t − Et ∆et+1 = ψt (see Appendix A.5).
   33
      The unconditional Sharpe ratio of the carry trade in the data is about 0.5, but at least half of it comes from the cross-
sectional country fixed effects not modeled in our framework, which instead focuses on the time-series properties. Our
empirical target for the Sharpe ratio of 0.2 corresponds to the “forward premium trade” in Hassan and Mano (2014).




                                                               27
      To summarize the results of Section 3, our baseline model with a simple transmission mechanism
and a single financial exchange rate shock is consistent, both qualitatively and quantitatively, with a
rich set of moments describing the dynamic comovement between exchange rates and macro variables.
Many of these moments correspond to the long-standing puzzles from the point of view of the conven-
tional international-macro models, including the PPP puzzle and the Backus-Smith puzzle. The financial
shock ψt admits a number of micro-foundations, yet is not directly observable in the data. When ψt is
assumed to follow a persistent AR(1) process with small innovations, the model reproduces both the
empirical Meese-Rogoff exchange rate dynamics and the empirical comovement properties between
exchange rates and interest rates, including the Forward Premium (UIP) puzzle.


4      Extensions
This section considers two main extensions to our analysis. Section 4.1 generalizes the baseline model
to a full-fledged monetary model with nominal stickiness and a Taylor rule. In the context of this
extension, we discuss the properties of the model with multiple shocks, as well as the Mussa puzzle
associated with the switch between monetary regimes. Section 4.2 extends the baseline model to feature
an explicit financial sector with risk-averse intermediaries and noise traders to shed light on a number of
issues, including the recent Engel (2016) puzzle. Additional extensions, including a model with capital,
are considered in Appendix A.11.

4.1     A monetary model with nominal rigidities
We now consider the robustness of our findings in Sections 2 and 3 in a fully specified monetary model
with nominal rigidities, arguably a salient feature of the real world. First, we demonstrate that nominal
shocks per se cannot reproduce the empirical exchange rate behavior, as suggested by Proposition 1.
Second, we show that the financial shock ψt has similar quantitative properties in the monetary model,
as in our baseline model of Section 3, despite a different transmission mechanism for the interest rates.
Third, we study a calibrated multi-shock model to quantify the contribution of monetary and produc-
tivity shocks to the exchange rate volatility. Lastly, we discuss the robustness of the results to various
policy rules and the associated Mussa puzzle.
      We introduce nominal rigidities as in the standard New Keynesian model (see e.g. Woodford 2003),
while leaving the structure of international financial markets as in the baseline model. We focus on a
cashless-limit economy and abstract from ZLB, commitment problems and multiplicity of equilibria. In
particular, the nominal interest rate is set by a central bank according to a conventional Taylor rule:

                                   it = ρm it−1 + (1 − ρm ) δπ πt + εm
                                                                     t ,                               (43)

where ρm and δπ are parameters, πt is the CPI inflation rate and εm
                                                                  t is an exogenous monetary shock.
      Firms are subject to a Calvo price-setting friction with the probability of price adjustment equal
to 1 − λp . We maintain the assumption that the desired price depends on both own marginal cost and
competitor prices, as in (12) with the exogenous markup shock shut down. We further assume that
exporters set prices in the local currency (LCP), as for example in Chari, Kehoe, and McGrattan (2002)

                                                    28
and Devereux and Engel (2002). Households set wages and are also subject to the Calvo friction with
the probability of wage adjustment equal to 1 − λw , as described in Galí (2008). Appendix A.9 provides
a full description of the model with the characterization of its solution, as well as several extensions
with PCP price stickiness and alternative Taylor rules.
       To calibrate the model, we keep the same values of the parameters as in the baseline case discussed
in Section 3. The prices are assumed to adjust on average once a year, i.e. λ = 0.75 (Nakamura and
Steinsson 2008). For wages, we set λw = 0.85 corresponding to a longer expected wage duration
equal to 1.5 years. For the inflation response elasticity in the Taylor rule we use the estimates from
Clarida, Galí, and Gertler (2000), namely δπ = 2.15, which satisfies the Taylor principle. Following the
literature, we set the interest rate smoothness parameter ρm = 0.95 to match the empirical persistence
of the interest rate, and we assume that the monetary shocks εm
                                                              t follow an iid process.
       We summarize the results of our analysis in Table 2, where we contrast the moments in the data
and in various versions of the model. Panel A considers various single-shock models. We first report
the moments in two versions of the model with the financial shock ψt alone. Specifically, column 1
reports the moments from a model without nominal rigidities (λp = λw = 0), but subject to the Taylor
rule (43), which is the only departure from our benchmark model of Section 3. Column 1 reconfirms
our findings that the model captures well the quantitative behavior of the exchange rates, both nominal
and real, including their persistence, volatility relative to other macro variables, as well as the direction
of comovement with consumption and interest rates.
       The model in column 2 of Table 2 features additionally wage and price stickiness, as discussed above,
while maintaining ψt as the only shock. We see that the introduction of nominal rigidities has very
little effect on the quantitative properties of the model, even despite the differences in the transmission
mechanism. Indeed, in the baseline model, the interest rate settles down to clear the markets, while
in the monetary model the path of the interest rate is chosen by the monetary authority according to
the Taylor rule (43). In both models, a ψt shock results in a sharp nominal depreciation, which in turn
leads to a mild home inflation as the prices of the foreign goods increase. In a monetary model, the
central bank responds by raising the interest rate, and the households respond by cutting their current
consumption expenditures, thus enabling the model to reproduce both the Backus-Smith puzzle and the
UIP puzzle. Furthermore, the sluggish price adjustment in the model with nominal rigidities increases
the volatility of the real exchange rate and reduces the volatility of consumption and interest rates
relative to the volatility of the nominal exchange rate, improving somewhat the fit of the model.34
       Finally, in column 3 and 4 of Table 2, we shut down the financial shock and instead consider two
conventional international macro models — a NOEM model with nominal rigidities subject to mone-
tary (Taylor rule) shocks εm
                           t and also for comparison an IRBC model without nominal frictions subject
to productivity shocks at .35 These models fail on a number of moments and reproduce the familiar
  34
      On the other hand, as pointed out by Obstfeld and Rogoff (2000), models with LCP imply a counterfactual negative
correlation between the exchange rate and the terms-of-trade. Matching the empirical positive, yet imperfect, correlation
between these variables requires a model with a mixture of price setting patterns (flexible, PCP, LCP), which also allows for
DCP (dollar/dominant currency pricing), as emphasized recently by Casas, Díez, Gopinath, and Gourinchas (2016).
   35
      With our focus on exchange rate moments, we only need to specify the processes for the relative shocks, i.e. at − a∗t in
case of the productivity shock, which we assume follows an AR(1) process with persistence ρa = 0.97.

Note: The table reports moments in the data (see details in the Data Appendix A.12) and in the simulated data for various
specification of the model, as described in the text. ρ(·) denotes autocorrelation, σ(·) denotes standard deviation. The numbers
in brackets report standard deviation across 10,000 simulations with 120 quarters (30 years) each, only for the moments that
vary considerably across simulations. In all specifications, model parameters are as in Table 1, and columns 2, 3 and 5
additionally feature sticky prices (λp = 0.75) and wages (λw = 0.85), while columns 1, 4 and 6–7 have flexible prices
(λp = λw = 0). Monetary policy in columns 1–6 follows the Taylor rule (43) with parameters given in the text, while in
column 7 it fully stabilizes the wage inflation (Wt = Wt∗ = 0), as in the baseline model of Section 3.




                                                                 30
exchange rate puzzles. In particular, both of these models cannot reproduce the direction of the co-
movement between interest rates and exchange rate (the UIP puzzle) and consumption and exchange
rate (the Backus-Smith puzzle). Furthermore, the NOEM model is challenged to reproduce the persis-
tence of the real exchange rate, yielding a half life of less than a year (the PPP puzzle), while for the IRBC
model matching the volatility of the nominal exchange rate requires incredibly large volatility of the
relative TFP shocks across countries, resulting in excessively volatile real exchange rate, consumption
and interest rates.

Multiple shocks and variance decomposition                     A natural deficiency of any one-shock model is that
it can only speak to the relative volatilities of variables, while implying counterfactual perfect corre-
lations between them. We consider now two models with multiple shocks to study whether they can
successfully reproduce the imperfect, and in general weak, empirical correlations between exchange
rates and macro variables. In particular, we extend the NOEM and IRBC models from columns 3 and
4 of Table 2 to feature two additional shocks each — the financial shock ψt and a demand shock for
foreign goods ξt .36 Leaving unchanged all parameter values, we only need to additionally calibrate the
relative variances of the shocks, with the overall level of variance kept to match the volatility of the
nominal exchange rate. We set the relative volatilities of the shock to match the correlations of the real
exchange rate with consumption and net exports.37
       From columns 5 and 6 of Table 2, we see that these extended NOEM and IRBC models are in-
deed capable at perfectly matching the weak negative correlation between the real exchange rate and
consumption and a close-to-zero correlation between the real exchange rate and net exports, with-
out compromising the fit of the other moments relative to the baseline monetary model in column 2.
We conclude that these parsimonious, and rather conventional, models provide a quantitative reso-
lution to a broad class of international macro puzzles assembled under the exchange rate disconnect
umbrella. The key to this success is the presence of the financial shock, as we now show more formally.
       In the context of these two multi-shock models, we carry out variance decompositions in order
to assess the relative importance of productivity, monetary and financial shocks for the exchange rate
dynamics. This decomposition, reported in Table 3, reveals a clear pattern, which echoes our theoretical
predictions in Propositions 1 and 2. First, the financial shock ψt plays the dominant role, explaining
over 70% of the nominal exchange rate variation in both models. Second, the international shock in
the goods market ξt also plays an important role, contributing about 20% to the nominal exchange
rate volatility, and partly balances out the comovement between exchange rate and macro variables
induced by the ψt shock. Third, the contribution of productivity and monetary shocks is minimal,
never exceeding 10% for either nominal or real exchange rate. Indeed, Proposition 1 suggests that
  36
      We have also experimented with a LOP-deviation shock ηt and a nearly-equivalent iceberg trade cost shock, but find them
largely redundant as long as ξt is included, which has superior quantitative properties for the moments we have chosen.
   37
      In the NOEM model, σm /σε = 0.315, where σm = σ(εm              m∗
                                                                t − εt ) for the Taylor rule shock in (43) and σε = σ(εt ) for
the innovation to ψt in (23). In the IRBC model, σa /σε = 2.1, where relative productivity (1 − ρa L)(at − a∗t ) ∼ N (0, σa2 )
with persistence ρa = ρ = 0.97. We do not combine productivity and monetary shocks together in any one specification
because their relative roles cannot be identified from the set of exchange rate moments that we focus on. Instead, both NOEM
and IRBC models include a foreign good demand shock: (1 − ρξ L)(ξt − ξt∗ ) ∼ N (0, σξ ) with ρξ = 0.97 and γσξ /σε set at
2.7 and 2.4 in the two specifications respectively.

Note: The table reports the variance decomposition for nominal and real exchange rate changes into the contributions of
shocks in the two multi-shock models, corresponding to columns 5 and 6 of Table 2. The relative volatilities of the shocks are
calibrated to match corr(∆c − ∆c∗ , ∆q) = −0.2 and corr(∆nx, ∆q) = 0, with other parameters as in Table 1.

both of these shocks, if too important in shaping the exchange rate dynamics, result in conventional
exchange rate puzzles. To be clear, however, these shocks are still central for the dynamics of other
macro variables, such as consumption, employment, output and prices levels. We conclude by noting
that our model of exchange rate disconnect does not fundamentally change the way the exchange rate
and macro variables respond to monetary and productivity shocks, but instead it puts an upper bound
on how important these shocks can be on average in shaping the exchange rate dynamics.

Mussa puzzle Mussa (1986) puzzle refers to the striking discontinuous difference in the behavior of
the real exchange rate when the monetary authority switches between a pegged and a floating nominal
exchange rate regimes. Indeed, in conventional models the real and nominal exchange rates are shaped
by different forces, at least once prices have adjusted, and therefore a change in the monetary regime
should not alter the behavior of the real exchange rate in such a fundamental way. After briefly re-
viewing a larger set of stylized facts, to which we collectively refer as the Mussa puzzle, we turn to our
model of exchange rate disconnect to study whether it reproduces these empirical patterns in response
to a switch in the monetary regime.
    Comparing empirical moments for several developed countries before and after the end of the Bret-
ton Woods system of fixed exchange rates, the literature has emphasized the following stylized facts:
   1. The volatility of the real exchange rate increased almost as much as the volatility of the nominal
       exchange rate (Mussa 1986). More precisely, the volatility of the nominal exchange rate was about
       8 times smaller under the peg, while for the real exchange rate it was about 4 times smaller, and
       the correlation between the two variables was 0.66 under the peg relative to a nearly perfect
       correlation under the float (Monacelli 2004).
   2. At the same time, there was almost no difference in the output or consumption volatilities across
       the two periods (Baxter and Stockman 1989, Flood and Rose 1995).
   3. The Backus-Smith risk-sharing condition and the UIP condition both held better in the data dur-
       ing the Bretton Woods period. Specifically, the data from the peg period exhibits the theoretically-
       predicted positive signs of the respective correlations (Colacito and Croce 2013).38
   38
      Similarly, Devereux and Hnatkovska (2014) document that Backus-Smith condition holds better across regions within
countries, in contrast with its cross-country violations. Another pattern emphasized by Berka, Devereux, and Engel (2012) is
a substantially greater role of the non-tradable (Balassa-Samuelson) component in the RER variation under a nominal peg.

Note: The first four lines report moments under a peg relative to their values under a float, e.g. 0.13 for std(∆et ) means that
nominal exchange rate is about 8 (≈ 0.13−1 ) times less volatile under the peg. In contrast, the last two lines simply report
the moments for the peg regime. The model in both columns corresponds to the multi-shock NOEM model from column 5 of
Table 2, with the Taylor rule changed from (43) to a peg (44); column 2 additionally shuts down the ψt shock under the peg.


We summarize these facts in the Data column of Table 4, which also reports the respective moments
in our simulated model. Our goal here is not to simply match the moments under the peg, but rather
to check whether our quantitative exchange rate disconnect model can simultaneously account for the
broad patterns of the Mussa puzzle. To this end, we adopt the extended multi-shock NOEM model from
column 5 of Table 2, and study two alternative nominal peg scenarios, keeping all other parameters
unchanged.
    By definition, a nominal peg regime requires a change from the Taylor rule (43) to a monetary
policy rule that directly stabilizes the nominal exchange rate. We focus on the following policy rule:

                                      it = ρm it−1 + (1 − ρm ) δe (et − ē) + εm
                                                                               t ,                                         (44)

where ē is the level of the peg and δe is the strength of the peg. We adopt this policy rule in both
scenarios, calibrating δe in each case to exactly match the empirical volatility of the nominal exchange
rate during the peg regimes (the first moment in Table 4).
    Another important difference under the peg is a substantially lower volatility in the UIP deviations
(as, for example, documented in Kollmann 2005), which corresponds to a lower variance of the financial
shock ψt . Jeanne and Rose (2002) suggest a theoretical limits-to-arbitrage mechanism, in which the
variance of ψt endogenously declines when the monetary authority commits to a peg, reducing the
risk associated with carry trades and making arbitrageurs less averse to large currency positions, as
we discuss in Section 4.2.39 To capture this, we consider two extreme scenarios: in the first scenario
in column 1 we keep the variance of all shocks (ψt , ξt , εm
                                                           t ) unchanged, while in the second scenario in
column 2 we fully shut down the dispersion of ψt , leaving the other two shocks unchanged.
    From Table 4, we see that under both scenarios, the model captures a sharp reduction in the volatility
of the real exchange rate under a nominal peg (in fact, overstating it), as well as a sizable reduction in
  39
     Other structural interpretations of the ψt shock may suggest further patters of comovement between ψt and the primitive
shocks of the model.



                                                              33
the correlation between the nominal and the real exchange rates from a nearly perfect correlation
under the float. The model under the first scenario (i.e., no reduction in ψt shocks) fails, however, on
the remaining moments, predicting an increase in the volatility of consumption and no reversal in the
signs of the Backus-Smith correlation and the Fama coefficient. In turn, the second scenario, with the
financial shock shut down, makes the model consistent with these three moments: in this case, the
volatility of consumption changes little across the regime switch and the signs of the Backus-Smith
correlation and the Fama coefficient turn to positive under the peg.
      We conclude that our model of exchange rate disconnect captures, at least qualitatively, the addi-
tional set of empirical patterns associated with a switch to a nominal peg regime, which we collectively
labeled as the Mussa puzzle. This, however, requires that a pegged nominal exchange rate endoge-
nously reduces the volatility of the UIP deviation shocks. We now turn to an explicit model of the
financial sector, which in particular sheds light on this mechanism.

4.2     A model with a financial sector
In this section we study an extension of the baseline model from Section 3 with an explicit financial
sector, which microfounds the upward-sloping supply in the financial market and the financial shock ψt .
The model embeds in general equilibrium the noise trader and limits-to-arbitrage model of De Long,
Shleifer, Summers, and Waldmann (1990) and its adaptation to the exchange rate market by Jeanne and
Rose (2002). This extension achieves the following goals. First, it allows us to analyze a symmetric world
economy, in which each country offers a bond in its own currency, and all international transactions are
intermediated by a financial sector, which is averse to large risky positions. This leads to an upward-
sloping supply of international bonds, and as a result the dispersion of the UIP deviation shock and the
volatility of the nominal exchange rate are determined endogenously in equilibrium. Second, unlike
our baseline, the model with a financial sector is stationary, featuring a unique long-run equilibrium
and long-run mean reversion in the real exchange rate. Nonetheless, we show that the small-sample
quantitative properties of the two models are nearly indistinguishable. Lastly, in the context of this
extension we address an additional set of facts on the comovement between interest rates and exchange
rates, emphasized recently by Engel (2016) and Valchev (2016).
      We start by briefly describing the extended model, relegating the details to Appendix A.10, and then
proceed to study its qualitative and quantitative properties. We consider an international financial
market with three types of agents trading assets. First, there are home and foreign households that
                                                                             ∗ respectively.40 Second,
trade their local-currency bond only, taking net foreign positions Bt+1 and Bt+1
                                                                  ∗ in foreign-currency bond and short
there are n noise traders that take a zero-capital position long Nt+1
         ∗ E in home-currency bond, and vice versa when N ∗
Nt+1 = −Nt+1 t                                           t+1 < 0. We assume
                                                               
                                                 ∗
                                                Nt+1 = n eψt − 1 ,                                                    (45)
  40
     For convenience, we now have Bt+1 denote the value of home-currency bonds purchased at t and paying out Rt Bt+1
                                                ∗
units of home currency at t + 1. Furthermore, Bt+1  now refers to the position of the foreign households (as home household
no longer hold foreign-currency bonds), and it pays Rt∗ Bt+1
                                                         ∗
                                                             units of foreign currency at t + 1.




                                                            34
where ψt is the noise-trader demand shock for foreign currency, which follows an exogenous AR(1)
process (23) with zero mean.41
        Third, intermediation in the financial market is done by a measure m of competitive arbitrageurs
                                                ∗ in foreign-currency bond and short D         ∗
that collectively take a zero-capital position Dt+1                                    t+1 = −Dt+1 Et
                                         ∗
home-currency bonds, again allowing for Dt+1                                            ∗
                                             < 0. We denote the return on a one-dollar Dt+1 po-
            ∗               Et
sition by R̃t+1 ≡ Rt∗ − Rt Et+1 . Each arbitrageur chooses his individual position d∗t+1 to maximize a
mean-variance utility of returns, Et R̃t+1 · d∗t+1 − ω2 vart (R̃t+1 ) · d∗2
                                                                         t+1 , where ω is the risk aversion pa-
rameter. The resulting demand for foreign currency bonds by the financial intermediary sector is then:

                                                    ∗                Et R̃t+1
                                                   Dt+1 =m                        .                                                (46)
                                                                  ω vart (R̃t+1 )

        The financial market clears when the interest rates Rt and Rt∗ are such that Bt+1 +Nt+1 +Dt+1 = 0
     ∗ + N ∗ + D∗
and Bt+1  t+1   t+1 = 0, which in particular implies that in equilibrium net foreign asset position
                                                            ∗ E . Lastly, we assume for concreteness
of home equals net foreign liabilities of foreign, Bt+1 = −Bt+1 t
that the profits and losses of the arbitrageurs and noise traders are transferred to the foreign households,
and thus their budget constraint becomes:

                                        ∗      ∗
                                       Bt+1 − Rt−1 Bt∗ = N Xt∗ + R̃t∗ (Dt∗ + Nt∗ ),

while the budget constraint of the home is Bt+1 − Rt−1 Bt = N Xt , where N Xt = −N Xt∗ Et . The
rest of the model is unchanged. We again solve the model by log-linearization around a non-stochastic
equilibrium with B = B ∗ = N ∗ = D∗ = R̃∗ = 0 and E = 1. In light of this approximate solution
approach, the strong assumptions made above — namely, the quadratic utility over dollar returns and
the transfer of profits to foreign households — are without loss of generality.42
        The only equation in the linearized equilibrium system that changes in this extension with a finan-
cial sector is the UIP condition (22), which now becomes (see Appendix A.10):

                                                                                 n/β                              Ȳ
    it − i∗t − Et ∆et+1 = χ1 ψt − χ2 bt+1                  with         χ1 ≡                    and χ2 ≡                  ,        (47)
                                                                                m/(ωσe2 )                       m/(ωσe2 )

where σe2 ≡ vart (∆et+1 ) is the variance of the innovation to the nominal exchange rate, which is
determined endogenously in equilibrium, yet taken as given by the competitive financial sector. The
generalized UIP condition (47) derives from the international bond market clearing condition combined
with (45) and (46). It characterizes the excess return on the home bond, which ensures that the arbi-
trageurs are willing to satisfy the relative demand for foreign bonds by both noise traders (ψt ) and
households (bt+1 ). The net foreign asset position of the home households, bt+1 ≡ RBt+1 /Ȳ , reflects
the demand for home-currency bond as a savings vehicle, and hence increases the price of the home
bond, or equivalently reduces its relative interest rate.
   41
      For example, a noise-trader shock can arise from a commodity company that decides to start hedging its currency expo-
sure in the financial market.
   42
      Note, in particular, that the profits and losses of the noise traders and arbitrageurs, R̃t∗ (Dt∗ + Nt∗ ), is a second order term.



                                                                  35
       The crucial difference of the new UIP condition (47) from (22) is that now it features two sources
of UIP deviations — an exogenous shock ψt as before and an endogenous feedback via the state vari-
able bt+1 . The elasticities χ1 and χ2 of respectively exogenous and endogenous sources of UIP devia-
tions decrease in the absorption (risk-bearing) capacity of the financial sector m/(ωσe2 ), which in turn
depends on the size of this sector m, its risk aversion ω and the endogenous volatility of the nomi-
nal exchange rate σe2 (cf. Gabaix and Maggiori 2015). As the financial sector becomes larger or less
                          Ȳ    n
risk averse, with        m/ω , m/ω   → 0, the model features an undistorted UIP condition in the limit (with
                                           n
χ1 = χ2 = 0). If, instead, χ1 ∝           m/ω   remains positive in the limit, the model admits the baseline UIP
condition (22) as a special case.
       The other equilibrium relationships of the extended model, apart from the UIP condition (47),
remain unchanged. This includes the proportional relationship between the nominal and the real
exchange rates (32), as well as the relationships between exchange rates and respectively terms of
trade (35), consumption (38) and interest rates (41). As a result, Propositions 5–7 still hold in the model
with a financial sector. The equilibrium dynamics of the exchange rate (Proposition 3) differs, however,
as we now characterize:

Proposition 9 (Exchange rate process redux) In the model with a financial sector and a noise-trader
shock ψt ∼ AR(1) with persistence ρ and innovation εt , the equilibrium nominal exchange rate et follows
an ARMA(2,1) process with AR roots ρ and ζ1 < 1 (with ζ1 → 1 iff χ2 → 0) and an MA root 1/β:

                                                             1     βζ1 χ1
                                                                            1 − β −1 L εt .
                                                                                      
                             (1 − ρL)(1 − ζ1 L)et =                                                                     (48)
                                                          1 + γλ1 1 − βζ1 ρ
                   nσε
Provided that      m/ω   is large enough, there exists a solution with χ1 > 0 and σe2 = vart (∆et+1 ) > 0, such
                          nσε
that σe2 increases in     m/ω .   There always exists another solution with σe2 = χ1 = 0.

A formal proof of this proposition is contained in Appendix A.10, which also defines the cutoff value
       nσε
for    m/ω   and shows that it tends to zero as βρ → 1. In the absence of other shocks, there always exists
a zero-variance equilibrium, in which the arbitrageurs coordinate to fully offset the noise-trader shock,
as this involves no risk as a matter of a self-fulfilling prophecy. However, for a large enough noise-
trader shock nσε , there also exists a positive-variance equilibrium, in which noise-trader shocks result
in a volatile exchange rate. Furthermore, any fundamental shock to current account (e.g., productivity
shock) shifts the economy to a positive-variance equilibrium. The government, however, has the ability
to commit to peg the exchange rate, providing a coordination device for the financial sector to fully
absorb the noise-trader shocks. This justifies why in Section 4.1 we considered the case in which a
monetary peg was associated with a reduction in the variance of the UIP deviation shock.
       The equilibrium exchange rate process (48) is stationary, unlike (28) in the baseline model. However,
the two become indistinguishable as χ2 → 0 and consequently ζ1 → 1. We discuss below that quan-
titatively, under our calibration with χ2 > 0, the two processes are nearly identical in finite samples,
even though one is stationary and one is integrated in the long run. The model with a financial sector
is stationary around a unique steady state with B = B ∗ = R̃∗ = 0.43 The stationarity of the model
  43
       We show in the appendix that the NFA position bt+1 follows a stationary AR(2) process with the same roots ρ and ζ1 .


                                                              36
emerges from the fact that the financial intermediaries are averse to holding positions that expose them
to exchange rate risk and require a premium. As a result, a country-borrower faces a higher interest rate
relative to 1/β, which provides an incentive to gradually close its NFA position. This mechanism offers
a microfoundation for the state-dependent borrowing rate often adopted to close small open economy
models (see Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe 2003).

Quantitative properties We now turn to a multi-shock version of the model with a financial sector
to study its quantitative properties. As in the earlier IRBC model (in column 6 of Table 2), we add a
productivity shock at and a foreign-good-demand shock ξt , however, for simplicity instead of a Taylor
rule we maintain the assumption that monetary policy stabilizes the nominal value of the wage rate,
as in the baseline model. We keep all parameters unchanged as in Table 1, and only need to calibrate
the new parameter χ2 and the relative volatilities of the three shocks. As before, we choose the relative
volatilities to match the consumption and net export correlation with the real exchange rate.44 We set
χ2 = 0.01 to match the impulse response of the UIP deviations in Figure 3a, as we discuss below.
    We report the model-generated moments resulting from this calibration in the last column of
Table 2. This column shows that the model with a financial sector is as successful at matching the
empirical moments as the other multi-shock models (NOEM and IRBC) discussed above, yet as we
discuss next it matches an additional set of moments. In particular, the model still reproduces a near-
random-walk exchange rate process, with nominal and real exchange rates nearly perfectly correlated,
while consumption remains about six times less volatile than the real exchange rate and weakly neg-
atively correlated with it.45 The similarity of the fit is, perhaps, not surprising, as the only difference
of the model with a financial sector sector is the presence of the endogenous feedback −χ2 bt+1 in the
UIP condition (47). Despite the implied qualitative difference resulting in stationarity of the exchange
rate, the finite sample properties of the model are almost unchanged. One difference that emerges in
the model with a financial sector is that non-financial shocks such as at and ξt now result in endoge-
nous UIP violations through their effect on the state variable bt+1 , and hence contribute more to the
exchange rate volatility. In particular, our calibration of the model with a financial sector attributes a
larger role to the good-market shock ξt in comparison with the multi-shock IRBC model.

Engel puzzle        We now turn to the Engel (2016) puzzle, which concerns the shape of the exchange rate
response to the movements in the interest rate differential. The Fama (1984) regression suggests that a
positive interest rate differential predicts an exchange rate appreciation, that is cov(it −i∗t , ∆et+1 ) < 0.
Engel (2016) argues that most models of the forward premium achieve this with an exchange rate
process that depreciates on impact at t and then gradually appreciates starting at t + 1. This is indeed
the case in our model with a single financial shock ψt following an AR(1) process, as we depict with
a solid blue line in Figure 2. Engel (2016), however, shows that in the data the exchange rate response
appears to be different, with an appreciation on impact at t followed by further appreciation over some
  44
     The exogenous shock to the UIP is now χ1 ψt with the coefficient χ1 not separately identified from the volatility of ψt .
Thus, to match the correlation moments, we now set σa /(χ1 σε ) = 4 and γσξ /(χ1 σε ) = 2.6 (cf. footnote 37).
  45
     The only noticeable difference in the fit of this model from the multi-shock IRBC model is the lower volatility of the real
exchange rate, which is due to the difference in the monetary policy rule.

Note: The figure plots two alternative shapes of the exchange rate impulse response to an innovation in the interest rate
differential. The construction of the impulse response is explained in Appendix A.10. The blue solid line is from the single-

period and an eventual reversal into depreciation (see also Valchev 2016).46 We illustrate this alternative
impulse response with a dashed red line in Figure 2.
       We show here that the calibrated multi-shock version of the model with a financial sector matches
the empirical impulse responses of the risk premium in Engel (2016) and of the exchange rate in Valchev
(2016). The results are reported in Figure 3, in which solid blue lines correspond to the empirical
impulse responses and the dashed red lines plot the corresponding responses calculated using simulated
data from the model. The calibration of the model is the same that yields moments for column 7 of
Table 2. In our choice of χ2 = 0.01, which parameterizes the endogenous feedback elasticity in the UIP
condition (47), we targeted the duration till risk premium becomes negative in the impulse response in
Figure 3a. Recall that all other parameters were kept unchanged from our calibration of the baseline
model in Section 3.
       Our calibrated model captures well that an increase in the interest rate differential today predicts
an increase in the risk premium Et ρt+j on impact, where ρt+j ≡ it+j−1 − i∗t+j−1 − ∆et+j , which then
gradually decreases and turns negative 20 months out (Figure 3a). Similarly, it captures an exchange
rate appreciation on impact, followed by further appreciation over the next 20 months, which then
reverts into an expected depreciation (Figure 3b).47 Indeed, these impulse responses capture the subtle
departures of the exchange rate process from a random walk, which are present both in the data, as
well as in our model.
  46
      The main empirical results in Engel (2016) are reported in terms of the impulse response of the UIP deviations, as we
reproduce in Figure 3a, yet his paper also shows that cov(it − i∗t , et ) < 0 and cov(∆it − ∆i∗t , ∆et ) < 0, consistent with
the shape of the dashed red impulse response in Figure 2, but not with the solid blue one. We report these correlations in the
data and for different version of the model in Appendix Table A2.
   47
      Here the model is somewhat off on the timing of the reversal, yet the uncertainty bounds around the exact shapes of
these impulse responses are wide enough that the two are not statistically different.

is the one-period return on future carry trades, and the expectation Et ρt+j is constructed using a VEC model, as in Engel
(2016). Panel (b) plots the projection of et+j − et on it − i∗t for j ≥ 0. The blue lines in the figures correspond to the empirical
estimates in: (a) Figure 2 in Engel (2016) and (b) Figure 2 in Valchev (2016), both reconstructed using data provided by Engel
(2016). The dashed red lines plot corresponding estimates in the data simulated from the calibrated multi-shock model with
a financial sector. The details of estimation are provided in Appendix A.10.


         The mechanism by which our model reproduces these empirical patterns relies crucially on the
endogenous state variable bt+1 in the UIP condition (47) in the presence of multiple shocks. In particular,
the short run dynamics of the UIP deviations is dominated by the noise-trader shock ψt . The other
shocks do not have a direct impact on the UIP deviations, but shape them indirectly through their
effect on the net foreign assets, which build up gradually over time, resulting in a non-monotonic
impulse response in Figure 2. Non-monotonicity is not guaranteed in general, but does emerge from the
combinations of ψt and ξt shocks, as they move risk premium in opposite directions for a given direction
of the interest rate change. We, thus, find that the same mix of shocks that results in the broad exchange
rate disconnect properties summarized in Table 2 also reproduces the dynamic comovement between
interest rate differentials and exchange rate changes documented by Engel (2016) and Valchev (2016).


5         Conclusion
We propose a parsimonious general equilibrium model of exchange rate determination, which is si-
multaneously consistent with a wide array of exchange-rate-related moments, offering a unifying
resolution to the main exchange rate puzzles in international macroeconomics, to which we collec-
tively refer as the exchange rate disconnect. The model is analytically tractable, allowing for a complete
closed-form characterization, essential for a transparent exploration of the underlying mechanisms.
Beyond reproducing the qualitative patterns in the data, the model also matches quantitatively a rich
set of moments describing the comovement between exchange rates and macro variables.


                                                                 39
    With this general equilibrium model, one can reconsider the conclusions of the vast international
macro literature plagued by the exchange rate puzzles. In particular, the model reproduces exchange
rate disconnect without altering the international transmission mechanism for monetary and produc-
tivity shocks, including international spillovers from monetary policy (see e.g. Corsetti, Dedola, and
Leduc 2010). This is the case because, conditional on a shock, the model relies on a transmission mech-
anism with conventional ingredients.
    In contrast, the model likely invalidates the conventional normative analysis in open economies,
and in particular the studies of the optimal exchange rate regimes. The model emphasizes the role of
the shocks in the financial markets, as opposed to monetary and goods market shocks, in accounting for
the bulk of the unconditional exchange rate variation. Therefore, a normative analysis must allow for fi-
nancial shocks, which introduce new tradeoffs for alternative policy options. For example, an exchange
rate peg may simultaneously reduce monetary policy flexibility, yet improve international risk-sharing
by offsetting the noise-trader risk (cf. Devereux and Engel 2003). Furthermore, a microfoundation for
the financial shock is essential, as it may endogenously interact with the policy.
    In addition, our framework can be used as a theoretical foundation for the vast empirical litera-
ture, which relies on exchange rate variation for identification (see e.g. Burstein and Gopinath 2012).
Similarly, it can serve as a point of departure for the equilibrium analysis of the international price sys-
tem (Gopinath 2016) and the global financial cycle (Rey 2013). Our model also offers a simple general
equilibrium framework for nesting the financial sector in an open economy environment. In particu-
lar, it summarizes the macroeconomic relationships in a few simple log-linear equations, which can be
combined with richer models of the financial sector (as e.g. Evans and Lyons 2002). We see this as a
particularly promising next step in exploring further the nature of the financial shocks and disciplining
them with additional moments on the comovement between exchange rates and financial variables.

Notes: The baseline model corresponds to the model of Section 3 with parameters as in Table 1. The table reports robustness
analysis with respect to deviations of various parameters from their baseline values. The moments are robust to changes
in ν, φ, µ and β (not reported for brevity). The robustness panel of the table shows only the moments that are sensitive
to the change in the parameter values. Data moments and notation as in Table 2, and HL(·) corresponds to the half-life
estimate. The dynamic moments are calculated as the median of the in-sample estimates across 10,000 simulations with 30
years (120 quarters) each and the standard deviation across simulations are reported in brackets. The asymptotic values of
the estimates are similar to the medians except for ρ(q) → 1, HL(q) → ∞ and βF → −4.6. The five sections in the table
correspond to the five puzzles defined in Section 1 and addressed in Section 3.1–3.5 respectively. See Appendix A.5.2 for
further discussion.

consumption and relative output respectively) and shocks εt ∈ Ωt = {wt , at , gt , κt , µt , χt , ηt , ξt , ψt } across models with
different home bias parameter γ ∈ [0, 0.15] and the other parameters as in Table 2. For three shocks (ηt , ξt , ψt ), the impulse
responses for all three xt are negligible relative to et in the autarky limit (γ → 0), and tend to monotonically depart away
from zero with γ > 0. For the other five shocks (wt , at , gt , κt , µt ), the impulse response for at least one zt is of the same
order of magnitude as that for et , even near γ = 0. The χt shock is equivalent to ψt shock in terms of its effect on prices and
quantities, but they differ in their effect on interest rates (not shown). See discussion in Section 2.2 and Propositions 1–2.

Note: Illustration for Section 3.4. A RER depreciation (qt ↑) has two effects corresponding to equations (36) and (37) in the
text. The latter is the expenditure switching towards domestic goods, which increases ỹt given c̃t . The former is the reduction
in the home real wage, which reduces the supply of labor and home goods ỹt given c̃t . The joint equilibrium in the goods
and labor market, hence, requires a reduction in c̃t , with in general ambiguous effect on output ỹt .

A.2    Demand structure
Consider the general separable homothetic (Kimball 1995) demand aggregator Ct defined implicitly by:
                                                               
                                      CHt                  CF t
                             ΩHt g            + ΩF t g              = 1,                       (A1)
                                     ΩHt Ct              Ω F t Ct

where g 0 > 0, g 00 < 0 and g(1) = g 0 (1) = 1 (a normalization), and

                              ΩHt ≡ (1 − γ)e−γξt                     and        ΩF t ≡ γe(1−γ)ξt

are the weights which satisfy the required properties. Then expenditure minimization results in the
following demand schedules:
                                                                                                               
                                 −γξt           PHt                                      (1−γ)ξt           PF t
              CHt = (1 − γ)e            h                 Ct         and       CF t = γe           h                  Ct ,   (A2)
                                                Dt                                                         Dt

where h(x) ≡ g 0−1 (x), which implies h0 < 0 and h(1) = 1, and where Dt is the Lagrange multiplier
on the aggregator (A1). We can solve for Dt by substituting demand (A2) into the aggregator (A1):
                                                                  
                            −γξt        PHt           (1−γ)ξt      PF t
                   (1 − γ)e      g h             + γe         g h           = 1,                (A3)
                                         Dt                         Dt

and also define the price index in this economy from the expenditure per unit of Ct :
                                                                                          
                PHt CHt + PF t CF t             −γξt         PHt       (1−γ)ξt          PF t
          Pt =                       = (1 − γ)e      PHt h         + γe        PF t h          .                             (A4)
                        Ct                                   Dt                         Dt

Proof of Lemma 1        It is immediate to check from (A3)–(A4), using g(1) = h(1) = 1, that when ξt = 0
and PHt = PF t , we have Pt = Dt = PHt = PF t , which corresponds to the symmetric steady state.
Using demand (A2), we immediately have that the symmetric steady state foreign share is:

                             PF t CF t                                               γCt
                                                                           =                   = γ,
                        PHt CHt + PF t CF t           ξt =0, PHt =PF t         (1 − γ)Ct + γCt

where we again use h(1) = 1. We next use (A3)–(A4) to obtain the log-linear approximation for Pt
and Dt around the symmetric steady state:48

                                            pt = dt = (1 − γ)pHt + γpF t ,                                                   (A5)

where pt and dt are the log deviations from the steady state values. Note that the taste shock ξt 6= 0
does not affect the first order approximation to the prices index (due to the way it enters the weights
ΩHt and ΩF t ). Finally, log-linearizing (A2), we have:

            cHt = −γξt − θ(pHt − dt ) + ct                     and         cF t = (1 − γ)ξt − θ(pF t − dt ) + ct ,
                                                        θ−1
  48                                              1
                                                                 
     In the CES case, which obtains with g(z) = θ−1   θz θ − 1 , we have Pt = Dt , while for a more general demand
Pt and Dt different by a second order term around a symmetric steady state. Since our analysis relies on the first order
approximation to the equilibrium system, we replace Dt with Pt in the demand equations (5) in the text.



                                                                 44
                 0
where θ ≡ − hh(x)
              (x)x
                     x=1
                           = − ∂ log∂xh(x)   x=1
                                                   . Together with (A5), these expressions results in (7). Sub-
tracting, we have cF t − cHt = ξt − θ(pF t − pHt ), which implies that the elasticity of substitution is
indeed θ.    

Monopolistic competition and price setting              Consider now a unit continuum of symmetric domestic
firms with marginal cost M Ct and a unit continuum of symmetric foreign firms with marginal cost
Et M Ct∗ monopolistically competing in the domestic market. We generalize the consumption aggrega-
tor Ct to be defined in the following way:
                        Z 1                       Z 1                  
                                     CHt (i)                     CF t (i)
                            ΩHt g              di +     ΩF t g              di = 1,                                     (A6)

with taste shocks (ΩHt , ΩF t ) determined as above by a common home bias parameter γ and a common
demand shifter ξt for all varieties i ∈ [0, 1]. The households choose {CHt (i), CF t (i)} to maximize Ct
given prices and total expenditure:
                                        Z    1                        Z   1
                       Et = Pt Ct =              PHt (i)CHt (i)di +           PF t (i)CF t (i)di.                       (A7)
                                         0                            0

This expenditure minimization results in individual firm demand as in (A2). A representative home firm
takes (Ct , Pt , Dt ) as given and sets its price to maximize profits from serving the domestic market:
                                                                                     
                                                                     −γξt     PHt (i)
                  PHt (i) = arg max (PHt (i) − M Ct )(1 − γ)e             h            Ct ,
                                 PHt (i)                                       Dt

which results in the standard markup pricing rule, with the markup Mt determined by the elasticity
of the demand curve h(·). Since all domestic firms are symmetric, we have CHt = CHt (i) and PHt =
PHt (i) for all i ∈ [0, 1]. Similar price setting rule is used by symmetric foreign firms with marginal
costs Et M Ct∗ , and we also have CF t = CF t (i) and PF t = PF t (i) for all i ∈ [0, 1]. Following the proof
of Lemma 1, the elasticity of demand in a symmetric steady state equals θ, and therefore the steady
state markup is given by M = θ/(θ − 1) for both home and foreign firms.
    We next take a log-linear approximation to the optimal price PHt around the symmetric steady state:

                                        pHt = −Γ(pHt − pt ) + mct ,

where we use the approximation dt = pt and Γ denotes the elasticity of the markup Mt with respect
to the relative price of the firm, evaluated at the symmetric steady state. Note that this equation is the
                                                  Γ
counterpart to (12) in the text with α ≡         1+Γ   and µt = 0.
    Lastly, we provide further details about the primitive determinants of θ and α (see Amiti, Itskhoki,
and Konings 2016, for a more indepth exposition). Define the demand elasticity function θ̃(x) ≡
− ∂ ∂loglogh(x)
            x , so that θ ≡ θ̃(1). Then the markup function is given by M̃(x) ≡
                                                                                                      θ̃(x)
                                                                                                    θ̃(x)−1
                                                                                                            ,   and the elas-
                                                 M̃(x)
ticity of the markup is given by Γ̃(x) ≡ − ∂ log∂x     , with M = M̃(1) and Γ = Γ̃(1). Manipulating

these definitions, we can represent

                                              ˜(x)                                  ∂ log θ̃(x)
                                Γ̃(x) =              ,       where         ε̃(x) ≡

is the elasticity of elasticity (or super-elasticity) of demand. Therefore, Γ =                 θ−1 ,   where  = ˜(1), and
we further have:
                                            Γ         
                                               = α=       .
                                          1+Γ     +θ−1
To the extent  and θ are controlled by independent parameters, we can decouple the elasticity of
substitution θ from the strategic complementarity elasticity α. Indeed, θ is a characteristic of the slope
(the first derivative) of demand h0 , while  is a characteristic of the curvature (the second derivative) of
demand h00 . Formally, we have:

    h0 (x)x                                                  h0 (x)x h00 (x)x                                   h00 (x)x
                                                                             
                                            ∂ log θ̃(x)
θ=−                           and        =             = 1−        + 0                              = 1+θ+                      .
     h(x)           x=1                      ∂ log x          h(x)    h (x)                    x=1               h0 (x)    x=1

We assume that the demand schedule h(·) is log-concave, that is  ≥ 0, and therefore α ∈ [0, 1), since
θ > 1 is the second order requirement for price setting optimality. An appropriate choice of  produces
any required value of α for any given value of θ. A suitable parametric example can be found in Klenow
and Willis (2006) and Gopinath and Itskhoki (2010), where h(x) = [1 −  log(x)]θ/ for some elasticity
parameter θ > 1 and super-elasticity parameter  > 0.

A.3       Equilibrium system
We summarize here the equilibrium system of the general model from Section 2.1 by breaking it into
blocks:
   1. Labor supply (3) and its exact foreign counterpart.
   2. Labor demand in (10), used together with the definition of the marginal cost (9), and its exact
          foreign counterpart.49
   3. Demand for home and foreign goods:

                                       Yt = YHt + YHt             and       Yt∗ = YF t + YF∗t ,                            (A8)

          where the sources of demand for home good are given in (17) and (18), and the counterpart
          sources of demand for foreign good are given by:

A.3.1     Symmetric steady state

In a symmetric steady state, B ∗ = B ∗F = 0, and the shocks (defined in Table 1) take the following
values:
                                       ψ = ξ = ξ ∗ = η = η ∗ = χ = χ∗ = 0,

and we normalize W = W ∗ = 1 (corresponding to w = w∗ = 0). We let the remaining shocks take
arbitrary (zero or non-zero) symmetric values:

                            a = a∗ ,        g = g∗,            κ = κ∗        and       µ = µ∗ .

    We start with the equations for prices. In a symmetric steady state, exchange rates and terms of
trade are equal to 1:
                                                      E = Q = S = 1,                                                 (A15)

and therefore we can evaluate the prices using the equilibrium conditions described above:
                                                                                                1
                                                                         "         µ       #
                                                                         e 1−α −a              1−φ

                         P = P ∗ = PH = PF∗ = PH∗              = PF =                                ,               (A16)
                                                                      (1 − φ)1−φ φφ
   50
      Log-linear expression for pt in (6) can be replaced with two non-linear expressions (A3)–(A4) defining (Pt , Dt ), and
Pt should be replaced with Dt in demand equations (17)–(18) and (A9)–(A10). The rest of the equilibrium system stays
unchanged. However, these adjustments do not have first order consequences, as Pt and Dt are the same up to second order
terms, and therefore the log-linearized system in Appendix A.3.2 is unchanged.

   Next we use these expressions together with production function, labor demand and labor supply
to obtain two relationships for (C, Y, L):

                                                       P
                                                                                                                                            −µ
Substituting prices (and using h(1) = 1) and intermediate good demand X = φ MPC Y = e 1−α φY into
the goods market clearing, we obtain an additional relationship between C and Y :
                                                         µ

We further have Y = Y ∗ , and YH = YF∗ = (1 − γ)Y and YH∗ = YF = γY .
   The asset demand conditions imply that R = R∗ = 1/β.
   Lastly, we define the following useful ratios:

A.3.2   Log-linearized system

We log-linearize the equilibrium system (summarized above in Appendix A.3) around the symmetric
steady state (described in Appendix A.3.1). We split the equilibrium system into three blocks — prices,
quantities and dynamic equations — and solve them sequentially, as the equilibrium system is block-
recursive.

Exchange rates and prices                  The price block contains the definitions of the price index (6) and its foreign
counterpart:
                                                       p∗t = γp∗Ht + (1 − γ)p∗F t ,                                                              (A23)

as well as the price setting equations (12)–(13) and (A11)–(A12), in which we substitute the marginal
cost (9) and its foreign counterpart and log-linearize to obtain:

               pHt = µt − (1 − α)at + (1 − α)(1 − φ)(wt − pt ) + pt ,                                                                            (A24)
               p∗Ht = µt + ηt − (1 − α)at + (1 − α)[(1 − φ)(wt − pt ) + pt − et ] + αp∗t ,                                                       (A25)
               p∗F t   =   µ∗t   − (1 −       α)a∗t   + (1 − α)(1 −         φ)(wt∗      −   p∗t )   +    p∗t ,                                   (A26)
               pF t =      µ∗t   +   ηt∗   − (1 −     α)a∗t   + (1 − α)[(1 −           φ)(wt∗       −    p∗t )   +   p∗t   + et ] + αpt .        (A27)



                                                                         48
In addition, we use the logs of the definitions of the real exchange rate and terms of trade (14) and (20):

                                                    qt = p∗t + et − pt ,                                      (A28)
                                                    s t = pF t −      p∗Ht   − et .                           (A29)

       First, it is useful to define the log LOP deviations (as in equation (14) and in its foreign counterpart):

                                          qHt ≡ p∗Ht + et − pHt = ηt + αqt ,                                  (A30)
                                           qF t ≡ p∗F t + et − pF t = −ηt∗ + αqt ,                            (A31)

where the expression on the right-hand side are obtained by using (A24)–(A27) together with (A28).
Then, we combine (A28)–(A29) together with these expressions, to obtain:

                                                   st = qtP − 2η̃t − 2αqt ,                                   (A32)
                                                   qt = (1 −     γ)qtP   − γst ,                              (A33)

where qtP = p∗F t +et −pHt is the producer-price-based real exchange rate and we use the tilde notation
x̃t ≡ (xt − x∗t )/2 for any pair of variables (xt , x∗t ). Lastly, we solve for qtP and st as function of qt :
                                               1 − 2αγ         2γ
                                         qtP =          qt −        η̃t ,                                     (A34)

       Next, we use these solutions together with the expressions for price indexes (6) and (A23), to solve
for:51

        pHt − pt = −        (pF t − pt ) = γ(pHt − pF t ) = −            qt +                       ,         (A36)

                        γ                                     (1 − α)γ      γ 2 ηt∗ − γ(1 − γ)ηt
       p∗F t − p∗t = −     (p∗Ht − p∗t ) = γ(p∗F t − p∗Ht ) =          qt +                      .            (A37)

Combining these expression with (A24) and (A26), we can solve for the price levels:

       Note from (6) that pHt − pt = γ(pHt − pF t ), and we use the following steps to solve for:

                 pHt − pF t = −(pF t − p∗Ht − et ) − (p∗Ht + et − pHt ) = −(st + qHt ) = −(st + αqt + ηt ),

in which we then substitute (A35) to solve out st . Similarly, we solve for p∗F t − p∗t .




                                                                 49

Real exchange rate and quantities              The supply side is the combination of labor supply (3) and labor
demand (10) (together with marginal cost (9)), which we log-linearize as:

                                      κt + σct + ν1 `t = wt − pt ,                                        (A41)

Combining the two to solve out `t , and using (A38) to solve out (wt − pt ), we obtain:52

Adding and subtracting the two we obtain:

       An immediate implication of (A44) and (A47) is that (ȳt , c̄t ) depends only on (āt , ḡt , κ̄t , µ̄t , ν̄t ) and
does not depend on the real exchange rate qt . In particular, if āt = ḡt = κ̄t = µ̄t = ν̄t = 0, then
ȳt = c̄t = 0. This is the case we focus on throughout the paper, since as we see below the variation in
(āt , ḡt , κ̄t , µ̄t , ν̄t ) does not affect qt . Combining (A45) and (A48) we can solve for ỹt and c̃t . For example,
the expression for c̃t is:

The log-linear approximation to the flow budget constraint (19) is given then by:

state exchange rate of E = 1). Note that the dynamics of Et and Rt∗ has only second order effects on

       The foreign counterpart is obtained from combining together and rearranging:

the returns on NFA (and hence drops out from the linearized system), as we approximate around a
symmetric steady state with zero NFA position. Equations (A51) is part of the dynamic block.

Exchange rate and interest rates          It only remains now to log-linearize the asset demand conditions (4)
and (15), which pins down the equilibrium interest rates, as well as provides an international risk shar-
ing condition:

                              it = Et {σ∆ct+1 + ∆pt+1 − ∆χt+1 } ,
                             i∗t = Et {σ∆ct+1 + ∆pt+1 − ∆et+1 − ∆χt+1 } − ψt ,
                             i∗t = Et σ∆c∗t+1 + ∆p∗t+1 − ∆χ∗t+1 ,
                                      


where it ≡ log Rt − log R and i∗t ≡ log Rt∗ − log R∗ . We combine the first two to obtain a no-arbitrage
(UIP) condition, the last two to obtain a risk-sharing (Backus-Smith) condition, and the first with the
third to solve for the interest rate differential:

                                                    it − i∗t = Et ∆et+1 + ψt ,                                        (A52)
                   Et σ(∆ct+1 − ∆c∗t+1 ) − ∆qt+1 = ψt + Et {2∆χ̃t+1 } ,
                     
                                                                                                                      (A53)
                                          ĩt ≡ 12 (it − i∗t ) = Et {σ∆c̃t+1 + ∆p̃t+1 − ∆χ̃t+1 } .                    (A54)

       Substituting out ∆ct+1 − ∆c∗t+1 = 2∆c̃t+1 in (A53) using (A49), we obtain an equation character-
izing the expected real depreciation Et ∆qt+1 as a function of exogenous shocks. Together with (A51),
in which we substitute (A50), it forms a system of two dynamic equations that describe the equilibrium
dynamics of the real exchange rate given the exogenous dynamic processes for the shocks.

A.4      Autarky Limit and Proofs for Section 2.2
Proof of Propositions 1         The strategy of the proof is to evaluate the log deviations of the macro
variables zt ≡ (wt , pt , ct , `t , yt , it ) from the deterministic steady state (described in Appendix A.3.1)
in response to a shock εt = V0 Ωt 6= 0.54 In particular, we explore under which circumstances
limγ→0 zt = 0. It is sufficient to consider the log-linearized equilibrium conditions described in Ap-
pendix A.3.2, as providing a counterexample is sufficient for the prove (hence, the focus on the small
log deviations is without loss of generality). Furthermore, the proof does not rely on the international
risk sharing conditions, and hence does not depend on the assumptions about the (in)completeness of
the international asset markets.
       To prove the propositions, consider any shock εt with the restriction that

                                            ηt = ηt∗ = ξt = ξt∗ = ψt ≡ 0.                                             (A55)

We now go through the list of requirements imposed by the first part of the condition (21):
  54
    We do not impose any restrictions on the process for shocks in Ωt , with the exception of the mild requirement that any
innovation in Ωt has some contemporaneous effect on the value of shocks in Ωt , i.e. we rule out pure news shocks. We discuss
examples with specific time series processes for the shocks in the end of this subsection.



                                                             52
   1. No wage response limγ→0 wt = 0 implies wt = 0, i.e. the unit of account shocks cannot lead to
      the exchange rate disconnect in the limit.
   2. No price level response implies, using (A38) and (A55):
                                                                 
                                                    1     µt
                                 lim pt = wt +                − at = 0,
                                 γ→0             1−φ 1−α

      which in light of wt = 0 requires µt = (1 − α)at , i.e. the markup shocks must offset the produc-
      tivity shocks to avoid variation in the price level.
      When the same requirements are imposed for foreign, it ensures limγ→0 {qt − et } = 0, as imme-
      diartely follows from the the definition of the real exchange rate qt = p∗t +et −pt (see also (A40)).
   3. From the labor supply and labor demand conditions (A41)–(A42), no consumption, employment
      and output response require:
                                        n              o
                                   lim σct + ν1 `t + pt = wt − κt = 0,
                                   γ→0
                                         n             o
                                     lim yt − `t + φpt = at + φwt = 0,
                                     γ→0

      which then implies at = κt = wt ≡ 0 and by consequence µt ≡ 0 from the result above. That
      is, there cannot be productivity, markup or labor wedge shocks, if the price level, consumption,
      output and employment are not to respond in the autarky limit.
   4. Rearranging the goods market clearing in the home market (A46), we have:
                                                            1−ζ
                               lim ζyt − ζςct = ζ(1 − ς)gt −     µt = 0,
                               γ→0                           1−α
      which in light of the above results requires gt ≡ 0.
   5. Lastly, the home bond demand requires:
                                
                             lim σ∆Et ct+1 + ∆Et pt+1 − it = Et ∆χt+1 = 0,
                             γ→0

      therefore there cannot be predictable changes in χt and unpredictable changes in χt do not affect
      allocations in a one-period bond economies, hence without loss of generality we impose χt ≡ 0.
To summarize, the first condition in (21) (combined with the absence of ηt , ξt and ψt shocks) implies:

                                   wt = χt = κt = at = µt = gt ≡ 0,

i.e. no other shock can be consistent with limγ→0 zt+j = 0 for all j ≥ 0, however in the absence of
shocks limγ→0 et+j = 0, violating the second condition in (21). A symmetric argument for foreign
rules out the foreign counterparts of these shocks. This completes the proof.      




                                                    53
Proof of Proposition 2           For the proof, we consider the equilibrium system in the autarky limit by only
keeping the lowest order terms in γ for each shock or variable.55 Throughout the proof we impose
wt = χt = κt = at = µt = gt ≡ 0, as well as for their foreign counterparts.
        First, we consider our three moments of interest when ψt is the only shock, that is we set ηt =
ξt ≡ 0. For this purpose, it is sufficient to consider the static equilibrium conditions only, as the effect
of the ψt shock on the macro variables is exclusively indirect through qt . Specifically:
    1. Consider the near-autarky comovement between the terms of trade and the real exchange rate
          from (A35):
                                              cov(∆st , ∆qt )                                    1
                                      lim                     = (1 − 2α) > 0             iff   α< ,
                                      γ→0       var(∆qt )                                        2
          since we have η̃t = 0. α < 1/2 is a necessary parameter requirement for this result, which is
          borne out in the data, as we discuss in Section 3.
    2. Consider the near-autarky comovement between the relative consumption and the real exchange
          rate from (A49), which in the absence of all shocks but ψt simplifies to:
                                                                                                 
          h                           i                     2(1 − γ) ν + φ 1          1+ν
           (1 − 2γ)ζ(νσ + ς) + 2γνσ c̃t = −γ θ(1 − α)                +              −      (1 − ζ) qt .
                                                             1 − 2γ     1 − φ 1 − 2γ 1 − φ

          Hence, we have:

                    1 cov (∆ct − ∆c∗t , ∆qt )
                                                                                                      
                                                     2                                    ν+φ
                lim                           =−                            2θ(1 − α) + ζ     − (1 − ζ) < 0,
                γ→0 γ       var(∆qt )            ζ(νσ + ς)                                1−φ

          which is negative for all parameter values since

                                              ν+φ             ζν + ζ − (1 − φ)
                                          ζ       − (1 − ζ) =                  >0
                                              1−φ                  1−φ

          as from (A20) ζ = 1 − e−µ/(1−α) φ > 1 − φ.
    3. Consider the near-autarky comovement between the nominal exchange rate and the nominal
          interest rate differential (the Fama coefficient) by using (A54), which we write in the limit as:
                                                                                               
                  ∗                                       2γσ                      ζ(1 − ς/σ)
            it − it = Et {2σ∆c̃t+1 + 2∆p̃t+1 } = −                 2θ(1 − α) − 1 +                Et ∆qt+1 .
                                                       ζ(νσ + ς)                      1−φ

          where we used expression (A49) for c̃t and expressions (A38)–(A39) for pt and p∗t . Furthermore,
          (A40) and (A53) imply Et ∆et+1 = Et ∆qt+1 = −ψt in the limit and with ψt shocks only. There-
   55
        For example, consider equation (A40), which we now rewrite as:
                                                                      
                                                 1            µ̃t               1  η̃t
                                 qt − et = 2           ãt −        − w̃t + 2γ         .
                                                1−φ          1−α               1−φ1−α

Note that the gap between qt and et is zero-order in γ for shocks (ãt , µ̃t , w̃t ) and first-order in γ for shock η̃t .




                                                                  54
         fore, the Fama regression coefficient in the limit is:56

                            cov (Et ∆et+1 , it − i∗t )    ζ(νσ + ς)            1
                    lim γ                   ∗          =−                                        ζ(1−ς/σ)
                                                                                                            < 0,
                    γ→0          var (it − it )              2σ     2θ(1 − α) − 1 +                1−φ

         which is always negative under a mild additional requirement that θ > 1 and σ > 1 (since ς ≤ 1
         and α < 1/2), with a necessary condition being substantially weaker.57
This proves the first claim of the proposition that ψt robustly and simultaneously produces all three
empirical regularities in the autarky limit.58
       Second, recall that the uncovered interest rate parity (A52) implies that the Fama regression coef-
ficient:
                                   cov(∆et+1 , it − i∗t )
                            βF ≡                          =1           whenever          ψt ≡ 0.
                                      var(it − i∗t )
Therefore, (ηt , ηt∗ , ξt , ξt∗ ) shocks that follow any joint process cannot resolve the forward premium
puzzle. This is sufficient for the second claim of the proposition that the remaining shocks cannot
deliver the empirical comovement for all three moments. Nonetheless, we explore the remaining two
moments as well.
       Third, in the remainder of the proof, we focus on the ξt and ηt shocks (setting all other shocks
including ψt to zero), and impose specific time series process for these two types of shocks, which can
be viewed as providing counterexamples sufficient for our argument in Proposition 2. Specifically, we
focus on AR(1) processes for relative shocks:

                                                  ξ˜t = ρξ ξ˜t−1 + σξ εξt ,
                                                  η̃t = ρη η̃t−1 + ση εηt ,

with ρξ , ρη ∈ [0, 1] and where εξt , εηt ∼ iid(0, 1). We focus on the zero-order component of the
exchange rate dynamics in γ, as this component is non-trivial for both ξ˜t and η̃t shocks. There-
fore, we drop the first and higher order components in γ, so that we have et = qt from (A40) and
Et ∆qt+1 = Et ∆et+1 = 0 from (A53) together with (A49). Hence, the dynamics of the exchange rates
is a random walk with jumps that satisfy the intertemporal budget constraints. The flow budget con-
straint (A51) (with net exports (A50), in which we substitute the solutions for c̃t and ỹt from (A45) and
(A48)) up to first order terms in γ is given by:

                                      βb∗t+1 − b∗t = 2γ ϑqt − ξ˜t − (θ − 1)η̃t ,

where ϑ ≡ θ(1 − α) −          1−2α
                                2 .   Solving this equation forward and imposing limT →∞ β T b∗T +1 = 0, we
  56
      We make use of the fact that cov (∆et+1 , it − i∗t ) = cov (Et ∆et+1 , it − i∗t ) since it − i∗t is known at t.
  57
      The Fama coefficient for the real interest rates is always negative without any further parameter restrictions, as it is
proportional to the expression for the Backus-Smith correlation, since the real interest rate rt ≡ it − Et ∆pt+1 = σEt ∆ct+1
in the absence of χt shocks.
   58
      It is also easy to verify that the dispersion of the (real and nominal) exchange rate is separated from zero in response
to a ψt shock since from (A53) Et ∆qt+1 = −ψt and qt needs to adjust in response to ψt to ensure intertemporal budget
constraint with net exports following (A50). We show this formally in Appendix A.5 for ψt following an AR(1) process.

where for the first moment we maintain the assumption that α < 1/2 and to sign the second moment
we use the fact that ζ > 1 − φ. To see that the Backus-Smith correlation under ξt shocks can take both
signs, it is sufficient to consider the case with ρξ = 1 (when the correlation is negative) and the case
with ρξ = 0 and β ≈ 1 (when the correlation is positive). If β ≥ ρξ , under our parameterization it is
sufficient to have the quarterly discount factor β > 0.75 for the sign to be positive (with the calibrated
value of β = 0.99). This shows that the η̃t shock robustly generates counterfactual comovement with
all three macro variables, while the ξ˜t shock does not robustly deliver empirically relevant comovement
between exchange rates on one hand and interest rates and relative consumption on the other hand. 

A.5     The Baseline Model of Section 3 with ψt Shock
Consider the log-linearized equilibrium system from Appendix A.3.2, in which we set wt = µt = ηt =
ξt = gt = at = κt = χt = 0 at Home, and equivalently in Foreign, and also specialize to ς = 1 and
ζ = 1 − φ (corresponding to G = 0 and µ̄ = 0 respectively). The equilibrium system is block recursive,
and we solve it in turn for prices, quantities and equilibrium dynamics, followed by the discussion of
interest rates.
   59
      We describe a rigorous solution method in Appendix A.5, while here we offer a heuristic argument: the net present value
(using β as a discount factor) of any innovation to the right hand side of the flow budget constraint needs to be zero for
intertemporal budget balance. Denote εt ≡ ∆qt the (random       P walk)j innovation  of the exchange rate. The net present value
of the innovation to the flow budget constraint is therefore ∞                    j     ξ           j    η
                                                                          
                                                                   j=0 β ϑεt − ρξ σξ εt − (θ − 1)ρη ση εt = 0, and solving for
εt from this equation we obtain the expression in the proof.

Note that (A62) ensures κnx
                         q > 0, which also implies λ2 > 0. In turn, λ1 > 0 iff:

We discuss sufficient conditions for (A62) and (A67) in Appendix A.5.1. Note, however, that the signs
of λ1 and λ2 are inconsequential for the proofs of the main results.
       Equations (A63)–(A64) define a dynamic system in (bt , qt ), where we assume the exogenous shock
ψt follows an AR(1) process:
                                                      ψt = ρψt−1 + εt .                                                 (A68)

This system can be solved for the equilibrium dynamics of qt and bt using the Blanchard and Kahn
(1980) method.63 We prove:

Lemma A2 The unique non-explosive solution to the dynamic system (A63)–(A64) with (A68) is given by:

Proof: We rewrite the dynamic system (A63)–(A64) in matrix form as:
                                 !                 !        !           !

    Alternatively, this system can be solved by the method of undetermined coefficients. Rewriting (A63) as Et qt+1 = qt −ψ̂t ,
                        1
it must be that qt = 1−ρ   ψ̂t + mt , where mt is a martingale with the innovation given by the only fundamental shock εt .
That is, mt+1 = mt + ϑεt+1 , where ϑ is the undetermined coefficient. We then use (A64) to find the unique value of ϑ that
results in a non-explosive path for b∗t .



                                                              58

where we use the rescaled variables b̂t =                γκnx   and ψ̂t =      1+γσκcq   for convenience. Matrix A has
                                                           q
two eigenvalues: 1 and 1/β > 1. The left eigenvector of matrix A associated with eigenvalue 1/β is
v = (1, 1 − β). Premultiplying the system by v from the left, we have:
                                                                  !

                Et zt+1 = zt − ψ̂t ,    where      zt ≡ v           = qt + (1 − β)b̂t .
                         β                                    b̂t

The unique non-explosive (forward) solution of this dynamic equation is:64
                                                   ∞
                                                   X                         β
                                          zt = β         β j Et ψ̂t+j =          ψ̂t .
                                                                          1 − βρ
                                                   j=0

                                                                                                             β
This implies a cointegration relationship for the endogenous variables, qt + (1 − β)b̂t =                  1−βρ ψ̂t ,   which
can be used to solve out qt in (A64), yielding:
                                                                   1
                                                   ∆b̂t+1 =            ψ̂t ,
                                                                1 − βρ

which implies (A70) given the definitions of b̂t and ψ̂t , and using the fact that (1 − ρL)ψt = εt , where
the lag operator Lxt = xt−1 for an arbitrary variable xt .
       Next we take the first difference of (A64):
                                                                   β            1
                                ∆qt = β∆b̂t+1 − ∆b̂t =                 ψ̂t −        ψ̂t−1 ,
                                                                1 − βρ       1 − βρ

where the second equality substitutes in the solution for ∆b̂t+1 . Applying the (1 − ρL) operator on
                                                                                              1
both sides, we obtain equation (A69), since (1 − ρL)ψ̂t = ψ̂t − ρψ̂t−1 =                    1+γσκcq εt .   

Proof of Proposition 3          Lemma A2 implies that the unique (NPG-admissible) solution of the dynamic
system results in an ARIMA(1,1,1) process for the exchange rate and an ARIMA(1,1,0) process of the
NFA position of the country. Equivalently, the change in the exchange rate ∆qt follows an ARMA(1,1)
with the AR root ρ and the MA root 1/β, while the change in the NFA ∆b∗t+1 follows an AR(1) process
with root ρ. Also note that the smaller is γ, the larger is the response of qt and the smaller is the
response of b∗t+1 to the innovation εt of the financial shock ψt . In light of (A57) and (A65), Lemma A2
implies Proposition 3.          

Proofs for Proposition 4 and 5            Next we discuss the properties of the equilibrium exchange rate dy-
namics, which in light of (A57) apply equally to both the nominal and the real exchange rate. Given
the solution (A69), we can now characterize the statistical properties of the exchange rate process:

   1. Unconditional variance of ∆qt can be calculated from (A69) as follows:

       The remaining explosive solutions feature limj→∞ β j Et zt+j+1 = ∞, violating the No Ponzi Game Condition for b∗t .


                                                                59

   which increases without bound as ρ → 1.

2. Auto-covariance of ∆qt can be similarly calculated using (A69) as:

                                 2             1          β              (β − ρ)(1 − βρ) 2
           cov(∆qt+1 , ∆qt ) = ρσ∆q −                            σε2 = −                σ .

   The autocorrelation of the exchange rate changes (both nominal and real, in light of (A57)) is:

                                 cov(∆qt+1 , ∆qt )    (β − ρ)(1 − βρ)        1−ρ

   confirming claim 1 in Propositions 4.

3. The variance of innovation of ∆qt+1 is:
                                                                             2
                                                                                       σε2
                                                                
                                                                       β
                 vart (∆qt+1 ) = var(∆qt+1 − Et ∆qt+1 ) =                                       ,
                                                                    1 − βρ        (1 + γσκcq )2

   where we assume that the information set at time t includes {qt , qt−1 , . . . , εt , εt−1 , . . .}. Since
   ∆et equals ∆qt scaled by a constant, we further have:

           var(∆et+1 − Et ∆et+1 )   var(∆qt+1 − Et ∆qt+1 )    β 2 (1 − ρ2 )        1+ρ
                                  =                        =                2
                                                                              −−−→     ,

   confirming claim 2 in Propositions 4.
   Combining with the result in point 1 above, we have:

              var(∆et+1 − Et ∆et+1 )        1      β 2 (1 − ρ2 )      1    1+ρ
                                     =           2           2
                                                                 −−−→    2
                                                                                ,
                   var(ψt+1 )          (1 + γλ1 ) (1 − βρ) β→1 (1 + γλ1 ) 1 − ρ

   which tends to infinity with ρ → 1, confirming claim 3 in Propositions 4.                

4. We now calculate the finite-sample autocorrelation of the real exchange rate in levels, that is the
   coefficient from a regression of qt on qt−1 (with a constant) in a sample with T + 1 observa-
   tions. Even though the second moments are not well-defined in population, this finite sample




                                                   60
          correlation is well-defined. We have:
                                     1 PT                                                1   PT
                                     T    t=1 (qt − q̄)(qt−1 − q̄)                       T    t=1 ∆qt qt−1
                          ρ̂q (T ) =    1 PT
                                                                   =1+               1   PT                       .
                                                  (q    −  q̄)2                                          − q̄)2
                                        T     t=1   t−1                              T       t=1 (qt−1

          Note that the denominator is positive and finite for any finite T , but diverges as T → ∞, since
          qt is an integrated process. The numerator, however, has a finite limit (assuming β, ρ < 1, which
          ensures stationarity of ∆qt , and conditioning on the given initial value of the process q0 ):
                             T                               ∞

                                 t=1                                         j=1

                                                     cov(∆qt , ∆qt−1 )         β−ρ            σψ2
                                                 =                     =−                               ,
                                                          1−ρ             (1 − ρ)(1 − βρ) (1 + γσκcq )2

          where we used the fact that for process (A69) cov(∆qt , ∆qt−j ) = ρj−1 cov(∆qt−j+1 , ∆qt−j ) for
          j ≥ 1 and the expression for cov(∆qt , ∆qt−1 ) obtained above.
          To summarize, this analysis implies that the finite sample autocorrelation of qt : (a) tends to 1
          asymptotically as samples size increases; and (b) is smaller than 1 in large but finite samples,
          provided that ρ < β. This confirms the claims in Proposition 5.                     

Interest rates and Carry trades               Finally, we turn to the properties of the interest rates, which are
linked to consumption and prices by (A54). Substituting in the solution for consumption (A60) and
prices (A56), we arrive at:
                                                                  
                             it − i∗t = − σγκcq −        1   2γ
                                                        1−φ 1−2γ       Et ∆qt+1 = −γλ1 Et ∆et+1 ,

corresponding to (41) and with λ1 defined in (A65). In this analysis we assume that the parameter
restriction (A67) is satisfied, and λ1 > 0.65 Combining the expression for interest rate differential with
the UIP condition (A52), we obtain expression (42) in the text.
       Lastly, we define a Carry trade. Consider a trade strategy that invests xt ≡ it − i∗t − Et ∆et+1 in
the home bond and sells short xt units of foreign bond, including the case when xt < 0 (i.e., shorting
the home bond and investing in foreign bond in this case). We refer to this strategy as a Carry trade.
Note that this trade requires zero capital at t and the intensity (exposure) of the trade is proportional to
its expected return, which from (A52) equals xt = ψt . The return on this trade and the corresponding
(unconditional) Sharpe ratio are given by:
                                                                                                 C
                                                                                               Ert+1
                              C
                             rt+1 = xt (it − i∗t − ∆et+1 )             and         SRC =          C )
                                                                                                      .                (A71)
                                                                                             std(rt+1
  65
       There exists a parallel relationship in real terms (where rt ≡ it − Et ∆pt+1 denotes the real interest rate):

                                       rt − rt∗ = σEt {∆ct+1 − ∆c∗t+1 } = −γσκcq Et ∆qt+1 ,

with the negative sign independently of the parameter values.




                                                                61
Proof of Proposition 8     First, consider the Fama regression of ∆et+1 on it − i∗t . From (26), it follows:

                                                             1       β
                                 ∆et+1 = Et ∆et+1 +                      εt+1 ,
                                                          1 + γλ1 1 − βρ
since εt+1 is the only innovation relative to the information set of time t. Furthermore, from our
derivations above we have it − i∗t = −γλ1 Et ∆et+1 , and therefore, we can write the regression as:

                                             1                   1       β
                            ∆et+1 = −           (it − i∗t ) +                εt+1 .
                                            γλ1               1 + γλ1 1 − βρ

Since εt+1 is a regression residual (i.e., E{εt+1 |it − i∗t } = 0), the Fama regression coefficient is given by
βF ≡ − γλ1 1 < 0. The R2 in this regression is given by the share of the predictable variation in ∆et+1 ,
since it − i∗t absorbes the entire predictable component Et ∆et+1 (see Proposition 4 and its proof for
derivation of the variance share of the unpredictable component):

            var(Et ∆et+1 )     var(∆et+1 − Et ∆et+1 )      β 2 (1 − ρ2 )       (1 − βρ)2
     R2 =                  =1−                        =1−                2
                                                                           =               .
             var(∆et+1 )            var(∆et+1 )           1 − 2βρ + β        1 − 2βρ + β 2
                          1−ρ
Note that limβ→1 R2 =      2 ,   which tends to zero with ρ → 1. This proves claim (i).
    Using the same arguments, we prove claim (ii):

                           var(∆et+1 )       1     var(∆et+1 )       1     1
                                     ∗   =       2
                                                                 =           .
                           var(it − it )   (γλ1 ) var(Et ∆et+1 )   (γλ1 ) R2
                                                                         2


Since γλ1 is separated from zero when γ > 0 and does not depend on β and ρ, the asymptotics of this
relative variances is the same as that of 1/R2 , which goes to infinity as β, ρ → 1.
    Claim (iii) follows form the fact that ρ∆e = corr(∆et+1 , ∆et ) → 0 as β, ρ → 1 (see Proposition 4),
                                       γλ1
while the persistence of it − i∗t =   1+γλ1 ψt   equals ρ → 1.
                                                                     C
    Lastly, we make use of the definition of the Carry trade return rt+1 and its Sharpe ratio SRC
in (A71), to prove claim (iv). In particular, we calculate the expected return and the variance of the
returns (using the fact that from (A52) we have it − i∗t − ∆et+1 = ψt − (∆et+1 − Et ∆et+1 )):

                  C
                       = E ψt Et {it − i∗t − ∆et+1 } = Eψt2 = var(ψt ) = σψ2 ,

                                          C
                                             )2 = E ψt2 [ψt − (∆et+1 − Et ∆et+1 )]2 − σψ4

            var(rt+1 ) = E(rt+1
                       = Eψt4 + E ψt2 vart (∆et+1 ) − σψ4 = 2σψ4 + vart (∆et+1 )σψ2 ,
                                   


where the last line uses the fact that vart (∆et+1 ) = Et {∆et+1 − Et ∆et+1 }2 depends only on the
parameters and does not depend on ψt (i.e., the unexpected component of ∆et+1 is homoskedastic; see
the proof of Proposition 4), the fact that E{ψt3 (∆et+1 −Et ∆et+1 )} = E{ψt3 Et {∆et+1 −Et ∆et+1 }} = 0,
and lastly that Eψt4 = 3(Eψt2 )2 = 3σψ4 under the additional assumption that εt is normally distribution
(in which case ψt is also normal). With this, we calculate:
                                                                                             −1/2

                                                        62
where we use the expression for vart (∆et+1 )/σψ2 from the proof of Proposition 4. Note that SRC → 0
as β, ρ → 1, as vart (∆et+1 )/σψ2 → ∞.                   

A.5.1    Parameter restrictions

The primitive parameters (defined in Table 1) can take the following values:
     • β ∈ (0, 1) and ρ ∈ [0, 1], while the model admits solution as long as βρ < 1
     • σ, θ > 0 and ν ≥ 0
     • γ ∈ [0, 1/2] with γ = 0 corresponding to autarky and γ = 1/2 corresponding to no home bias
     • α ∈ [0, 1) with α = 0 corresponding to no strategic complementarities and complete pass-through
     • φ ∈ [0, 1) with φ = 0 corresponding to no intermediate inputs.
In addition, we impose the following sufficient parameter restrictions needed for certain results:

Assumption A1: α < 1/2.

A1 ensures positive correlation between RER and ToT (Proposition 6). A1 is consistent with the range
of empirical estimates for the elasticity of strategic complementarities.

Assumption A2: θ > 1/σ.

Together with A1, A2 implies 2σθ(1 − α) > 1, which is a sufficient condition for (A67), ensuring
that λ1 > 0, i.e. that the nominal interest rate falls with expected deprecation (see (41); needed for
Proposition 8, and useful but not necessary in discussion of Proposition 3).66 Note that here 1/σ plays
the role of IES (elasticity of intertemporal substitution), rather than the income effect in the labor supply
(and therefore does not exclude GHH preferences). Empirically, θ > 1 and 1/σ ∈ (1/2, 1), so this
sufficient condition is met with ease, and the necessary condition (A67) is even further lax.

Assumption A3: θ >            2   +   1−φ 1−2γ .


A3 is a sufficient condition for (A62), a variant of the Marshall-Lerner condition in our general equi-
librium model, which ensuring that λ2 > 0 and κnx
                                               q > 0, i.e. that net export improves in response
to a devaluation (see (25); a useful but not necessary condition for discussion of Proposition 3). An
                                                                                 φ 
alternative necessary condition for (A62) can be written as θ > 21 1−γ
                                                                    1
                                                                       
                                                                         1 + 2γ 1−φ  . A necessary con-
dition (A62) is noticeably weaker, and in particular is relaxed when α > 0. In the limit of autarky
(γ ≈ 0), θ > 1/2 is both necessary and sufficient, corresponding to the classical Marshall-Lerner con-
dition. Since empirically θ > 1 and φ ≈ 1/2, A3 would be easily satisfied even for countries that are a
number of times more open than the United States.
   66
      Condition A2 effectively ensures that nominal and real interest rates move in the same direction, i.e. the expected inflation
response does not more than offset the movement in the real interest rate.




                                                                63
A.5.2   Quantitative properties and robustness

We now explore the robustness of our quantitative findings in the baseline model (with ψt shocks only),
away from both limites γ → 0 and βρ → 1, and with respect to departures from our baseline param-
eterization summarized in Table 1. The results are reported in Table A1, along with the benchmark
empirical moments. The robustness columns report only the moments that are sensitive to the changes
in the parameter values.
    The robustness analysis suggests that the model requires a high ρ in order to capture the dynamic
properties of the exchange rates, as a lower ρ results in less persistent exchange rates and in more
predictable exchange rate changes. The quantitative success of the model also relies on home bias
(a low γ), as when γ is doubled (corresponding to a 60% trade to GDP ratio), the model predicts a
considerably more volatile response of the real variables to the real exchange rate, in contrast with the
data. Having moderately low θ and high α is also important for the fit of the model, while it is more
robust with respect to variation in other parameters, including risk aversion σ and Frisch elasticity
ν (not reported in the table). Similarly, we check robustness with respect to ς = C/(C + G) and µ̄
(average markup).
    Note: in response to ψt shock, ct and c∗t are perfectly negatively correlated so that ∆ct − ∆c∗t =
2∆ct . Therefore, while ∆ct − ∆c∗t is about three times less volatile than ∆qt , ∆ct alone is about
six times less volatile than ∆qt . The in-sample Fama regression coefficient is −8 with huge variation
covering zero within two standard deviations. When ψt is combined with other shocks, the median
coefficient becomes closer to zero, as in the data (see Table 2).

A.6     Market (in)completeness
We consider here the generalization of our framework to a version of a complete market environment
to assess the importance of a single internationally-traded bond assumption in the baseline model.
    We make the following assumptions: Only the foreign-currency assets are traded internationally
and are the only types of assets held by foreign households. This assumption is for convenience of
exposition and is without loss of generality if there exists a full set of state-contingent foreign-currency
assets. We make the following assumptions about SDFs:
   1. Foreign nominal SDF for foreign-currency assets: Θ∗t+1 = β exp{−(σ∆c∗t+1 + ∆p∗t+1 )}.
   2. Home nominal SDF for home-currency assets: Θt+1 = β exp{−(σ∆ct+1 + ∆pt+1 )}.
   3. Home nominal SDF for foreign-currency assets:

                             Et+1 ∆ζt+1
                      Θt+1       e      = β exp{∆ζt+1 − σ∆ct+1 − ∆pt+1 + ∆et+1 }.
                              Et

Hence, ζt is an exogenous home preference shock for holding foreign currency assets at t, or alterna-
tively a shock to international risk sharing. It can also be viewed as a type of deviation from the joint
assumption of CRRA utility and complete markets (see e.g. Lustig and Verdelhan 2016).




                                                    64
       With a full set of state contingent foreign-currency assets, the risk-sharing condition becomes:

                               Et+1 ∆ζt+1
               Θ∗t+1 = Θt+1        e                ⇔         σ(∆ct+1 − ∆c∗t+1 ) = ∆qt+1 + ∆ζt+1 ,
                                Et
which is equivalent to a static condition (in log deviations):

                                                 σ(ct − c∗t ) = qt + ζt .                                            (A72)

Therefore, ζt is the shock to/wedge in the Backus-Smith condition. We take equation (A72) as the
reduced-form characterization of this environment, which can be consistent with both complete mar-
kets, as well as specific types of deviations from complete markets.
       In what follows, we allow for productivity shock at and risk sharing shock ζt , shutting down all
other shocks for simplicity. We also maintain the assumption of flexible wages and prices. Under
complete markets, the budget constraint is satisfied as a side-equations (due to state-contingent payoffs)
and does not affect the equilibrium dynamics. The equilibrium characterization simply combines the
risk-sharing condition (A72) with the goods and labor market clearing relationship (40), which remains
unchanged.67 Together, they result in the solution for the real exchange rate:
                                               σκa                     1
                                     qt =            (at − a∗t ) −          ζt .                                     (A73)
                                            1 + γσκq               1 + γσκq

Therefore, in this complete market environment, the real exchange rate is driven directly by the con-
temporaneous shocks to productivity and to international risk sharing, and the persistence in these
shocks directly translates into persistence in qt .
       Given the solution for equilibrium real exchange rate in (A73), the equilibrium nominal exchange
rate is characterized by (31), which also stays unchanged, and we reproduce it here as:
                                                                              
                                  1     2γ                  ∗       1          ∗
                    et = 1 +                   qt + (wt − wt ) −       (at − at ) ,
                                1 − φ 1 − 2γ                     1−φ

and where the path of the nominal wage wt − wt∗ is determined by the monetary policy.
       The conclusion from this analysis is that the exchange rate disconnect properties of the baseline
one-bond model can be also obtained in this version of a complete-market environment, provided that
productivity (at − a∗t ) and monetary (wt − wt∗ ) shocks are small relative to a persistent risk-sharing
shock ζt . Indeed, when ζt is the only shock and it follows a persistent AR(1) process, the real and
nominal exchange rates will be perfectly correlated and will follow the same persistent process. Fur-
thermore, there will be analogous limiting disconnect properties for the macro variables. Consider for
example consumption, which we solve for by combining (A72) with (A73):
                                                    σκa                   γσκq
                                σ(ct − c∗t ) =            (at − a∗t ) +          ζt .
                                                 1 + γσκq               1 + γσκq
  67
     Recall that in the absence of markup shocks, this condition implicitly assumes flexible prices and wages, an assumption
we maintain throughout this appendix. With nominal rigidities, the equilibrium real exchange rate would be additionally
influenced by the implied markup shocks arising from sticky prices and wages.




                                                            65
We see that ζt shock generates the Backus-Smith negative correlation between ct − c∗t and qt , and the
volatility of consumption is arbitrary small relative to the real exchange rate when the economy is
closed to international trade (γ → 0). Therefore, we can prove equivalents of Propositions 1–2 and 5–8
in the complete market environment as well. To summarize, market incompleteness in the specific
form of a single internationally-traded bond is not necessary for our exchange rate disconnect results,
however, a shock ζt to the risk-sharing condition is, and it can emerge due to a variety of reasons, such
as risk premia, financial frictions, limits to arbitrage, or market incompleteness.

Relationship to the baseline model            Under incomplete markets with a single risk-free foreign nominal
bond traded internationally, the optimal risk sharing results in the (log-linearized) UIP condition:68

                             it − i∗t = Et ∆et+1 + ψt ,           where      ψt ≡ Et ∆ζt+1 .

Therefore, the shock ψt in our baseline model is equivalent to the expect change in the SDF shock ζt ,
as the martingale disturbances to the SDF (with Et ∆ζt+1 = 0) wash out in the linearized model.
       We consider now two special cases:
   1. ζt follows an AR(1): ζt = ρζt−1 + εt . Then ψt = Et ∆ζt = −(1 − ρ)ζt also follows an AR(1) with
         persistence ρ, and ψt and ζt are negatively correlated. In the limit of ρ → 1, ψt becomes both
         more persistent and less volatile, with var(ψt ) → 0 holding var(εt ) constant.
   2. ∆ζt follows an AR(1): ∆ζt = ρ∆ζt−1 + εt . Then: ψt = Et ∆ζt+1 = ρ∆ζt also follows an AR(1)
         with persistence ρ, yet now ψt and ζt are positively correlated. The variance of the ψt process
         goes to zero with ρ → 0.
We consider the first case as our benchmark, with ρ < 1 but in the neighborhood of 1. Note that a
persistent ψt requires a persistent ζt , which however does not need to be integrated.
       In the baseline model, equilibrium real exchange rate follows a dynamic process (A69) in Lemma A2,
which differs markedly from the simple static relationship of qt to shocks in (A73). The reason is that the
RER in a single-bond economy not only needs to clear markets statically, but also ensures the dynamic
intertemporal budget constraint, which is not relevant for equilibrium dynamics in a complete market
environments.

A.7       Relationship to Engel and West (2005)
Consider a simple monetary model extension with an interest-elastic money demand:

                                                 mt − pt = σct − χit ,                                       (A74)

and an exogenous stochastic money supply process mt . This model corresponds to one of the special
cases considered in Engel and West (2005), and their other special case with a Taylor rule admits a
similar characterization (omitted here for brevity). We shut down all sources of shocks apart from a
productivity shock at , a financial shock ψt (or ζt ) and a monetary shock mt .
                                                                                             E
  68
       This derives from a log linear approximation to i∗t+1 = − log Et Θ∗t+1 = − log Et Θt+1 t+1 e∆ζt+1 .
                                                                                        
                                                                                               Et




                                                             66
Partial equilibrium       solution of Engel and West (2005) combines the UIP condition (22) with money
demand (A74) in both countries and the definition of the real exchange rate (29) to obtain the equilib-
rium dynamic expression for the nominal exchange rate as a function of fundamentals:
                                                                                                                   χ
et = δEt et+1 + δψt + (1 − δ)ft ,             where     ft ≡ qt + (mt − m∗t ) − σ(ct − c∗t )         and δ ≡          .
                                                                                                                  1+χ
The forward solution to this equation, after imposing a no-bubble condition for the nominal exchange,
is given by:
                                           ∞
                                           X                            ∞
                                                                        X
                                                  j
                                  et = δ         δ Et ψt+j + (1 − δ)          δ j Et ft+j ,                         (A75)
                                           j=0                          j=0

which admits the Engel and West (2005) structure. This solution expresses the nominal exchange rate
as a net present value of future fundamentals, both exogenous shocks like ψt and endogenous variables
like consumption ct . In general equilibrium, however, other equilibrium conditions impose cointegra-
tion between ψt and ft , resulting in a solution that may look different from (A75), as we now discuss.

General equilibrium         solution for nominal exchange rate combines the definition of RER (29), the
money demand (A74), the UIP condition (22) and the risk-sharing condition (39):

         et = qt + pt − p∗t
            = qt + (mt − m∗t ) − σ(ct − c∗t ) + χ(it − i∗t )
            = qt + (mt − m∗t ) − σ(ct − c∗t ) + χ Et ∆et+1 + Et {σ(∆ct+1 − c∗t+1 ) − ∆qt+1 } .
                                                                                            


After rearranging:
                             (1 − δL) [et − qt + σ(ct − c∗t )] = (1 − δ)(mt − m∗t ),

where still δ ≡ χ/(1 + χ) and L is the lag operator, we solve forward:
                                                                 ∞
                                                                 X
                           et = qt − σ(ct − c∗t ) + (1 − δ)            δ j Et {mt+j − m∗t+j }.
                                                                 j=0

Lastly, substitute in the solution for consumption (40) to obtain:
                                                                          ∞
                                                                          X
                  et = (1 + γσκq )qt − σκa (at − a∗t ) + (1 − δ)                δ j Et {mt+j − m∗t+j },             (A76)
                                                                          j=0

which yields a relationship between nominal and real exchange rates and exogenous shocks. This
relationship does not depend on whether markets are complete or incomplete (in the sense of Ap-
pendix A.6), as we only used equilibrium conditions ((22) and (39)) that hold under both cases.69
    The solution for real exchange rate in general equilibrium does not depend on monetary shocks
(due to flexible prices), and is given either by (A69) in a single-bond economy following the steps in
Appendix A.5 or by (A73) under complete markets. Combining these solutions with (A76) we obtain
  69
     Another relationship between nominal and real exchange rate (31) also holds in equilibrium, and combining the two, one
obtains the solution for the equilibrium relative nominal wages wt − wt∗ .


                                                            67
the expression for nominal exchange rate as a function of exogenous shocks. Consider, for example,
the complete market environment of Appendix A.6, in which case we have:
                                                         ∞
                                                         X
                                 et = −ζt + (1 − δ)             δ j Et {mt+j − m∗t+j }.
                                                         j=0

Contrast this solution with the partial equilibrium relationship (A75). Analogously, one can analyze
our baseline case in a single-bond economy, where qt follows an ARIMA(1,1,1) of Lemma A3.

Summary       Engel and West (2005) offer a partial equilibrium characterization of the nominal exchange
rate (which clears only a subset of markets, e.g. bond and money markets), expressing it as a function
of future endogenous and exogenous fundaments. This characterization applies in our model, yet the
general equilibrium nature of our model imposes additional cointegration relationships on the endoge-
nous fundamentals, which need to be taken into account in characterizing the equilibrium exchange
rate behavior. For example, Engel-West solution (A75) suggests that expectation of future consumption,
real exchange rate and risk sharing shocks should impact today’s value of the nominal exchange rate.
In contrast, the general equilibrium solution (A76) shows that only the contemporaneous realizations
of the real exchange rate and productivity matter for the nominal exchange rate, while the only future
fundamentals that matter for the nominal exchange rate are monetary shocks.
    Furthermore, the partial equilibrium and general equilibrium focus also leads to different conclu-
sions about the role of the parameters that matter for the persistence of the exchange rate. In particular,
Engel and West (2005) emphasize δ, which may arise either from the interest elasticity of money de-
mand χ or from the Taylor rule parameter, with the limit δ → 1 resulting in a near-random-walk
behavior for the nominal exchange rate, for a wide range of values of other parameters. In our general
equilibrium solution (A76), δ plays no role for the real exchange rate and a limited role for nominal ex-
change rate, provided that money demand shocks are not the key drivers of the nominal exchange rate
(as Proposition 1 suggests, otherwise resulting in a PPP puzzle). This property is due to the endogenous
equilibrium cointegration between future risk premium shocks, real exchange rate and consumption,
making them disappear from the right-hand side of (A75), making δ inessential for the transmission
of these shocks. Instead, in our baseline single-bond model, the process for the exchange rate depends
crucially on the time discount factor β (naturally close to 1), as emphasized in Propositions 3 and 4.70

A.8    Productivity shocks and the Backus-Smith puzzle
We consider here alternative mechanisms, which can resolve the Backus-Smith puzzle in a bond-only
economy subject exclusively to productivity shocks, following much of the literature (in particular,
Corsetti, Dedola, and Leduc 2008). Using the static equilibrium relationship (40), we can express the
Backus-Smith correlation as:

     Both Engel and West (2005) and our solution rely on a persistent shock to obtain a near-random walk behavior for the
exchange rate.


                                                           68
where %a,q ≡ corr(∆at − ∆a∗t , ∆qt ). The puzzle persists as the typical calibrations imply %a,q > 0
and γ ≈ 0, resulting in the counterfactually positive correlation between relative consumption growth
and real exchange rate depreciation. The two mechanism we discuss below either make %a,q < 0, or
increase std(∆qt )/std(∆at − ∆a∗t ) to obtain the empirical negative correlation.
    In addition to (40), the two dynamic equilibrium conditions are the risk sharing condition (39) and
the budget constraint (analog of (25)), which we reproduce here altogether as the special case of the
equilibrium system in Appendix A.3.2 with productivity shocks only:

                                                  ct − c∗t = κa (at − a∗t ) − γκq qt ,                  (40)
                      Et {σ(∆ct+1 − ∆c∗t+1 ) − ∆qt+1 } = 0,                                            (390 )
                                      βb∗t+1 − b∗t = nxt = γ [λq qt − λa (at − a∗t )] ,                (250 )

Further, for simplicity, we consider the case with φ = 0, ζ = ς = 1 and ν = 0, and the results generalize
immediately beyond this special case. In this case, the coefficients in the system above are given by:

                         1                 4θ(1 − α)(1 − γ)                 κq   1 − 2(1 − γ)α
          κa = λa =          ,      κq =                    ,        λq =      −               .
                      1 − 2γ                  (1 − 2γ)2                     2       1 − 2γ

Two noteworthy features of this system are:
   1. Both coefficients γλa and γλq tend towards zero with γ → 0, while this is the case only for
      γκq , and not for κa . This suggests that the direct effect of productivity on consumption will tend
      to dominate the expenditure switching effect, when γ is small (that is, economy is sufficiently
      closed). This constitutes the key challenge for the productivity-based models in obtaining the
      empirical Backus-Smith correlation.
   2. Coefficients κa , κq , λa > 0, while λq > 0 iff a version of the Marshal-Lerner condition holds:

                                              1 1 − 2γ 1 − 2(1 − γ)α
                                         θ>                          ,
                                              2 1−γ        1−α
      for which Assumption A3 in Appendix A.5.1 is a sufficient condition.
The fact that λq can flip sign (when θ is sufficiently low) is one path towards a resolution of the Backus-
Smith puzzle. The other possibility relies on reducing the volatility of innovation to productivity (mak-
ing κa (at − a∗t ) small in (40)), while simultaneously increasing its persistence (to increase the response
of qt and hence the term γκq qt in (40)). We consider these two possibilities in turn.

Low elasticity of substitution   For simplicity we focus here on the case of a random walk process for
productivity, and results generalize outside this case. With ∆(at − a∗t ) = εat , the combination of (390 )
and (40) results in Et ∆qt+1 = 0. Intuitively, in response to a permanent shift in productivity, the
real exchange rate also shifts permanently. Given a random walk path for both qt and (at − a∗t ), the
intertemporal budget constraint holds only if λq qt − λa (at − a∗t ) ≡ 0. Therefore, the real exchange
rate depreciates with a positive productivity shock iff the Marshal-Lerner condition is satisfied, but it
appreciates otherwise. Intuitively, an increase in consumption and import demand from a productivity
shock must be offset by an increase in exports, which requires a depreciation iff the Marshal-Lerner

                                                     69
condition holds, and vice versa. Combining this relationship between qt and (at − a∗t ) with the solution
for consumption, we arrive at:
                             n    h                               i       o
                                    2θ(1−α)(1−γ)
                  ct − c∗t = 1−2γ
                               1
                                        1−2γ     − [1 − 2(1 − γ)α]  − γκq   qt .

Therefore, the violation of the Marshal-Lerner condition is sufficient for the negative correlation be-
tween ct − c∗t and qt , but the necessary condition is weaker and is given by:

                                                      1 1 1 − 2(1 − γ)α
                                                θ<                      .
                                                      21−γ    1−α

With γ = 0.28 (four times that of the US) and α = 0, this requires θ < 0.7. For smaller γ and larger α,
this requirement becomes considerably more strict (e.g., for our baseline values of α and γ, θ < 0.25).

Persistent productivity shocks              Here we assume that the Marshal-Lerner condition is satisfied and
λq > 0, and instead consider a case with a persistent process for relative productivity growth rates:

                                                    ∆ãt = ρa ∆ãt−1 + εεt ,

where ãt ≡ (at − a∗t )/2 and ρa ∈ [0, 1).71 Combining (390 ) and (40), we have in this case:
                                                    2σκa                2σκa ρa
                                   Et ∆qt+1 =              Et ∆ãt+1 =          ∆ãt .
                                                  1 + γσκq             1 + γσκq

Therefore, a positive productivity growth shock results in an expected appreciation. Combining this
with the flow budget constraint, we have a system of dynamic equations, which we solve again using
the Blanchard-Kahn method (as in Lemma A2):72
                                                                                                !
                                             λ̂ − βρa κ̂                   (λ̂ − κ̂)ρa
                                   ∆qt+1   =                  ∆ãt+1 −                   ∆ãt       ,
                                              1 − βρa                      λ̂ − βρa κ̂

                  2σκa
where κ̂ ≡       1+γσκq   and λ̂ ≡ 2λa /λq . With this solution, we can calculate the Backus-Smith covariance
(making use of (40)):

   cov(∆ct − ∆c∗t , ∆qt )       cov(∆ãt , ∆qt )
                          = 2κa                  − γκq
        var(∆qt )                 var(∆qt )
                                                        (1 − βρa )[λ̂(1 − ρ2a ) − κ̂ρa (β − ρa )]
                                 = 2κa                                                                              − γκq .
                                          [λ̂(1 − ρa ) + κ̂ρa (1 − β)]2 + ρa (2 − ρa )(λ̂ − κ̂)(λ̂ − κ̂βρa )
  71
       The results in the stationary AR(1) case are qualitatively similar to the random walk limit with ρa .
  72
       To apply the Blanchard-Kahn method, we rewrite the system in matrix form as:
                                                                                       
                                         qt+1           1     0         qt          κ̂ρa ∆ãt
                                    Et            =                            +                ,
                                         b̂t+1          1 1/β           b̂t           −λ̂ãt

where b̂t ≡ βb∗t /(γλq ), and look for the unique stationary solution associated with the explosive root 1/β. Note that the
coefficients do not depend on ρa , which facilitates taking the limits below. Note that, given the productivity process, the RER
equilibrium process is still an ARIMA(1,1,1), as in Lemma A2, yet with a different MA root.




                                                                70
Around ρa ≈ 0 (random walk), the Marshal-Lerner condition is sufficient to ensure that this expression
is positive (corresponding to the case we considered earlier). However, as ρa increases, this equation
switches sign to negative, as in the limit βρa → 1, var(∆qt )/var(∆ãt ) → ∞. This is an intuitive
result: as productivity growth shocks become very persistent, the contemporaneous improvement in
productivity is small relative to the cumulative expected improvement, and the RER responds to the
cumulative expectation. Therefore, tiny shocks to current productivity act like news shocks about fu-
ture productivity, and trigger large RER movements. Under these circumstances, indirect expenditure
switching effect of RER on consumption can dominate the direct contemporaneous productivity ef-
fect in (40). Long-run risk shocks in Colacito and Croce (2013) operate in a similar way, yet have an
additional risk premia effects in (39). Lastly, we point out that persistent growth rate shocks are not
necessary per se, as persistent effects to output growth can be obtained from endogenous amplification,
such as capital accumulation in Corsetti, Dedola, and Leduc (2008).

A.9   Monetary model with nominal rigidities (Section 4.1)
We outline the details of the monetary model, adopting a general enough setup to nest several exten-
sions as special cases. In particular, we allow for both nominal wage and price rigidities. As before, we
focus on Home and symmetric relationships hold in Foreign.

Households     Consider a standard New Keynesian two country model in a cashless limit, as described
in Galí (2008). In particular, the aggregate labor input is a CES aggregate of individual varieties with
elasticity of substitution , which results in labor demand:
                       −                            Z                              Z                   1

                  Wt

and the rest of the model production structure is unchanged. The first order conditions of the household
optimization result in the New Keynesian IS curve and the UIP condition:

                                          Et {σ∆c̃t+1 + ∆p̃t+1 } = ĩt ,                                                (A77)
                                                            Et ∆ẽt+1 = 2ĩt − ψt ,                                     (A78)

                                               2   (xt − x∗t ).
   Households set wages a la Calvo and supply as much labor as demanded at a given wage rate. The
probability of changing wage in the next period is 1 − λw . The first order condition for wage setting is:

Substituting in labor demand and log-linearizing, we obtain:

where ŵt denotes log deviation from the steady state of the wage rate reset at t. Note that the wage

The law of motion for home prices and the resulting NKPC are then:

Government policy and shocks             We assume that Central Bank conducts active monetary policy, while
the government chooses the fiscal policy (taxes) passively to balance the budget. The monetary policy




                                                         72
is represented by a standard Taylor rule:

                               it = ρm it−1 + (1 − ρm ) [δπ πt + δy yt ] + m
                                                                            t ,                         (A80)

where δy is a coefficient on the output gap, which in the baseline case was absent (i.e., δy = 0). The
Taylor rules are symmetric in both countries. In the case with exchange rate peg (Table 4), we check
robustness with asymmetric Taylor rules, where one country follows a conventional Taylor rule (43),
while the other pegs its exchange rate according to (44).
   We allow persistence of the interest rate to be different from the autocorrelation of other shocks,
which in addition to the ψt shock in (23) also include foreign-good demand and productivity shocks:

                                               ξ˜t = ρξ˜t−1 + ξt ,                                     (A81)
                                               ãt = ρãt−1 + at .                                     (A82)

Market clearing     The last dynamic equation is the country’s budget constraint:

                                     βb∗t+1 = b∗t + 2 (p̃∗Ht + ỹHt
                                                                 ∗

where b∗t is the net foreign asset position of the Home country. The static part of the model is repre-
sented by labor demand and goods market equilibrium conditions:

                               `˜t = ỹt − ãt + φ ((1 − γ) p̃Ht − γ p̃∗Ht − w̃t )                      (A84)

             ỹHt = −γ ξ˜t − θγ (p̃Ht + p̃∗Ht ) + (1 − φ) c̃t + φ ((1 − φ) (w̃t − p̃t ) − ãt + ỹt )   (A85)

                                     ỹHt = −ỹHt − ξ˜t − θ (p̃Ht + p̃∗Ht )                             (A86)
                                                                   ∗
                                          ỹt = (1 − γ) ỹHt + γ ỹHt                                   (A87)

The numbered equations above define the system that describes the equilibrium dynamics of the model.

Robustness     All baseline parameters are as described in the main text and we set the elasticity of
substitution between different types of labor to  = 4. Table A3 presents the results from alternative
monetary models with multiple shocks, which can be compared to the baseline multi-shock mone-
tary model in column 5 of Table 2. In particular, we consider the following alternative specifications,
adjusting one feature of the model at a time relative to the baseline:
   1. Flexible wages (λw = 0): no noticeable difference
   2. Flexible prices (λp = 0): the volatility and correlation of terms of trade and real exchange rate
      relative to the nominal exchange rate deteriorate somewhat, volatility of consumption goes up,
      and the role of monetary shocks is larger.
   3. Lower persistence in the Taylor rule (ρm = 0.8): Fama coefficient becomes positive, interest rates
      become more volatile and less persistent.
   4. Expected inflation (Et πt+1 ) instead of πt in the Taylor rule (43): no noticeable differences.


                                                       73
   5. Positive weight on output gap in the Taylor rule (δy = 0.2): no noticeable differences.
   6. PCP stickiness instead of LCP (with the same λp = 0.75): correlation between RER and ToT
       becomes approximately +1 instead of −1, with few other differences.
In each case, we recalibrate the relative volatilities of the shocks (reported in the last two lines of Ta-
ble A3) to still match the correlations between consumption and net exports and the real exchange rate.

A.10       A model with a financial sector (Section 4.2)
This appendix provides the details for the model of Section 4.2. We discuss here the equations that
change relative to the baseline model summarized in Appendix A.3. This concerns only the blocks 5 and
6, namely the Euler equations and the budget constraints, and additionally it involves the equilibrium
(market clearing) conditions for the financial intermediation sector.
       We start with the home, which now has the following consolidated budget constraint:

                                                        ∗   ∗                              ∗   ∗
  Bt+1 − Rt−1 Bt = N Xt ,          where     N Xt = Et PHt YHt − PF t YF t = PHt YHt + Et PHt YHt − Pt Ct .

Since home households can trade only the home currency bond, their intertemporal optimization is
characterized by a single Euler equation:
                                                                                     −σ
                                                                               Ct+1          Pt
                        Rt Et Θt+1 = 1,          where          Θt+1 = β                         .
                                                                                Ct          Pt+1

The log linearization of these two conditions results in:

                                      βbt+1 − bt = nxt ,                                                           (A88)
                                                 it = Et {σ∆ct+1 − ∆pt+1 },

both equations exactly as before.73 Given that the static relationship in the model are unchanged, we
still have as in (25) that nxt = γλ2 et with λ2 defined in (A66).
       The foreign households differ only in that the profits and losses of the noise traders and arbitrageurs
are transferred to them, but that constitutes a second order term, which vanishes in the log linearization.
Specifically, we have the two parallel equations for foreign:

                   ∗        ∗                                                          Et−1
                  Bt+1 − Rt−1   Bt∗ = N Xt∗ + R̃t (Nt∗ + Dt∗ ),             ∗
                                                                     R̃t ≡ Rt−1 − Rt−1      ,
                                                                                        Et

The log-linearization of the former results in βb∗t+1 − b∗t = nx∗t , since in steady state both R̃ = 0 and
N ∗ = D∗ = 0, and hence the transfer term is second order. Also note that this log-linearized equation
is equivalent to (A88), since by definition N Xt∗ = −Et N Xt and from market clearing Bt+1
                                                                                       ∗   = −Et Bt+1
(see below), and hence we drop it from the equilibrium system (Walras law). The log linearization of
the second conditions is, as before:

                                             i∗t = Et {∆c∗t+1 − ∆p∗t+1 }.

                                                                                   ∗
       Finally, we turn to the financial market clearing Bt+1 +Nt+1 +Dt+1 = 0 and Bt+1    ∗ + D∗
                                                                                       + Nt+1  t+1 = 0.
These conditions imply that, given that noise traders and arbitrageurs both hold zero-capital positions

ities of home: Et Bt+1 = −Bt+1 . Therefore, in light of the exogenous demand of noise traders (45) and
optimal demand of the arbitrageurs (46), we have the following market clearing condition:

Using the fact that

we rewrite this condition as:

Using the facts that in steady state R∗ = 1/β, E = 1, B = 0, ψ = 0 and i − i∗ − ∆e = 0, we obtain
the approximation:74

                                          and σe2 ≡ vart (∆et+1 ), which after rearranging results in the UIP

                                          it − i∗t − Et ∆et+1 = χ1 ψt − χ2 bt+1 ,                                      (A89)

where
                                            n/β                                 Ȳ

       Now combing (A88) and (A89) together with the static equilibrium relationships of net exports and
nominal interests with the exchange rate (which are unchanged, and as derived in Appendix A.3.2), we
obtain the dynamic equilibrium system:
                                                           χ1           χ2

where we again assume that the exogenous shock follows an AR(1):

                                       ψt = ρψt−1 + εt ,           εt ∼ iid(0, σε2 ).                                  (A92)

Note that this system takes the one in the baseline model as a special case as χ2 → 0, and it generalizes
it by allowing for χ2 > 0. Note also the additional complication that the χ1 , χ2 coefficients depend
on the equilibrium volatility of the nominal exchange rate innovations, which needs to be taken into
account in the solution.
       We now prove a generalization of Lemma A2 in Appendix A.5 for the model’s extension with a
  74
     This can be viewed as a log-linear approximation under an asymptotics where σe2 is first order in the size of the shocks,
as for example can be the case when the number of arbitrageurs m decreases with the volatility of the shocks.

with the property that 0 < ζ1 ≤ 1 and             β   ≤ ζ2 < ∞, with the two equalities obtaining iff κ → 0
(i.e., χ2 → 0). Furthermore, the Vieta’s formulas imply ζ1 ζ2 = 1/β and ζ1 + ζ2 = 1 + κ + 1/β, which
we conveniently use below.
                                                                            ζ2 − β1 ,    κ

    The left eigenvector of A associated with ζ2 > 1 is v2 =                             β    . Therefore, the cointegration
relationship between the variables is (see proof of Lemma A2):

                                                   κ/β             1
                                           et +           b̂t =        ψ̂t ,
                                                  ζ2 − β1       ζ2 − ρ

or equivalently using the Vieta’s formulas:

                                            1                    βζ1
                                     et +     (1 − βζ1 )b̂t =           ψ̂t ,
                                            β                 1 − βζ1 ρ

Combining with the second equation of the system, this yields the solution for b̂t+1 :

                                            1                        βζ1
                                  b̂t+1 =     b̂t + et = ζ1 b̂t +           ψ̂t .
                                            β                     1 − βζ1 ρ

Together with the definitions of b̂t+1 and ψ̂t , this yields the solution in Lemma A3. Since ψt follows an
AR(1), bt+1 follows an AR(2) with roots ζ1 and ρ.

and therefore et+1 follows an ARMA(2,1) with AR roots ζ1 and ρ and an MA root 1/β.
    Note that as χ2 → 0, we have κ → 0, ζ1 → 1 and ζ2 → 1/β, and therefore the stationary
solutions AR(2) and ARMA(2,1) become integrated solutions of Lemma A2, namely ARIMA(1,1,0) and
ARIMA(1,1,1).
    Lastly, we characterize the equilibrium volatility of the innovation of the nominal exchange rate.

                                                    ζ2 − ρ = d · σe .

This is because ζ2 → 1/β as σe → 0 and ζ2 is convex in σe for σe > 0, and dˆ is the unique value at
which dσˆ e and ζ2 − ρ are tangent (see Figure A6). One of these two solutions has the property that
∂σe /∂d > 0, and we select this solution as economically meaningful. One can rationalize this solution
as stable by introducing explicit dynamics of entrepreneur’s entry. More importantly, this solution
becomes the unique non-zero solution of (A95) in the limit βρ → 1, as in this limit (ζ2 − ρ)|σe =0 → 0,
hence dˆ → 0 and the other non-zero root merges with σe = 0 root. 

Figure 2       plots impulse responses of the nominal exchange rate et+j to the innovation in it − i∗t for
j ≥ 0 obtained from a model with a financial sector, both its single-ψt -shock version and the multi-
shock version    describe in Section 4.2. For the single shock case, we construct this impulse response
           ∂(it −i∗t )
         .
   ∂et+j
as ∂εt        ∂εt , where εt is the innovation of the ψt process (23), the only source of innovations in
this version of the model. Given the closed-form solutions for both the nominal exchange rate and the
interest rate differential, this impulse response is analytical. In fact, since (42) still holds in this model,
           ∂(it −i∗t )        γλ1
we have       ∂εt        =   1+γλ1 , and therefore the impulse response of the exchange rate to the innovation in
the interest rate is simply the impulse response of exchange rate to εt , as characterized by (48), scalled
      γλ1
by   1+γλ1 .
     Next, consider the multi-shock version. In this case, the innovation to it − i∗t comes from a combi-
nation of shocks, and we define the impulse response as follows:
                                                     ,
                        et+j
                               X            ∂et+j       X             ∂(it − i∗t )
                   IRFit −i∗ =                  z σz                               σz ,
                            t      z∈{ψ,a,ξ} ∂εt            z∈{ψ,a,ξ}    ∂εzt

where z indexes the shocks (ψt , at , ξt ), εzt is the innovation of respective shock, and σz2 is its vari-
ance. Therefore, the standard-deviation-weighted response of it − i∗t to the innovations in the model.
We calculate this impulse response numerically, by simulating (it − i∗t ) and the time path {et+j }j≥0
10,000 times for random draws of {εzt }z∈{ψ,a,ξ} with all other innovations set to zero, and taking

Figure 3       The empirical impulse response functions in Figure 3 are calculated following closely Engel
(2016) and Valchev (2016). The data used is for US vs trade-weighted average of Canada, France, Ger-
many, Italy, Japan and UK, using monthly data from 1979:06 to 2009:10 provided by Engel (2016). As a
result, the empirical impulse response in Figure 3a reproduces exactly that in Figure 2 of Engel (2016),
while the empirical impulse response in Figure 3b differs slightly from that in Figure 2 in Valchev (2016)
due to the difference in the dataset, yet the results are consistent qualitatively. The same procedures
are applied to calculating impulse response in the model-generated data.
     The impulse response in Figure 3a plots δj for j ≥ 1, which are obtained as coefficients from the

                                     Figure A7: Impulse response of ρt+j to it − i∗t
Note: this Figure complements Figure 3a, and plots the impulse response for the ex post realized UIP deviations ρt+j =
it+j−1 − i∗t+j−1 − ∆et+j , instead of Et ρt+j , reproducing Figure 4 in Engel (2016), as described below.

                                          Et ρt+j = ζj + δj (it − i∗t ) + ut+j ,

where ρt+j = it+j−1 − i∗t+j−1 − ∆et+j is the ex post one-period UIP deviation (risk premium) at t + j
and its conditional expectation Et ρt+j is constructed using a VEC model for nominal exchange rate,
price differential and nominal interest rate differential between countries, as described in detail in Engel
(2016). In Figure A7 we plot a similar impulse for realized UIP deviations ρt+j , that is obtained from
the following regression:
                                           ρt+j = ζj + δj (it − i∗t ) + ut+j ,

as in Figure 4 in Engel (2016). The impulse response in Figure 3b plots δj for j ≥ 0 from:

                                         et+j − et = ζj + δj (it − i∗t ) + ut+j ,

where δ0 = 0 by construction.

Additional moments         Table A2 reports two correlations — corr(et , it − i∗t ) and corr(∆et , ∆it − ∆i∗t )
— calculated both in the data (provided in Engel 2016, as descried above) and for different model spec-
ifications. In the data, both correlations are mildly negative. We consider four model specifications:
  (1) multi-shock NOEM (corresponding to column 5 of Table 2) — both correlations are positive;
  (2) multi-shock IRBC (column 6 of Table 2) — first correlation is positive, second is negative;
  (3) single-ψt -shock model with a financial sector — both correlations are strongly positive;
  (4) multi-shock model with a financial sector (column 7 of Table 2) — both correlations are mildly
       negative, as in the data.
Thus, Table A2 shows how a multi-shock model with a financial sector reproduces the empirical un-
conditional correlation moments in addition to the projection coefficients reported in Figure 3.

A.11          Additional extensions
We consider three additional extensions:
       1. Decreasing returns to scale. For tractability, the baseline model assumes constant returns to
         scale in production, which allows to solve for prices as a function of exchange rate and exogenous
         shocks, independently from quantities. We relax this assumption and show that qualitatively
         decreasing returns to scale act similarly to a higher Frisch elasticity ν, and quantitatively both
         have only very mild effects on the properties of the model (see Appendix A.5.2). The detailed
         results are available from the authors upon request.
       2. GHH preferences. The baseline model adopts the separable constant-elasticity utility in con-
         sumption and labor, for which the parameter σ acts simultaneously as the inverse intertemporal
         elasticity of substitution in dynamic decisions and the income effect elasticity in labor supply.
         We consider instead the GHH preference specification with no income effect on labor supply
         to explore robustness of our qualitative and quantitative results to this feature of the transmis-
         sion mechanism. We show that the results remain robust qualitatively, and the only quantitative
         differences result in higher volatilities of the interest rates, consumption and output, slightly de-
         teriorating the quantitative performance of the model. The detailed results are available from the
         authors upon request.
       3. A model with capital. For simplicity, the baseline model abstracts from capital and dynamic in-
         vestment decisions, to reduce the state space to a single net foreign asset variable. Below we show
         the robustness of our conclusions in Sections 3–4 to the introduction of capital accumulation.

A model with capital
Setup         We assume that firms rent capital from households, who in turn make the investment decisions.
Capital is produced from country-specific consumption good with one period lag and potentially sub-
ject to capital adjustment costs. We continue to assume that only foreign bond is traded internationally,
while domestic bond and capital stocks are traded only by local agents. Below we formulate optimiza-
tion problems of home agents and derive equilibrium conditions in log-linear form.

Households         The problem of Home household now includes the choice of capital investment:

where κ is adjustment cost parameter and returns on capital RtK are in units of the final good. Labor
supply and demand for bonds remain the same as in the baseline model and can be written in linearized

which equalizes costs of investment with expected future returns and a change in adjustment costs in
the future.     In steady state, this optimality condition pins down the rate of return on capital:

Firms       The pricing block of the equilibrium system remains unchanged except for the marginal costs.
Assume that production function is Cobb-Douglas with a share φ1 spent on intermediates. Out of the
remaining 1 − φ1 part, φ2 is the capital share and 1 − φ2 is the labor share. We choose steady state
productivity level so that marginal costs and prices are equal 1. Log-linear approximation to the pricing
block is then:
                                   pt = (1 − γ) pHt + γpF t ,
                              pHt = (1 − α) mct + αpt ,
                                  pF t = (1 − α) (mc∗t + et ) + αpt ,
                              mct = φ1 pt + (1 − φ1 ) φ2 rtK + (1 − φ1 ) (1 − φ2 ) wt − at .

Market clearing          The market clearing conditions are more involved since we now have an additional
market for capital:
      • demand for labor: wt + lt = yt + mct
      • demand for capital: rtK + pt + kt = yt + mct
      • goods market equilibrium now includes investment demand and adjustment costs in addition to
          consumption and intermediates. For example, home demand for domestic goods is:
                                               "                        2 #
                                                              κ    It
                           YHt = (1 − γ) e−γξt Ct + Xt + It +         − δ Kt .

      With a slight adjustment in notation, we use rt in this section to denote the nominal interest rate, with it now used for
the log-deviation of investment.

      Up to the first order approximation, adjustment costs are equal zero, and therefore:

                                   ∗
              yt = (1 − γ) yHt + γyHt ,
           yHt = −γξt − θ (pHt − pt ) + (1 − φ1 ) (ςct + (1 − ς) it ) + φ1 (yt + mct − pt ) ,
            ∗
           yHt = (1 − γ) ξt∗ − θ (p∗Ht − p∗t ) + (1 − φ1 ) (ςc∗t + (1 − ς) i∗t ) + φ1 (yt∗ + mc∗t − p∗t ) ,
                                                         
              C̄                                    δφ2
      where   Ȳ
                   = (1 − φ1 ) ς = (1 − φ1 ) 1 −    R̄K
                                                              . When capital share in production goes to zero,
      i.e. φ2 = 0, we get the same market clearing conditions as in the baseline model.
The last dynamic equation is country’s budget constraint:

                                                           1 − φ1
where b∗t is a net foreign asset position of the Home country and nxt = p∗Ht + yHt
                                                                                ∗ +e −p
                                                                                    t  F t − yF t is
its net export. Finally, a log-linear approximation to the GDP is
                                                                     γ
                                  gdpt = ςct + (1 − ς) it +               nxt .
                                                                   1 − φ1

Calibration    All parameters from the benchmark model take the same values. Following the previous
literature, we choose capital share in value added to be equal 0.3 and the quarterly depreciation rate
of 0.02, which implies steady state capital-to-GDP ratio of 5. Adjustment cost parameter is calibrated
together with relative volatilities of the shocks to match the relative volatility of investment in addition
to exchange rate correlation with consumption and net exports.

Effect from capital    It is convenient to separate the effect of capital on the economy into static and dy-
namic components. In the extreme case when adjustment costs go to infinity, the capital stock becomes
constant. As a result, dynamic effect of capital vanishes. However, the presence of capital in production
function implies that the technology exhibits decreasing returns to scale in labor. As we discuss above,
decreasing returns to scale have similar implications as a higher Frisch elasticity of labor supply (with
mild consequences for the quantitative performance of the model). In addition, when adjustment costs
are finite, there is also a dynamic effect of capital coming from the intertemporal investment choice of
households and time-varying stock of capital, a new state variable.

Results   The process for exchange rate can be derived following the same steps as in the baseline case.
The main difference is that we now have two states (NFA and capital) and two controls (exchange rate
and consumption). It can be shown that for economically meaningful parameter values, the system has
two eigenvalues greater than one (one of which is 1/β as in the baseline model), one eigenvalue smaller
than one and one unit eigenvalue. It follows that each of the state variables follows ARIMA(2,1,1)
processes, in contrast with the ARIMA(1,1,0) process for the NFA position in the baseline model.
    In turn, exchange rate, being a linear function of the two state variables and financial shock, follows
an ARIMA(2,1,2) process. Thus, the introduction of capital as an endogenous state variable increases
the order of the stochastic process for exchange rate in the similar way as additional exogenous shocks

                                                      83
in the baseline model. Importantly, the process remains integrated and indistinguishable from a random
walk in the finite-sample numerical simulations of the calibrated model.
       We further show that the introduction of capital does not affect the qualitative or quantitative
properties of the model with respect to the behavior or real exchange rate and terms of trade. In
particular, the real exchange rate still follows closely the volatile and persistent nominal exchange rate
process, with the capital state variable introducing only a mild wedge in the relative dynamics of the
two variables.
       What concerns the exchange rate correlations with respectively the relative consumption (Backus-
Smith) and the relative interest rates (Fama Forward Premium), the results in the model are no longer
analytical, yet we show quantitatively that the calibrated model with realistic adjustment costs (cali-
brated to match the volatility of investment relative to the real exchange rate) is able to match both
correlations (despite a somewhat different transmission mechanism for the interest rates). In addition,
the model matches the empirical negative correlation between relative investment and exchange rate
changes (similar pattern as with consumption), another moment at odds with both productivity and
monetary shocks. Further detailed derivations and quantitative results are available from the authors
upon request.

A.12       Data appendix
Data sources for moments used in Tables 2, 4 and A1:
   1. Persistence and volatility of nominal and real exchange rates: from Meese and Rogoff (1983) and
         survey by Rogoff (1996).
   2. Moments for terms of trade and producer-price real exchange rate: from Table 1 in Atkeson and
         Burstein (2008), based on manufacturing prices and estimated for annual differences and HP-
         filtered quarterly data, 1975-2006.
   3. Moments for consumption, investment and GDP: estimates by the authors. The data is for France,
         Germany, Italy and Spain from 1973 to 2000, quarterly.76 We take first log differences for each se-
         ries, calculate a weighted average across countries and take the difference with the corresponding
         series for the U.S. The weights are proportional to the PPP-adjusted GDP averaged across years.
         We prefer first-differenced moments, but the results are robust to HP-filtering.
   4. Moments for net exports: estimates by the authors. Quarterly data for the U.S. versus the rest of
         the world, 1980 - 2015.
   5. Slope coefficient β and R2 in Fama regression: survey by Engel (1996) and recent estimates by
         Burnside, Han, Hirshleifer, and Wang (2011, Table 1) and Valchev (2016, Table B.1).
   6. Volatility and persistence of the interest rate differential: estimates by the authors. Monthly data
         for the U.S. versus the U.K., France, Germany and Japan from 1979:06 to 2009:10.
  76
    Our data goes through 2015, but we choose the pre-2000 subperiod to be consistent quantitatively with the moments
reported in the earlier literature, as in the more recent period the correlation between relative consumption growth and real
exchange rate changes became less negative.



                                                             84
  Note: the interest rates for individual countries have autocorrelation of 0.97 − 0.99, while the
  autocorrelation for the interest rate differentials is lower, at 0.85−0.90. In the model of Section 3,
  ρ corresponds to the persistence of both the level it and the differential (it − i∗t ). In the multi-
  shock models of Section 4, we set ρ = 0.97 to target ρ(it − i∗t ) = 0.90.
7. Carry trade Sharpe ratio: the estimates for the forward premium trade from Hassan and Mano
  (2014, Table 2) .
8. Profits volatility (omitted from the tables for brevity): estimates by the authors. Quarterly data
  for the U.S., 1973 - 2015. We divide seasonally adjusted corporate profits (before taxes) by the
  seasonally adjusted nominal GDP, calculate the standard deviation of the first differences of this
  series and divide it by the standard deviation of changes in exchange rate.
