             Government Spending, Interest Rates, Prices and
             Budget Deficits in the United Kingdom, 1701-1918


                                    ABSTRACT

    The British data from the early 1700s through World War I provide an

unmatched opportunity for studying the effects of temporary changes in

government purchases. In this paper I examine the effects of these changes

on interest rates, the quantity of money, the price level, and     budget
deficits. Temporary increases in government purchases—showing up in the

sample as increases in military outlays during wartime—bad positive effects

on long—term interest rates. The effect on the growth rate of money (bank

notes) was positive only during the two periods of suspension of the gold

standard (1797-1821 and 1914-1918). As long as convertibility of bank notes

into specie was maintained, there was no systematic relation of government

spending to monetary growth. Similarily, the main interplay between

temporary government spending and inflation occurred during the periods of

suspension. Temporary changes in military spending accounted for the bulk of

budget deficits from the early 1700s through 1918. This association explains

the main increases in the ratio of the public debt to GNP, as well as the

decreases that typically occurred during peacetime. Over the sample of more

than two hundred years, I found only two examples of major budget deficits

that were unrelated to wartime—one associated with compensation payments to

slaveowners in 1835—36 and   the   other with a political dispute over the income

tax in 1909—10. Because of the "exogeneity" of these deficits, it is

interesting that interest rates showed no special movements at these times.

    Fluctuations in government purchases influence the economy in numerous

ways. There are effects on, real interest rates, and on the quantities of

output, consumption, and investment. There are direct effects on the price

level, as well as indirect effects through the interplay with monetary

growth. There are also effects on the current—account balance and on budget

deficits, which may have additional influences on the economy.

    In this paper I follow Benjamin and Kochin (1984) by using the British

data from the start of the eighteenth century through World War I to study

some of the economic effects of government purchases. In practice the main

evidence comes from the variations in military spending that are associated

with war arid peace. One attraction of the sample—from a scientific

viewpoint—is that it features numerous wars of varying sizes. Fortunately.

there are also usable data for long periods on interest rates, price levels,

a narrow monetary aggregate, and budget deficits.

    Section 1 deals with interest rates. After developing a theoretical

model, I study the effect of temporary military spending on long—term

interest rates. Section 2 investigates the effects of military spending on

the price level and the quantity of money. Section 3 explores the relation

between military spending and budget deficits.



1. Covernment Purchases and Interest Rates

a. Theoretical Considerations

   A number of existing analyses (Hall, 1980; Barro, 198lb, 1987, Chapter

12; Judd, 1985) discuss the effect of temporary government purchases on real

interest rates. The simplest case is for government consumption expenditure

that does not substitute directly for private spending. If an increase in
                                                                            2


government purchases is temporary, households permanent income falls by less

than one—to—one. Accordingly, consumer demand tends to decline by less thai-i

the increase in purchases, and the aggregate demand for goods rises. There

is a corresponding excess of investment demand over desired national saving,

which means—in a closed economy—that the real interest rate must increase.

When the Ricardian view of the public debt is valid—so that households view

taxes and deficits as equivalent—this result obtains independently of

whether the temporary spending is financed by taxes or debt. The same

conclusion holds also in the case of monetary finance as long as changes in

monetary growth do not have major effects on real interest rates.

    The tendency for temporary government purchases to raise real interest

rates still follows if government consumption substitutes for private

consumption, as long as this substitution is less than one for one.

Similarly, one can allow for an effect of public services on private

production functions, and hence on the supply of goods. Finally, the

increase in real interest rates applies as well to the case of public

investment, which may substitute imperfectly for private investment.

    The basic idea is that a higher real interest rate is the appropriate

price signal when the government's demand for goods is temporarily high.1

This signal motivates people to demand less goods today (for consumption and

investment) and supply more goods today (by working harder and by using

existing capital more intensively). Thus the tendency to substitute




'With an open economy the effect shows up partly in borrowing from abroad and
partly in a higher real interest rate. I do not consider the effects on the
current—account balance in this paper. See Ahmed (1986) for this type of
analysis.
                                                                             3


intertemporally buffers the shock from the government's unusual demand for

goods.

    Benjamin and Kochin (1984, pp. 595-96) point out that temporary

government purchases, such as in wartime, affect the term structure of real

interest rates. For example, suppose that a war starts today and everyone

knows that it will last for one year. The response of the private market is

to substitute intertemporally between the period of high government demand,

which is the current year, and the normal period after the end of the war.

Therefore, there is an increase in real interest rates with maturity greater

than one year. But today's short—term real interest rates (of maturity less

than one year) apply to an interval over which the government's demands are

uniformly high. Since there is no motivation to substitute over time within

the one—year period, there is no apparent upward pressure on short—term

rates.

    Figure 1 illustrates these results for a closed economy. Suppose that a

war starts as a surprise at date t1, and that the ratio of spending to CNP,

    rises from g2 to gwa'• Suppose further that the spending ratio

remains constant during the war, then falls back to the value gPea at date

   when the war ends. Finally, assume that the duration of the war—that is,

the date t2—is known as of date t1.

    Consider a model where the representative individual has an infinite

horizon with the constant rate of time preference on utility equal to p.

(For an exposition, see for example, Barro, 1987, Ch. 11.) In the steady

state of this economy (with no growth in real income or population), the real

interest rate equals p. At this point each individual is satisfied with
                                                                              4


constant consumption over time. Figure 1 assumes that the interest rate

R_aPplYing to short—term (instantaneous) loans—is at the value p before

date t1. If there are no storable (investment) goods, then consumption (or

leisure) must fall to match the increase in        at date t1. Then consumption

remains constant at this depressed level during the war. Since consumption

is constant—although at a lower level than before—during the war, the

instantaneous interest rate       must still be equal to p. Therefore, the path

shown for R in Figure 1 shows no change at date t1 or afterwards during the
       2
war.

       At date t2 the drop in   allows consumption to return to the higher

level associated with peacetime. Since people anticipate the drop in          an

equilibrium requires R at time t =          to be high enough to motivate people
                                       t2
to plan for a discrete upward jump in consumption. In the present (extreme)

context, this requires the instantaneous interest rate to be infinite. Then,

after date t2, consumption is again constant and R = p applies.

       Looking at the situation during the war, where t1 < t < t2, short—term

interest rates are unaffected. However, long—term interest rates would

incorporate the high (infinite for an instant) interest rate at time t2.

Hence, as Benjamin and Kochin suggested, there would be a positive relation

between      and interest rates that applied to a horizon longer than t2—t.

The effect on the yield to maturity would be strongest when the horizon was

only slightly longer than t2—t.


21f the war were anticipated, then people would expect a discrete fall in
consumption at date t1. In that case the instantaneous interest rate would
have to be minus infinity at date t1. However, the present analysis assumes
that the start of the war was a total surprise.

    The sharp distinction between short—term and long—term interest rates

does not hold if there is either uncertainty about the war's duration or if

there are durable (investment) goods around. In these cases temporary

government purchases tend to increase short—term real interest rates, as well

as longer—term rates.

    Figure 2 illustrates the results for a standard one—sector production

function with reproducible (and consumable) capital. The path for R shown

in Figure 1 is no longer an equilibrium because investors would want to

liquidate their capital stocks just before date t2. In the new equilibrium

the wartime spending must crowd out some investment, as well as consumption,

prior to date t2. As the capital stock falls, the interest rate rises to

match the rising marginal product of capital. The interest rate peaks at

date t2—thereafter, the rate falls as the capital stock is rebuilt.3

    One implication from the extension to include investment is that the

current short—term interest rate,       depends positively on current and

lagged values of        The lagged values matter because they led to reductions

in the capital stock and thereby to a higher current marginal product of

capital. Future values of      also matter—however, the effect on current

short—term interest rates is negative, whereas that on current long rates is

uncertain (because future short rates rise).




3The level of consumption falls discretely at date t1, then grows as long as
R > p. Assuming that utility is isoelastic with respect to consumption (and
neglecting effects on leisure), the fastest growth rate of consumption occurs
at date t2. However, the pre—war level of consumption is reattained only
asymptotically as R approaches p.

    In this study I use wartime as an observable example of temporary

government expenditure. There are other aspects of wars that can affect real

interest rates, such as the prospect of victory or defeat. These prospects

affect the default premium on bonds, and also influence desired saving and

investment. To the extent that defeat threatens property rights, there are

downward effects on desired investment and saving, which have an ambiguous

net effect on real interest rates. Also, direct wartime controls can

substitute for movements in interest rates as a device for crowding—out

private spending. Then the observed response in interest rates will be

weaker than otherwise. For the British case examined here, this aspect of a

command economy would be important mainly during World War I (see Pollard,

1969, Chapter II).



b. The tta for the United Kingdom

    Thus far, there is little evidence from the U.S. time series that

verifies a positive effect of temporary government purchases on real interest

rates—see Barro (1981a; 1987, Chapter 12) and Plosser (1982). But, as

stressed by Benjamin and Kochin (1984), the long—term British data are

especially promising for isolating this effect if it exists. Especially

during the eighteenth century and through 1815, the United Kingdom was

involved in numerous wars, which provide for substantial temporary variations

in government purchases. Further, until World War I, the economy was free of

most other governmental interventions, such as extensive price and

interest—rate controls, which often accompany wars.

   Figure 3 shows the ratio of real military spending to trend GNP for the

United Kingdom from 1701 to 1920. Real military spending is nominal spending

divided by an index of wholesale prices.4 Trend real GNP comes from a trend

 line through the data on real CNP, using one growth rate (.55% per year) from

 1700 to 1770, and another (2.18% per year) from 1771 to l938.

    A quick examination of Figure 3 reveals the peaks associated with the

eight major wars from 1701 to 1920 (treating the wars with France from 1793

to 1815 as one event). These wartime periods provide the main evidence about

the effects of temporarily high government purchases. In particular, there

are no comparable variations in non—military spending over the sample period

(except for the transfer payments in 1835, which are discussed in

Section 4)6

    The other suggestion from Figure 3 is the absence of permanent changes in

the ratio of military spending to GM', at least up to 1920. This property


4The data on military expenditure are from Mitchell and Deane (1962, pp.
390—91, 396—99). The figures combine the items for army, navy and ordnance,
and for expenditures on special expeditions and votes of credit. The dating
of expenditures refers to disbursements rather than orders (see Benjamin and
Kochin, 1984, p. 602, n.6). For 172i)-51 the fiscal-year data ended September
29 were treated as calendar year numbers. The same procedure was used for
1752—99, where the fiscal year ended on October 10. For 1801—54 the fiscal
year figures ended January 5 were treated as applying to the previous
calendar year. For 1855—1919, the fiscal—year data ended March 31 were also
viewed as covering the prior calendar year. The data on wholesale prices are
from Mitchell and Dean (1962, pp. 469-70, 474. 476). The series is a linking
together of the following wholesale price indexes: 1871—1920, Board of Trade
total index of wholesale priàes; 1850—70, Sauerbeck—Statist overall index;
1790—1849, Gayer, Rostow and Schwartz index of domestic arid imported
commodities; 1700-89, Schumpeter—Cilboy index of consumer goods.

5The data on real GNP are from Feinstein (1972, pp. 14. T1O, 114, 118) for
1856-1918. For 1830-55. the data are from Deane (1968, pp. 104, 106).
Before 1830 there are estimates at 10—year intervals in Deane and Cole (1967.
pp. 78, 282).

6Except for 1835 non—military expenditures of the central government remained
between 2 and 3% of trend GNP from 1801 to 1900. See Mitchell and Deane
(1962, pp. 396-98) for the data. These expenditures reached 4% of trend GNP
in the early 1900s, but then fell back to 2% during World War I.
                                                                             8


means that the raw movements in the spending ratio,     correspond to values
of the ratio that are temporarily high or low. Hence, the sample will not be

useful in identifying the economic effects of permanent changes in governnient

purchases. In the next section I model the stochastic process for      in

order to isolate the temporary part of this variable—that is, the departure

of     from some concept of a "normal" value. It is this temporary part that

has the effects on real interest rates shown in Figures 1 and 2. However, as

suggested by inspection of Figure 3, the normal spending ratio changes little

over time. Therefore, for explaining the changes in interest rates or other

variables, the variable     turns out to do about as well as my constructed

measure of temporary spending.

     Table 1 shows the values of the military spending ratio for the eight

main wars during the sample period. (This tabulation neglects a large number

of small conflicts—in India, China, Afghanistan. Africa, Burma, etc.—that

peaceloving Britain pursued, but which have insubstantial effects on the

military spending ratio.) Note from the table that the value of the spending

ratio (relative to its mean of 6.7%) ranges from a high of 49% during World

War I (1916) to 16% in the Seven—Year's War (1761). 10% for the American

Revolution (1782), 9% during the Napoleonic Wars (1814), 6% for the War of

the Austrian Succession (1748), 5% for the War of the Spanish Succession

(1707), 3% for the Boer War (1901), and 1% during the Crimean War (1855).

Some comparable values for the U.S. are 20% for World War I (1918). 34% for

World War II (1944). and 2% for the Korean War (1952) (see Barro, 1986,

Table 3).

     For the long—term interest rate I use the yield on consols (or on the

comparable perpetual annuities for 1729—52), which is available continuously

        • percentage change in the wholesale price index. These changes apply from the
         year before each war to the final full year of the war.

since l729. These government bonds are perpetuities, except that they were

redeemable at par   after a   stated number of years. The theory implies that

temporary government spending would have    a positive   effect on these interest

rates. Empirically, the broad nature of this relation is evident from Figure

4. Note that, over the period from 1729 to 1918.8 the interest rate (solid

line) appears to rise along with the spending ratio (dotted line).

    Table 1 reports the changes in the long—term interest rate during each of

the major wars. These changes are all positive and in excess of 1 percentage

point in five of the eight cases. Since the standard deviation of the annual

first difference of the interest rate from 1730 to 1918 is .26 percentage

points, these five cases involve increases in interest rates that are 5 to 7

times this standard deviation. (The sample     mean of   the interest rate from

1729 to 1918 is 3.54Z.)

    A usable series on short—term interest rates is unavailable for the full

sample. Most short—term interest rates, including the Bank of England's bank

rate, were subject to a usury ceiling of 5% from 1714 until 1833. This

ceiling was an effective constraint until at least 1817. (See Homer, 1977,

pp. 163—65, 205—08.) If the sample started in 1817 or later, then much of




7The data are from Homer (1977, pp. 156, 161—62, 195-97, 416). The yields
apply to 3% annuities or consols until 1888, and to 2—1/2% consols
thereafter. The possibility that the 3% consols would be redeemed at par
implies that the yields on these instruments were misleadingly high after
1888.

8i terminate the sample in 1918 because non—military government spending
begins to become important after World War I, and because different
accounting conventions apply thereafter to the breakdown between military and
non—military spending. However, it would be possible to extend the sample
beyond 1918.

the action in the government spending variable would be lost (see Figure 1).

Thus I do not report results with short—term interest rates in this paper.

    The interest rate data measure nominal rates rather than the expected

real rates that matter theoretically. The actual inflation rate averaged

0.4X per year from 1701 to 1918 and 0.1% per year from 1701 to 1913. It may

be that the long—term expected rate of inflation was also stable and close to

zero. However, the analysis in section 2 indicates that these long—term

expectations depend on long—term assessments about remaining on (or in some

intervals returning to) the gold standard. Possible changes in the price of

gold—which aid not occur to a significant extent over the sample

period—iriight also come into play. Therefore, I cannot rule out the

possibility that some of the observed variations in interest rates represent

changes in long—term inflationary expectations, rather than movements in real

interest rates.



c. Temporary Military Spending

    In this section I model the stochastic process generating the military

spending ratio,     and use the results to construct a measure of temporary

spending. The first difference of     is satisfactorily modeled with

second—order autoregressive and moving—average terms—that is,      is an ARIMA

(2, 1, 2) process. This process captures the temporary, but serially

correlated, aspects of wartime, and also allows for the possibility of

pernønent shifts in the spending ratio. The fitted equation from 1704 to

1918 is
                                                                                         11

(The Q—statistic with 10 lags is 3.1, 5% critical value of 12.6.) If a

constant is added to equation (1). its estimated coefficient is .002.             s.e.    =

.008—hence, there is no evidence of drift in the ratio of spending to GNP.
   Since the coefficients of the two moving—average terms in equation (1)

sum nearly to —1, the results are similar in level form for g:'°

                           a = .026,       R2 =   .88.



Thus, as suggested by inspection of Figure 1.            may be stationary in levels.

For subsequent purposes I use the first—difference specification in equation

(1), although the results would be similar with equation (2).

   Using equation (1) and the estimated values of the residuals, e. it is

possible to form "forecasts" of        for any date t and forecast horizon i.




9The sum is .99, but with an estimated standard error of .39.

°The MA (1) coefficient of .25 probably appears because                    is a

time—averaged measure of military spending.

Thereby one can measure the "permanent" ratio of spending to CNP11 as



                  (3)       = (1 —
                                     o)•( + 6g1 + 62g2 + ...)

where the superscript e denotes a forecast, arid 6 is a constant discount
factor such that 1 — 6 is approximately equal to the difference between the

real interest rate and the growth rate of real GNP. (The constancy of 6 is

only an approximation.) For the British case the long—term real interest

rate (from 1729 to 1913) averaged 3.5%, while the growth rate of real CNP

(from 1730 to 1913) averaged 1.8%. Therefore. 6 should be about 0.98.

       Hansen and Sargent (1981, p. 260) provide a formula that can be modified

to calculate       for a given value of 6 and for the set of ARMA coefficients

estimated in equation (1). In the present case the process for
                                                                        —         in
                                                      —        is close to zero for
equation (1) damps out fast enough so that

I greater than about 10 years. Therefore, as long as 6 is reasonably close

to one (that is, if the discount rate per year is not too large), the measure

of       is not very sensitive to the choice of 6.

       The temporary part of the spending ratio is        =   —      This   variable

is plotted for the value 6 =     .98 as the dotted line in Figure 5. The
resulting series has a similar pattern to that for the raw series            (net of

a constant mean), which is shown as the solid line in Figure 5. Further, the

subsequent findings on interest rates and other variables do not differ

greatly whether one uses        or     as an explanatory variable. This result is

not surprising, since the expectation from examination of Figure 3 was that

permanent movements in the spending ratio would be unimportant relative to

the temporary fluctuations. For this reason I have not carried out further

refinements of the measurement of        (such as estimating equation (1) jointly

with other equations).



d. Formal Results on Iiterest Rates

    I model the determination of the interest rate in the form,



                          (4) R = a0 + a1 + Ut.


where the coefficient a1 is positive. If the error term u were stationary

with an unconditional mean of zero, then a0 would be the long-run mean of the

interest rate. In fact, for Britain from 1729 to 1918—where the continuous

data series is available—the long—term interest rate exhibits nearly

random—walk behavior, although there is some indication of stationarity.

(The consol rate would have to be close to a random walk or else there would

remain either very high or very low expected returns from holding these

long—term bonds over short periods.) I model the error term in equation (4)

by the first—order autoregressive process,



                                                +
                               (5) Ut =   Xu1

where    is white noise, and   the   positive coefficient X is close to but below

unity.
                                                                                             14


    Equations (4) and       (5)    imply that,   aside   from the influence of temporary

military spending, the other determinants of the interest rate. u, are close

to random walks. In the random—walk case where X = 1, equation (4) could be

estimated satisfactorily in first—difference form (with a zero constant).

But if X < 1, then it is appropriate to deal with levels of variables.

    Conditional on the constructed series for                (based on 6 =    .98), the
maximum—likelihood estimates of equations (4) and             (5)   are12

    Over the sample from 1730 to 1913 the estimated coefficient on                       is 6.1,

s.e. =   1.3 ("t—value" relative to 0 of 4.9). The result implies that an
increase   by 1 percentage point in the temporary—spending ratio raises the

long—term interest rate by 6.1 basis points. A graph of R versus                         appears

            Temporary Military Spending and
               the Interest Rate, 1729—1918
                                                                                15


    The estimated value ? =   .909, s.e.   =   .029, implies a "t—value" relative
to the null hypothesis X = 1 of 3.1. Considering the one—sided alternative,

X < 1. this statistic differs significantly from zero at less than the 1%

level using the t—distribution. It is significant at about the 1% level

according to the distribution that is generated by Monte Carlo methods for an

analogous non—stationary model in Fuller (1976, Table 8.5.2, the section for

T). Thus there is some evidence that supports the stationarity of the

long—term interest rate over the period from 1730 to 1913.

    Adding the World War I experience, 1914—18, to the sample in equation (7)

lowers the estimated coefficient on        to 2.6, s.e. =   0.7.13   Although the

interest rate rises from 3.4X in 1913 to 4.6% in 1917—that is, by 1.2

percentage points—the estimated equation (6) would have predicted an

increase by 2.6 points. It may be that the command economy aspects of World

War I, which were mentioned previously, explains the failure of the interest

rate to rise as much as predicted. For this reason, the sample that excludes

World War I in equation (6) may be better than the full sample in equation

(7) for estimating the response of interest rates to temporary spending in a

free—market setting.




13Using a likelihood—ratio test, one can reject at the 5% level the
hypothesis that the data from 1730 to 1913 are generated from the same model
as the data from 1914 to 1918.

      The results differ only slightly if                 is replaced by       as an

explanatory variable.4 For example, over the sample 1730—1913. the results

are

equation (8) is virtually the same as the that in equation (6).

      Because of the cuminulative effect on capital stocks, the theory suggests

that   the   current interest rate, R. also reacts positively to lagged values

Equation (9), based on           shows an influence of five lagged values, although

the negative effects of            and _4 are    hard to explain. Additional lags

are unimportant. Equation (10) shows that the fit based on             is again
similar.



2. Prices and Money

    Benjamin and Kochin (1984, pp. 598-600) argue that temporary military

spending has a positive effect on the general price level in the United

Kingdom. In fact, they argue that the dual influence of war accounts for the

celebrated positive association between the interest rate and the price

level, which is known     as   the Gibson Paradox. However, Barsky and Summers

(1985. Section I) argue that the BenjarninlKochin explanation is inadequate

because the Gibson Paradox applies also during nonwar periods.

    The connection between military spending and the price level is

straightforward under a paper standard where governments use the printing

press to finance wartime expenditures. Although a common view is that

governments shift readily off of commodity standards and toward paper

standards during wartime or other emergencies, this view does not apply to
                                                                               18



the United Kingdom during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The U.K.

was on some form of commodity standard from 1700 to 1931, except for two

instances of suspension of specie payments by the Bank of England. The first

was from 1797 to 1821 and was precipitated by the wars with France (see

Clapham, 1945, volume II, Chapter 1). The second involved a variety of

restrictions on specie payments that began in the middle of 1914 during World

War I (See Sayers. 1976, Ch. 5). In this case the gold standard was not

resumed until 1925. Although financial crises arose at other

times—especially during some wars of the eighteenth century—the suspension

of specie payments did not occur (see Clapham, 1945, volume I, Chapter 7. for

a discussion). Basically, except for the years 1797—1821 and 1914—1925, the

U.K. was on a gold standard from 1700   to   1931. (Until 1821 the system was

formally bimetallic with gold overvalued at the mint—see Del Mar,     1877.)
    Under a gold standard the possibilities for a link between the spending

ratio,     and the price level, P, are limited. Since I measure P by an

index of wholesale prices, the linkage requires an effect of       on the price

of a basket of produced, mainly tradable goods relative to the price of gold.

If increased military purchases imply an increase in the demands for these

goods relative to gold, then the price level would rise.

    Civen the value of      a link between       and the quantity of money, M.

amounts to a link between    and the real demand for money. The overall

effects here are ambiguous. The real demand for money falls because the

interest rate, R. rises. However, wartime may have a direct positive effect

on the demand for money. In addition, if         affects real income, then the

demand for money would change on this count. Empirically, I find no relation
                                                                               19


between        and M for periods where the gold standard was maintained (see

below).

    During periods when the gold standard is suspended, the prediction is

that   a   higher value of      leads to faster rates of growth of money and

prices. This prediction is based on the governments incentive to use the

inflation tax under a paper standard.



a. Results for Money

       I measure the narrow money supply, M. by the quantity of bank

notes—issued solely by the Bank of England from 1729 to 1764 and from 1775

to 1833, and including also the issues by country. Scottish and Irish banks
                      15
from 1834 to 1918.

    The empirical relation of this concept of money to military spending is

illustrated by the following least—squares regressions:

15The data are from Mitchell and Deane, 1962, pp. 441-43, 450—51. Values for
1729 to 1764 refer to August 31 of each year. Those from 1775 to 1833 are
averages of figures from the end of February and the end of August. Values
from 1834 onward are annual averages of monthly or weekly figures. The
available data prior to 1729 are rough estimates. The figures that I found
from 1765 to 1774 are not comparable to those for the other years.

There is a strong positive relation between       and monetary growth during the

periods of suspension (1797—1821, 1914—1918), but no significant relation

during the gold—standard years.16 (The results are essentially the same if

is replaced by    in the regressions.) This finding can also be seen in

Figure 7, which plots the values of log(M) and

    The conclusion is that military spending during wars led to money

creation only if it first led to suspension of the gold standard.

Furthermore, this pressure to suspend was successful only in two cases—the

Napoleonic period and World War I—although the sample includes six other

major wars (see Table 1). It is interesting to conjecture why suspension

occurred when it did—in 1797 and effectively in 1914—and not at other

times. For World War I. the magnitude of military spending is probably a

sufficient explanation (see Table 1). However, through 1797, the ratio of

military spending to CNP—which averaged 10.8% from 1794 to 1797—was less

than that of the Seven Years' War (average of 16.3% from 1757 to 1762), and

similar to that of some other wars (9.0% from 1703 to 1712, 10.0% from 1741

to 1748, and 11.6% from 1776 to 1782). The main distinction of the wars with

France after 1793 was the duration—22 years with only brief

interruptions17—although it is unclear that this length would have been

foreseen in 1797. However it may be that the French Revolution and Napoleon

made the conflicts after 1793 more threatening than the earlier wars. One

other indicator that these conflicts were taken more seriously than the prior

wars was the introduction of new types of taxes—on income and property—in

1799. On the other hand, Clapham's (1945, volume 1, Chapter VII) discussion

of the earlier periods indicates that the Bank of England's reserve of specie

was nearly exhausted in several cases—in 1710, 1745, 1763 and 1783.

Therefore it may be mainly a matter of luck that suspension occurred in 1797

and not at these other times.

18The variable    involves the current value of real spending.           =
where C is nominal spending. Therefore, measurement error in Pt (which           is

likely to be serious here) tends to generate a downward bias in a regression
of log(P/P1) on            Therefore   the results shown in equations (13) and

(14) are instrumental estimates using as an instrument for            the value that

would be calculated if C/P were replaced by C/P1.

insignificant if added to equations (13) or (14).) The results show that the

effect of    on 1og(P/P1) is significantly positive for the suspension

period and just significantly positive for the gold—standard period.

However, the effect is substantially larger for the period of suspension in

equation (13).19 In fact, fluctuations in military spending explain

essentially none of the variations in inflation over the gold—standard

period. Figure 8 shows graphically the relation of log(P) to

    For making long—range forecasts of inflation an important issue is

whether the level of prices is stationary—that is, whether there is a

systematic tendency for the price level to return to a normal value (see

Figure 8). Under the gold standard it is conceivable that the price level

would be stationary. However, in a regression with log(P) as the dependent

variable, I cannot reject at the 5% level the hypothesis that the coefficient




    likelihood—ratio test rejects at less than the 1% level the hypothesis
that the same model for the inflation rate applies over both sub—samples.

1914—1918. Of course, even a finding that the price level was stationary

under the gold standard would not be so useful if there were a nonzero

probability (presumably related to             of shifting to the suspension regime

where the price level was nonstationary.

      The main difficulty in using the results from equations (13) and (14) to

calculate long—term expected inflation is the measurement of the transition

probabilities between the regimes. Although the sample is long, it features

only two suspensions (a third if 1931 were added) and one resumption (a

second if 1925 were included). Hence the sample is still small in this

regard.



3. Budget Deficits

a. Military Spending and Budget Deficits

      In some previous papers I discussed the tax—smoothing theory of

governilient deficits (Barro, 1979, 1986—see also Pigou, 1928, Ch. VI; Kydland

and   Prescott, 1980; and Lucas and Stokey, 1983). Some of the principal

conclusions were the following. First, temporary government spending, as in

wartime, would be financed primarily by budget deficits. Thereby tax rates


20For example, over 1705-1796, 1822—1913, the result of the instrumental
estimation is log(P) = —.009 +             +
                                                .943lo(P...1).   a' =   .063, DW = 1.9.
                            (.008) (.15)       (.032)
The test that the coefficient of log(P1) is unity uses Fuller's (1976, p.
373) distribution, which was discussed before, and applies to the one—sided
alternative that the coefficient is less than one. The same outcome with
respect to stationarity obtains if the additional lagged variable, lo(P2).
is added to the regressions.
                                                                             24


rise uniformly during and after the war, instead of being unusually high

during the war. Second, a permanent increase in the ratio of government

spending to GNP leads to a parallel increase in tax rates, with no increase

in   the   budget deficit. Third, the government runs deficits during recessions

and surpluses in booms to prevent tax rates from being unusually high or low

at these times. Fourth, expected inflation has a one—to—one effect on the

growth rate of the nominal debt. Thereby the planned behavior of the real

debt is invariant with expected inflation. On the other hand, unexpected

inflation does not affect the budget deficit, and therefore impacts in the

opposite direction on the stock of real debt outstanding.

     Empirical results for the United States for the period 1916 to 1983

provided reasonably good estimates for the effects on budget deficits from

business fluctuations and expected inflation (see Barro, 1986). However,

there was less information about the impact of temporary government spending,

which was dominated by the observations for World Wars I and II.

     It is clear from the previous discussion that the long—term British data

are well suited for studying the relation of budget deficits to temporary

military spending. On the other hand, the sample does not permit reliable

estimates of cyclical effects. That is because annual data on GNP are

available only since 1830, and the quality of these data before the middle

1850s is especially uncertain. Further, for reasons mentioned earlier, I

have not yet been able to use the data to assess the effects from changes in

anticipated inflation. Therefore, I focus the present study on the relation

between budget deficits and temporary military spending.

     I calculate the nominal deficit for each year from the difference between

the government's total expenditures (including interest payments) and total
                                                                              25


revenues.2' I then compute a time series for the stock of public debt

outstanding (at "book value") by adding the cumulative deficit to a benchmark

stock of debt from the end of 1700.22 This procedure is necessary because

the reported figures on the stock of public debt treat all numbers as par

values even when new debt is issued or retired at a discount from par. This

problem is especially serious during the Napoleonic Wars and to some extent

during the American Revolution, where large quantities of debt were issued at

a discount to yield about 5% but were carried on the books as though issued
                23
at par (3iC).        Hence the change in the public debt as recorded far exceeded

the true deficit at these times. Then the error was effectively undone later

in the nineteenth century when the old debt was eventually redeemed. Thus,

by World War I (and before the 1770s), the series that I calculate turns out

to be close to the reported numbers on the stock of public debt outstanding.

(However, my series is not a market—value construct, since it does not

consider the changes in market value that occurred subsequent to the issue

date of a security.)

    Figure 9 shows the ratio of the real public debt (the nominal amount from

the start of the year relative to the wholesale price index for the year) to

trend real CNP from 1701 to 1918. The ratio rose from about 25% in 1701 to

70% in 1718 (after the War of the Spanish Succession) and declined during




21The data are from Mitchell and Deane (1962. pp. 386-98). The dating of the
fiscal years corresponds to that for military spending, as discussed in n. 4
above. Civen this correspondence, there is no problem in matching the budget
deficits with the expenditure numbers.

peacetime to less than 50% by the early 1740s. Then the ratio reached 90%

after the War of the Austrian Succession (1750) and 140% after the

Seven-Years' War (1764). Following a decline during peacetime to 100% in

1775. the ratio rose to over 130% after the American Revolution (1785).

After another peacetime decline to less than 90% in 1795, the ratio rose to

nearly 160% at the conclusion of the Napoleonic Wars in 1816, and (with the

sharp decline in the price level) to the all—time peak of 185% in 1822.24

There followed a long peacetime decline—with only minor interruptions from

some small wars—to a low point of 30% in 1914. Then with World War I the

ratio reached 110% in 1918.

     Figure 10 shows more clearly the dominant influence of temporary military

spending on budget deficits. This figure graphs the ratio of the nominal

deficit to trend CNP (trend real CNP multiplied by the wholesale price

index), along with the temporary—spending ratio,         The figure shows that

the relationship is positive and also accounts for the bulk of fluctuations

in the deficit.

24Using the reported figures on the stock of public debt, this peak ratio is
275% rather than 185%. The difference is the extent to which the debt
figures—recorded at par—overstated the deficit during the wartime years.

 equation (15) is a deficit—CNP ratio. The coefficient b0 is the growth rate

 of the nominal debt that occurs when       arid v equal zero. In previous

analysis (Barro. 1979), this rate corresponded to the trend growth rate of

 real GNP plus the rate of expected inflation. That is, when                =
                                                                                v = 0,   the

 current deficit is set so as to maintain constancy over time for the planned

 ratio of the nominal debt to nominal GNP. In the present setting I treat the

parameter b0 as a constant. However, non—constancy of expected inflation

could be one element that generates serial correlation of the error term v

 in equation (15). The omission of cyclical effects, which would themselves

be autocorrelated, could also generate this serial correlation. The

autogressive form of the error process in equation (16) is intended to

account for these effects.

    The estimates of equations (15) and (16) for 1706—1913 are

The first coefficient—.0l3. s.e. = .003—should equal the trend growth rate

of real GNP plus the average rate of expected inflation. In fact, the

average growth rate of real GNP from 1701 to 1913 was 1.6% per year, while

the average rate of change of the wholesale price index was 0.1% per year.

Thus the estimated value of the coefficient on the lagged debt, .013. does

approximate the trend growth rate of real GNP plus the average rate of

inflation.

    The estimated coefficient on     .96,   s.e. =   .04, indicates the fraction

of temporary government spending (as measured) that is financed by deficits.

Note that the estimated coefficient differs significantly from zero, but

insignificantly from unity. The result indicates that temporary military

expenditure was financed by the issue of debt, rather than taxes.27

    The serial correlation coefficient. • =   .76,   s.e. =   .04. presumably picks

up factors such as cyclical fluctuations and persisting variations in

expected inflation. Thus far, I have no detailed results on these elements.




    have not allowed for different coefficients in different sub—periods.
although the average growth rate of real CNP from 1701 to 1770 (0.5% per
year) was well below that from 1770 to 1913 (2.1% per year).
27For much of the sample the dominant forms of the central government s tax
revenues were customs duties and excise taxes. (See Mitchell and Deane,
1962. pp. 387-88, 392-94 for the data.) The tax on land was also
significant, amounting to about 20% of total revenue in 1800, but less than
10% by 1840. Income (and property) taxes, begun in 1799. accounted for as
much as 15% of overall revenue during the Napoleonic Wars. After lapsing in
1817. income taxes were reintroduced in 1843 at about 10% of total revenue.
This percentage reached 15% around 1900 and 30% in 1915. An excess-profits
tax for World War I accounted for about 30% of overall receipts. Thus, in
order to generate more tax revenues, the government partly raised the rates
of existing taxes, and partly introduced new types of levies. Also,
especially during World War I, there was a tendency for non—military
components of governmental outlays to fall during wartime.
                                                                                       29


    With World War I included, the results for the period 1706—1918 are




             (18)
                     B—B1     = .008.      Bi         +                 = .81

                     a = .0101,            =   .98,        DW =   2.1


These results are similar to those in equation (17).

    As an example of the effect of wartime, from 1757 to 1762 the average

value of the temporary-spending ratio          was 9.6%. Multiplying by the

coefficient .96 from equation (17), the prediction is that the debt—GNP ratio

would rise on average by 9.2 percentage points per year during this war. In

fact, the ratio rose over the period from 0.74 to 1.39 or by 10.8 percentage

points per year.

    Similarly, from 1794 to 1815. the average value of                  was 4.9%. Hence,

the prediction is that the debt—CNP ratio would rise on average by 4.7

percentage points per year (.049 x .96). The actual figures show an increase

from 0.96 to 1.57 for an average increase of 2.8 percentage points per year.

(The sharp—and presumably partly unexpected—rise in the price level

accounts for some of the discrepancy.).

    During peacetime the variable      is negative, rather than zero. Hence,

instead of predicting a constant ratio of the debt to CNP. equation (17) says

that this ratio will fall during peacetime. This behavior underlies the

tendency for the debt—GNP ratio to decline during years that do not involve

major wars, as is apparent from Figure 9. For example, from 1822 to 1913,
                                                                               30


the average value of the variable      was —2.1%. Therefore the prediction is

that the debt—CNP ratio would fall on average by 2.0 percentage points per

year (—.021 x .96). In fact, the ratio fell over this period from 1.85 to

0.30, or by 1.7 percentage points per year. (The level of the nominal debt

changed relatively little—from       564 million at the beginning of 1822 to

  643 million at the end of 1913.)



b. Two Episodes of Non—War Budget Deficits

    Unlike for the case of wartime, it is typically difficult to identify the

temporary part of fluctuations in peacetime government expenditures. In any

event, the movements in non—military spending were relatively mild over the

sample period—see n. 6 above. Therefore, in explaining budget deficits and

other variables, I did not attempt to include a measure of temporary spending

aside from the military component. However, there are two interesting

episodes of peacetime deficit finance that are worth noting.

    Following the decision in 1833 to free the West Indian slaves, there were

large compensatory payments by the British government to slaveowners. The

amounts were   16.7 million in 1835 and 4.1 million in 1836. 28     These

figures. when divided by the wholesale price index, represented 4.3% and

0.9%, respectively, of trend real GNP. Thus the transfer payments in 1835

were similar in scale to a medium—sized war (see Table 1). Since the

transfers were temporary, they should be included nearly one—to—one in the

concept of the temporary—spending ratio.       which so far included only

events appears in Burn (1937, Chapter II) and Engerman and Fogel (1974).

military expenditures. With this adjustment the measured value of      rises

in 1835 from -.033 to .010, and in 1836 from —.035 to -.026. Using this

revision to the     variable, the estimated deficit—CNP ratio from equation

(17) for 1835 becomes .034, as compared with the actual value of .039. The

previous estimate, based on the unrevised concept of      was —.007. For

1836, the revised estimate for the deficit—GNP ratio is —.006, as compared to

the actual value of •003.29 The main point is that the compensatory payments

to slaveowners were financed mainly by debt. Thus the budget deficit reacts

to temporary peacetime spending in a manner similar to temporary wartime

spending.

     On the other hand, with respect to interest—rate determination, the

freeing of the slaves and the payments to slaveowners would be different from

temporary military purchases. The freeing of the slaves, per Se, converts

some non—human assets—that is, ownership rights in slaves—into human

capital.3° With "imperfect" capital markets, this change could raise the

desire to save in nonhuman form, and thereby reduce market interest rates.

However, the financing of the compensation payments by public debt offsets

this effect.

     The Ricardian view of budget deficits says that the extra public debt is

matched by a higher present value of future taxes, and thereby has no effect

on desired national saving or on interest rates. This view assumes that

  The previous estimate for 1836, which was .022, reflected the large
positive residual for 1835 (see equation (17)). If the effect of this
residual were eliminated, then the previous estimate would have been —.016.

imperfections in capital markets are unimportant—therefore the view also

implies that the freeing of the slaves, per Se, has no appreciable impact on

market interest rates. Overall, the Ricardian view predicts no important

effect on interest rates from the freeing of the slaves and the associated

budget deficit.

    The actual path of interest rates was 3.76% in 1831, 3.58% in 1832 (when

there was discussion of the pending legislation for freeing the slaves).

3.42% in 1833 (when the emancipation legislation and the compensation package

were enacted). 3.32% in 1834, 3.29% in 1835 (when the main compensatory

payments were made and the budget deficit was large), 3.35% in 1836, and

3.30% in 1837. Thus, despite the large budget deficit in 1835, there was no

apparent impact on interest rates. This finding accords with the Ricardian

view of public debt.

    The second episode of non—war budget deficits concerns the debate over

income taxes and other levies in 1909 (actually the fiscal year ended March

1910).31 The dispute over what kinds of taxes to enact and at what levels

produced a legislative deadlock during fiscal 1909-10, which created a

one—year lapse in the government's authority to collect certain revenues,

especially from the income tax. Therefore, although there was no temporary

bulge in expenditures, the sudden drop in receipts, mainly from the income

tax, produced a budget deficit of 1.5% of trend CNP in 1909 (as compared to

an estimated value of —0.4% from equation (17)). This deficit was financed

with short—term debt, which was paid off as promised when the uncollected

                                                                             33


 taxes ("arrears") were paid during the following year. The receipt of these

backlogged taxes, when added to the regular revenues, generated a budget

surplus of 2.0% of trend CNP for 1910 (actually the fiscal year ended March

1911).

    The scientific attraction of this episode is that it involves movements

in budget deficits that are not confounded by correlated shifts in government

expenditures for the military or other purposes. Therefore, the behavior of

interest rates in 1909—10 provides information about the effects of a budget

deficit, per se—although a deficit that was pretty much assured to be

temporary and balanced by a surplus the next year. The path of interest

rates was 2.90% in 1908. 2.98% in 1909, (when there was a budget deficit),

3.08% in 1910 (when there was a budget surplus), and 3.15% in 1911. These

data do not indicate that the budget deficit or surplus had a major effect on

interest rates. Thus the results again support the Ricardian view of public

debt.




4. Conclusions

    The British data from the early 1700s through World War I provide an

unmatched opportunity for studying the effects of temporary changes in

government purchases. In this paper I examined the effects of these changes

on interest rates, the quantity of money, the price level, and budget

deficits. But the data should be useful for many other purposes.

    The main findings are as follows. Temporary increases in government

purchases—showing   up in   the sample as increases in military outlays during

wartime—had positive effects on long—term interest rates. The effect on the
                                                                         34


growth rate of money (bank notes) was positive only during the two periods of

suspension of the gold standard (1797—1821 and 1914—1918). As long as

convertibility of bank notes into specie was maintained, there was no

systematic relation of government spending to monetary growth. Similarily,

the main interplay between temporary government spending and inflation

occurred during the periods of suspension.

    Temporary changes in military spending accounted for the bulk of budget

deficits from the early 1700s through 1918. This association explains the

main increases in the ratio of the public debt to GNP. as well as the

decreases that typically occurred during peacetime.

    Over the sample of more than two hundred years. I found only two examples

of major budget deficits that were unrelated to wartime—one associated with

compensation payments to slaveowners in 1835-36 and the other with a

political dispute over the income tax in 1909—10. Because of the

"exogeneity" of these deficits, it is interesting that interest rates showed

no special movements at these times.
