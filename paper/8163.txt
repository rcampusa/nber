I. Introduction

           Generational policy – the government’s treatment of current and future

generations -- is a fundamental aspect of a nation’s fiscal affairs.                  The policy involves

two actions – redistributing resources across generations and allocating to particular

generations the burden of paying the government’s bills. Taking from one generation to

help another or forcing one generation to pay for another’s public goods raises a host of

ethical as well as economic questions. How much of the government’s bills should future

generations be forced to pay? How should the government treat today’s elderly versus

today’s young? Should those born in the future pay more because they will benefit from

improved technology? Can the government redistribute across generations? If so, how

does this work?         Does relieving current generations of fiscal burdens let them consume

more and, thereby, reduce or crowd out national saving and domestic investment? Should

the government try to pool risks across generations?

           Generational morality is the province of philosophers. But the positive questions

surrounding the treatment of the old, the young, and unborn have captivated economists

since the birth of the discipline.             Their work has firmly embedded the analysis of

generational policy within the broader theory of fiscal incidence.1 This theory has three

central messages. First, those to whom the government assigns its bills or designates its

assistance are not necessarily those who bear its burdens or enjoy its help. Second, the

incidence of policies ultimately depends on the economic responses they invoke. Third,

apart from changes in economic distortions, generational policy is a zero-sum game in

    For surveys of tax incidence see Kotlikoff and Summers (1987) and Fullerton and Metcalf (this volume).


                                                       2
which the economic gains to winners (including the government) equal the economic

losses to losers.2

          Because the gulf between policy goals and policy outcomes can be so large,

incidence analysis is both important and intriguing.                    This is particularly true for

generational policy where a range of private responses can frustrate the government’s

initiatives.      These include intra-family intergenerational redistribution, private changes in

saving and labor supply, and the market revaluation of capital assets.

          The admonishment of incidence theory that policy descriptions bear no necessary

relationship to policy outcomes is particularly apt in considering the traditional measure

of generational policy, namely official government debt.                  Notwithstanding its common

use, official government debt is, as a matter of neoclassical economic theory, an artifice

of fiscal taxonomy that bears no fundamental relationship to generational policy.

          In contrast to deficit accounting, which has no precise objective, a relatively new

accounting method, Generational accounting, attempts to directly assess generational

policy.        Specifically, it tries to measure the intergenerational incidence of fiscal policy

changes as well as understand the fiscal burdens confronting current and future

generations under existing policy.

          Generational accounting represents but one way of trying to quantify the

economic impacts of generational policy. Another is computer simulation.                      Each passing

year sees the development of ever more sophisticated and carefully calibrated dynamic

computer simulation models.           These virtual environments are simplifications of economic

  Changes (including reductions) in economic distortions include policy-induced changes in the economy’s
degree of risk sharing to the extent that marginal rates of substitution and production are not equated across
states of nature.


                                                      3
reality. But they allow economists to conduct stylized controlled experiments in studying

the dynamic impacts of generational policies.

        This chapter shows how generational policy works, how it is measured, and how

much it matters to virtual as well as real economies. To make its points as quickly and

simply as possible, the chapter employs a two-period, overlapping generations model.

This model is highly versatile.          It illustrates the central controversies surrounding

generational policy, including its potential impact on national saving and its potential

impotency due to Ricardian Equivalence. It exposes the vacuity of deficit accounting.

And it elucidates the government’s intertemporal budget constraint that provides the

framework for generational accounting.

        Section II begins the analysis by presenting the two-period life-cycle model,

defining generational incidence, and showing the zero-sum nature of generational policy.

Section III illustrates generational policy with a simple example, namely a policy of

redistributing, in a non-distortionary manner, to the contemporaneous elderly from the

contemporaneous young as well as all future generations.           This example clarifies the

difference between statutory and true fiscal incidence. It also illuminates, as described in

Section IV, the arbitrary nature of fiscal labels as well as their resultant fiscal aggregates,

including the budget deficit, aggregate tax revenues, and aggregate transfer payments.

Finally, it illustrates the various guises of generational policy, including structural tax

changes, running deficits, altering investment incentives, and expanding pay-as-you-go-

financed social security.

        Once this example has been fully milked, the chapter shows that its lessons about

fiscal labels are general.    They apply when fiscal policy, in general, and generational




                                                4
policy, in particular, is distortionary, when it is uncertain, when it is time inconsistent,

and when segments of the economy are credit constrained.           Indeed, they apply to any

neoclassical model with rational economic agents and rational economic institutions

(including the government).         This demonstration sets the stage for Section V’s

description, illustration, and critique of generational accounting.   This section also lays

out the implications of generational policy for monetary policy.

          Because generational policies play out over decades rather than years and can

have major macroeconomic effects, understanding their impacts is best understood

through computer simulation analysis.       Section VI presents results from simulating two

major generational policies – changing the tax structure and privatizing social security.

The messages of this section are that generational policies can have significant effects on

the economy and the well being of different generations, but that such policies take a long

time to alter the economic landscape.

          Having illustrated generational policy, its measurement, and the potential

magnitude of its effects, the Chapter turns, in Section VII, to Ricardian Equivalence – the

contention that generational policy, despite the government’s best efforts, just doesn’t

work. The alleged reason is that parents and children are altruistic toward one another

and will use private transfers to offset any government attempts to redistribute among

them.     Ricardian Equivalence has been assailed by theorists and empiricists.       These

attacks have paid off.     As Section VII discusses, there are very good theoretical and

empirical reasons to doubt the validity of Ricardian Equivalence, at least for the United

States.     Section VIII considers the government’s role in improving or worsening




                                                5
intergenerational risk sharing.                    The final section, IX, summarizes and concludes the

chapter.

        To conserve space, the chapter makes no attempt to survey the voluminous

literature on generational policy.                     But any discussion of the modern analysis of

generational policy would be remiss if it failed to identify the four major postwar

contributions       to    the      field,     namely      Samuelson’s (1958) consumption-loan model,

Diamond’s (1965) analysis of debt policies, Feldstein’s (1974) analysis of unfunded

social security, and Robert Barro’s (1974) formalization of Ricardian equivalence. These

papers and their hundreds, if not thousands, of offspring collectively transformed the field

from a collection of intriguing, but poorly posed questions to an extremely rich and

remarkably clear set of answers.



II. The Incidence of Generational Policy

The Life-Cycle Model

        Consider a two-period, life-cycle model in which agents born in year s have utility

Us defined over consumption when young, cys, consumption when old, cos+1 , leisure when

young, lys, and leisure when old, los+1 .

(1)     U s = u( c ys , cos +1 , l ys , los +1 )

For this dynamic economy, consumption and leisure from a point in time, say the

beginning of time t, onward is constrained by a constant returns production function

satisfying

(2)        F ( cot + c yt + g t , cot +1 + c yt +1 + gt +1 ,..., l ot + l yt − 2T , lot +1 + l yt +1 − 2 T ,..., k t ) = 0 ,




                                                                6
where gs is government consumption in year s, k t is the capital stock at the beginning of

time t (before time-t production or consumption occurs), and T is the time endowment

available to each generation in each period.3 Since there are two generations alive at each

point in time, the aggregate time endowment in each period is 2T. The arguments of (2)

are the net (of endowments) demands for consumption and leisure at time t and in all

future periods plus the beginning of time t endowment of capital.

         Output is non-depreciable and can be either consumed or used as capital. Since

there are no future endowments of capital, only the time-t endowment of capital enters

(2). The fact that all of the leisure being demanded in a given period enters as a single

argument independent of who enjoys this leisure implies that the amounts of labor

supplied by different agents are perfect substitutes in production.                                  Finally, the fact that

the aggregate time endowment (T) is constant through time reflects the simplifying

assumption that each cohort is of equal size – the value of which is normalized to unity.

         Using the constant returns-to-scale property, the production function can be

written as:

(3)      ( cot + c yt + gt ) + Rt +1 ( cot +1 + c yt +1 + g t +1 ) +...+ wt ( l ot + l yt ) + Rt +1 wt +1 ( l ot +1 + l yt +1 )...+

              kt
         =       + wt 2T + Rt +1 wt +1 2T +... ,
              Rt

where Rs+1 is the marginal rate of transformation of output in period s into output in

period s+1 (the cost of an extra unit of output in period s+1 measured in units of output in

period s); i.e.,




3
 To keep the notation simple, this presentation abstracts from uncertainty in leaving out subscripts that
denote state of nature. Indexing commodities by the state of nature is straightforward.


                                                               7
                    Fcs+1
(4)      R s +1 ≡         ,
                     Fcs

and ws is the marginal rate of transformation of output in period s into leisure in period s

(the cost of an extra unit of leisure in period s measured in units of output in period s),

i.e.,

                              Fls
        (5)         ws ≡
                              Fcs

The terms Rs+1 and ws – the respective time-s marginal products of capital at time s+1 and

labor at time s -- are referenced below as pre-tax factor prices.

        Equation (3) is the economy’s intertemporal budget constraint. It requires that the

value of current and future consumption and leisure, all measured in units of current

consumption, not exceed the value of the economy’s current and future endowments, also

measured in units of current consumption.

        In choosing their consumption and leisure demands, agents born in year s≥t

maximize (1) subject to:

(6)     c ys + Rs +1 c os +1 + ws l ys + Rs +1 ws +1l os +1 = ws T + Rs +1 ws +1 T − h ys − Rs +1 hos +1 ,

where hos is the net payment of the old at time s.

        Those agents born in t-1 maximize their time-t remaining lifetime utility subject

to:

                           a ot
(7)      cot + wt lot =         + wt T − hot
                           Rt

In (6) and (7), hys is the net payment to the government by the young at time s, and aot

represents the net worth of the initial elderly at the beginning of time t.




                                                           8
The Government’s Intertemporal Budget Constraint

          Substitution of (6) and (7) into the economy-wide budget constraint (3) yields the

government’s intertemporal budget constraint:

(8)
                                                                                                                                   a ot − k t
hot + h yt + Rt +1 (hot +1 + h yt +1 ) + Rt +1 Rt + 2 ( hot + 2 + hyt + 2 ) +... = gt + Rt +1 gt +1 + Rt + 1 Rt + 2 gt + 2 +...+
                                                                                                                                       Rt

The right-hand side of (8) is the government’s bills -- the present value of it current and

future projected consumption plus its net debt, which equals the difference between total

private-sector net worth and the economy’s aggregate capital stock, (aot - k t)/Rt.                                         The

government’s intertemporal budget constraint requires that either current or future

generations pay for the government’s bills, where its bills represent the sum of its

projected future consumption plus its initial net debt. As discussed below, different ways

of labeling government receipts and payments will alter hot (the remaining lifetime net

payment, or generational account, of the time-t elderly) and (aot - k t) /Rt by equal

amounts.       In contrast, the lifetime net payments (the generational accounts) facing initial

young (hyt+Rt+1 hot+1 ) and future generations (hys+Rs+1 hos+1 , ,for s>t) are invariant to the

government’s vocabulary; i.e., the fiscal burden on current and future newborns is well

defined, whereas the government’s net debt is not.



The Incidence of Generational Policy

          Suppose that at time t the government changes policy.                                 The policy change will

affect the generation born at time t-1 (the initial elderly), the generation born at time t

(the initial young), and all generations born after time t (the future generations).                                        The




                                                               9
incidence of the policy for an affected generation born in year s is found by

differentiating (1):

(9)       dU s = ucys dc ys + ucos+1 dcos +1 + u lysdl ys + ulos +1 dl os +1

For the initial elderly, s=t-1, and dcyt-1 =0 and dlyt-1 =0, since consumption and leisure that

occurred before the policy changed is immutable.

          The incidence experienced by each generation born at for s ≥ t can be expressed

in units of consumption when young by dividing (9) by the marginal utility of

consumption when young.

          dU s          u                ulys        u
(10)           = dc ys + cos+1 dc os+1 +      dl ys + los +1 dl os +1
          ucys           ucys            ucys         ucys

Equation (10) traces generational incidence to changes in each generation’s consumption

and leisure when young and old valued in terms of their consumption when young.                                              In

the case of the initial elderly, the change in utility can be normalized by the marginal

utility of consumption when old.



The Zero-Sum Nature of Generational Policy

          Policy-induced changes in consumption and leisure experienced by the various

There are two sets of terms on the right-hand-side of (13).                                              The first set involves

differences between marginal rates of substitution (MRS) and marginal rates of

transformation (MRT) multiplied by a) the change in the economic choice being distorted

and b) a discount factor.                     These MRS-MRT wedges arise from distortionary fiscal

policies and are often referred to as marginal tax wedges.                                         This first set of terms is

related, but not strictly identical to, the present value of the marginal change in economic

efficiency (the change in excess burden) arising from the policy. The second set of terms

measures the present value of the policy-induced change in the time-path of government

consumption.

          Thus (13) shows that fiscal-policy incidence summed over across all current and

future generations equals a) the present value of the time-path of terms related to policy-



                                                                   11
induced changes in excess burden and b) the increase in the present value of government

consumption.      Thus, apart from efficiency effects, any change in government

consumption must be fully paid for in terms of reduced welfare experienced by current or

future generations.      If the policy entails no efficiency change and no change in

government consumption, Et equals zero, and the policy simply redistributes fiscal

burdens across generations.      Hence, ignoring efficiency effects, policy changes are,

generationally speaking, zero-sum in nature.      Either current or future generations must

pay for the government’s spending and holding government spending fixed, any

improvement in the wellbeing of one generation comes at the cost of reduced wellbeing

of another generation.

        It’s important to note that (13) takes into account policy-induced changes in the

time-path of factor prices.    Apart from efficiency considerations, (13) tells us that all

intergenerational redistribution, be it direct government intergenerational redistribution,

arising from changes in the constellation of net payments it extracts from various

generations, or indirect intergenerational redistribution, arising from policy-induced

changes in the time-path of factor prices, is zero-sum in nature.     Stated differently, the

benefits to particular generations arising from policy-induced changes in wage and

interest rates are exactly offset by losses to other generations from such factor-price

changes.

        Although the first set of terms in (13) involving MRS-MRT wedges arise only in

the presence of economic distortions, their sum represents a precise measure of the

change in excess burden only if the policy being conducted compensates all generations

for the income effects they experience.       To show how this compensation could be




                                             12
effected, take the case of a policy change that a) does not alter the time-path of

government consumption, b) compensates members of each generation by keeping them

on their pre-policy-change budget constraints, and c) does not require resources from

outside the economy (i.e., leaves the economy on its intertemporal budget constraint).4

           Since each generation remains on its initial budget constraint (defined in terms of

its slope and intercept) the policy serves only to alter the choice of the position on that

constraint.      This change in the consumption/leisure bundle arises because of the policy’s

alteration in relative prices (i.e., because of changes in incentives).            Hence, each

generation’s change in utility arises due to a change in how it allocates its budget, rather

than a change in the size of its budget. The resulting change in utility is a pure change in

economic distortion.          Because these utility changes are measured in units of time-t

output, adding them up, as (13) does, across all current and future generations indicates

the amount (positive or negative) of time-t output that could be extracted from the

economy by engaging in the policy, but using generation-specific non distortionary net

payments that keep each generation at its pre-policy change level of utility.

           To keep each generation on its initial budget constraint, the government must alter

the net amounts it takes from each generation when young and old to offset all policy-

induced income effects, including those arising from changes in relative prices of

consumption and leisure when young and old. Assuming, without loss of generality, that

the amount of distortionary net payments made by each generation are offset by non

distortionary net payments of equal magnitude, the only income effects to be offset are

those arising from changes in relative prices. This means setting dhot such that

(15)       dhot = dwt T − dwt l ot
4
    This is a Slutsky’s compensation in an intertemporal setting.


                                                       13
and setting dhys and dhos+1 for s≥t such that



(16)

dh ys + Rs +1 dhos +1 = dws T + d ( Rs +1 ws +1 ) T − dRs +1 hos +1 − dRs +1 c os+ 1 − dws l ys − d ( Rs +1 ws +1 ) los +1

         Does this compensation policy satisfy the government’s intertemporal budget

constraint? The answer is yes.               To see why, take the differentials of (3), (6), and (7).

These equations plus (15) and (16) generate the differential of the government’s budget

constraint.      Intuitively, the constant-returns property of the production function implies

that factor-price changes are zero-sum in nature. Hence, the government can redistribute

resources from generations experiencing beneficial factor-price changes to those

experiencing adverse factor-price changes.                      This leaves each generation on its initial

budget frontier, although, potentially, at a different point on that frontier.


         When one applies (15) and (16) in conjunction with a policy change that leaves

government spending unchanged, the resulting consumption and leisure differentials in

(13) are compensated ones. For discrete, as opposed to infinitesimal, policy changes, one

can integrate Et over the range of the policy change. The resulting expression will be the

present value sum of each period’s Harberger excess burden triangle, if there are no

initial distortions in the economy.5




III. Illustrating Generational Policy

A Cobb-Douglas Example

5
  Were one to expand the above analysis to incorporate uncertainty about future states of nature, all
commodities at a particular point in time would be indexed by their state of nature and the discrepancies
between marginal rates of substitution and marginal rates of transformation would capture the absence of
risk-sharing arrangements associated with incomplete insurance markets.


                                                           14
        A very simple Cobb-Douglas two period life-cycle model suffices to illustrate

how generational policy works and why it cannot be uniquely described with

conventional fiscal taxonomy. Let the utility of the young born at time s, Us, be given by:


(17)              U s = α log c yt + (1 − α) log c ot +1 .


In (17), we make the assumption that labor supply is exogenous. Specifically the young

work full time, and the elderly are retired. Also let the production function for output per

worker satisfy:


(18)              y t = Ak tβ


Each cohort has N members, so there is no population growth. Finally, assume that the

                                      −
government takes an amount h from each member of each young generation and hands

the same amount to each member of the contemporaneous old generation.


        At any time t+1, capital per old person equals capital per worker, k t+1 , because the

number of old and young are equal. The amount of capital held at t+1 by each old person

is what she accumulated when young; i.e.,


                                  −
(19)              k t +1 = wt − h − c yt .


Given that consumption when young equals a share, α, of lifetime resources, we can

write (19) as:


                                                   −
                                  −           r h
(20)              k t +1   = wt − h − α( wt − t +1 )
                                             1 + rt +1


                                                       15
Finally, using the fact that factor prices equal marginal products, we can express (20) as:


                                                                          −
                                                      −  βAt +1 k tβ+1−1 h
(21)             k t +1   = (1 − β)(1 − α) At k − h + α(
                                                 β
                                                                             ).
                                                        1 + βAt +1 k tβ+−1 1
                                                t




Equation (21) represents the transition equation for the capital labor ratio. Knowing the

value of k t, one can solve (by nonlinear methods) for the value of k t+1 .




The Crowding Out of Capital


        Consider introducing the policy at time 0. Because α is between zero and one, the

                                                               −                  −
derivative of k t+1 for t = 0 with respect to h is negative evaluated at h equals zero.

Hence, if we assume the policy is introduced at time 0, it reduces the economy’s capital

stock at each future date. What is the explanation for this crowding out of capital? The

answer is the increased consumption of those who are old at the time of the reform – time

                                −                                                  −
0. This cohort receives h for free; i.e., without being forced to hand over h when young.

                                                                              −
And the cohort immediately increases its consumption by h per person.                  This present

value gain to the initial old is offset by a present value loss to the initial young and future

                                    −
generations of interest on h ; i.e., if one discounts, at the time path of the marginal

                                                                              −
product of capital, the sum of all the losses of interest on h by the initial young and future

                                     −
generations, the total equals - h .




                                                          16
        If the losses to the current young and future generations are equal in present value

to the gains to the initial old, why is there an initial (time 0) net increase in consumption

and a decline in national saving? The answer is that the increased consumption by the

elderly at time 0 is only partially offset by the reduced consumption of the

contemporaneous young.       As just indicated, the contemporaneous young pay for only a

small portion of the transfer to the initial elderly. Moreover, their propensity to consume,

α, is less than one – the propensity to consume of the initial elderly.           So the positive

income effect experienced by the initial elderly exceeds in absolute value the negative

income effect experienced by the initial young, who, in any case, have a smaller

propensity to consume. Hence, consumption of the initial elderly rises by more than the

consumption of the initial young falls, thereby reducing national saving and investment.


        Although all future generations will be forced to reduce their consumption once

they are born, that doesn’t matter to the time-0 level of national consumption and saving.

Moreover, the reason this policy has a permanent impact on the economy’s capital stock

is that there are always generations coming in the future whose consumption has not yet

been depressed because of the policy; i.e., at any point in time, say t, the cumulated

policy-induced net increase in the economy’s aggregate consumption from time 0

through time t is positive. Another way to think about the policy is to note that as of time

0 the old are the big spenders, whereas the young and future generations are the big

savers. Indeed, future generations have a propensity to consume at time 0 of zero. So the

policy redistributes resources at time 0 from young and future savers to old spenders.




                                                17
The Policy’s Incidence


        The incidence of the policy can be described as follows. The elderly at time 0

         −
receive h , and since factor prices at time 0 are unchanged, they experience no reduction

in the return they earn from their capital.    Hence, the policy unambiguously makes the

                                                                                       −
initial elderly better off.   Next consider the young at time 0.     They give up h when

                                                                                           −
young, but receive the same amount when old. On balance, they lose interest on the h .

This reduction in lifetime income is somewhat counterbalanced by the fact the policy

drives up the return they receive on their savings. The reason is that the policy reduces k 1

relative to what it would otherwise have been. (Note that while the policy alters k 1 and

subsequent levels of capital per workers, it doesn’t change k 0 , which means it doesn’t

change the wage earned by the initial young.) Finally, consider those born at time 2 and

                                                          −
thereafter. Each of these generations loses interest on h . In addition, each earns a lower

wage on its labor supply and a higher rate of return on its saving than in the absence of

the policy. On balance, these factor price changes make these generations worse off.


        Since there is neither government consumption nor economic distortions in this

example, the policy, according to (13), is zero-sum across generations with respect to

welfare changes. Now the derivative of each generation’s utility has two components –

                               −
the change due to raising h (above zero) and the change due to policy-induced factor

price changes. If we measure these two components in present value (in units of time-0

consumption) and add them up across all generations, equation (13) tells us that their sum

is zero. However, as indicated above, the sum across all initial and future generations of



                                              18
                                                                         −
the first component – the utility changes from raising h is, by itself, zero.6 Hence, the

present value sum of the utility changes experienced by initial and future generations

from factor-price changes must also sum to zero. In concrete terms, this means that the

gain to the initial young from receiving a higher rate of return in old age, measured in

units of time-0 consumption, equals the sum of the net losses, measured in time-0

consumption, incurred by subsequent generations from receiving a lower real wage when

young plus a higher return when old.



IV. Deficit Delusion and the Arbitrary Nature of Fiscal Labels

           In presenting generational policy in the Cobb-Douglas model, no use was made of

the terms “taxes,” “transfer payments,” “interest payments,” or “deficits.”                        This section

points out that there are an infinite number of equally uninformative ways to label the

above policy using these words. Each of these alternative sets of labels use the words

“taxes,” “transfers,” “spending,” and “deficits” in conventional ways. Consequently, no

set of labels has a higher claim to relevance than any other.

           The choice of a particular set of fiscal labels to use in discussing the model (the

choice of fiscal language) is fundamentally no different than the choice of whether to

discuss the model in English or French.                      The message of the model lies in its

mathematical structure. And no one would presume that that message would differ if the

model were discussed in English rather than French.




                                                                   −
6
    Recall that the present value sum of the loss of interest on   h by the initial young and future generations
           −
equals - h -- the gain to the initial elderly.


                                                        19
        Showing that fiscal labeling is, from the perspective of economic theory, arbitrary

establishes that the “deficit” is not a well defined measured of generational or, indeed,

any other aspect of fiscal policy. It establishes the same point with respect to “taxes,”

“transfer payments,” and “spending,” where spending consists of “transfer payments” and

“interest payments on government borrowing.”               Since the “deficit,” “taxes,” “transfer

payments,” and “spending” are, from the perspective of economic theory, content free, so

too are ancillary fiscal and national income accounting constructs like “debt,” “national

income,” “disposable income,” “personal saving,” and “social security.”                 Given the

ubiquitous use by governments and economists of these verbal constructs to discuss,

formulate, and evaluate economic policy, the import of this point cannot be overstated.



Alternative Fiscal Labels

                                                       −
        Consider first labeling the payment of h by members of the initial young and

                                                                               −
future generations as a “tax” and the labeling of the receipt of h by the initial and

subsequent elderly as a “transfer payment.” With these words, the government reports a

balanced budget each period since “taxes” equal “spending.” This is true despite the fact

that the government is running a loose fiscal policy in the sense that it redistributes

toward the initial old from the initial young and future generations.              Furthermore, the

                                                                                          −
budget remains in balance regardless of whether the policy is extremely loose (h is very

                           −
large) or extremely tight ( h is negative and very large in absolute value).

                                                                                    −
        As a second example, let the government (1) label its payment of h to the elderly

                                                                     −
at time 0 as “transfer payments,” (2) label its receipt of h from the initial young and


                                                 20
                                                                                          −
subsequent generations as “borrowing,” and (3) label its net payment of h to each elderly

generation from time s=1 onward as “repayment of principal plus interest in the amount

                −                            −
of (1+rs) h less an old age tax of rs h .” While each old person starting at time 0 still

            −                                                 −
receives h and each young person still hands over h , with this alternative set of words

                                                                  −
the government announces that its running a deficit of h at time 0 since time-0 spending

                                −
on transfer payments equals h and time-0 taxes equal zero. At time 1 and thereafter, the

deficit is zero since the old age tax equals the government’s interest payments (the only

                                                                                      −
government spending).       Hence, the stock of debt increases from 0 to h at the beginning

of time 1 and stays at that value forever.

           The above two examples are special cases of the following general labeling rule:

                                                 −                                            −

                                         −                                −
net transfer to the young of (m-1) h , 2) label the payment of h to the initial old as a

                                                          −
transfer payment, and 3) label the payment of h to the old in periods s≥1 as return of

                                     −                                        −           −
principal plus interest of m(1+rs) h less a net old age tax of (m-1) h +mrs h . Note that in

the first example, m equals 0. In the second, m equals 1. Also note that regardless of the

                                                              −
value of m, the government, on balance, extracts h from the young each period and

       −
hands h over to the old each period.

                                                                      −
           The government’s reported deficit at time 0 is m h . At time s≥1, the reported

                                                                                  −
deficit equals government spending on interest payments of mrs h plus net transfer

                           −                                         −       −
payments of (m-1) h minus government net taxes of (m-1) h +mrs h ; i.e., the reported

                                                                                             −
deficit in s≥1 is zero. Hence, from time 1 onward, the stock of government debt is mh .

Since m can be any positive or negative integer, the government can choose language to

make its reported debt for s≥1 any size and sign it wants.

        For example, if the government makes m equal to –30,000, it will announce each

                                              −                                  −
period that it is “taxing the young 30,001 h and lending the young 30,000 h and, in each

period s≥1, that it is “receiving from the old principal and interest payments of

               −                                                         −           −
30,000(1+rs) h and making a transfer payment to the old of 30,001 h +30,000rs h . In this

                                                            −
case, the government reports a surplus at time 0 of 3000 h .

        Thus, each choice of m corresponds to a different choice of fiscal language. And

since the government and private sector are always fully repaying those payments and

receipts that are described as “government borrowing” and “government loans,” one

choice of m is no more natural than any other from the perspective of everyday parlance.

From the perspective of economic theory, the choice of m is completely arbitrary as well;

i.e., the equations of the model presented above do not contain m.

        In addition to not pinning down the choice of m at a point in time, the model’s

equations provide no restrictions on changes in the choice of m through time.            Let ms

                                                        −
stand for the choice of m applied to the receipt of h from the young at time s as well as

                   −
the receipt of h by the old at time s+1. So ms references the language used to describe

the fiscal treatment of generations s.     In this case, the deficit at time s will equal the

                       −
quantity (ms–ms-1 ) h .



                                               22
        To summarize, regardless of the true size and nature of generational policy as

                                        −
determined by the size and sign of h , the government can announce any time-path of

deficits or surpluses it chooses. For example, the government can choose a sequence of

ms that makes its reported debt grow forever at a faster rate than the economy. This

means, of course, that the debt to GDP ratio tends to infinitely. It also means that the

invocation in economic models of a transversality condition, which limits the ratio of

debt to GDP, is a restriction about permissible language, not a restriction on the

economy’s underlying economic behavior.

        At this point, an irritated reader might suggest that the above is simply an exercise

in sophistry because as long as the government chooses its fiscal language (its m) and

sticks with it through time, we’ll have a meaningful and consistent language with which

to discuss fiscal policy.

        This is not the case. Even if the government were to choose an m and stick with it

through time, the resulting time path of government deficits would have no necessary

connection to actual fiscal policy.         As we’ve seen in the above example, if the

                                                                                     −
government chooses a large (in absolute value) negative value of m to label the h policy,

it will announce over time that it has a huge level of assets, despite the fact that it is

conducting loose policy.        Moreover, the government’s choice of fiscal labels isn’t

sacrosanct. The fact that the government has chosen a particular time-path for the value

of m doesn’t preclude each individual in society from choosing her or his own time-path

of ms in describing the country’s past and projected future fiscal affairs. Each of these

alternative time paths has the same claim (namely zero) to explaining the government’s

actual past, present, and future fiscal position.    Indeed, those who wish to show that



                                               23
deficits crowd out capital formation need only define a time path of ms that produces a

negative correlation between investment and the deficit. And those who wish to show the

opposite can choose a time path of ms that produces a positive correlation.

         Finally, unless the government’s fiscal policy is described in label-free terms,

there is no way for the public to know what m the government has chosen or whether it is

maintaining that choice through time. In our simple model, the reported deficit depends

on the current period’s choice of m, the previous period’s choice of m, as well as the size

    −                                                 −
of h .      Without independent knowledge of h , the public can’t tell if the deficit is

changing because of changes in fiscal fundamentals or simply because of changes in

fiscal labels. Nor can the public tell if the same labels are being used through time.



Other Guises of Generational Policy

                                                                               −
         In the above discussion, we’ve indicated that the our h                   intergenerational

redistribution policy can be conducted under the heading “pay-as-you-go” social security,

“deficit-financed transfer payments,” or “surplus-financed transfer payments,” where the

deficits or surpluses can be of any size. This is not the limit of the language that could be

used to describe the policy. The policy could also be introduced under the heading of

“structural tax reform.”      To see this, suppose the government initially has in place a

consumption tax that it uses to make transfers to the young and old which precisely equal

their tax payments.     Now suppose the government switches from consumption to wage

taxation as its means of collecting the same amount of revenue to finance the transfer

payments.     Since the initial elderly are retired and pay no wage taxes, they will be

relieved of paying any net taxes over the rest of their lives.                Hence, this reform



                                                 24
redistributes to them from the initial young and future generations.              These latter

generations find that the present value (calculated when young) of their lifetime net tax

payments has been increased.

         Our final example of fiscal linguistic license is particularly artful. As discussed in

Auerbach and Kotlikoff (1987), it involves the government engineering a stock market

boom and, thereby, raising the price at which the elderly sell their capital assets to the

young.     In so doing, the government can claim that market revaluation, rather than

government policy, is responsible for improving the well being of the initial elderly at the

cost of lower welfare for the initial young and future generations.        Since we want to

                                                           −
describe this outcome as a particular labeling of our h policy, we need to clarify the

difference between capital assets and consumption goods.         The difference arises not in

the physical property of the two, since our model has only one good, but rather in the date

the good is produced. The economy’s capital stock at time t consists of output that was

produced prior to time t. And the government can tax or subsidize the purchase of output

produced in the past differently from the way it taxes or subsidizes output produced in the

present.

                                                      −
         In terms of the equations of our model, h stands for the higher price of capital

(measured in units of consumption) that the young must pay to invest in capital. It also

stands for the higher price (measured in units of consumption) that the old receive on the

sale of their capital to the young.

         How can the government engineer a stock market boom of this kind? The answer

is by announcing a tax on the purchase of newly produced capital goods by the young.

Since the young can either invest by buying new capital goods or by buying old capital



                                              25
from the elderly (the capital valued in the stock market), this will drive up the price of the

capital the elderly have to sell to the point that the young are indifferent between the two

options. To avoid the government retaining any resources, we can have it return to the

young the equivalent of their investment tax payments, but in a lump-sum payment (a

payment that is not related to the level of that investment.                       This, plus a couple of

additional elements that leave the effective tax rate on capital income unchanged, will

make the “investment tax policy” differ in name only from conducting our benchmark

policy under the alternative headings “pay-as-you-go social security,” “deficit-financed

transfer payments to the elderly,” “surplus-financed transfer payments to the elderly,”

and “structural tax change.”7



Generalizing the Point that the Deficit is Not Well Defined

         The above illustration of the arbitrary nature of deficit accounting was based on a

simple framework that excluded distortionary policy, economic as well as policy

uncertainty, and liquidity constraints.           Unfortunately, none of these factors provide any

connection between the measured deficit and fiscal fundamentals.




7
  To make this policy fully isomorphic to our benchmark policy, we need to include six elements: 1) a
subsidy to capital income received by generation s when old that is levied at the same rate as the tax
generation s pays when young on new investment, 2) a lump sum transfer paid to the elderly equal to the
subsidy to capital income, 3) a lump sum transfer to the young equal to the proceeds of the investment tax,
4) the setting of the investment tax rate each period to ensure that the net cost of purchasing the capital rises
            −
by exactly h , 5) if the elderly consume their own capital, the government provides them a subsidy at the
same rate as the investment tax, and 6) if the young invest their own capital (the output they receive as
wages), they will be forced to pay the investment tax. Element 1 ensures that there is no change in the
effective rate of capital income taxation under this description of the policy. Elements 2 through 4 ensure
that the budget constraints of the young and old each period are precisely those of the benchmark policy.
Element 5 guarantees that the elderly are indifferent between consuming their own capital or selling it to
the young, and element 6 guarantees that the young are indifferent between investing their own wages,




                                                       26
Distortionary Policy

          To see that distortionary policy has no purchase when it comes to connecting

deficits with fiscal fundamentals, consider again the general model that includes variable

first period and second period leisure and net payments from the young and old in period

t to the government of hyt and hot. To introduce distortionary fiscal policy, we simply let

hyt and hot depend on how much generation t decides to consume and work when young

and old, respectively.     In maximizing its lifetime utility function subject to (6) or (7),

agents take into account the marginal dependence of hyt and hot+1 on their consumption

and leisure demands and this marginal dependence helps determine the marginal prices

they face in demanding these commodities.

          Our model with distortionary policy thus consists of a) government-chosen time-

paths of the hyt and hot functions and gt (government consumption demands) that satisfy

the government’s intertemporal budget constraint, household demands for consumption

and supplies of labor, and firms supplies of output and demands for capital and labor

inputs.    Market clearing requires that, in each period along the economy’s dynamic

transition path, a) firms’ aggregate output supply cover the consumption demands of

households and the government plus the investment demand of firms and b) labor supply

equals labor demand.


          The fact that we can formulate and discuss our model of distortionary fiscal

policy making no use whatsoever of the words “taxes,” “transfer payments,” or “deficits”

in itself tells us that the deficit has no connection to policy, even if that policy is

distortionary.    But to drive home the point, consider labeling hyt as “government


purchasing new capital for investment from other young people, or purchasing the capital owned by the



                                                 27
borrowing” of mt hyt from the young at time t less a “net transfer payment” to the young at

time t of (mt -1)hyt. The corresponding labeling of the payment by the old of hot+1 would

be labeled as “repayment of principal and interest” of -mt hyt (1+rt+1 ) (which is negative,

because the government is doing the repaying) plus a “net tax payment” of hot+1 + mt hyt

(1+rt+1 ). Notice, that regardless of the size of mt , the net payments of generation t when

young and old are hyt and hot+1 , respectively and its generational account is hyt + Rt+1 hot+1 .

Thus, the choice of the time path of the mt s makes no difference to economic outcomes,

although it leads to a sequence of “official” deficits, dt, of

(22)              d t = mt h yt − mt −1 hyt −1 .

         To make this math more concrete, suppose that the government finances its

possibly time-varying consumption each period based on a net payment from the young

of hyt, which distorts each generation’s first-period labor supply. 8                 How can observer A

report that the government is taxing only the labor earnings of the young from time 0

onward and always running a balanced budget? How can observer B report that the

government runs a deficit of hy1 at time 0? And how can observer C report that the same

government runs a surplus of hy1 at time 0?

         The answer is that observer A sets ms equal to zero for all s; observer B sets m0

equal to zero and m1 equal to 1; and observer C sets m0 equal to zero and m1 equal to -1.

Observer A describes the government as taxing generation 1 when it is young on the

amount it earns when young. Observer B describes the government as taxing generation

1 when it is old on the accumulated (at interest) amount it earns when young. Observer C

describes the government as taxing generation 1 when it is young on its labor supply by


elderly.
8
  In this example, the net payment of the old each period is assumed to equal zero.


                                                     28
more than the amount needed to cover government spending. Observer C also describes

the government as subsidizing generation 1 when it is old based on the accumulated (at

interest) amount it earned when young.            The key point here is that, although all three

observers report different time-0 deficits, all three report that the government is imposing

the same tax, at the margin, on labor supply when young.

        The labels of observers B and C may, at first, seem a bit strained because they

entail stating that the government is collecting revenue or making subsidies in one period

based on economic choices made in another. There are, however, multiple and important

examples of such elocution. Take 401k, IRA, and other tax-deferred retirement accounts.

The tax treatment of these accounts is expressly described as taxing in old age the amount

earned when young plus accumulated interest on those earnings. Another example comes

from the Social Security System, which provides social security benefits in old age based

on the past earnings of workers in a manner that connects marginal benefits to marginal

past contributions.    A third example is the U.S. federal income tax which taxes social

security benefits and thus, indirectly, taxes in old age the labor supplied by retirees when

they were young.

        Moreover, such cross-period references aren’t essential.             Take B’s observation

that generation 1 pays zero taxes when young and (1+r2 )hy1 taxes when old.                    B can

describe the zero taxes that generation 1 pays when young as “revenues from a tax on

labor supply when young less a lump-sum transfer payment made to the young at time 1

of equal value.” And B can describe the taxes generation 1 pays when old as a “lump

sum tax.”9


9
  Recall that, according to observer B, this second-period lump -sum tax is offset by the second-period
repayment of principal plus interest on the government’s borrowing, so that the agent makes no net


                                                  29
        Although the model discussed above has only a single type of agent per

generation, the argument about the arbitrary nature of fiscal labels is equally valid if

agents are heterogeneous. In this case, the net payments to the government, hyt and hot,

will differ across agents.       If the government cannot observe individual characteristics,

like innate talent, these functions will be anonymous.            On the other hand, the labeling

convention – the choice of mt can be individual specific; i.e., we are each free to describe

our own and our fellow citizens’ net payments to the government with any words we like.

        Ghiglino and Shell (2000) point out that if the government were restricted in its

choice of words to, for example, announcing only anonymous tax schedules, those

restrictions might, in light of limits on reported deficits constrained the government’s

policy choices.     This point and their analysis, while very important, is orthogonal to the

one being made here, namely that whatever is the government’s policy and however the

government came to choose that policy, it can reasonably (in the sense of using standard

economic terminology) be described by men and women, who are not encumbered by

government censors, as generating any time path of deficits or surpluses.



Liquidity Constraints

        Another objection to the above demonstrations that “deficit” policies are not well

defined is that they ignore the possibility that some agents are liquidity constrained.                If

some young agents can’t borrow against future income how can they be indifferent

between a policy that involuntarily “taxes” them and one that voluntarily “borrows” from

them? There are two answers.


payment in the second period. Thus, if the agent dies prior to reaching the second period, observer B can
claim that the agent’s estate used the proceeds of the debt repayment to pay the second-period lump -sum



                                                   30
        First, the government can compel payments with words other than “taxes.” For

example, government’s all around the world are currently “reforming” their social

security pension systems by forcing workers to “save” by making contributions to

pension funds, rather than by making social security “tax” contributions.                    The

governments are then “borrowing” these “savings” out of the pension funds to finance

current social security benefit payments.      When the workers reach retirement, they will

receive “principal plus interest” on their compulsory saving, but, presumably, also face

an additional tax in old age to cover the government’s interest costs on that “borrowing.”

While this shell game alters no liquidity constraints, it certainly raises the government’s

reported deficit.

        The point to bear in mind here is not that governments may, from time to time,

opt for different words to do the same thing, but, rather that any independent observer

can, even in a setting of liquidity constraints, reasonably use alternative words to describe

the same fundamental policy and, thereby, generate total different time-paths of deficits.

        The second reason why liquidity-constrained agents may be indifferent between

“paying taxes” and “lending to the government” is due to Hayashi (1987). His argument

is that private-sector lenders are ultimately interested in the consumption levels achieved

by borrowers since the higher those levels, the greater the likelihood that those who can’t

repay will borrow and then default.          When the government reduces its “taxes” on

liquidity-constrained borrowers, private lenders reduce their own loans to those

borrowers to limit the increase in their consumption. Instead of lending as much as it did

to its borrowers, the private lenders make loans to the government.                    Indeed, in

equilibrium, the private lenders voluntarily “lend” to the government exactly the amounts


tax.

                                                31
the liquidity-constrained agents were otherwise sending the government in “taxes.”

Hence, the borrowers find their private loans cut back by precisely their cut in taxes (i.e.,

they find their “tax cuts” being used to buy government bonds) and end up with the same

consumption.    Thus, changing language will not alter the degree to which any agent is

liquidity   constrained   since   these   constraints   will   themselves   be    determined,

fundamentally, by the unchanged level and timing of the agents’ resources net of their net

payments to the government.



Uncertainty

        A third objection to the proposition that fiscal labels are economically arbitrary

involves uncertainty. “Surely,” the objection goes, “future transfer payments and taxes

are less certain than repayment of principal plus interest, so one can’t meaningfully

interchange these terms.” In fact the risk properties of government payments and receipts

provide no basis for their labeling; i.e., the deficit is no better defined in models with

uncertainty than it is in models with certainty. The reason is that any uncertain payment

            ~
(receipt) X , where the ~ refers to a variable that is uncertain, can be relabeled as the

                                                    −                                     ~
combination of a certain payment (receipt) X plus an uncertain payment (receipt) X -

 −                                                                                 ~
X . So a net payment when young of hyt and an uncertain receipt when old of hot +1 can be

described as a net payment when young of hyt plus a certain old age receipt of hyt/Rt+1 less

                              ~
an uncertain receipt of hot +1 - hyt/ Rt+1 .    Regardless of what one calls the uncertain

component of this receipt, there are, as we’ve seen, an infinite number of ways to label

the certain payment when young and the certain receipt when old.            More generally,



                                               32
whatever are the risk properties of net payments that are labeled “borrowing” and

“interest and principal repayment,” these same net payments can be labeled as “taxes”

and “transfer payments.”

        Take, as an example, Barsky, Mankiw, and Zeldes’ (1986) demonstration that “a

tax cut coupled with a future income tax increase (that pays off the associated borrowing)

can stimulate consumer spending” and that “the marginal propensity to consume out of a

tax cut, coupled with future income tax increases, can be substantial under plausible

assumptions.”    In their two-period life-cycle model, agents’ second period earnings are

uncertain. According to the way they label their equations, the government cuts taxes by

an amount T when workers are young and repays its borrowing by taxing workers when

old in proportion to their earnings.        Since agents have no way to insure their risky

earnings, the policy provides an element of intragenerational risk sharing and, thereby,

lowers precautionary saving and raises consumption when young. Barsky, Mankiw, and

Zeldes view this increase in consumption in response to the “tax cut” as a Keynesian

reaction to a Ricardian policy.

        While the points Barsky, Mankiw, and Zeldes make about consumption under

uncertainty are impeccable, their findings have nothing to do with “tax cuts,” “deficit

finance,” or “the timing of taxation.”       One can equally well describe their equations as

showing that there is a sizeable and very non-Keynesian consumption response to a tax

hike of size T. How? By labeling the policy as “raising taxes on the young by T and

making a loan to the young of T.” When the young are old, the government “receives

loan repayments of T plus interest” but makes a “transfer payment” of 2T less an amount

that is proportional to earnings at the same rate described by Barsky, et. al. as the tax rate.




                                                 33
Time Consistency

        Another question about the alleged arbitrary nature of fiscal labels is whether the

timing of “taxes” is better defined in a setting in which government policy is subject to

time-consistency problems.10 One way to demonstrate that it is not is to show that time

inconsistent policy can be modeled with no reference to “taxes,” “transfers,” or

“deficits.” Take, for example, an economy consisting of a generation that lives for two

periods and is under the control of a time inconsistent government in both periods.

Specifically, suppose the government has a social welfare function Wy(u1 ,u2,… ,un ) that

represents its preferences over the lifetime utilities of agents 1 through n when they are

young. Let Wo (u1 ,u2 , … ,un ) represent the government’s preferences when the agents are

old.   Further, assume that agent i’s utility is a function of her consumption when young

and old, ciy and cio , her leisure when young and old, liy and lio , and her enjoyment of

public goods when young and old, gy and go . Thus, ui = ui(ciy,cio ,liy,lio ,gy,go ). When the

cohort is old, the government will maximize Wo taking as given the consumption and

leisure and public goods that each agent enjoyed when young.

        If the Wo ( , , , ) and Wy( , , , ) functions differ, the government’s preferences will

be time inconsistent.      In this case, the young government (the government when the

cohort is young), will realize that the old government will exercise some control over the

consumption and leisure that agents will experience when old and use that control to

generate undesirable outcomes.        Consequently, the young government will use dynamic

programming to determine how the old government will make its decisions and the ways

in which it can indirectly control those decisions.


10
   Note that time consistency problems can be potentially resolved by having successive governments
purchase consistent behavior from their predecessors. See Kotlikoff, Persson, and Svensson (1988).


                                                 34
           The government, both when it is old and young, can use non-linear net payment

schedules to redistribute across agents and extract resources from agents.            If the

government is not able to identify particular agents, these net payment schedules will be

anonymous.       If government favors agents with particular unobservable characteristics,

such as low ability, it will condition its net payments schedules on observables, such as

earnings, that are correlated with those characteristics, and face self-selection constraitns

as in Mirrlees (1971).

           The government’s second-period optimization is also constrained by the amount

of second–period output, which depends on the economy’s second-period capital stock as

well as agents’ second-period labor supplies. The solution to this problem includes the

choice of go and as well as agent-specific second-period values of consumption and

leisure.     These choices are functions of second-period capital, and these functions are

used by the young government in setting policy; i.e., the young government considers

how its net payment schedules will affect the economy’s capital in the second period and,

thereby, the consumption, leisure, and the public goods enjoyed by different agents when

old.   In recognizing that the old government will control second-period outcomes, the

young government formulates a time-consistent policy.



An Example

           To make this point concrete, consider a simple model with two agents, a and b,

both of whom would earn w when young and old were they to work full time. The young

government supplies 2gy and the old government 2go in public goods.                 The two




                                             35
governments differ with respect to their preferences over the utilities of the two agents, ua

and ub . Specifically, assume that α>.5 and that

    (23)    Wo = αu a + (1 − α)u b

    (24)    Wo = (1 − α)u a + αu b

Suppose that utility is separable in public goods, consumption, and leisure and that the

utility of consumption and leisure is given by

    (25)    u i = log ciy + log l iy + θ (log c io + log l io ) for i = a and b

It's easy to show using dynamic programming that the consistent solution entails

                 cao      αRθ
   (26)              =
                 cay (1 − α)(1 + θ )

    (27)         wlay = c ay

    (28)         wlao = c ao

                                      w       g
                          (1 − α)( w +  − gy − o )
    (29)         c ay =               R        R ,
                                    1 +θ

where R stands for 1 plus the rate of return. A symmetric set of equations holds for the

consumption and leisure of agent b with α replaced by (1-α) and (1-α) replaced by α.

These government choices for consumption and leisure can be compared with the private

choices that would arise in the absence of government policy. Those private demands are

found by setting α, gy, and go to zero. Compared to the no-policy setting, the interaction

of the two governments distorts the intertemporal allocation of consumption and leisure

of the two agents. Agent a (b) ends up with higher (lower) ratios of consumption when




                                                   36
old to consumption when young and leisure when old to leisure when young. The reason,

of course, is that the old government redistributes toward agent a, while the young

government redistributes toward agent b.

        Having worked out the best lifetime allocations that it can achieve given the old

government’s ultimate control of second-period outcomes, the young government needs

to implement this time-consistent solution. Because it can announce non-linear as well as

non-differentiable net payment schedules, the above allocation can be decentralized in an

infinite number of ways. One way is to announce agent-specific lump-sum payments, ha

and hb , plus agent-specific payments per unit of expenditure on old-age consumption and

leisure, pa and pb .        In this case, the agents will perceive the following lifetime budget

constraints:

                            p a (c ao + wlao )      w
(30)    ( cay + wlay ) +                       = w + − ha
                                     R              R

                            p b ( cbo + wlbo )      w
(31)     ( cby + wlby ) +                      = w + − hb ,
                                     R              R

where

                               w                    g
(32)    ha = ( 2α − 1)( w +      ) + 2(1 − α)( g y + o )
                               R                     R

                               w              g
(33)    hb = (1 − 2α)( w +       ) + 2α( g y + o )
                               R               R

                1− α
(34)     pa =
                 α

                 α
(35)    pb =
                1− α

        Note that the two lump-sum payments add up to the present value of the

government’s purchase of public goods. Also note that since α>.5, agent a faces a lower


                                                     37
marginal payment on second-period expenditures than does agent b. It’s easy to show

that the marginal payments generate no net resources to the government.

         The fact that one can, as just shown, model time-inconsistent government

preferences without resort to the terms “deficit,” “taxes,” or “transfer payments” indicates

that whatever are the policies that arise in the model just described or in similar models,

they can be labeled any way one wants. Indeed, models of time consistency that cannot

be relabeled freely may be predicated on fiscal irrationality.               Consider, in this respect,

Fischer’s (1980) classic analysis of time-inconsistent capital-income taxation.

         Fischer’s model also features a single generation that consumes and works when

young and old and a government that wants to provide public goods.                        But unlike the

above model, all generation members are identical.                Fischer permits his government to

levy only proportional taxes on labor earnings when young and old and a tax on capital

holdings when old. These restrictions may seem benign, but they’re not. Why? Because

Fischer is saying that the old government can levy what from the perspective of the

second period is a non-distortionary tax on capital, but that it can’t levy the same non-

distortionary tax as part of a non-linear second-period earnings tax in which

inframarginal earnings are taxed at a different rate than are marginal earnings.11

         If one drops Fischer’s restriction and allows non-linear net payment schedules, his

model collapses to the above model with α=.5.                      In this case the young and old

governments agree and extract inframarginal net payments to pay for public goods.

Hence, Fischer’s economy ends up in a first-best equilibrium, in which no margins of

11
   Suppose, for example, that Fischer’s old government levies a tax of 50 units of the model’s good on
capital and a 15 percent proportional tax on labor earnings. From the perspective of second-period agents,
this is no different from a policy under which the government announces that it will not tax capital at all,




                                                    38
choice are distorted. This is a far cry from the third-best equilibrium Fischer proposes –

an equilibrium in which the government can only tax second-period earnings in a

distortionary manner and to avoid doing so, places very high, and possibly confiscatory

taxes on agents’ capital accumulation.           Agents naturally respond by saving little or

nothing.

           Do    Fischer’s   restrictions,   which    he   doesn’t     justify,   reflect   economic

considerations, or are they simply a subtle manifestation of fiscal illusion? One economic

argument in their behalf is that the governments he contemplates don’t have the ability to

observe individual earnings or capital holdings and are forced to collect net payments on

an anonymous basis.          For example, the governments might be able to collect net

payments from firms that are functions of the firms’ aggregate capital holdings and

aggregate wage payments, but not be able to collect net payments from individual agents.

This doesn’t immediately imply the absence of inframarginal labor earnings taxes since

the governments could, in addition to taxing the firms’ total wage bill at a fixed rate, levy

a fixed payment per employee on each firm, assuming the government can observe the

number of employees.          But, for argument’s sake, let’s assume the government can’t

observed the number of employees.

           In this case, can one still re-label fiscal flows in Fischer’s model without changing

anything fundamental? The answer is yes.              Take the first of Fischer’s two third-best

equilibria.     It entails a first-period proportional labor-earnings tax, a second-period

proportional capital levy, and no second-period labor-earnings tax.               Now starting from

this tax structure, suppose the government wants to “run” a smaller surplus. It can do so


but instead assess a 50 unit tax on the first dollar earned and a 15 percent tax on each dollar earned
thereafter.


                                                 39
by labeling first-period labor-income taxes of Ty as “a first-period “loan” to the

government of Ty plus a “second-period tax” of (1+r)Ty , where r is the rate of interest.

Since this second-period tax is calculated as a function of labor earnings when young, the

re-labeling alters no incentives to work when young.                          Nor does it change the

government’s cash flows, since the government still receives Ty in the first period as a

“loan” and uses the (1+r)Ty second-period “tax” receipt to repay “principal plus interest”

on its first-period “borrowing.”          The government has no reason to either a) renege on

repaying this debt or b) tax these debt holdings because in the second period it is getting

all the receipts it needs from its non-distortionary capital levy.12

         If the government is effecting its transactions through firms, it can borrow from

firms in the first period, repay the firms in the second period, and assess a tax in the

second period on the firms based on their first-period wage payments. In this case, the

firms will withhold and save enough of the worker’s first-period pre-tax wages so as to

be able to pay these extra second-period taxes. The firms will invest in the government

bonds and use the proceeds of those bonds to pay off the additional taxes.

         Fischer’s alternative third-best tax structure entails a confiscatory tax on all

physical capital accumulated for old age and positive first- and second-period labor-

earnings taxes. Can the government, also in this setting, postpone its taxes on first-period

labor earnings and get the young, or the firms on behalf of the young, to lend it what it

12
     If the government wants, instead, to announce a larger first-period surplus, it can raise the first-period
labor-income tax, lend the additional proceeds back to the young, and provide a second-period subsidy on
first-period labor earnings paid for with the proceeds of the loan repayment. Again, the old government has
no reason to renege on this second-period subsidy because it is already collecting all the resources it needs
via the non-distortionary capital levy. Alternatively, it can collect the second-period capital-income tax in
the form of a first-period tax on the acquisition of assets and then lend these additional first-period receipts
back to the young. This leaves the net payment of the young unchanged, and the second-period repayment
of principal plus interest on the loan gives the government the same second-period net receipts it has under
its initial wording.



                                                      40
would otherwise have collected as first-period taxes? The answer is yes.                       If the

government reneges on its debt repayment in the second-period, by either repudiating the

debt or levying a tax on holdings of debt, the old, or the firms on their behalf, won’t be

able to repay the taxes that are due in the second-period on first-period labor earnings

unless the government violates Fischer’s stricture against taxing second-period earnings

at other than a fixed rate that is independent of the level of earnings. To see this, note

that taxes levied on first-period labor earnings are, from the perspective of the second

period, lump-sum since first-period labor supply decisions have already been made. So

paying off the debt has no efficiency implications because the proceeds of this debt

repayment are immediately handed back to the old government in the form of a lump-

sum tax.      If the government were to renege on its debt and also tax first-period labor

earnings in the second period, it would force the old (the firms) to pay additional taxes

from the proceeds of their second-period labor earnings (their second-period wage

payments).        This would require a non-linear tax, which, again, is something that Fischer

seems to have ruled out a priori. The non-linear tax in this case would be a fixed

payment, independent of second-period labor earnings, plus a payment based on the level

of second-period labor earnings.



Voluntary vs. Involuntary Payments

        A final issue is whether the voluntary nature of private purchases of government

bonds makes debt labels meaningful.          This proposition is indirectly advanced in a very

interesting   article    by   Tabellini   (1991)    on   the   sustainability   of   intergenerational

redistribution.     In his model, the government wants to finance uniform transfer payments




                                                   41
to young parents by extracting payments from a subset of them, namely those that are

rich.   Unfortunately, Tabellini’s government can’t observe endowments, and were it to

force all young parents to make the same payment, it would defeat its purpose. Instead,

the government “borrows” from young parents, with the result that only those young

parents with large endowments voluntarily “lend” to the government. Tabellini notes that

these loans will be repaid when these rich parents are old. Why? Because their children

will join with them in voting for debt repayment since much of that repayment will come

from the children of the poor. In the course of showing that intragenerational distribution

considerations can help enforce intergenerational redistribution, Tabellini claims that this

same policy could not be implemented through a social security system, because a social

security tax would be compulsory.

        I disagree for the simple reason that social security tax payments need not be

compulsory.    Instead of announcing that is “borrowing,” Tabellini’s government could

equally well announce a payroll tax that is the same function of the young parents’

endowment as is their debt purchases.        The government would also announce social

security benefit payments that are set equal to the tax contributions plus the market rate

of return that would otherwise be paid on government bonds. True, the government can't

force the parents, when they are young, to pay social security taxes because the

government can't observe the parent's initial endowments. But there is no need to enforce

the tax collection; the same parents who would otherwise have purchased debt will want

to pay the tax because it will ensure them an old age social security benefit in a setting in

which they have no other means to save for old age.




                                             42
        Note that in many countries, payroll tax payments are in large part voluntary.

Workers can choose to work in the formal sector and pay those taxes or they can choose

to work in the informal sector and not pay. Another way to think about “enforcing” the

“tax” is for the government to announce a penalty, namely, disqualification from receipt

of the old-age transfer payment, so that formal-sector workers could choose not to

contribute without the fear of being sent to jail.     Note also that with this alternative

labeling, the children of the rich will want to enforce the payment of social security

benefits because their parents will otherwise lose out to the benefit of the children of the

poor.

        With Tabellini’s fiscal labels (case a), the government reports a deficit when the

parents are young. Under mine (case b), it reports a balanced budget. If it wanted to

report a surplus, it could a) announce a social security tax schedule that was, say, double

what would it announce in case b, but also announce that it would make loans to all tax

payers equal to one half of their tax contributions. When old, in this case c, the parents

would get twice the social security benefits that they'd get in case b, but they would have

to pay back their loans with interest.   If the government in Tabellini’s model wants to

report an even larger deficit (case d), it could borrow twice as much and announce that it

would provide a special transfer payment to its lenders equal to, say, one half of the loans

they provide. When old, these lenders would face an extra tax, equal to the special

transfer plus interest, with the proceeds of this tax subtracted out of the government's

repayment to the lenders.




                                             43
        In each of these cases, the net flows between each parent and the government in

each period is the same, so the voting choices of the young won't change. The only

change is the government's reported deficit/surplus.




Implications for Empirical Analyses of Deficits, Personal Saving, and Portfolio Choice

        The above demonstration that government debt and deficits are not well defined

has serious implications for the vast time-series literature that purports to connect these

aggregates to consumption, interest rates, and other macroeconomic variables.            This

literature is reviewed in Elmendorf and Mankiw (1998). The problem with these studies

is that they use wholly arbitrary measures of deficits and debts, which could just as well

be replaced by other equally arbitrary measures that have the opposite correlation with

the dependent variable.     Moreover, in the absence of any theoretical ground rules for

measuring the deficit, Eisner and Pieper (1984) and other economists have felt free to

”correct” the U.S. federal deficit in ways that substantiate their priors about the impact of

deficits on the economy.

        Empirical analysis of personal saving suffers from the same shortcoming.         The

measurement of personal saving is predicated on the measurement of personal disposable

income, which, in turn, depends on the measurement of taxes and transfer payments.

Since taxes and transfer payments can be freely defined, the nation’s personal saving rate

can be anything anyone wants it to be.        This fact casts a pall on studies like those of




                                               44
Bosworth, Burtless, and Sabelhaus (1991) and Gale and Scholz (1999) that purport to

“explain” or, at least illuminate, changes over time in the nation’s rate of personal saving.

          Finally, if government debt is not well defined, then the division of private

portfolios between stocks and bonds, including government bonds, is a matter of opinion,

not fact.      This calls into question studies that purport to identify risk preferences and

other portfolio determinants based on the shares of portfolios invested in bonds versus

stocks.



V. Generational Accounting

          Generational accounting was developed by Auerbach, Gokhale, and Kotlikoff

(1991) in response to the aforementioned problems of deficit accounting. The objective

of generational accounting’s is to measure the generational incidence of fiscal policy as

well as its sustainability and to do so in ways that are independent of fiscal taxonomy.

Generational accounting compares the lifetime net tax bills facing future generations with

that facing current newborns.        It also calculates the changes in generational accounts

associated with changes in fiscal policies. Both of these comparisons are label-free in the

sense that generate the same answer regardless of how government receipts and payments

are labeled.

          Although academics have spearheaded development of generational accounts,

much of the work has been done at the governmental or multilateral institutional level.

The U.S. Federal Reserve, the U.S. Congressional Budget Office, the U.S. Office of

Management and Budget, H.M. Treasury, the Bank of Japan, the Bundesbank, the

Norwegian Ministry of Finance, the Bank of Italy, the New Zealand Treasury, the




                                                 45
European Commission13 , the International Monetary Fund, and the World Bank have all

done generational accounting.       Much of the interest in generational accounting by these

institutions stems from the projected dramatic aging of OECD countries coupled with the

commitments of OECD governments to pay very high levels of social security and health

care benefits to the elderly.

          Generational accounting has also drawn considerable interest from academic and

government economists.          Haveman (1994), Congressional Budget Office (1995), Cutler

(1993), Diamond (1996), Buiter (1997), Shaviro (1997), Auerbach, Gokhale, and

Kotlikoff (1994), Kotlikoff (1997), Raffelhuschen (1998), and others have debated its

merits.

          Much of the interest in generational accounting is motivated by the extraordinary

aging of industrial societies that will, over the next few decades, make almost all of the

leading countries around the world look like present-day retirement communities.

Population aging per se is not necessarily a cause for economic concern, but population

aging in the presence of high and growing levels of government support for the elderly

makes early attention to the long-term fiscal implications of aging imperative.

          While generational accounting is a natural for old and aging countries, developing

countries, like Mexico and Thailand, which don’t face aging problems, have their own

reasons for examining generational accounting.           In particular, they realize that their

relative youth means they have more current and future young people to help bear

outstanding fiscal burdens and that viewed through the lens of generational accounting,

  The European Commission has an ongoing project to do generational accounting for EU member nations
under the direction of Bernd Raffelhueschen, Professor of Economics at Freiburg University. See
Raffelhueschen (1998).

their fiscal policies might look much more responsible relative to those of the developed

world.

         This section lays out generational accounting’s methodology, shows alternative

ways of measuring generational imbalances, stresses the importance of demographics in

generational accounting, discusses practical issues in constructing generational accounts,

shows examples of generational accounts and measures of generational imbalances,

points out the connection between generational accounting and traditional tax incidence

analysis, and mentions, along the way, a variety of concerns that have been raised about

this new form of fiscal appraisal.

In (36), Nt,k stands for the per capita generational account in year t of the generation born

in year k.    For generations currently alive, Nt,k denotes per capita remaining lifetime net

taxes discounted to the current year t. For generations not yet born, Nt,k refers to per

capita lifetime net taxes, discounted to the year of birth.           The term Pt,k stands for the

population in year t of the cohort that was born in year k. This first summation on the

left-hand side of (36) adds together the generational accounts of future generations,

discounted at rate r to the current year t. The second summation adds the accounts of



                                                  47
existing generations.     In actual applications of generational accounting, separate accounts

are calculated for males and females, but this feature is omitted from (36) to limit

notation.

        The first term on the right-hand side of (36) expresses the present value of

government purchases. In this summation the values of government purchases in year s,

given by Gs, are also discounted to year t.              The remaining term on the right-hand side,

Dtg , denotes the government's explicit net debt – its financial liabilities minus the sum of

its financial assets and the market value of its public enterprises based on whatever

arbitrary language conventions the government has adopted.



The Precise Formula for Generational Accounts

        The generational account Nt,k is defined by:

                                             k +D       P
                                    N t,k = ∑ T s, k
                                                         s, k
(37)                                                          (1 + r )-(s-t) ,
                                           s= max (t,k) P
                                                         t, k

where κ=max(t,k). The term Ts,k stands for the projected average net tax payment to the

government made in year s by a member of the generation born in year k.

        The term Ps,k/Pt,k indicates the proportion of members of cohort k alive at time t

who will also be alive at time s.14           Thus, it represents the probability that a particular

member of the year-k cohort who is alive in year t will survive to year s to pay the net

taxes levied, on average, in that year on year-k cohort members.                     Hence, Nt,k is an

actuarial present value. It represents the average value in the present of the amount of

14
   The population weights Ps,k incorporate both mortality and immigration, implicitly treating immigration
as if it were a “rebirth” and assigning the taxes paid by immigrants to the representative members of their
respective cohorts. This approach does not, therefore, separate the burdens of natives and immigrants. See



                                                    48
net taxes that members of cohort k will pay in the future, where the averaging is over not

just net tax payments, but also survivorship.



What Do Generational Accounts Exclude?

         Note that generational accounts reflect only taxes paid less transfer payments

received. With the exception of government expenditures on health care and education,

which are treated as transfer payments, the accounts do not impute to particular

generations the value of the government's purchases of goods and services.                      Why not?

Because it is difficult to attribute the benefits of such purchases. Therefore, the accounts

do not show the full net benefit or burden that any generation receives from government

policy as a whole, although they can show a generation's net benefit or burden from a

particular policy change that affects only taxes and transfers.                        Thus generational

accounting tells us which generations will pay for the government spending not included

in the accounts, rather than telling us which generations will benefit from that spending.

This implies nothing about the value of government spending; i.e., there is no

assumption, explicit or implicit, in the standard practice of generational accounting

concerning the value to households of government purchases.15



Assessing the Fiscal Burden Facing Future Generations

         Given the right-hand side of equation (36) and the second term on the left-hand-

side of equation (36), generational accountants determine, as a residual, the value of the


Ablett (1999) and Auerbach and Oreopoulos (1999) for applications of generational accounting that make
that separation as well as study a variety of fiscal issues associated with immigration.
15
    Raffelhüschen (1998) departs from this conventional approach to generational accounting of not
allocating the benefits of government purchases. Instead, he allocates these purchases on a per-capita basis.



                                                     49
first term on the left-hand side of equation (36) -- the collective payment, measured as a

time-t present value, required of future generations.            Given this amount, one can

determine the average present value lifetime net tax payment of each member of each

future cohort under the assumption that these lifetime net tax payments rise for members

of each successive future cohorts at the economy's rate of labor productivity growth, g.

Now, if labor productivity grows at g percent per year, so will real wages. Hence, the

lifetime labor income of each new cohort will be g percent larger than that of its

immediate predecessor.      So, in assuming that each successive cohort pays lifetime net

taxes that are g percent larger than those of its predecessor, one is assuming that each

successive future cohort pays the same share of its lifetime labor income in net taxes; i.e.,

one is assuming that each future cohort faces the same lifetime net tax rate.

            _
        Let N stand for the growth-adjusted generational account of future generations.

_
N is the amount each member of a future cohort would pay in lifetime net taxes if her

lifetime labor income were the same as that of a current newborn. The actual amount the

                                    _
cohort born in year t+1 will pay is N (1+g). The actual amount the cohort born in year

                _
t+2 will pay is N (1+g)2 . The actual amount the cohort born in year t+3 will pay is

_
N (1+g)3 , and so on.

                                               _
        Equation (38) can be used to solve for N .

_
N is the lifetime net tax payment of future generations adjusted for growth, so it is

directly comparable to that of current newborns, Nt,t. This comparison is also label-free

because alternative labeling conventions leave unchanged lifetime net payments.              If

_                                                  _
N equals Nt,t, generational policy is balanced. If N exceeds (is smaller than) Nt,t, future

generations face larger (smaller) growth-adjusted lifetime net tax burdens than do current

newborns.

        The assumption that the generational accounts of all future generations are equal,

except for a growth adjustment, is just one of many assumptions one could make about

the distribution across future generations of their collective net tax payments to the

government.     One could, for example, assume a phase-in of the additional fiscal burden

(positive or negative) to be imposed on future generations, allocating a greater share of

the burden to later future generations and a smaller share to earlier ones. Clearly, such a

phase-in would mean that generations born after the phase-in period has elapsed would

face larger values of lifetime burdens (the Nt,ks) than we are calculating here.



Alternative Ways to Achieve Generational Balance

        Another way of measuring the imbalance in fiscal policy is to ask what immediate

and permanent change in either a) government purchases or b) a specific tax (such as the

income tax) or transfer payment (such as old-age social security benefits) would be

necessary to equalize the lifetime growth-adjusted fiscal burden facing current newborns

and future generations.       Because such policies satisfy the government’s intertemporal


                                                 51
budget constraint, they also sustainable.

         To be more precise about this type of calculation, suppose one wants to find the

immediate and permanent percentage reduction in government purchases needed to

achieve generational balance. Denote this percentage reduction by z.                 Next, use equation

                                              _
(39) to solve for z under the assumption that N equals Nt,t.

As a second example, consider the immediate and permanent percentage increase in

income taxes needed to achieve generational balance. Call this percentage increase v.16

To determine the size of v, try different immediate and permanent income tax hikes until

you find the one with the following property: given the new values of generational

                                                                         _
accounts (the values inclusive of the tax hike), the calculated value of N equals Nt,t.                  In

contrast to the calculation of z, in this calculation of v , Nt,t, the generational account of

current newborns, is not held fixed.          Like the accounts of all other existing generations,

                                                                              _
Nt,t is higher because of the increase in the income tax. Consequently, so is N .




16
  To introduce v in equation (4) we’d have to express the generational accounts of current generations as a)
the present value of their future tax payments minus b) the present value of their future transfer payments
and simply multiply the expression for the present value of future tax payments by (1+v).


                                                    52
The Role of Demographics

        As can be seen in equations (23)-(26), demographics play a central role in

determining the size of the imbalance in generational policy.             Other things equal, the

                                                                                   _
larger the population sizes of future generations, the smaller will be the size of N , and,

therefore, the smaller will be the imbalance of generational policy. Ceteris paribus, larger

                                                            _
population sizes of current generations will raise or lower N depending on the sign of the

generational accounts these population totals are multiplying.              For example, if the

generational accounts of those over age 65 are negative, larger numbers of older people

                                  _
will make the calculated value of N larger.              A negative account means that the

government will, under current policy, pay more to a generation in transfer payments

than it receives in taxes.      Negative generational accounts for older generations is the

norm in industrialized countries because these generations receive more in state pension,

health, and other benefits over the remainder of their lives than they pay in taxes.

        What is the impact of the large number of baby boomers on generational

imbalance? Since these generations typically still have positive generational accounts,

                                                           _
they are contributing, on balance, to lowering the size of N and, thus, the imbalance in

generational policy.    On the other hand, since these generations are close to receiving

large net transfers from the government, the current values of their generational accounts

                                                                            _
are quite small.    Hence, the contribution they are making toward lowering N is small.

This is the channel through which the very sizable benefits that are due to be paid in

retirement to the enormous baby boom generation in industrialized countries constitute a



                                                 53
fiscal burden on young and future generations.



Inputs to Generational Accounting

        Producing generational accounts requires projections of population, taxes,

transfers, and government purchases, an initial value of government net debt, and a

discount rate.    Since generational accounting considers all levels of government -- local,

state, and federal -- the measures of taxes, transfers, and government purchases must be

comprehensive.       Government infrastructure purchases are treated like other forms of

purchases in the calculations.       Although such purchases provide an ongoing stream,

rather than a one-time amount, of services, they still must be paid for.        Generational

accounting clarifies which generation or generations will have to bear the burden of these

and other purchases. Government net debt is calculated net of the current market value of

state enterprises.    This value is determined by capitalizing the net profits of those

businesses.      In contrast to the treatment of the market value of state enterprises,

government net debt does not net out the value of the government’s existing

infrastructure, such as parks, highways, and tanks. Including such assets would have no

impact on the estimated fiscal burden facing future generations because including these

assets would require adding to the projected flow of government purchases an exactly

offsetting flow of imputed rent on the government’s existing infrastructure.

        Taxes and transfer payments are each broken down into several categories. The

general rule regarding tax incidence is to assume that taxes are borne by those paying the

taxes, when the taxes are paid: income taxes on income, consumption taxes on

consumers, and property taxes on property owners. There are two exceptions here, both




                                                 54
of which involve capital income taxes.              First, as detailed in Auerbach, Kotlikoff, and

Gokhale (1991), one should, data permitting, distinguish between marginal and infra-

marginal capital income taxes.         Specifically, infra-marginal capital income taxes should

be distributed to existing wealth holders, whereas marginal capital income taxes should

be based on future projected wealth holdings.               Second, in the case of small open

economies, marginal corporate income taxes are assumed to be borne by (and are

therefore allocated to) labor.       The general rule for allocating transfer payments is to

allocate them to those who directly receive them.

        The typical method used to project the average values of particular taxes and

transfer payments by age and sex starts with government forecasts of the aggregate

amounts of each type of tax (e.g., payroll) and transfer payment (e.g., welfare benefits) in

future years.   These aggregate amounts are then distributed by age and sex based on

relative age-tax and age-transfer profiles derived from cross-section micro data sets. For

years beyond those for which government forecasts are available, age- and sex-specific

average tax and transfer amounts are generally assumed to equal those for the latest year

for which forecasts are available, with an adjustment for growth.

        Equation (40) helps clarify the method of distributing annual tax or transfer

aggregates in a particular year to contemporaneous cohorts.               Again, to simplify the

presentation we abstract from the distinction between sexes that we consider in the actual

calculations.

                           t , t , t − s t, t − s

In (40), Ht stands for an aggregate tax or transfer amount in year t. Let’s assume it stands

for total income tax payments to make the example concrete. The term Tt, is the average


                                                    55
amount of income tax paid in year t. Rt,t-s is the relative distribution profile for income

taxes in year t.      Specifically, it stands for ratio of the average income tax payment of

members of the cohort born in year t-s to the average income tax payment in year t.

Finally, Pt,t-s stands for the number of people in year t who were born in year t-s, i.e., it is

the population size of the age t-s cohort. Given Ht and the values of the Rt,t-s and Pt,t-s

terms, one can use equation (41) to solve for Tt.                To form Tt,t-s, the terms that enter

equation (37) that are used to calculate each current generation’s account, note that

Discount Rates and Uncertainty

        For base-case calculations, generational accountants typically use a real rate of

discount around 5 percent, a rate that exceeds the real government short-term borrowing

rate in most developed countries.               This rate seems justified given the riskiness of the

flows being discounted.              However, the “right” discount rate to use is in sufficient

question to merit presenting results based on a range of alternative discount rates – a

practice routinely followed by those constructing generational accounts.

        The appropriate discount rate for calculating the present value of future

government revenues and expenditures depends on their uncertainty.                  If all such flows

were certain and riskless, it would clearly be appropriate to discount them using the

prevailing term-structure of risk-free interest rates.          However, even in this simple and

unrealistic case, such discounting could be problematic since it would require knowing

the values of this term structure.             To discern these values, one might examine the real

yields paid on short-term, medium-term, and long-term inflation-indexed government



                                                      56
bonds. But this presupposes the existence of such bonds. Many countries do not issue

indexed bonds, and those that do don’t necessarily issue indexed bonds of all maturities.

         In the realistic case in which countries’ tax revenues and expenditures are uncertain,

discerning the correct discount rate is even more difficult. In this case, discounting based on the

term structure of risk-free rates (even if it is observable) is no longer theoretically justified.

Instead, the appropriate discount rates would be those that adjust for the riskiness of the stream in

question. Since the riskiness of taxes, spending, and transfer payments presumably differ, the

theoretically appropriate risk-adjusted rates at which to discount taxes, spending, and transfer

payments would also differ. This point carries over to particular components of taxes, spending,

and transfer payments, whose risk properties may differ from those of their respective

aggregates.17     Moreover, if insurance arrangements are incomplete, the appropriate risk

adjustments would likely be generation-specific. Unfortunately, the size of these risk adjustments

remains a topic for fortune research. In the meantime, generational accountants have simply

chosen to estimate generational accounts for a range of discount rates.



Illustrating Generational Accounts -- the Case of the U.S.

         In their recent calculation of U.S. generational accounts, Gokhale, Page, Potter,

and Sturrock (2000) used the latest long-term projections of The Congressional Budget

Office (CBO) with one modification.                 They assumed that U.S. federal discretionary

17
   To see this, consider a government policy in the two-period life-cycle model of borrowing from the
young at time t and using the proceeds to purchase stock from the young. When the young are old the
government repays the principal it borrowed by selling its shares and making up the difference between its
interest obligations and the return (including capital gain) on its stock as a net tax payment. This entire set
of transactions entails no net payments from the government to generation t either when it is young or old.
However, net tax payments will, on average, be negative when generation t is old, since stocks average a
higher return than bonds. If one discounts the safe and risky components of the net tax payments at their
appropriate and different risk-adjusted discount rates, the present value of future net tax payments will be
zero. This is what one would want generational accounting to show, since the policy simply involves the
government borrowing stock from the young and returning it (including its return) when they are old; i.e.,
the policy entails no increase in lifetime net payments. But were one to mistakenly discount the total of




                                                      57
spending would grow with the economy. Table 1 reports generational accounts on this

basis, constructed using a 4.0 percent real discount rate and assuming a 2.2 percent rate of

growth of labor productivity. This discount rate is roughly the current prevailing rate on

long-term inflation-indexed U.S. government bonds, and the productivity growth rate is

the one currently being projected by the CBO. The accounts are for 1998, but are based

on the CBO projections available as of January 2000.

         Table 1 shows, for males and females separately, the level and composition of the

accounts. Recall that the accounts are present values discounted, in this case, to 1998.

As an example, consider the $112,300 account of 25 year-old males in 1998.                             This

amount represents the present value of the net tax payments that 25 year-old males will

pay, on average, over the rest of their lives.

         The generational accounts for both males and females peak at age 25 and become

negative for females at age 50 and for males after at age 60. The accounts for those

younger than age 25 are smaller because they have a longer time to wait to reach their

peak tax-paying years. The accounts are also smaller for those above age 25 because

they are closer in time to receiving the bulk of their transfer payments. By age 10 for

males and age 30 for females, Medicare and Social Security benefits are the two most

important forms of transfer payments, if one uses the government’s fiscal taxonomy.

         The only figures in this table that aren’t a function of labeling conventions are the

lifetime net tax rate of future generations and of newborns.                The denominators in these

lifetime tax rates are the present value of lifetime earnings. And they are constructed by

pooling the net tax payments and labor earnings of males and females. In the case of


expected net taxes in old age at a single discount rate, the value of the change in the generational account
would be non zero.


                                                    58
future generations, the present value to 1998 of all future net taxes of all future

generations is divided by the present value to 1998 of the labor earnings of all future

generations.



The Imbalance in U.S. Generational Policy

         For newborns the lifetime net tax rate is 22.8 percent. For future generations it is

32.3 percent. So future generations face a lifetime net tax rate that is 41.6 percent higher

than that facing current newborns.18           Stated differently, future generations, according to

current policy, are being asked to pay almost a dime more per dollar earned than are

current newborns.

         In thinking about the magnitude of the U.S. generational imbalance, it’s important

to keep in mind that the lifetime net tax rate facing future generations under current

policy assumes that all future generations pay this same rate.                 If, instead, one were to

assume that generations born, say, over the next decade are treated the same as current

newborns, the net tax rate for generations born in 2010 and beyond would be higher than

32.3 percent.



Policies to Achieve Generational Balance in the U.S.

         Table 2 considers five alternative policies that would achieve generational balance

in the U.S. The first is a 31 percent immediate and permanent rise in federal personal and

corporate income taxes. Had the U.S. adopted this policy in 2000, the federal surplus


         18
             This is a very sizeable imbalance, but it’s nevertheless smaller than the imbalance estimated in
the early 1990s. The decline in the imbalance reflects policy changes and much more optimistic long-term
fiscal projections.



                                                     59
reported by the government for that year would have more than doubled. Hence, based

on the government’s fiscal language, the year-2000 surplus was far too small compared to

that needed to achieve generational balance.

          Rather than raising just federal income taxes, one could raise all federal, state, and

local taxes.     In this case, an across-the-board tax hike of 12 percent could deliver

generational balance.      Cutting all Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps,

unemployment insurance benefits, welfare benefits, housing support, and other transfer

payments by 21.9 percent is another way to eliminate the generational imbalance. Two

final options considered in the table are immediately and permanently cutting all

government purchases by 21 percent or cutting just federal purchases by 66.3 percent.

          Cutting government purchases to achieve generational balance would leave future

generations paying in net taxes the same 22.8 percent share of lifetime earnings as current

newborns are expected (under current policy) to pay. In contrast, either raising taxes or

cutting transfer payments would mean higher lifetime net tax rates for those now alive.

As Table 2 indicates, these alternative policies would leave newborns and all future

generations paying roughly 27 cents out of every dollar earned in net taxes. This net tax

rate is over 4 cents more per dollar earned than newborns are now forced to pay. The

payoff from having newborns as well as everyone else who is currently alive pay more in

net taxes, is a reduction in net tax rate facing future generations by 5 to 6 cents per dollar

earned.



Achieving Generational Balance in 22 Countries




                                                60
       The United States is certainly not alone in running imbalanced generational

policies. Table 3, abstracted from Kotlikoff and Raffelhüschen (1999), reports alternative

immediate and permanent policy changes that would achieve generational balance in 21

countries. According to the second column in the table, 13 of the 22 countries need to cut

their non-educational government spending by over one fifth if they want to rely solely

on such cuts to achieve generational balance. This group includes the United States and

Japan and the three most important members of the European Monetary Union: Germany,

France, and Italy. Four of the 13 countries – Austria, Finland, Spain, and Sweden -- need

to cut their non-education purchases by more than half, and two countries -- Austria and

Finland – need to cut this spending by more than two thirds!           Bear in mind that

generational accounting includes regional, state, local, and federal levels of government.

So the cuts being considered here are equal proportionate cuts in all levels of government

spending.

       Not all countries suffer from generational imbalances.   In Ireland, New Zealand,

and Thailand future generations face a smaller fiscal burden, measured on a growth-

adjusted basis, than do current ones given the government’s current spending projections.

Hence, governments in those countries can spend more over time without unduly

burdening future generations.    There are also several countries in the list, including

Canada and the United Kingdom, with zero or moderate generational imbalances as

measured by the spending adjustment needed to achieve perfect balance. What explains

these tremendous cross-country differences? Fiscal policies and demographics differ

dramatically across countries.   The U.S., for example, has experienced and is likely to

continue to experience rapid health-care spending.      Japan’s health care spending is




                                            61
growing less rapidly, but it’s aging much more quickly.            The United Kingdom has a

policy of keeping most transfer payments fixed over time in real terms.                 Germany is

dealing with the ongoing costs of reunification.

        One alternative to cutting spending is cutting transfer payments.                In Japan,

education, health care, social security benefits, unemployment benefits, disability

benefits, and all other transfer payments would need to be immediately and permanently

slashed by 25 percent. In the U.S., the figure is 20 percent. In Brazil, it’s 18 percent. In

Germany, it’s 14 percent. And in Italy it’s 13 percent.            These and similar figures for

other countries represent dramatic cuts and would be very unpopular.

        So too would tax increases. If Japan were to rely exclusively on across-the-board

tax hikes, tax rates at all levels of government (regional, state, local, and federal) and of

all types (value added, payroll, corporate income, personal income, excise, sales,

property, estate, and gift) would have to rise overnight by over 15 percent. In Austria and

Finland, they’d have to rise by over 18 percent. If these three countries relied solely on

income tax hikes, they had to raise their income tax rates by over 50 percent! In France

and Argentina, where income tax bases are relatively small, income tax rates would have

to rise by much larger percentages. In contrast, Ireland could cut its income tax rates by

about 5 percent before it needed to worry about over burdening future generations. The

longer countries wait to act, the harder will be their ultimate adjustment to fiscal reality.

As an example, the United Kingdom needs to raise income taxes by 9.5 percent if it acts

immediately. But if it waits 15 years, the requisite income tax hike is 15.2 percent.



How Well Does Generational Accounting Measure True Fiscal Incidence?




                                                   62
       One concern about generational accounting is the accuracy of its implicit

incidence assumptions.     Fehr and Kotlikoff (1997) use the Auerbach-Kotlikoff (1987)

dynamic general equilibrium life-cycle model, described below, to compare changes in

generation accounts with true fiscal incidence.    Tables 3 and 4, taken from their paper,

use the closed-country version of the Auerbach-Kotlikoff model to illustrate the

relationship between changes in generation’s utilities, measured in units of current

consumption, and changes in their generational accounts. The tables consider the effect

of a shift in the tax structure.     Specifically, the economy switches from having a 20

percent income tax to having a 15 percent income tax plus a consumption tax where the

revenue loss from lowering the income-tax rate is covered by the consumption tax.

Government spending on goods and services is held fixed per capita in the simulation.

       In the first year of the economy’s transition the consumption tax rate is 6.4

percent. Over time it drops to 6.1 percent. In the long run, the economy’s capital stock,

wage rate, and interest rate end up 8.2 percent higher, 2.1 percent higher, and 5.6 percent

lower, respectively.     This crowding-in of the capital stock reflects the shift in the tax

burden from initial young and future generations to initial older generations. Table 4

shows how key economic variables evolve other time in the model.

       Table 4 compares changes in generational accounts with the true policy incidence.

As is clear from the table, generational accounts, in this case, do a very good job in

capturing the general pattern of the generation-specific utility changes. They do less well

for certain generations in capturing the precise magnitude of their welfare changes. The

changes in generational accounts match up fairly closely to the changes in utility for

those initially over age 25. For younger and future generations, the match is much less




                                              63
good. In this simulation, generational accounting provides a lower bound estimate of the

absolute change in welfare of those born in the long run. The reason is that policy that

raise the economy’s capital stock are generally policies that redistribute from the initial

old to the initial young and future generations. Since a higher long-run degree of capital

intensity means a higher long-run wage, the direct redistribution from those alive in the

long run, captured by generational accounting, will understate the improvement in

welfare of those born in the long run.            In addition to missing this long-run general

equilibrium   action,   Fehr    and   Kotlikoff        show   that   generational   accounting,   as

conventionally applied, omits the efficiency gains and losses arising from fiscal reforms.

For particular reforms these efficiency effects can be important components of the

policy’s overall incidence effects.       Fehr and Kotlikoff conclude that the incidence

assumptions used in generational accounting needs to be augmented to incorporate both

efficiency and general equilibrium feedback effects.



Generational Accounting and Monetary Policy

         One of the net taxes that are allocated in forming generational accounts is the

seignorage the government collects from the private sector in printing and spending

money.     When it prints and spends money, the government acquires real goods and

services, but it also precipitates a rise in the price level that would not otherwise have

occurred. This real gain to the government is a loss to the private sector that comes in the

form of a reduction in the real value of their holdings of money.

         The government can also garner resources from the private sector by deflating the

real value of its official nominal liabilities as well as implicit nominal transfer payment




                                                  64
obligations. On the other hand, it can lose resources by deflating away the real value of

tax receipts that are fixed in nominal terms. Finally, governments can use the printing of

money and its associated inflation to reduce the real value of their spending on goods and

services to the extent this spending is fixed in nominal terms. Each of the ways in which

governments use monetary policy as a fiscal instrument can and have been incorporated

in generational accounting.       For example, the hidden seignorage tax is allocated across

cohorts by using data on average real money balances by age and sex.

         Generational accounting can also be used to help determine the likely course of

future monetary policy.      Countries with very large generational imbalances are countries

that are likely to have to print large quantities of money to help “pay” their bills. Indeed,

generational accounting can be used to determine the amount of money creation needed

to achieve a generationally balanced and sustainable policy.                    Hence, generational

accounting should be of as much importance and interest to monetary authorities as it is

to fiscal authorities.



VI. Simulating Generational Policy

         The advent of high-speed computers has transformed generational policy analysis.

Today researchers around the world are constructing large-scale dynamic simulation

models to assess how policy changes would affect macroeconomic outcomes as well as

the intra- and intergenerational distributions of welfare.19             This section illustrate the

                                                  65
effects of two generational policies – the wholesale shift from income to consumption

taxation and the wholesale privatization of social security, with the accrued liabilities of

the old system financed via a consumption tax.           Both of these policies effect major

redistributions across generations. Indeed, it is hard to contemplate policies with greater

potential to redistribute across generations.

        There are three key questions that these and similar simulations address.         First,

how large are the macroeconomic effects of policies of this magnitude? Second, how

long does it take for these effects to occur? Third, how large are the welfare changes

visited on different generations as well as on particular members of those generations?

        The illustration is based on the Auerbach-Kotlikoff-Smetters-Walliser (AKSM)

model. The AKSM model descended from the Auerbach-Kotlikoff (1987) (AK) model.

The AK model featured 55 overlapping generations with a single representative agent in

each cohort. Unlike the steady-state and myopic transition models developed by Upton

and Miller (1974), Kotlikoff (1979), Summers (1981), Seidman (1983), Hubbard and

Judd (1987), and others, the AK model solved for the economy’s perfect foresight

transition path.    The solution is found using an iterative convergence algorithm that

begins by guessing the time-paths of factor demands, endogenous tax rates, and other key

endogenous variables. The algorithm then uses these guesses to generate the time-path of

factor prices and marginal net prices. These variables are fed into the supply side of the

model where households determine how much to save and work. These micro decisions,

when aggregated, deliver a time-path of economy-wide factor supplies that is compared

with the initial guess of the time-path of factor demands. If the supply of factors equals

the demand for factors each period, a dynamic equilibrium has been determined.




                                                66
Otherwise, the algorithm averages the initial guessed time-path of factor demands and the

associate time-path of factor supplies to form a new guess of the time-path of factor

demands, and the iteration continues.

       The AKSM model uses the same solution technique of the original AK model, but

it differs in two important respects.20 First, it follows the lead of Fullerton and Rogers

(1993) by incorporating intra- as well as intergenerational inequality.      Specifically, the

model posits 12 different earnings groups within each cohort. The groups are labeled 1

through 12, with earnings higher for groups referenced with a higher number. Groups 1

and 12 represent the lowest and highest 2 percent of earners. Groups 2 and 11 are the

next lowest and next highest sets of earners, but each constitutes 8 percent of earners.

And groups 3 through 10 each constitute 10 percent of earners.         The new model also

approximates U.S. fiscal institutions much more closely. Second, it includes an array of

tax-base reductions, a progressive Social Security system, and a Medicare system.



Switching from Income to Consumption Taxation

       Tables 5 and 6, extracted from Altig, et. al. (2001), shows some of the AKSW

model’s results from simulating the complete replacement of the current U.S. personal

and corporate federal income taxes with an equal revenue proportional consumption tax.

Given the above discussion of deficit delusion, it’s important to point out that the term

“revenue” here is based on the U.S. federal government’s fiscal language.              Under

alternative labeling conventions, reported tax revenue would be dramatically larger or

smaller than what the government says it is collecting and a “revenue-neutral” switch in




                                             67
tax bases, which did not try to preserve the same changes in generational accounts and

economic incentives, would have different economic effects.                  That said, the tax reform

considered here entails a major redistribution across generations because it confronts

those rich and middle class retirees alive at the time of the reform with a much greater

remaining lifetime net tax burden than would otherwise be the case. Low-income retirees

are, on the other hand, largely insulated from the policy because their social security

benefits are adjusted in the model to retain their original purchasing power.

         Table 5 reports macroeconomic effects, while Table 6 shows welfare effects for

five of the twelve lifetime earnings classes. Note that income class 1 refers to the poorest

members of each cohort (those with the smallest endowment of human capital), and

income class 12 refers to the richest members of each cohort (those with the largest

endowment of human capital.) The horizontal axis locates cohorts by their years of birth

measured relative to the reform, which occurs in year zero.                    The welfare change are

measured as equivalent variations, specifically the percentage change in full remaining

lifetime economic resources that an agent living under the old policy regime (living in the

initial steady state) would need to achieve the same level of remaining lifetime utility as

she/he experiences under the new policy.

         The macroeconomic effects of the tax reform are significant. In the long run, the

economy’s capital stock, labor supply, and output are larger by 25.4 percent, 4.6 percent,

and 9.4 percent, respectively. However, getting reasonably close to this new steady state

takes a while.      For example, achieving half of the ultimate increase in the capital stock

takes about 15 years.

20
  There is also a new demographic version of the AKSM model (Kotlikoff, Smetters, and Walliser 2000),
not used here, that provides a much more realistic modeling of fertility and lifespan than in the original AK



                                                     68
         The policy’s capital deepening raises pre-tax wages by 4.6 percent and lowers the

pre-tax return to capital by 100 basis points. The expansion of the economy permits a

decline in the consumption tax rate from an initial rate of 16.6 percent to a final rate of

14.5 percent.      Measured on a wage-tax equivalent basis, the long-run consumption tax

rate is 12.7 percent. This is substantially below the initial steady-state’s 21.4 percent

average marginal tax rate on wage income. It’s even further below the 34.0 percent peak

marginal wage tax faced by those in the top earnings class.

         As Table 6 shows, the tax reform effects a major redistribution across generations,

but one that differs markedly for the lifetime poor and rich. In forcing rich (e.g., earnings

class 12) initial retirees to pay a high consumption tax rate, the policy, in effect, taxes

their accumulated wealth.          This lowers their remaining lifetime utility.21              In contrast,

members of this earnings class that are born in the new long-run steady state experience a

4 percent increase in their lifetime utilities measured relative to their welfare in the

absence of the reform. For the lowest earnings class, the generational incidence pattern is

the opposite. The initial poor retirees experience a small welfare improvement, but future

members of this class are worse off. The reason is that the consumption-tax structure is

much less intragenerationally progressive than the original income-tax structure.                         The

generational incidence pattern for the other earnings groups in the top (bottom) half of the

earnings distributions is similar, but less pronounced than that for earnings group 12 (1).



Social Security’s Privatization


model and that can initial simulations from non steady-state positions.
21
   The simulated model includes capital adjustment costs, which limit the economic losses to initial elderly
generations. The reason is that they own much of the economy’s existing capital stock and this capital




                                                     69
         The U.S. Social Security System faces a grave long-term financial crisis, the full

dimension of which is not well known. Paying out benefits on an ongoing basis requires

an immediate and permanent increase of roughly 50 percent in the OASDI payroll tax

rate.22 The United States is now embarked in a national debate about how to save Social

Security. Options here include cutting benefits, raising the payroll tax, and privatizing all

or part of the system by allowing people to contribute to individual accounts. The key

issues in this debate are how any policy, including maintaining the status quo, will affect

the macro economy as well as rich and poor members of current and future generations.

         Table 7 extracted from Kotlikoff, Smetters, and Walliser (2001), illustrate the A-

K OLG Model’s analysis of the effects of social security’s privatization.                                The table

considers privatizing the U.S. system and financing the 45-year transition, during which

social security benefits are gradually phased out, with a consumption tax.                             The policy

generates sizeable long-run increases of 39 percent and 13 percent in the economy’s

capital stock and output, respectively. But the half-life of the policy is 30 years, roughly

twice the half-life of the tax reform just considered. The transition takes longer because

the policy phases in gradually over time.

         Table 8 shows that these long-run gains are not free. They come at the price of

lower utility to initial older and middle-aged generations. All those alive in the long run,

including the richest (group 12) and poorest (group 1) agents, are better off. Since the

system being privatized features a highly progressive benefit schedule, but also a highly

regressive tax schedule (due to the ceiling on taxable earnings), the fact that the long-run

poor are better off is particularly interesting.                  It shows that paying off the existing


experiences a rise in its relative price because it is a relatively scarce factor with respect to installing
additional capital.



                                                         70
system’s benefit liabilities in a more progressive manner (by making initial rich and

middle income elderly contribute to that cause) outweighs the loss the long-run poor

incur from not receiving benefits based on social security’s progressive benefit schedule.

           The long-run poorest earnings group experiences a 6.0 percent rise in lifetime

utility. This is a substantial welfare change; it means that were social security not to be

privatized, providing this group with the same welfare improvement would require a 6

percent increase in their consumption and leisure in each year they are alive. The long-

run richest earnings group enjoys a 4.4 percent improvement in its lifetime utility.         The

biggest winners from the reform are those in the upper middle classes (groups 6 though

9) alive in the long run.          Their welfare gains are roughly 8 percent.   Like their poorer

contemporaries, these groups enjoy the higher real wages delivered by the privatization.

But the removal of social security means more because, compared with their

contemporaries, they faced the highest rate of lifetime net social security taxation.        The

costs of delivering these long-run welfare gains are visited on the initial middle-class and

high-income elderly as well as all initial workers. The largest losses amount to about 3

percent of remaining lifetime resources.

           The two simulations just presented provide a sense of the maximum potential

macroeconomic and redistributive effects of generational policy.         The reasons are a) the

policies are radical, b) they entail major intergenerational redistribuiton, and c) they

significantly improve marginal economic incentives to work and save.            But as described

in Altig, et. al. (2001) and Kotlikoff, Smetters, and Walliser (2001), the benefits available

to future generations from tax reform or social security’s privatization can easily be

dissipated by providing transition relief to early generations. In the case of consumption-

22
     See Gokhale and Kotlikoff (2001).

                                                  71
tax reform, such relief could come in the form of exempting the initial elderly from

paying taxes when they purchase consumption with existing assets.23 In the case of

privatizing social security, transition relief could come in the form of the delaying the

imposition of a new tax to cover the loss of revenues arising from having workers make

their social security contributions to private accounts.            Such a policy permits workers

close to retirement to gain at the expense of subsequent generations.



VII. Ricardian Equivalence

        Ricardian equivalence refers to the proposition that private intergenerational

transfers will undo government intergenerational transfers making generational policy

entirely ineffectual and generational accounting a waste of time.                   The proposition is

appropriately attributed to David Ricardo who, in discussing whether to borrow or tax to

finance a war, wrote that “in point of economy, there is no real difference in either of the

modes …”24 More precisely, in comparing a one-time war tax of £1,000 and a perpetual

tax of £50 to pay interest on borrowing of £1,000, Ricardo said that “if he (the payee)

leaves his fortune to his son, and leaves it charged with this perpetual tax, where is the

difference whether he leaves him £20,000, with the tax, or £19,000 without it?”25

        While Ricardo realized that bequests could be raised or lowered to undo

government intergenerational redistribution, he was skeptical that such behavior would

arise in practice. For in his next sentence he says “The argument of charging posterity


23
   If consumption taxation was instituted (i.e., labeled) by the government as a tax on income with 100
percent expensing of new investment/saving (i.e., as taxing output minus saving, which equals
consumption), transition relief could come in the form of grandfathering the investment incentives provided
to existing capital under the prior tax structure.

equivalence as an empirically relevant phenomenon.

with the interest on our debt, or of relieving them from a portion of such interest, is often

used by otherwise well informed people, but we confess we see no weight in it.”26



Barro’s Proof of the Irrelevance Proposition

             Ricardo would presumably have included Robert Barro (1974) in the category of

“otherwise well informed people,” notwithstanding the latter’s elegant and influential

derivation of the former’s irrelevance proposition.                                      Barro’s derivation begins by positing

that the utility of one generation depends not only on the goods (including leisure) it

consumes over its lifetime, but also the utility of its children. In the two-period model,

this function is

(42)                u t = u( c yt , c ot +1 , l yt , l ot +1 , u t +1 ) .

Writing the corresponding expression for ut+1 and substituting into (42) and then doing

the same for ut+2 and all other future utility functions leads to the following infinite

horizon utility function whose arguments consist of all future values of consumption and

leisure:

(43)                u t = u( c yt , cot +1 , l yt , l ot +1 , c yt +1 , c ot +1 , l yt+1 , l ot + 2 ,...)

             Thus, Barro’s simple and seemingly quite natural formulation of intergenerational

altruism has the striking implication that those alive today will care not only about their

own levels of consumption and leisure, but also the consumption and leisure of their

children, grandchildren, and all subsequent descendents.                                            The generation alive at time t

takes its inheritance, bt, as given and chooses consumption when young and old as well as

bequests (or intervivos transfers) when old, bt+1 , to maximize (43) subject to

where Rs+1 discounts flows at time s+1 to time s.

          To make Barro’s point about the irrelevance of generational policy, (44) includes

a policy, announced at time t, of giving an amount hs at time s≥t+1 to the

contemporaneous old and taking that same sum from the contemporaneous young. The

generation alive at time t+1 faces the analogous budget constraint, except it includes the

receipt when young of the government’s net payment.

(45) c yt+1 + wt +1l yt+1 + Rt + 2 ( cot + 2 + wt + 2 l ot + 2 + bt + 2 ) = bt +1 − ht +1 + wt +1T + Rt + 2 ( ht + 2 + wt + 2 T )

If one solves for bt+1 in (45) and substitutes for that variable in (44), the terms involving

ht+1 drop out.          The resulting expression now involves bt+2 , which can be eliminated by

solving for bt+2 from the time t+2 version of (45).                              Doing so leads ht+2 to drop out.

Proceeding indefinitely in this manner leads to the extended family’s infinite horizon

constraint:

(46)

                   c ot +1 + wt +1 l ot +1                   c + wt +1 l ot +1                      w T
c yt + wt l yt +                           + c yt + wt l yt + ot +1            + ... = bt + wt Tt + t +1 + ... .
                          1 + rt +1                                1 + rt +1                       1 + rt +1

The extended family maximizes (43) subject to (46).                               Since all the terms involving the

government’s generational policy have dropped out of (46), generational policy has no

impact whatsoever on the economy.                              Operationally, the extended family nullifies

generational policy by raising its bequests at time s≥t+1 by hs.                                    Note that hs can be

positive or negative. Generations that receive a positive net payment when old bequeath

these receipts to their children. The children, in turn, use this inheritance to make their

net payments to the government; i.e., the children’s payment to the government is given



                                                               74
to their parents who hand it back to the children. Since bequests can be negative as well

as positive, we can also describe the change in bequests as the children reducing their

own private transfers to their parents. If the government’s net payment to the elderly is

negative, the elderly will respond by cutting back on their bequests to their children;

alternatively, their children will hand the positive net payment they receive from the

government to their parents.



Theoretical Objections to the Barro Framework

        Barro’s model ignores four interrelated issues whose consideration undermine, if

not vitiate, his result. First, the model ignores marriage. Second, it ignores differences in

preferences among extended family members.         Third, it assumes symmetric information

across family members about each others’ incomes. Fourth, it ignores uncertainty.

        The fact that it takes two to tango means that marriage entails at least two sets of

parents, both of which may be altruistically linked to the married couple, but may have

no particular interest in each other. One way to model intergenerational transfers in this

context is to assume that each set of in-laws takes the other’s transfers to their children as

given. But as shown in Kotlikoff (1983) and Bernheim and Bagwell (1988), this Nash

assumption implies the effective altruistic linkage of the two sets of in-laws. And if the

in-laws have other children, the original in-laws will become altruistically linked with the

all of the other children’s in-laws as well. Hence, if altruism were as widespread as Barro

posits, essentially everyone would be altruistically interlinked with everyone else around

the world as a consequence of marriage within groups and intermarriage across racial,

ethnic, religious, and national lines.




                                              75
          The resource sharing arising from altruistic linkage means that each interlinked

household’s consumption and leisure is determined by the collective resources of all

extended family members. State differently, the distribution of resources across extended

family members makes no difference to the distribution of consumption and leisure of

those members.       Thus, the Barro model implies that the consumption of a randomly

chosen person in Nashville, Tennessee should depend on the income of a randomly

chosen person in Almati, Kazakhstan.

          The source of this patently absurd prediction is the assumption that each extended

family takes the transfers of other extended family members as given. The difficulty with

this assumption becomes apparent if one compares two parties who each care so strongly

about each other that each wants to transfer to the other. Taking each other’s transfers as

given may lead to an infinite handing back and forth of funds between the two parties;

i.e., the problem may have no solution. Of course, in the real world, such situations are

handled by would-be recipients simply refusing to receive the funds they are handed. As

Kotlikoff, Razin, and Rosenthal (1990) point out, the power to refuse a transfer if it is too

big or, indeed, if it is too small as well as the power to refuse to make a transfer is

someone else’s transfer is too small or too large changes the bargaining game

fundamentally.     In particular, threat points matter and Ricardian Equivalence no longer

holds because when the government redistributes across generations, it alters their threat

points.

          Conflicts over who loves whom and by how much may also lead parties to

withhold information about their economic positions.        Kotlikoff and Razin (1988) point

out that altruistic parents trying to transfer to children whose abilities and labor efforts are




                                               76
unobservable will condition their transfers on their children’s earnings.     In this setting,

government redistribution between parents and children can modify the self-selection

constraints under which parents operate in establishing their earnings-related transfer

functions. In this case, the policy will be non neutral.

        Feldstein (1988) raised another important theoretical objection to the Barro

model, namely that, in the context of uncertainty, Ricardian equivalence will only hold if

transfers are operative in all states of nature in which the government’s redistribution

occurs. Take parents who are altruistic, but whose altruism is not strong enough to lead

them to make transfers to their children if their children end up with higher incomes than

their own.     Then government redistribution from children to parents will generate no

private offset in the form of higher bequests or intervivos gifts in those states of nature in

which the children would otherwise be better off than the parents.              In developed

economies in which per capita incomes grow through time, one would expect Feldstein’s

point to be particularly applicable.



Testing Intergenerational Altruism

        As mentioned, the Barro Model of intergenerational altruism predicts that the

consumption of altruistically linked individuals is independent of the distribution of

resources across those individuals. This implication has been tested in a variety of ways

with a variety of data. Boskin and Kotlikoff (1985) took the Barro model as the null

hypotheses and used dynamic programming to determine the level of annual consumption

that would be demanded by Barro dynasties given earnings and rate of return uncertainty.

They estimated their model on postwar U.S. time series data and tested whether the cross-




                                                 77
cohort distribution of resources matters to aggregate consumption given the level of

consumption predicted by the Barro Model. The authors report a very strong dependence

of aggregate consumption on the intergenerational distribution of resources.

        Abel and Kotlikoff (1994) pointed out that altruistically linked households will

automatically share risk and, therefore, experience identical shocks (Euler errors) to their

marginal utilities of consumption.     They also showed that changes in the average Euler

error by cohort would share this property if, as Barro believed, the economy was

dominated by intergenerational altruists.     Abel and Kotlikoff aggregated by cohort U.S.

consumer expenditure data to test for the commonality of Euler errors.           Their test

strongly rejects intergenerational altruism; cohorts that experience positive income

shocks spend, rather than share, their good fortune.

        Altonji, Hayashi, and Kotlikoff (1992) and Hayashi, Altonji, and Kotlikoff (1996)

use Panel Study of Income Dynamics data on the consumption of extended family

members to test whether a) the distribution of consumption of extended family members

depends on the distribution of resources among those members and b) whether extended

family members share risk – an implication not simply of altruism, but also selfish risk

sharing. The data strongly reject both propositions. Another study by the three authors

(Altonji, Kotlikoff, and Hayashi 1997) considers the subset of extended PSID families

who were actively making transfers among themselves. They showed that taking a dollar

from a child and giving it to a parent who is giving the child money results in an increase

in transfers to the child of only 13 cents – an amount that is not only small, but also

insignificantly different from zero.




                                               78
       Additional compelling evidence against the Barro view is provided by Gokhale,

Kotlikoff, and Sabelhaus (1996).      This article documents that the dramatic postwar

decline in U.S. saving has been the result of an equally dramatic increase in

intergenerational transfers to the elderly that have led to an enormous increase in their

absolute and relative consumption. Since 1960 the consumption of the elderly, on a per

person basis, has roughly doubled relative to that of young adults.     A related finding,

developed in Auerbach, Gokhale, Kotlikoff, Sabelhaus, and Weil (2001), is the dramatic

postwar increase in the annuitization of the resources of the elderly.      This increased

annuitization has been engineered primarily by the government, which provides the

elderly substantial resources in old age in the form of cash and medical benefits that

continue until they die, but aren’t bequeathable. If Barro were right, and the elderly were

altruistic, they would have responded to their being forced to acquire more annuities by

purchasing more life insurance.   In fact, the life insurance holdings of the elderly have

not increased in the postwar period as a share of their remaining lifetime resources.

They’ve declined.



VIII. The Government’s Role in Intergenerational Risk Sharing

       Samuelson’s (1958) classic consumption-loan model pointed out the inherent

incompleteness in markets arising from the fact that agents alive at one point in time

can’t contract with those who will be born well after those agents are deceased.      This

market failure is manifest primarily in the area of risk sharing.      Were they able to

contract, agents alive today and those born in the future could form risk-sharing

arrangements by buying or selling state-contingent contracts of various kinds.         The




                                            79
question raised by these missing markets is whether the government can redistribute

across generations to emulate, if not replicate, the risk-sharing arrangements that

members of different cohorts would privately conclude.

        As shown in Kotlikoff (1993), it’s an easy matter to extend the two-period model

of Section III to include uncertainty both with respect to the economic environment and

government policy.        Kotlikoff (1993) considers uncertain technology, specifically the

coefficient of total factor productivity, as well as uncertain (i.e., state-contingent)

government net payments each period from the young to the old.                   The role for

government intergenerational risk sharing in this model is to transfer resources from the

contemporaneous young to the contemporaneous old at time t if the technology at time t

is better than at time t- 1. The degree of redistribution would also be conditioned on the

economy’s time-t capital stock.

        The fact that government’s can pool risks across generations doesn’t mean they

necessarily do so. Indeed, governments may exacerbate the degree of uncertainty facing

generations by randomly distributing among them.               As Auerbach and Hassett (1999)

point out, this manufacturing of uncertainty may come in the form of simply delaying the

decision of who will pay the government’s bills. Take, as an example, the current failure

of the U.S. government to determine how it will close the very sizeable imbalance in U.S.

generational policy.     The government can either place a larger fiscal burden on the

current elderly, on middle-aged baby boomers, on the current young, or on future

generations.     The size of the bill is reasonably clear.           But in failing to specify

immediately which generations will pay what, the U.S. government is generating

uncertainty for all generations, where none intrinsically exists.




                                                  80
        Can one say whether the government is, on balance, pooling risk across

generations? Yes and no.27 Abel and Kotlikoff (1994) stress that their study tests and

strongly rejects intergenerational risk sharing, no matter whether that risk sharing is

arising from a) altruistic extended family behavior, b) selfish extended family

arrangements, c) the purchase of contracts and securities in private insurance and

financial markets, or d) government policy.            But Abel and Kotlikoff’s study doesn’t tell

us the precise role, if any, played by the government in frustrating or improving

intergenerational risk sharing.



IX. Conclusion

        Generational policy – the question of which generation will pay the government’s

bills -- lies at the heart of most fiscal policy debates. The importance of this issue has

stimulated a prodigious amount of theoretical, empirical, and simulation research.                This

research has delivered some important findings.                First, which generation pays the

government’s bills is, apart from efficiency considerations, a zero-sum game.                 Second,

generational policy works not just by redistributing resources directly across generations,

but also by redistributing resources indirectly via policy-induced general equilibrium

changes in factor prices. Third, the same generational policy can be conducted under a

variety of headings and operate through surprising channels, including asset markets.

Fourth, notwithstanding its ubiquitous use, the budget deficit is not a well-defined

measure of generational or any other aspect of economic policy.                The same is true of

taxes and transfer payments as well as their associated constructs, such as disposable

27
  Note that the government may pool risks within generations at the same time it generates risks across
generations. Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes’ (1995) and Eaton and Rosen (1980) are two important studies



                                                  81
income and personal saving.          Fifth, generational accounting represents an important, but

far from perfect method of assessing generational policy.           Sixth, generational policies in

non-altruistic economies can effect major redistribution across generations and major

changes in the long-run values of key macroeconomic variables.               Seventh, generational

policies take a fairly long time to effect the economy.           Eighth, intergenerational altruism

can nullify the impact of generational policy, but the theoretical conditions under which it

would arise are highly unlikely to prevail. Ninth, there is a plethora of evidence, at least

for the U.S., that intergenerational redistribution, be it across cohorts or between older

and younger members of the same extended families, materially raises the well being to

those receiving the transfers and materially harms those making the payments. Tenth, at

least in the U.S., government policy does not achieve intergenerational risk sharing.

Indeed, U.S. government policy may, on balance, be an important, if not the primary

source of generational risk. Finally, and most important, a variety of countries around the

world are running generational policies that will dramatically reduce the economic well

being of their future generations.              Achieving generational balance in those countries

requires immediate, major, and highly painful policy responses.




of government intragenerational risk sharing.

Note: Welfare is measured relative to the no-reform equilibrium. A value, for example,
of .97 means that the group in question experiences a welfare change from the reform
that is equivalent to their experiencing a 3 percent decline in consumption and leisure at
each age under the initial fiscal structure.
