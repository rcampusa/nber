                                              ABSTRACT

This paper tests how migrants’ willingness to remit changes when given the ability to direct remittances
to educational purposes using different forms of commitment. Variants of a dictator game in a lab-in-the-
field experiment with Filipino migrants in Rome are used to examine remitting behavior under varying
degrees of commitment. These range from the soft commitment of simply labeling remittances as being
for education, to the hard commitment of having funds directly paid to a school and the student’s educational
performance monitored. We find that the introduction of simple labeling for education raises remittances
by more than 15 percent. Adding the ability to directly send this funding to the school adds only a
further 2.2 percent. We randomly vary the information asymmetry between migrants and their most
closely connected household, but find no significant change in the remittance response to these forms
of commitment as information varies. Behavior in these games is then shown to be predictive of take-up
of a new financial product called EduPay, designed to allow migrants to directly pay remittances to
schools in the Philippines. We find this take-up is largely driven by a response to the ability to label
remittances for education, rather than to the hard commitment feature of directly paying schools.

1.   Introduction
       Migrant remittances are one of the largest international financial flows to developing
countries, exceeding US$400 billion in 2012 (World Bank 2013). These remittances represent
the most tangible way in which migrants share the tremendous gains in income achieved through
migrating abroad with remaining family members in their home countries. One common use of
these funds is to fund the schooling of the migrant’s children and other relatives in the home
country, with several studies finding increases in education as a result (e.g. Cox-Edwards and
Ureta 2003, Yang 2008, Theoharides 2014). However, migrants may differ from remittance
recipients in their preferences for how money sent should be used (Ashraf et al 2015), with
physical separation and limited information making it difficult for migrants to ensure money is
used the way they intend.
       In such a context, financial instruments which provide migrants with greater ability to
monitor and control how funds are spent should have positive take-up by some migrants, and
may lead to an increase in how money is remitted. In this paper we test this idea via a lab-in-the-
field experiment with Filipino migrants in Rome, Italy. In a dictator game, migrants are asked to
allocate 1000 € between themselves and people of their choice in the Philippines. Different
games then allow them to explicitly set aside some of the money sent for educational purposes,
varying the amount of control offered. Three levels of control are tested: the option to simply
label some amount of money as for educational purposes only; labeling the funding and having it
sent directly to a school to pay for a particular student’s educational tuition; and combining
labeled money sent direct to a school with reports on student attendance and grades. We also
randomize whether the household in the Philippines is told the migrant’s choices in the game, to
test whether migrants are able to exhibit more control when the remittance receivers have less
information.
       Individuals who took part in this exercise were then subsequently offered the opportunity
to use a new financial product, EduPay, developed by the authors in collaboration with the Bank
of the Philippine Islands (BPI). This product allowed migrants to use a remittance to directly pay
for tuition in educational institutions in the Philippines for students of their choosing, with this
payment going directly to the school, and the school subsequently providing attendance records
and grades. We use this to examine the actual demand for control over remittances for education


                                                 2
purposes. We can then combine this with the lab-in-the-field evidence to examine the extent to
which behavior in the game predicts take-up of the new product, and to help better understand
the likely mechanisms behind any take-up.
       We find that introducing simple labeling of remittances for education increases the total
amount remitted to individuals in the Philippines by 15 percent. This increase comes from
increases in both the number of distinct individuals they choose to send money to, and from the
amount sent to each individual. Adding the ability to directly send this funding to the school adds
only an additional 2.2 percent to the amount remitted. The additional remitting largely occurs
within the most closely connected household in the Philippines, and does not vary significantly
as we vary the information this household is provided about the choice the migrant is making.
We find that choices in these games are significant predictors of take-up of the EduPay product:
individuals who allocate more of the 1000 € to this product in the game are more likely to want
to use it in practice. Moreover, this take-up seems to be driven largely by preferences for
education labeling, with no additional predictive power from use of direct payment in the game.
       This paper contributes to two main literatures. The first is very recent literature which
examines how migrants respond to changes in information asymmetry and to the opportunity to
exert more control over how remittances are used. Ambler (forthcoming) finds in a lab-in-the-
field experiment that migrants share more of a windfall when relatives are told the migrant
received this windfall. Ashraf et al. (forthcoming) find that migrants from El Salvador save more
in the home country when offered accounts providing greater ability to monitor and control
savings. The most closely related work to our paper is Ambler et al (2015), which, in a sample of
Salvadoran migrants in Washington, D.C., examines the demand for a new financial product that
allowed migrants to target remittances towards the education of a specific student they selected
in El Salvador. Money was sent via an ATM card, that the student was told was intended to
support their education, but for which there was no enforcement on how the money was used.
They find zero demand for this product when offered by itself, but do find positive demand for
the product when it is accompanied by matching funds. Our study contrasts with this finding by
showing there can be positive demand from migrants for education-labeled remittances, and
through the use of a lab-in-the-field experiment to examine the mechanisms driving this demand.
       This paper also contributes to a second, related literature, which examines the role of soft
and hard commitments on financial decisions. Karlan and Linden (2014) test the demand and


                                                3
impact of two savings accounts for education in Uganda: a school-based commitment account
that can only be used for educational purposes, and a soft commitment product that was labeled
for education use but could be withdrawn for any purpose. They find more savings under the
weaker commitment product, suggesting individuals may wish to bind their future behavior, but
not too tightly. Benhassine et al (forthcoming) show that simply labeling a cash transfer as
intended for education can have similar positive effects on school participation as imposing that
transfers be conditional on school attendance. Consistent with the idea that ear-marking, or
labeling, money for a specific purpose can increase saving, Soman and Cheema (2011) find that
low-income Indian workers save more when salaries are earmarked, especially when pictures of
the household’s children are placed on the earmarked envelope. Our findings of increased
remittances when migrants can label accounts, and little additional remittances from directing the
payments straight to the school, suggest that soft commitments may also be enough for
educational remitting.
   The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses different theories
why labels and control over how remittances are spent may change remitting behavior. Section
3describes the setting, baseline sample, and lab-in-the-field experiment. Section 4 presents the
main empirical results, quantifying the effects of the different forms of education labeling.
Section 5 concludes.


2. Why might remittances respond to labeling and added control?
   Remittances occur for a wide variety of reasons, including altruism, insurance, exchange, and
as repayment of loans. Rapoport and Docquier (2006) provide an excellent summary of different
theories of remitting, and note that a key feature of remittances is that distance makes
informational problems more pervasive and hence strategic behavior more likely than is the case
with many other types of transfers. In particular, the standard unitary model of the household
seems particularly unlikely to hold in a migration context due to information asymmetries and to
limits on monitoring within the household (de Laat 2014; Chen 2013; Ambler forthcoming; Doi
et al 2014; Genicot et al 2014).
   In particular, Ashraf et al (forthcoming) find migrants prefer that remittances be used less for
immediate consumption and more for longer-term investment and savings than is the case for
remittance receivers. Even when migrants and remittance recipients share the same preferences


                                                4
over how remittances should be spent, self-control issues may lead remittance receivers to save
and invest less than both they and the migrant prefer.
   Money sent for education purposes may be subject to a number of these issues. Migrants may
not be able to monitor how much school expenses actually are, whether money sent for schooling
is diverted to other uses, and whether students actually attend school once such fees are paid.
Since the returns to schooling occur in the future, while costs occur in the present, impatient or
time-inconsistent remittance receivers may be tempted to spend money on items that bring
immediate benefits. Knowing this, the migrant may send fewer remittances for schooling
purposes than would be the case with perfect information and complete enforcement.
       How might labeling a remittance as being for education purposes change this? The
literature on self-control has long considered the role of rules to restrict opportunities (e.g. Thaler
and Shefrin 1981). One way of doing this is through mental accounts (Thaler 1999), whereby
money is implicitly or explicitly set aside in different labeled accounts for different purposes.
Soman and Cheema (2011) note that once such rules are set, there is a large psychological
literature detailing how breaking these rules can be costly, in terms of leading to negative
emotions such as guilt, remorse, and regret. By labeling a remittance as being for education
purposes, a migrant may effectively be able to create this mental account for the remittance
receiver, with these psychological costs making it costly for the receiver to spend the money on
other items.
       Of course labels may not always work, in which case migrants may wish to exert even
more control over how money is spent. Directly sending money to the school for fees is a much
stronger way of exerting control, and may therefore be preferred by migrants if they believe
labels do not exert enough pressure on the receiver to use money for the intended purpose.
       Given that migrants regularly communicate with their family members, a natural question
is then whether we should expect an outside entity’s offer to label money for education to add
anything beyond any labels migrants can already attach? That is, if migrants would send more
money if this money were labeled as being for education purposes, why don’t the migrants
simply label remittances this way? There are at least two possible reasons why an outside party
may provide a valuable label. First, the label may be seen as more credible or stronger when
communicated by a third party. Second, attaching a label may be costly for migrants, as it could
be seen by receivers as a signal of lack of trust. This same cost may not exist when the


                                                  5
communication comes from a third party, especially if the receiver is unsure of the circumstances
under which the migrant is making this decision.
        In contrast, it is easier to see how a third party offering the ability to directly send
remittances to school to pay for expenses, and to provide monitoring reports on the child’s
attendance and progress can add value, since there is no easy way for migrants to do this by
themselves. However, this hard form of commitment could be viewed by the recipient as
indicating a lack of trust from the migrant, which could have offsetting negative costs for the
sender. An additional downside of hard commitments is that they reduce the flexibility of
recipients to use remittances for other purposes, for example if health or other emergencies arise.


3. Setting, Baseline Sample, and Description of Lab-in-the-Field Experiment
3.1 Setting
        Our experiment was conducted among Filipino workers in Rome, Italy. The Philippines
sends workers to a very diverse set of migrant destinations. There are estimated to be
approximately 113,000 Filipino migrants in Italy, remitting about US$500 million, on average,
back to the Philippines each year in recent years. Education is a key desired use for these
remittances, with US$233.5 million of remittances sent in expectation that this would finance the
education of a relative (IOM 2010).1


3.2 EduPay
        We worked with the Bank of the Philippines Islands (BPI) and the Philippine Association
of Private Schools, Colleges, and Universities (PAPSCU) to develop and pilot a new remittance
product, called EduPay, that was intended to provide migrant workers with greater ability to
control the use of remittances for education. This product allows migrants to channel tuition
payments for particular students directly to those students’ educational institutions in the
Philippines from a BPI remittance branch in Rome. This mechanism allowed migrants to avoid
sending tuition payments via family members or others in the Philippines who might not be
completely trusted to make such payments reliably. The migrant would then also subsequently

receive attendance records and school grades from the child’s school, enabling them to better
monitor the schooling being paid for.


3.3 Baseline Sample
    Given that Filipinos are a small minority of the overall population of Rome, we used
intercept-point sampling to obtain a sample for this study. Between August 2012, and January
2013, we intercepted 2,291 Filipino migrants at common meeting points in Rome and at the main
branch of BPI in Rome.2 Migrants were given a general introduction to the research project,
which was described as “about the lives and financial decisions of OFWs in Rome, and about the
remittances they send home to the Philippines.” 3 Migrants were also told, referring to the EduPay
product, “We will also be offering you a new product related to education and remittances at the
end of the survey, and you may benefit from using this product.”
    Migrants were then invited to answer some preliminary screening questions to determine
their eligibility to participate in the pilot phase. To be considered eligible, a respondent had to
meet two criteria: (a) the province of origin of the migrant and of his/her “mostly closely
connected household” (i.e., the household where they lived before migrating, or the household
they send the most remittances to) should be in one of three regions of the Philippines in which
PAPSCU had agreed to assist in running the pilot; 4 and (b) had a relative in the Philippines aged
5-22. If the migrant did not refuse to answer further questions, the interview would begin. The
complete survey instrument, including introductory text read to potential respondents, is
provided in the Online Appendix.
    This resulted in a sample of 501 migrant workers, who were then administered a baseline
survey and a lab-in-the-field experiment. At the conclusion of the survey and experiment,
participants were then told about the new EduPay product, provided with some related marketing
material and, if they wanted to use this new product, asked to sign two forms: (i) a general
information form on the sponsorable student(s) and (ii) an authorization form required by

  Intercepts were scheduled at various times on a variety of days of the week. The intercept points were five fixed
locations: the Santa Pudenziana Filipino community church, the Bank of the Philippine Islands Rome branch, the
Embassy of the Philippines, the headquarters of an important Filipino NGO (OFSPES), and the central train station
in Rome (Termini Station).

  These regions are: 1) Region 3 [Central Luzon];2) Region 4 [the provinces of Batangas, Cavite, Laguna, Quezon,
Rizal, Marinduque, Occidental Mindoro, Oriental Mindoro, Palawan, and Romblon]; and 3) the National Capital
Region (the group of contiguous cities comprising metro Manila).

PAPSCU to obtain all relevant information on the student (e.g., their school ID number) from the
schools so as to implement EduPay.
    The baseline survey collected information on demographic background, labor market status,
remitting behavior, and the quality of their relationship with their most closely connected
household in the Philippines. Summary statistics are provided in Table 1. The sample is 73
percent female and the average (and median) age of the respondents is 42. Most (70 percent) of
the migrants have a college or a university degree and have been living in Italy for about 7 years
(median). Only 21 percent are never married, but only 5 percent have their spouse with them in
Italy. Nearly 68 percent of the respondents are employed as domestic workers, with the other
main occupations being housecleaners (8 percent) and nannies (6 percent). The median wage is
900 euro per month. Almost 96 percent have remitted regularly to the most closely connected
household in the Philippines in the last 12 months, and 72 percent remit monthly. The median
amount of remittances is 380 euro/month. 81 percent report having sent remittances in the past
year for the specific purpose of funding the education of someone in the Philippines, with a
median of 970 euro/year sent for this purpose.
    It is worthwhile comparing these baseline characteristics to those of the overall Filipino
migrant community in Italy. According to Italian labor force survey data (Italialavoro 2013),
58% of Filipino immigrants in Italy are female, 80% of those in the workforce have monthly
incomes below 1,000 euro, the median age category is 30-39 years, and 53% have at least an
upper secondary education. Comparing these figures with our sample statistics reveals that our
study sample is more female, older, and better educated than the broader Filipino immigrant
population in Italy. 5
    The most closely connected household to the migrant in the Philippines has an average of
4.45 individuals in it. The head is the migrant’s parents in 29.5 percent of cases, the migrant’s
spouse 22.6 percent of the time, and the migrant’s sister or brother in 17.2 percent of cases. 62.9
percent of migrants have one of their own children in this household, and 32.1 percent have a
nephew or niece in this household. Communication between the migrant and this household is
frequent, with 52 percent communicating daily, and 93 percent at least weekly. 71 percent of

5
 Because the sample appears, in particular, to be more female than the broader Filipino population in Italy, all
empirical results in the main tables (in which we pool males and females) will also be presented in the Online
Appendix with interaction terms testing whether effects found are different for males and females. Below, alongside
discussion of our main (gender pooled) results, we discuss implications (if any) for our estimates of population
average treatment effects.

                                                         8
migrants declare themselves to be “very well informed” on what happens in this household.
However, despite this, 55 percent claimed they would like to have more influence on how the
overall budget of the most closely connected household is spent and 37 percent stated that they
wish to have more influence on the spending decisions of the remittances. This suggests there
may be demand for interventions which provide them with more control over remittances.


3.4 The lab-in-the-field experiment
   The experimental intervention was administered to participants face-to-face, immediately
after they answered the baseline survey. There were three main objectives of this experiment.
The first was to test the responsiveness of total migrant remittances when migrants have the
ability to control some of this for education use. The second objective was to attempt to
unbundle the different features of the EduPay product, in order to determine whether any
positive responsiveness to EduPay was driven by the ability to channel funds directly to schools,
or whether EduPay simply provided a way for migrants to label that a transfer was intended for
education. The third objective was to examine how use of these features varies with the degree of
asymmetric information between the migrant and the recipient.
   Migrants were told that they were entered into a lottery to win a 1000 € prize, and asked how
they would like to allocate any winnings between themselves, and between one or more other
people in the Philippines. They were told that any amount shared with people in the Philippines
would be remitted by the research project at no charge. As seen from Table 1, 1000 €
corresponds to just over one month’s median earnings, and almost three months of median
remittances, so is a sizeable sum. We ask them to make this choice under four different settings,
using a within-participant experiment in which we randomized the order in which each person
was presented with these four cases.
   The cases were as follows:
   (i)     Basic: this choice corresponds to a simple dictator game, in which the migrant
           decides how much to keep for her or himself, and how much to share with others,
           with any funds allocated to people in the Philippines provided to them directly in the
           form of cash.
   (ii)    Education label option: Under this choice, migrants were given the option (but no
           requirement) of labeling any amount shared as being for education, so that when it


                                               9
           was delivered to the recipient it would be accompanied by a note saying “these funds
           are intended to be used for the education of someone in your household”. This
           captures the labeling aspect of the EduPay product.
   (iii)   Direct Payment option: This case is identical to (ii), in that migrants could choose for
           each amount shared whether or not to attach an education label.I In addition, this case
           adds the option of choosing to have the money paid directly to the student’s school as
           tuition. This captures the labeling and direct payment aspects of the EduPay product.
   (iv)    Direct payment with performance monitoring: This case is identical to (iii), except
           that if the migrant chose to send money directly to the school for tuition, they would
           also receive reports on the attendance and grades of this student. This last case then
           mimics the three key features of the EduPay product: labeling, direct payment, and
           monitoring.
   To be clear, cases (i) through (iv) are nested, in that each successive case only adds options
for the migrant, and never takes any away. Case (ii) adds the education label option, but allows
simply sending cash without a label, as in case (i). Case (iii) adds direct payments to schools, but
also allows simple labeling as in case (ii) or just cash provision as in case (i). Respondents have
free choice to use any, all, or none of the options available to them in a particular case. For
example, in case (iii), a migrants could send, for a particular recipient, a cash remittance, a
labeled remittance, or a direct payment to a school, or any combination of these three. What’s
more, respondents could make these transfers for any number of recipients in the Philippines.
   This nested structure allows us to interpret differences in remittances between treatments as
reflecting the impact on remittances of adding or subtracting particular sharing options. For
example, the difference in remittances between cases (iii) and (ii) reflects the net impact of
adding an option for direct payments to schools, over and above an ability to attach an education
label or to simply share cash without a label.
   Choices were incentivized by telling respondents that one respondent in the study would
actually win the 1000 € prize, and for that winner one of their four cases (i, ii, iii, or iv) would be
randomly selected to be implemented as they had specified. Migrants were told that they would
not be allowed to change their allocation decision if they later learned that they had won the
lottery, so they should take the allocation decision seriously. The lottery was actually
implemented on 28 March 2013.


                                                  10
    In this experiment we were also interested in whether migrants would make different choices
under different assumptions about what their family members in the Philippines knew about their
choice environment.6 In particular, we were interested in the possibility that migrants might be
less willing to use the education label or direct funds to schools if the most closely connected
households in the Philippines felt that the migrant was explicitly seeking to control their
behavior. This might be the case if beneficiaries viewed attempts to control them as reflecting the
migrant’s lack of trust in them or disapproval of their decision-making.
    To test this, we randomly assigned the migrants into three treatment groups, each of 167
individuals:7
    •   Treatment 1 (Private information): Migrants assigned to this treatment were told that the
most closely connected household in the Philippines would not be informed of any of the
decisions or choices the migrant made. If the migrant decides to share money with anyone from
this household, they would receive the money and be told it came from the migrant answering a
survey in Italy, but not what the decision process was that resulted in this amount being
transferred.
    •   Treatment 2 (Information sharing): Migrants assigned to this treatment were told that the
household in the Philippines would be informed of all the choices they made. This means the
household would know that the migrant had to allocate 1000 €, and exactly how they had
decided to allocate it.
    •   Treatment 3 (Social excuse): Migrants assigned to this treatment were told that, as in
Treatment 2, the household in the Philippines would be informed of all choices made. However,
if the migrant chose any of the EduPay options (directed payment, or directed payment +
monitoring), the survey team would inform the household that a small donation to a Filipino
community organization in Rome was made when the EduPay option was chosen. This was to
provide the household with a social excuse for using EduPay.
    Our prior was that migrants would be least willing to share money with the household in the
Philippines when their choice was public information (treatment 2), and that they would be more
willing to use education labeling or directed payment when either this choice was private

  Existing research (such as Ambler forthcoming, or Genicot et al 2014) suggests that remittance recipients’
knowledge about the migrant’s choice environment, and the migrant’s economic conditions in particular, affects
migrant remittance behavior.

  Randomization occurred by computer, and was a simple random draw, without stratification, since no baseline data
were available to stratify on at the time of assigning questionnaires to different treatments.

information, or when they had a social excuse to justify to the household why they were doing
this (treatments 1 and 3, respectively).


4.   Lab-in-the-Field Results
     We begin by pooling results across the different information treatments and examining how
the migrant’s willingness to share (remit) money with others in the Philippines varies with the
different choices which provide greater or lesser degrees of control over how money is used for
education. We then examine the extent to which these choices vary according to the information
provided to the most connected household in the Philippines. In the next section we then
investigate the extent to which behavior in these lab-in-the-field experiments helps predict take-
up of the new EduPay product.


4.1 How does the amount remitted vary with different education commitments?
     For each individual we observe four different allocation decisions, corresponding to one
decision for each of the four choice cases (i)-(iv) above. To estimate the impact of these choice
options on outcome y for migrant j we estimate fixed effects models of the form:
           𝑦𝑗 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝐸𝑑𝑢𝐿𝑎𝑏𝑒𝑙𝑗 + 𝛾𝐷𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑃𝑎𝑦𝑗 + 𝛿𝐷𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑃𝑎𝑦&𝑀𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑗 + 𝜇𝑗 + 𝜀𝑗
     Where EduLabel indicates the decision is taken under choice (ii), where the migrant has the
option of labeling remittances as for education purposes; DirectPay indicates the decision is
taken under choice (iii), where the migrant also has the option of choosing to have money
directly paid to the school, and DirectPay&Monitor indicates the decision is taken under choice
(iv), where the migrant can choose to have money directly paid to the school and receive
monitoring reports in return. 𝜇𝑗 is an individual fixed effect, enabling us to identify impacts from
intra-migrant decisions. This fixed effect also captures the 24 randomization strata which
determine the ordering of the four choices. The standard error 𝜀𝑗 is then clustered at the
individual level.
     We are then interested in testing whether 𝛽 = 0, that is whether or not there is any change in
remittance behavior when the option to label remittances as for education is given, as well as
testing for equality of 𝛽, 𝛾, and 𝛿, which tells us whether the form of educational commitment
matters.



                                                12
   We consider several outcomes. The first is the extensive margin of whether or not the
migrant chooses to remit any of the money at all with others in the Philippines. 87.8 percent of
migrants do choose to remit in the basic, no-label option. The second outcome is the total amount
remitted to anyone in the Philippines. Migrants could divide the money up with as many
individuals in the Philippines as they liked, with the maximum being 9 individuals. We total this
up, and find the mean amount remitted is 614.6 € under the basic, no-label option. That is,
migrants are sharing more than they keep for themselves. We also consider the total number of
people in the Philippines they choose to remit to (an average of 2.03 under the basic option), and
the amount remitted to each beneficiary (conditional on making any remittances). Then to
examine the extent to which differences are arising from changing remittance behavior with the
most closely connected household, versus with other households in the Philippines, we examine
the number of individuals within the most closely connected household that they choose to
allocate money to, whether or not they choose to allocate money to someone outside this main
household (23.8 percent do under the basic choice option), and the amount remitted to people
outside the main household (90.2 € on average under the basic option).
   Table 2 reports the results. First consider the effect of being able to include an education
label. This results in a 4.6 percentage point increase in the likelihood of remitting at all, and a
93.7 € increase in the total amount remitted, both significant at the 1 percent level. This increase
in the total remitted is approximately a 15 percent increase on the amount remitted under the
basic choice option. We see that this increase reflects migrants remitting to both more people
(0.15 more people), and remitting more to each person that they do remit to. Most of the increase
appears to be occurring within the most closely connected household, with no increase in the
likelihood of remitting to someone outside this main household, and 82 percent of the total
increase in remittances going to individuals inside the main household.
   Adding the option of direct payment to the school, or direct payment and monitoring, only
leads to modest changes relative to education labeling alone. Although there is a statistically
significant difference between education labeling alone and the direct payment option for several
outcomes, the magnitudes of these differences are relatively small. With direct payment the total
amount remitted increases by 107.4 € relative to the basic, no-label option, which represents only
a 2 percent higher increase than that under education labeling alone. Moreover, the last row of
Table 2 shows that for all but one outcome we cannot reject the null hypothesis of equality of the


                                                13
three forms of directing the remittance for education purposes. The one exception is in the
number of individuals in the main household that money is shared with. This is 0.06 to 0.08
persons higher with either direct payment option, a 4 to 5 percent increase on the basic option
mean.
    Figure 1 shows the CDFs of the total amount remitted under the four choice structures. We
see the change in the amount remitted when moving from the basic (no label) option to any of
the other three options occurs across the entire distribution, while the other three choices have
very similar distributions to one another.
    In sum, it does appear that migrants are willing to remit more when given the ability to direct
these remittances towards education, but that the main effect appears to come from the softer
commitment of education labeling, rather than through the ability to exert more control through
direct payment.8


    4.2 How do these choices vary with the information provided to the household in the
Philippines?
     Next we examine whether the responsiveness of migrants to the ability to label remittances
for education or to be able to directly pay the school varies with the information the most closely
connected household in the Philippines has about this choice. 9 The information randomization
occurred at the individual migrant level, with a migrant making each of her or his four choices
under the same information condition. Therefore to identify the impact of different information
settings, we rely on random assignment of information treatments across individuals, and
estimate the following regression at the individual level:
                   𝑦𝑗 = 𝛼 + 𝛽𝐸𝑑𝑢𝐿𝑎𝑏𝑒𝑙𝑗 + 𝛾𝐷𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑃𝑎𝑦𝑗 + 𝛿𝐷𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑃𝑎𝑦&𝑀𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑗


8
  To test differences in treatment effects across male and female migrants, Online Appendix Table 1 presents
regression results analogous to those of Table 2 but where interaction terms are added between “male” and the three
treatment dummies. (The “male” main effect need not be included in the regression, because the regression includes
individual respondent fixed effects, which absorb all time-invariant respondent variables such as gender.) The only
statistically significant difference that appears is in the “total amount remitted” regression, where for males the
effect of the education label appears to be larger, by 46 euro, than the effect for females (81 euro). (By contrast, the
effects of education labeling on other outcomes found in Table 2 do not seem to be differential by gender at
conventional significance levels.) Because our study population is more female than the general population of
Filipinos in Italy, this result suggests that our estimate in Table 2 of the population-average effect of education
labeling on total remittances sent is downward-biased.
9
  A relevant background statistic is that 80.8% (405 out of 501) study participants remit to their most closely
connected household. Given that 87.8% of study participants (440/501) remit to anyone at all in the Philippines,
92.0% of households doing any remitting (405/440) remit to their most closely connected household.

    Where 𝐼𝑛𝑓𝑜𝑆ℎ𝑎𝑟𝑒𝑑 denotes the individual was assigned to information treatment 2, in
which all choices are shared with the main household in the Philippines, and 𝑆𝑜𝑐𝑖𝑎𝑙𝐸𝑥𝑐𝑢𝑠𝑒
denotes the individual was assigned to information treatment 3, in which all choices are shared
with the main household, but a social excuse is given for using EduPay-like options. Here 𝛼 is
the mean outcome (e.g. total remittances) for the basic choice option under treatment 1 (private
information). We then test 𝜃1 = 𝜆1 = 0 to test whether information treatment has no effect on
decisions under the basic (no label) choice option; test𝛽 = 𝜃2 = 𝜆2 for no difference in the
added effect of education labeling relative to the basic, no-label, case across the information
treatments; and likewise test 𝛾 = 𝜃3 = 𝜆3 and 𝛿 = 𝜃4 = 𝜆4 .
    Table 3 presents the results. Consider first the outcomes under the basic, no-label choice.
The point estimates on information sharing and on having a social excuse suggest that, if
anything, migrants are remitting less in total when the choice decision is to be communicated to
the most closely connected household. This contrasts with the finding of Ambler (forthcoming),
but this difference is not statistically significant, and for none of the outcomes can we reject
equality of means for the basic (no label) choice across the different information treatments.
Consider next choices under education labeling. We see migrants send an additional 102.7 €
relative to the no-label choice when the choice is made privately, an additional 85.9 € relative to
the basic choice when the choice is made under information sharing with the migrant, and an
additional 36.4 € relative to the no-label choice when migrants are provided with a social excuse.
The p-value for testing equality of these effects is 0.127, so we cannot reject that there is no
impact of information treatment on the decisions made.
    We see this is generally true across the different outcomes and tests: we cannot reject
equality of decisions under the different information treatments for 23 of the 28 tests performed
at the bottom of the table. Three of the five significant tests are for testing equality of
information treatment effects for the outcome of the number of individuals in the most closely
connected household remitted to. The increase seen in this outcome under private information
appears to be lower when a social excuse is provided for using education labeling or direct

                                                15
payment. This contrasts with our prior that a social excuse would lead migrants to use these
features more. The point estimates suggest that one explanation might be that migrants shift
more of their funding towards individuals outside the most closely connected household (perhaps
now because the migrant can use the social excuse as a justification for why they are helping
others outside the main household), but this effect is not statistically significant. 10


5. Do choices in the lab-in-the-field experiment predict product take-up?
     Following the lab-in-the-field experiment, our field team explained the new EduPay product
developed with BPI with the help of some marketing material. Migrants who were interested in
using the product signed a request letter to the school, asking them to release the students’
identification number, make available an invoice for payment to the school, provide details of the
bank account of the school, and also release the grades of the student. These forms were then
sent to our project coordinator in the Philippines, who worked with PAPSCU to contact the
schools and arrange the logistics. Overall 27.1% of individuals offered the product signed this
letter of intent. We use this as our take-up measure, since in practice during the pilot phase, many
of the schools did not provide the needed information in a timely fashion, so that the majority of
these intended transactions were not executed.12
     We examine the determinants of take-up via probit regressions of the form:
                         Pr(𝑈𝑠𝑒 𝐸𝑑𝑢𝑃𝑎𝑦) = 𝑃𝑟𝑜𝑏𝑖𝑡(𝛿 ′ 𝐺𝑎𝑚𝑒𝐵𝑒ℎ𝑎𝑣𝑖𝑜𝑟 + 𝜁 ′ 𝑋)
     where X are additional control variables that may be likely to determine the desire of the
migrant to remit for education. We include here gender, the number of children in the
Philippines, whether the individual has their spouse in the Philippines, whether they have
nephews and nieces of school-age in the Philippines, their own education level, whether they
have been in Italy longer than the median of 7 years, whether they earn less than the median of
800 euro per month, and the amount they report having sent to the Philippines for educational

10
   Online Appendix Table 2 presents regression results analogous to those of Table 3 but where interactions are
added between “male” and the relevant treatment terms in Table 3. Because the regressions do not include
individual respondent fixed effects, the “male” main effect is included in the regression. As it turns out, there is no
evidence that the estimates in Table 3 are different across genders: none of the interaction terms with male are
statistically significant from zero at conventional levels.
12
   There were several reasons for this. First, a number of schools did not have bank accounts set up, and were not
prepared to do so for only a small number of transactions. Second, schools typically took two to three weeks to
provide the invoice and bank account information, and so many migrants, being nervous about meeting tuition
deadlines, opted to send money through other means. Ultimately this resulted in only 21 individuals making an
EduPay transaction, 11 in the first pilot phase and 10 in an extension phase.

purposes in the past 12 months. The regression analysis will use a sample of 483 individuals out
of our original sample of 501.13
     We consider several measures of behavior in the lab-in-the-field games. The first measure is
simply the amount of money they decide to remit explicitly in the form of a direct payment to the
school under the direct payment choice option, case (iii). The mean is 316€ with a standard
deviation of 364€. For ease of interpretation, we divide by 100€, so the coefficient represents the
marginal effect of allocating 100€ more to direct payment in the choice experiment.
     The second measure is the difference in the total amount they choose to remit to the
Philippines when given the option to label money for education compared to the basic, no-label,
choice. The mean is 93.7€, with a standard deviation of 253€. We then also consider the
additional difference in the total amount they choose to remit when given the further option of
directing payments straight to the school versus education labeling alone. The mean for this
variable is 13.8€, with a standard deviation of 156€. Again we standardize these variables in
terms of hundreds of euro.
     Table 4 reports the results. In the first column we see that individuals who choose to remit
more money via the direct payment option during the game are significantly more likely to take
up the EduPay product. Each 100€ more allocated to the direct payment option in the game is
associated with a 2.4 percentage point higher take-up rate. A one standard deviation increase in
the amount chosen to be remitted via direct payment option in the game is therefore associated
with an 8.7 percentage point higher take-up rate, which represents a 32 percent increase relative
to the mean take-up rate of 27.1 percent. Column 2 shows this effect continues to hold in terms
of both magnitude and statistical significance once we add control variables. We also see that
migrants with children in the Philippines are more likely to sign up for this product, whereas
those with lower incomes are less likely to use the product.
     The third and fourth columns show the association with the differential amount they choose
to remit in the game when given the education labeling option. Column 3 shows each 100€ more
remitted when given the labeling option is associated with a 1.5 percentage point increase in the
likelihood of take-up, which is statistically significant at the 5 percent level. This relationship
strengthens slightly when we add additional controls in column 4. Here a one standard deviation

13
  Four individuals were dropped because of missing data on control variables, and an additional 14 were dropped
because of lack of information on the schools, because the schools were public, or because the school could not be
managed by PAPSCU.

                                                        17
increase in the differential amount remitted when given the option for education labeling is
associated with a 5.1 percentage point increase in the likelihood of take-up, representing a 19
percent increase relative to the mean take-up rate.
     The last column adds the differential amount remitted when given the direct payment option
versus the education labeling option. We see that this variable has a small and not statistically
significant association with take-up, while the effect of labeling versus the basic option remains
statistically significant. This suggests that take-up of the EduPay product is largely driven by a
demand for being able to label remittances for education, rather than for a demand for direct
payment to schools. This is consistent with the findings of the lab-in-the-field experiment.14


6. Conclusion
     We find in a lab-in-the-field experiment that migrants are prepared to remit more money
back to the home country when given the option to label some of this money as explicitly for
education purposes. Strengthening this commitment from the soft commitment of labeling to the
hard commitment of directly paying the school (and potentially monitoring the schooling of the
sponsored student) results in little additional change in remitting behavior. Furthermore, we find
behavior in this game predicts take-up of a new financial product designed to enable migrants to
direct remittances to schools in the Philippines. Migrants who remit more for education purposes
in the game, and who remit more with education labeling than without, are more likely to want to
use this new product. The demand for the new product seems driven more by a demand for the
ability to label remittances for education, than for the hard commitment entailed by paying the
school directly.
     These findings are consistent with recent evidence from other domains suggesting that soft
commitments in the form of labeling can change spending and saving behaviors. They suggest


14
   Online Appendix Table 3 presents regression results that correspond to those of Table 4, but in which interaction
terms are added between “male” and the measures of game behavior. The “male” main effect is also included in the
regression. It appears that the responsiveness of EduPay take-up to the amount tagged with direct payment is
statistically significantly larger for males than for females (columns 1 and 2). In addition, it appears that for males,
unlike for females, this is driven by difference in total remittances in education label compared to direct payment:
the coefficient in column 5 on “Difference in Total Remittances in Education Label vs Direct Payment*male” is
positive and statistically significantly different from zero, while that on “Difference in Total Remittances in Basic
vs. Education Label * male” is much smaller in magnitude and never statistically significant in columns 3-5. It
appears that male demand for EduPay is better predicted by their experimental responsiveness to direct payment,
compared to females. This may suggest different marketing strategies in approaching men and women with EduPay-
like products in practice.

                                                          18
that migrants may be willing to increase the amount they remit for education if given the ability
to exert some soft control over its use. The challenge for future work is then to explore further
the logistics of how best to do this, as well as to determine when harder forms of commitment
such as direct payment to the schools will be more effective. Related work by Ambler et al
(forthcoming) points to a challenge in doing so, since they find no take-up among Salvadoran
migrants for one product labeled for education. However, several private sector companies are
now piloting products that channel remittances directly to education, including PhilSmile for the
Philippines, and the remittance operator IME in Nepal. We view measuring the impact of such
products on overall remittances and on schooling outcomes as a promising direction for future
research.

*Please approach potential study participants and say:

We invite you to participate in a research study about the lives and financial decisions of OFWs in Rome, and about the
remittances they send home to the Philippines. The study is funded by USAID (U.S. Agency for International
Development) and is being conducted by researchers from University of Michigan, Sapienza University of Rome, and
the World Bank. The field work for this study is being conducted by Innovations for Poverty Action (IPA), a nonprofit
research organization based in the U.S. I am an employee of IPA.
If you agree to be part of the research study, you will be asked about your current work and financial situation, and
about support you provide to family and friends in the Philippines. Your participation in the study can help improve the
lives of Filipinos back home by possibly influencing policies of institutions like USAID. We will also be offering you a
new product related to education and remittances at the end of the survey, and you may benefit from using this product.
The researchers have taken steps to minimize the risks of this study. The main risks that remain are minimal; in rare
cases you may be uncomfortable answering some questions in the survey, and there is minimal risk that the
confidentiality of your responses to the survey may be violated. You have the right to not answer any question and to
stop the interview at any time.

To thank you for your time, you will receive €5, and additionally we will be holding a lottery in which you will be
entered to potentially win even more.
We plan to publish the results of this study, but will not include any information that would identify you. There are
some reasons why people other than the researchers may need to see information you provided as part of the study. This
includes organizations responsible for making sure the research is done safely and properly, including the University of
Michigan and the study sponsor (USAID).
The interview will take approximately 40 minutes. Please contact Majlinda Joxhe (mjoxhe@poverty-action.org;
+39/3477073405) with any questions or concerns.
If you have questions about your rights as a research participant, or wish to obtain information, ask questions or discuss
any concerns about this study with someone other than the researcher(s), please contact the University of Michigan

Your participation is completely voluntary and all of your responses will be kept confidential and used for research
purposes only. Your name and contact information will not be shared and will be used only for the purpose of
contacting you. It is possible that someone from the study will contact by text message or mail.

Do you have any questions? If all of your questions have been answered, may we continue?

Introduction to experimental choices in this survey

          As part of this survey, we will be asking you to make a series of decisions regarding how you would allocate a
large amount of money, €1,000. In some of these you will be asked to choose how much to allocate between yourself
and one or more people in the Philippines. In another case, you will be asked how you would like to allocate €1000
entirely to your closest family in the Philippines, but across expenditure items. It is important that you take these
decisions seriously, because there is a chance that these decisions will be implemented. Let me explain how this will
work.
          At the end of this round of surveys (in about four months), we will hold a lottery among survey respondents,
including you. At least one (and possibly up to three) respondents in the study will win a €1,000 prize. If you are among
those chosen to win the prize, we will then randomly select one of your allocations in this survey to be implemented.

Lottery for MCCH

Here is the first decision we are asking you to make about €1,000.

First, please think about your most closely connected household (MCCH) in the Philippines. This is the household
that you feel closest to in the Philippines. It might be the household where you lived before going abroad, the household
where your closest relatives live, the household you send the most remittances to, or all of these, or none of these. You
decide which is your most closely connected household in the Philippines.

Please tell us how would you like your MCCH to receive the €1,000. We are not going to give the money in cash, but in
the way you tell us. It could be anything that you want us to give to them (not what you think your family would
want). What you tell us will not affect the probability of wining for your family, since the winner will be selected
randomly.

Tell us what you really want us to give to your MCCH. Think well, and tell us all what you really want, since if you
win, that is exactly what we are going to give them. It could be any type of expense or type of savings/investments. If
this choice is selected to be implemented, a project staff member will accompany each beneficiary to purchase the item
or pay for the expense specified.

It could be several things, but the total amount must add up to €1,000.

The important thing is that this is what you want for your MCCH.

 you some questions about the regular remittances that you send to people in the Philippines.”

PART II: EXPERIMENTAL ROUNDS


*Text to read to the respondent:
 Now I am going to ask you to make more decisions regarding about a large amount of money, €1,000. I will ask
you to choose how much to allocate between yourself and one or more people in the Philippines. As with the
allocation of €1,000 to your MCCH that we asked you about at the beginning of the survey, it is important that you
take these decisions seriously, because there is a chance that one of these decisions will be implemented. As I
mentioned at the beginning, we will hold a lottery among survey respondents, including you. At least one (and
possibly up to three) respondents in the study will win the €1,000 prize. If you are among those chosen to win the
prize, we will then randomly select one of your allocations in this survey (from among the one you decided on at
the beginning or the questions below) to be implemented.
Notes to enumerator: Refer to respondent’s ID1 and determine which of the following to read to respondents:

Treatment 1: Please keep in mind that because of the rules of this project, we will never inform your MCCH of any
of the choices you have made below. This means that your MCCH will not know of any of the choices you will be
making below.

Treatment 2: Please keep in mind that because of the rules of this project, if your name is chosen to win the €1000,
we must inform your MCCH of all the choices you have made below. This means that your MCCH will know of all
the choices you could possibly have made.

Treatment 3: Please keep in mind that because of the rules of this project, if your name is chosen to win the €1000,
we must inform your MCCH of all the choices you have made below. This means that your MCCH will know of all
the choices you could possibly have made. But if you choose any of the EduPay options, we will also inform your
MCCH that we encouraged you to allocate funds to EduPay by making a small donation to a Filipino organization
in Rome. If your name is chosen to win the E1,000, we will donate E5 to OFSPES for every EduPay payment that
is chosen to be implemented

Refer to respondent’s ID2 and implement experimental rounds in that order. If the respondent allocates anything
to other individuals, please collect the names of these individuals and the amount to be sent to each person. Make
sure that the amounts sum to €1000 for each question.

*Ask D5 always in the end.
Explain the experiment in D5 reading the example that is given on the questionnaire, do not give examples with
other amount of money. The examples are randomly implemented to each questionnaire and refer to 200, 400, 600,
800 and 1000.


Ask if each beneficiary is in the respondent’s MCCH, and if so check the relevant box [ ].
