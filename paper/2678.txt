      The    purpose of       this   paper   is to
                                                 characterize the changes in risk
premium     in the   1980s.   A   five-variable vector autoregressive model (VAR) is
constructed      to    calculate a risk premium series in         the   foreign exchange

market.        The    risk premium series is         volatile   and time-varying.   The

hypothesis     of no risk premium is          strongly rejected for the entire    sample

and   each of        the   two subsamples considered.       Various tests     using the

constructed risk premium series suggest that a risk premium existed but               it

was neither constant nor stable over subsamples and that its volatility was

considerably reduced after October 1982.

1. Introduction
       The   purpose of     this    paper   is to characterize   the time   series   properties
of the       risk premium in the l980s.            From the third week of 1981 to the 44th

week    of       1982 the yen depreciated from 199 yen per         dollar to   276 yen        per
                                                                              of

depreciation took place in the presence of a large                   yen

Note that the forward premium is equal to the interest rate differential

between the          two countries because of covered interest parity.                (See Ito

                                                                                       and    the

higher than the three-month yen-denominated interest

higher in 1982.

         These observations can be interpreted in several ways.               First, if      one

believes that the foreign exchange market is an efficient market without

risk premium,          then deviations between the forward rate and            the    ex    post

realized spot rate are due to unexpected events or                    mistakes of       market

probability sense,             that market participants      continuously made forecast

errors for two straight years.                Second, there may have been a          large but

constant risk premium in the foreign exchange                     market which prevented

uncovered interest parity from holding in the period of sharp yen                          depre-

ciation.         Finally,   it is possible that the risk premium was a time varying

risk premium, in which case the usual test of the efficiency of the forward

market assuming the zero or constant risk premium may be questioned.

    rates,      confirmed the       existence     of a risk premium and           found       evidence of

heterosked.asticity              and     nonlinearities.   Attempts to            incorporate            these

features in                theoretical    models by      Hodrick (1981) and               Stulz         (1981)

encountered various degree of success.

           An    alternative way to construct an ex-ante time series for the                              risk

premium         is to use     some measure of market expectations           .    For   example,       Frankel
and     Froot (1986), Dominguez             (1981) and   Ito (1988b) used survey data as                        a
measure         of expectation of future exchange rates.              Here we employ a                 simple

vector-autoregressions (VAR)                    forecasting model       to         construct           market

expectations as               k-step ahead forecasts,         conditional        on     the    amount      of
informationavailable              at each point in time.       The   risk       premium   is defined as
the difference between the model-generated expected spot rate and the
forward rate.
     The constructed measure of the risk premium allows us to draw

inferences about its correlation with the expected change in the spot rate
and on          its       predictability given the forward       premium         (see     Fame        (1984),

Hodrick         and Srivastava (1984) (1986) for similar exercises using realized

values of these variables).               It differs from the survey data used by                     Frankel

and Froot (1986), but the discrepancymay be explained if their data set                                    is

a     poor indicator of the correct expectations prevailing in                             the        market.

Alternatively, agents might have been somewhat                   unsophisticated forecasters
so  that rules of thumb are more appropriate than projection techniques to
describe their behaviour. In this case our results show that there would
have         been     a    substantial improvement       on    those forecasts                if      market

participants had            been using a time series model like ours.
      We      find that the risk premium series            is volatile,         and    that      it     shows


                                              2
strong nonlinearities,        time variation and structural changes.                 To study and

examine such a series we employ Bayesian techniques,                  which generate features

similar      to    the ARCH-M model of Engle, Lilien, and Robins                  (1987).     Time

variation is explicitly considered in a way that allows us to quantify its

influence         on the   variance of the        series.    We    exploit this technique,

developed, among others in Doan-Litterman and Sims (1984) and Canova (1981),

because it retains linearity in the specification of the model, but                         allows

for several nonlinearities to be present in the estimation process.                          Tests

of various hypotheses concerning the existence and the constancy of the risk

premium series are undertaken.

       The   results also support the idea that             the   monetary policy regime has
a   nonnegligible     effect on the time series properties of the risk premium in

the market,       a phenomenon largely neglected in previous theoretical models.

       The    rest of      the paper is organized as         follows:       the   next section

presents the VAR model and briefly suinarize its dynamic properties.                        Section

3    describes the construction of the risk premium, compares the                     measure of

market expectations generated with the one of survey data and outlines some

of    the    empirical features found.            Section 4        tests    several hypotheses
regarding to       the risk premium series using a version of a Bayesian AR                  model

and compares the           results   with   the     ones existing in           the    literature.

Concluding remarks are presented in section 5.


2    The VAR Model

       The weekly VAR model consists of five variables:                    (Logarithms of) stock

price indices and (levels of) short-term interest rates of the United States

and Japan, and the (logarithm of) yen/dollar spot exchange rate."                        Many

structural        models of    international finance have identified the these


                                        3
financial variables as important ingredients, although researchers do                                 not

agree        on    the    causal relationship among those variables.              The    VAR     model

treats all           variables as       endogenous,    and avoids biases due            to ad         hoc

exogeneity assumptions and restrictive specifications.                     Since the      principal

objective of             the VAR model in this paper is to derive the              expected spot

rate,        a    lack of identifying restrictions in the system does not                     cause    a

problem.

        We concentrate on the financial variables and exclude CNP, inflation or

government deficits,          since financial variables are quicker in responding to

the changes in the economy first.               The levels of the two interest rates               and

the     logarithm of the spot exchange imply, through covered interest                        parity,

the     forward exchange rate.           Since the VAR model yields         the     k-step ahead
forecast of          the spot exchange rate, a risk premium series, measured as                        a

deviation from uncovered interest parity, is easily defined in                          the    model.

Ito (1988a) demonstrated that the test of uncovered interest parity                           can be

formulated as            cross-equationconstraints in a VAR model.            In    this paper,

risk premium is numerically constructed, estimated and analyzed.

        We       choose to model the (log of) stock prices as a             trend       stationary
stochastic process          as opposed to   first     order difference stationary because
the latter        distorts the properties of the system, if the true model is trend

stationary.2" Also,            unit root    tests have a     low   power    in rejecting the
nonstationary        null hypothesis (Dickey and Fuller (1981)).              West (1986)         and

Sims,    Stock and Watson (1987) showed that the inclusion of a constant and                           a

trend    in a       system with   a unit root    allows us    to use standard asymptotic
theory even with unit          roots.    Therefore we chose to estimate the model                with

a  trend and a constant imposing a weakly restrictive prior on the
coefficients of each equation.

      Using      four different criteria and           one   diagnostic statistic           the


appropriate lag      length of our model       is determined to be five(lags 1 through
4    plus the 8th).       The    lag length implies that information in the past two
months    sufficient to form rational expectations in the foreign exchange
          is

market. (Details of determining the lag length are contained in Canova and
Ito (1987; Appendix A)).

       Some aspects of the dynamics among the variables can be sua.arized hy

the    F-tests of the hypothesis         that all lags of a certain variable are          zero

and by     the sign of the entries of the correlationmatrix                 of   innovations.

Table     I      shows     the    F-test    significance   levels     and    provides       the

                                                                No variable is uaeful in

predicting the           spot rate, while the spot rate adds        significant power in

forecasting interest rates.             In the U.S. stock price equation, the        interest

rates have explanatory power for the Standard & Poor 500 (SP500) index.

       Table 1 also provides a test for the joint hypothesis that the sum                   of

own coefficients in the spot equation is unity. Essentially,                 this is a test

of the random walk hypothesis. Some think that a random walk model (i.e. a
univariate one lag model with unit coefficient) is an appropriate forecast
device   (see Meese and Rogoff (1983)). Hakkio (1986), among others, stressed

the    low power of existing tests in rejecting the rando. walk hypotheais.

The    results     of the table show that longer lags help in           inference     and    in

forecasting,   contrary to an apparent random walk behavior.
       Contemporaneous correlations among innovations are relatively small

except for       the correlation between spot rate and           Eurodollar rate.         The

estimated signs           of    the   entries are reasonable.   For    example,     the   two

interest rates           move    in the same direction,    and an   unexpectedly strong



                                           5
dollar       is associated with high interest rates.              The   positive correlation
between       the two     stock price   indices also suggests that       an unexpected real

shock in one country is likely to affect indices in both countries, perhaps
because of the diversification of agents' portfolios. This also provides a

possible        justification   for the unexpected sign between Nikkei innovations

and     spot rate innovations.               These evidences      suggest that predictable
movements in the spot exchange rate are sufficientlywell explained by                      its

own past movement and that positive innovations in the Eurodollar rate                     are
associated       with yen depreciation.

        Next,     we proceed to define and analyze the risk premium behavior.              The

dynamics ofthe structural interdependence among financial variables in the
two countries as suinarized by impulse response functions and the variance

decompositions are reported           in    Canova and   Ito (1987)).

3. Overview of the Risk Premium Time                Series

        In   this section, the dynamic properties of the estimated VAR system are

translated into a stochastic process of risk premium. In section 4 we                     will

directly        estimate the risk premium series and test some                    hypotheses
concerning       its behaviour.
        Letting     s     stand for the (log of) yen/dollar spot exchange rate,
Etst+k for       the expected value at       t of the (log of) spot rate at t+k, t,t+k
for   the (log of) forward rate quoted at t              for transactions to be completed
at t+j,           interest parity
                covered                          implies that forward premium   equals the

interest rate differential:

        FPt,k      m   t,t+k -          =   R3A1 -     RUSt                       (3.1)
while   Uncovered Interest Parity (UIP) requires that:

        EXtx       m Et mt+k      -        = RIAt -RUSt       .                   (3.2)

                                             6
When UIP is not satisfied, risk premium is defined by:

                    m   R St+k — t,t+k                                                 (3.3)

       IMP    has been tested by many researchers with mixed results. (See,                    for

example,     Frenkel (1981), Hansen and Hodrick (1980), Geweke and Feige (1916),

and    Ito    (1988a).)            Since the expectation of the future spot rate         is    not

                                    the UIP test requires an additional assumption.            For
directly observable,

example,      the       rational      expectation hypothesis is used as       a   part of      the

maintained hypothesis in order to substituite out                   tt+k    However,   this kind

of test in the case of rejection, does not produce a time series of the risk

premium. Recently two ways to obtain

been    suggested:           one    uses survey data   (Frankel and Froot    (1986))    and    the


other   a    VAR    model    with montbly observations (Ito (1984)). This paper pursues
the second avenue.
       We     assume that rational           agents form   their forecasts by taking linear

projections on the                  available information set at      each t.     Linearity of

agents'       projections allows us to use the VAR outlined in the previous

section to construct a proxy for the best K-step ahead linear forecast, if

parameter estimates            are consistent with the amount of information available
at    each     t.    The use of the Kalman filter recursively generates parameter

         Plots of       the forward,       spot and expected spot rate are                 presented in

figure 1. Noticeable is the persistent divergence between the expected spot

rate and the forward rate for the period 81:14-82:1, confirming findings of

Ito (1984) using monthly data and by Frankel and Froot (1986) using                                 survey
data.        A    plausible explanation of this behaviour is that                    the    lifting of

capital controls in Japan, which occurred at the end of 1980, affected the

behaviour of          Japanese investors                   so that the forward rate was             a    bad

predictor for the expected spot rate (see Ito (1986)).

        In figure 2, we plot the behaviour of the annualized percentage values

for     the forward premium, the risk premium and the expected change                              in    the

spot     rate. Frankel and Froot       that for much of the time span
                                               (1986) found
under consideration, the expected spot rate from survey consistently

pointed      to an appreciation of the yen, from 15 % in 1981 to 6% in the                              late

1985.     According to             this data, agents were willing             to    sacrifice higher

effective returns             on    the yen in order to           hold dollars. This behavior

generates         a   risk premium on                the    dollar   both in       appreciation         and

depreciation phases and implies that most of the movements in                                  the risk

premium are induced by movements in the forward premium.

        It   is   evident in figure        2   that forward discount was relatively stable
in the    whole sample and that movements in the risk premia are entirely due

to      movements       in    the     expected change in             the                    rate.       The
                                                                           exchange

contemporaneous         correlations between these variables is close to one in
each     of the sample considered.              Also   it    is clear that,   until    1982,      the yen


                                                 8
was   expected to depreciate according to our         measure of   expectations
        It    is     heuristically interesting to compare the VAR     forecast      errors

with     the survey forecast errors. Frankel and Froot report that, for               a    13

week horizon for the (weekly) sample period from 1981:6 to               1985:12,         the


survey data collected by the Economist indicate an expected depreciation of

the dollar of, on average,          about 12.66% per year. According to the forecasts

that the VAR model generates the expected depreciation of the               dollar was

only 2.33% per year on average, with a standard error of 15.1 much closer to

the depreciation of 4.31% that actually occurred.4' Our results,             therefore,

indicate that if agents had used mechanical methods to generate forecasts

of future variables, they could have improved their predictions and                   reduced

the    forecast errors. In that sense survey data do not seem to             produce a

reliable          risk premium series.

       Figure         2   also confirms the findings of Fama (1984) and Hodrick and

Srivastava (1986)             regarding the negative correlation between the              risk

                            expected appreciation of the yen (our measure        of       risk
premium and           the

premium is            the negative of    theirs).   Further,   consistent with their

theoretical calculations,           the variance of the risk premium series (81.08)

is larger than the variance of the expected change in the spot rate (16.00)

and     the covariance between the risk premium and the expected depreciation

of     the yen (-154.22)       is larger than the covariance of the forward premium

with the realixed change in the spot rate (-13.14).

         A    discussion on the features of the risk premium series sunarized in

table              is in order." The risk premium generated here shows      large         vari-

82:41-85:52         is still positive after 26 lags, in contrast to 19 lags of         the

first subsample.        The sample mean of the process is 1.82 which, at an average

220     yen per dollar, corresponds to an average risk premium of about 2%             per

quarter.       For the two subsamples the means are respectively 20.98 and           - .41,

with the latter           being insignificantly   different from zero   at     the    5     1

significance         level. The standard deviation of the series is 16 so      that an

acceptable band of oscillation around the mean for a Gaussian process                would

be    (-25,40), which is approximately the hand of oscillation of the            series.

Note also that the standard deviation after 1982:40 is only 8, indicating a

substantial        reduction in uncertainties   generating the risk premium.

        The strong serial correlation in the risk premium series suggests the

presence of conditional heteroskedasticity.          To check this possibility we

first compute a diagnostic for some form of non-linearity in the series                by

regressing the          squared deviation from the mean on a constant and      its     13

lags.       Results of this regression are presented in table 3. An F-test for

the     null hypothesis of zero lag coefficients is strongly rejected for            the

whole sample and also for each of the two subsamples.

        To further check the existence of fat tails, we compute a test for the

kurtosis of the empirical distribution generating the risk premium in                the

subsamples.     The test, which compares the estimated kurtosis with the one of

a    Gaussian distribution,      rejects the hypothesis that the    distribution is

normal, implying the possible existence of heteroskedasticity.

        A   similar test for tLe skewness of the process indicates the existence

of    different skewness values in various subsamples. This result seems              to

support      the    conjecture of Fama (1984),     that   the   negative correlation

between the risk premium and the expected depreciation of the yen may                 be

during the period.
     In sum, the distribution generating the risk premium series is
nonatationary and        can   be approximated by a mixture of normal distributions.

The       the variance and the autocovariance functions are evolving over

section                                                                 can generate the

4.    Tests   of Time-varying Risk Premium

       In   this section we test the existence of a risk           premium,   its constancy
over time, and         the existence of a regime change in October 1982. Hodrick
and Srivastava(1984)            and Domowitz and Hakkio (1985),      among    others, have
tested some of these properties using ex-post measures of risk                premium and

different econometric techniques.
       The       existence   of nonstationaritiesand fat tails in the risk premium

series creates          problems for the estimation.           Economic theory does not

             a     precise indication of how the risk premium is               related to
provide

fundamentals in the economy. A coimion way to proceed in this case is to use

a quasi-differencingfilter to induce stationarity in the data and estimate

the    constructed series using a version of ARCH models (see Engle,                 Lilien

and Robbins (1987); Domowitz and Hakkio (1985)).

       Although       variants of     ARCH   models have   often proved to be useful
instruments        in estimating   time   series with some form of heteroskedasticity,
we    approach       the problem from a different point of view for           two   reasons.



                                            11
First,       the use of quasi-differencingfilters induces phase shifts                 in       the

data and spurious variability at high frequencies and this transformation

may    artificially reduce the                significance of    the    coefficients of         the

               6,'
regression.             Second,       the ARCH-M model which would be appropriate in

this context, introduces complex nonlinearities in the model so                      that       the

maximum likelihood estimation process requires an iterative procedure                            or

the calculation of numerical derivatives.7"

       Our approach is Bayesian in spirit. It retains linearity of parameters

and      variables       in     the        model structure,      hut     accounts    for        the

nonsrationarities and heteroskedasticityfound in the data by means                         of    a

time varying prior on the coefficients. The theoretical advantage of                        this

approach lies in the flexibilitywith which the specification adapts to                           a

rich  class of situations, without requiring data transformations and
complex nonlinearities in the model. (Canova and Ito (1987; appendix B)
show how a simple first order AR model with a rich enough prior

parametrization         on    coefficients is able to induce general            patterns of

conditional          heteroskeclasticity       and how    time variation       affects      the

unconditional structure of the model.)

       Let Y(t) be the risk premium series represented in figure                1. The model

we propose is the following:

        It = a.t(L) Yt1 +                   + Ct                '.
                                                                      (Q,52)    (4.1)
           — B0 = G (Bt_l              -   8o ) +   t      Ut (0,       °t)         (4.2)

                                                                                 Given the

complexity of the task, our approach is to            characterize the prior by means

of fixed parameters and search for the specificationwhich comes closest to
                                                                  chosen is
producing the posterior mode of the distribution. The methodology

                                                                 of                     the
parameters regulating the prior in order to construct the region

posterior distribution close to the mode8"

     Since the number of free parameters in (4.2) is large, we decrease the
                                                                                 to a set of
dimensionality by linking the free coefficients in           B,    G and

hyperparameters which       control the evolution of the          prior.    We    therefore

assume the following forms for the unknown parameters of (4.2):"

      G =       *   I
      B0=[l,0,0                               0]

      The model, as it is set up, is easily estimable recursively with                   the


Kalman filter algorithm        .   We   conducted an intensive grid        search in     the


unknown parameter space to generate the best possible fit guided by                      the


scaled likelihood statistics that the model generates)0",



                                         13
        Several interesting hypotheses can be tested in this framework.                     A test
 for the existence of the          risk premium involves testing the hypothesis that

 all Mt coefficents and the constant are zero.               A   test of   the existence of s
 constant risk premium implies that             all AR     coefficients are equal to        zero.

 Results     of the estimation and hypotheses testing are
                                                          reported in                     table    6

 for    the sample 81:14-85:25 and for the two subsamples which are
                                                                                       separated

 by the change in Fed's operating procedures.

       The    Ma    representation of the estimated model for the             entire sample

 (presented in the lower panel of figure 3) suggests that a unit                      innovation
 in    the   risk premium creates oscillatory responses up to 52                weeks, with

cycles evolving from 6 weeks at the beginning to 4 weeks at the end.                         This
time varying         cyclical behaviour        indicates    the presence of     elements of

instability        and   seasonalities    throughout the sample. The test of the non-
existence     and constancy of the risk premium is               strongly rejected.
       Given the results of previous sections, we suspect that the series
                                                                          may
show a       substantial     structural   break at 82:40. The existence of            a    regime
change can be tested in several ways. Maintaining the Bayesian approach we

can use      the     Schwarz criteria and compare the likelihood for              the       whole

sample with     the sum of likelihoods for the two
                                                   subsamples.
                                                               11/              The gains      in
precision for the one-step ahead forecasts are evident when the                        optimal
hyperparametersare recomputed after 1982,40.12/ Following this result,                        we

reestimate the process for the two subsamples. Several                     differences are

noticeable in         the   estimated coefficients and             in various     hypothesis
testings.     In    the first sample,          several coefficients are          significant

(expecially        at longer lags) so that the tests which reject the null hypo-

thesis are strongly significant,            the unconditional variance is finite             but
the variance of the recursive residuals is large. The estimated specifica-


                                          14
tion for the second subsample shows a coefficient larger than unity on                 the


first       lag, with a significant    t-statistic.   This result confirms that        the


conditional variance of the estimated process is nonstationary and that the

unconditional variance is infinite so that asymptotic theory may not               apply

and    standard tests              not have   the   correct interpretation.      The   MA

representation for the two suhsamples do not show the oscillatory behaviour

of    the     MA representation for the entire sample. However, for        the    period

1982-1985      the peak of the response after a few weeks confirms the           presence

of nonstationarities and of a strong hut short heteroskedasticmemory.

        The optimal amount of time variation needed for estimation and testing

is large. There is a significant difference across subsamples: while before

1982:40       5% of the variance of the time series on a weekly basis is due            to

time variation,        after 1982:40 time variation accounts for only 0.2 % of the

variance.       For    the   entire sample the optimal    amount of    time variation

                    increase in the variance of the prior of 7% each period.            To
requires an

tesr the significance of these numbers against the null hypothesis that no

time variation exists, we again use the Schwarz criteria.                 The     results

 (1986) our     estimates     suggest a much lower fl-coefficient for a regression of

 the    realized changes in the spot rate on the forward             premium and      smaller
estimates       of the differences between the variances of the forward premium

and of the expected changes in the spot rate. As Domowitz and Hakkio (1985)

we confirm the rejection of the null hypothesis of no risk premium and,                    in

addition,      we show the importance of time variation within each subsample.


S.   Conclusion
        In   this paper   a   VAR model   was employed   to study the exchange rate and
risk    premium dynamics in
                         the yen/dollar exchange market. The VAR model
produces better forecasts than the survey responses for the transition
period       between 1981-1982.     Our measure    of risk premium    is very volatile in
1981-82       and strongly serially correlated afterwards.           Also the       associated
time    series is time varying and nonstationary.              Although these features
could    be     the   result of a peso problem there is         no    evidence that       this

conclusion is appropriate for the specific case under consideration.                     Tests

on  the risk premium series, undertaken through a new estimation technique,
confirms the significance of the risk premium over the sample period.
However, the series was neither constant nor stable over subsamples.
         results of this paper are extended to a multi-country framework in
       The

our forthcoming work, in which it is shown that the most important feature
discovered are conon to all dollar exchange markets, but tends to disappear
when risk premia are calculated using croas exchange rates.

basis     and    then converted into the weekly series by sampling the                   data at

There     are several indices for stock prices which could be used.                    We    select

the Standard & Poor's 500 (SPSOO) and the Nikkei, a weighted average of                          225

stock prices.            We also looked at the New York Stock exchange composite

(NYSE)     index and         at   Tosho,   the    Tokyo Stock     exchange composite,             as

alternatives,         but empirical results were not affected by                 the   choice of

particular variables.             For the short term dollar denominated intereat rate

we    chose     the    offshore (Eurodollar)          3-month interest    rate    and    for    yen

denominated interest rate the Gensaki rate (see Ito (1986) for reasons                           for


using the Gensaki rate).

      A   sensitivity analysis was conducted to assess the robustness of                        the

results       to the elimination of the years 1979-80, a period where Japan had

substantial      capital controls.     In that case, 1981 data are used to estimate

the   model      and forecasts are generated starting from 1982.                 None of        the

      The plot of the log spectrum of the series shows that most of the power

is     concentrated at             low frequencies.     This indicates               that a        low        order

polynomial            will suffice to generate a transfer function with the                              required

properties.             A random walk assumption on the coefficients of the model                               may

be     the most              appropriate   prior in this case,                but     there        are        other

specificationa with                the coefficients of the            AR polynomial close to one

which    may    be        sufficient. For this reason we set G=X0*I where              I       is     the

 identity matrix and l-X0 is the decay parameter toward the mean, which                                    is

restricted to be less than one. The mean of the process is assumed                             to      be

unity on the first lag and zero otherwise. Also, we scale down the                              prior
variance to sccount for the uncertainty regarding the correct prior model

specification         by        assuming that a linear combination of         coefficients is

represents the amount of time variation injected in the unconditional
variance of the coefficients at each date. A value of 1 implies that no
extra variance is               added at each point in the      estimation.       Finally,            we
assume an uninformative structure                 on   ct by assuming a prior mean of               zero

and   a relatively large variance.

12/ A       more standard procedure to test for structural breaks would               be    to

split      the   sample   and    construct    a       stability test of    the    parameter

estimates using F-tests.             Standard tests do not        apply here      since     the

assumption of homoskedasticityis not satisfied.                Following Hansen(l982) we

construct a        heteroskedastic    consistent covariance matrix as            V==C1DC1T,

where C=l/T(Et X(t)'x(t))               and where D=l/T(Et X(t)'u(t)'u(t)x(t)),             and

then apply an F-test. The significance level of the test is                  .3E-09       which

rejects the        hypothesis of constancy of the coefficients across the                   two

samples.
