We report results from our long-standing research partnership with the Massachusetts Department
of Elementary and Secondary Education. We make two primary contributions. First, we illustrate the
wide range of informative analyses that can be conducted using a state longitudinal data system and
the advantages of examining evidence from multiple cohorts of students. Second, we document large
income-based gaps in educational attainments, including high-school graduation rates and college-
going.Importantly, we show that income-related gaps in both educational credentials and academic
skillhave narrowed substantially over the past several years in Massachusetts.

                     Income-based Inequality in Educational Outcomes:

                       Learning from State Longitudinal Data Systems

       During the first three-quarters of the 20th century, the educational attainments of

Americans increased rapidly. This remarkable trend made possible the rapid economic growth

that produced a rising standard of living for most American families (Goldin & Katz, 2008).

Since the mid-1970s, the growth in educational attainments has slowed markedly, and gaps in

academic achievement and educational attainments between children growing up in low-income

families and those raised in more affluent families have grown (Reardon, 2011; Bailey &

Dynarski, 2011). These trends jeopardize future economic growth and the upward

socioeconomic mobility of which Americans historically have been so proud.

       Most of the evidence on trends in educational inequality comes from datasets such as the

National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP), the National Longitudinal Surveys of

Youth (NLSY), and the longitudinal surveys sponsored by the U.S. Department of Education.

While analyses based on these datasets have provided a great deal of information about national

trends, they are of very limited value in examining patterns and trends within states. This

matters because the U.S. Constitution leaves the governance of public education to the states. A

result is that states have developed quite varied educational systems, with differences in such

dimensions as funding levels, academic standards, high school graduation requirements, and

teacher licensing provisions. Consequently, inequality in educational outcomes, the sources of

such inequality, and progress in remedying it may differ widely among states.

       As of 2013 every state has a longitudinal data system that tracks the academic progress of

every student enrolled in the state’s public schools. These data systems, many of which states

created quite recently with financial support from the U.S. Department of Education, provide a
new resource for studying patterns and trends in educational outcomes within states. Moreover,

a growing number of states are merging their longitudinal databases with data sources that

provide information on post-secondary outcomes such as college enrollment and graduation.

This ability to examine college outcomes is especially important today because post-secondary

educational attainments are more important predictors of labor market earnings than they were

four decades ago. Together, these longitudinal datasets that track individual students through the

state educational system and into college present substantial opportunities for researchers and

policymakers to understand trends in educational outcomes overall and by subgroup, and to

assess the effectiveness of educational policies.

       In this paper, we describe results from a seven-year-long partnership with the

Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education aimed at increasing

understanding of the consequences of the state’s educational reform efforts. The paper makes

two kinds of contribution. First, it provides considerable evidence regarding income-based gaps

in educational outcomes and especially on changes in the gaps over time. Second, it illustrates

the wide-range of informative analyses that can be conducted using a state longitudinal data

system.

       In the next section, we describe national trends in education-related wage differentials

and income-based educational inequality, as well as several factors that contribute to this

inequality. We then describe our datasets and empirical approaches in more detail. We present

our main results and conclude with a discussion of these findings, focusing on several key

lessons for policymakers. Most of our analyses are descriptive and demonstrate important trends;

where our analyses support causal inferences, we note this clearly.

Income Inequality and Educational Attainments: Evidence from National Data




                                                                                                  2
Educational Attainments and Labor Market Earnings

       During the 1980s, education-related wage differentials grew substantially and have

remained remarkably high by historical standards. For example, in 2012, the average terminal

four-year college graduate over age 25 earned 63% more than the average terminal high school

graduate, who in turn earned 38% more than the average high school dropout, and more

education is strongly related to the probability of having a full-time job (Bureau of Labor

Statistics, 2012). A number of recent studies with strong causal designs show that, to a large

extent, these earnings differences reflect payoffs to educational attainments rather than self-

selection of the most able students to higher levels of education (cf. Card, 1999; Heckman et al.,

2008). Furthermore, other recent studies have documented that additional education improves

many dimensions of recipients’ quality of life, including their own health and wellbeing and, in

the case of women, the health of their children (Oreopoulos, 2007; Lochner & Moretti, 2004;

Lleras-Muney, 2005). Finally, obtaining more education than one’s parents has been an

important mechanism of upward socio-economic mobility for many generations of Americans.

Educational Inequality

       There are large income-related gaps in educational attainments in the United States. For

example, among students who turned 24 in 2006, those from the top quartile of family income

had completed nearly four more years of schooling, on average, than those from the bottom

quartile (Bailey & Dynarski, 2011). This mirrors a strong income gradient in college access and

persistence: nearly 80 percent of students in the top quartile of family income enter college by

age 25, compared to just 30 percent of students in the lowest quartile. Of these students, more

than two-thirds of high-income students persisted in college and graduated, compared to just

under one-third of the lowest-income students (Bailey & Dynarksi, 2011).




                                                                                                     3
        These attainment patterns have resulted in rates of inter-generational socio-economic

mobility in the U.S. today that are lower than those in several European countries (Jantti et al.,

2006). Although the average American completes more education than his/her parents did, the

proportion of students who have lower levels of educational attainment than their parents

(downward mobility) is higher than it was during the 1950s and 1960s. According to Hout and

Janus, “twenty-five percent of men in the late 1990s and 20 percent of men and women in the

last decade were downwardly mobile, despite sharp increases in the college aspirations,

expectations, and preparation of young people” (2011, p. 173). Thus, increases in educational

attainments have become a less powerful driver of intergenerational social mobility than in the

past.

Sources of Educational Attainment Gaps

        There are large gaps present at the start of kindergarten between the average skills of

students from low-income families and those from higher-income families (Duncan &

Magnuson, 2011). A number of studies show that inequalities in investments during children’s

first years of life contribute to these achievement gaps and that they have long-term

consequences for children’s life chances (Heckman et al., 2010). Inequality in family

investments in children during the schooling years also contributes to income-based gaps in

student achievement (Duncan & Magnuson, 2011; Farkas, 2011). So does residential and school

segregation by family income, both of which increased substantially during the last two decades

of the 20th century (Reardon & Bischoff, 2011; Altonji & Mansfield, 2011). The increasing

concentration of low-income children in particular schools reduces the quality of education they

receive through several mechanisms, including peer-group effects and the difficulty in attracting

and retaining strong teaching staffs (Duncan & Murnane, 2011; forthcoming).




                                                                                                     4
       Over the past few decades, the standards-based reform movement has sought to address

the vastly different levels of educational quality and rigor experienced by students in different

schools. This movement has had a broad and powerful influence on education policy. About half

of all states – serving nearly 70% of the nation’s schoolchildren – have taken these policies one

step further by requiring students to pass exit examinations in order to earn a high-school

diploma (Center on Education Policy, 2012). In most states, including Massachusetts, students

first take these exit examinations as 10th graders. Because low-income students tend to score

worse on these tests, they are more likely to fail the exit examinations. Students who fail have

many opportunities to retake the tests and pass them. However, in part because low-income

students have fewer family resources to support them and because they attend schools with large

numbers of failing students, failing may present a greater barrier to high school graduation than it

does for higher-income students. In Massachusetts, barely failing the 10th grade mathematics

examination reduced the probability of graduating from high-school for urban, low-income

students who were in 10th grade in 2004 (Papay, Murnane, & Willett, 2010).

Measuring Educational Attainment Gaps

       Although measuring educational attainments seems like a straightforward task, it is

anything but. Most past evidence on educational attainments in the United States – including

high-school graduation rates and college-going rates, as well as their predictors – derives from

large, national datasets. These studies are valuable because they provide a broad-based and

nationally representative picture of educational inequality. However, estimates of educational

attainments from these datasets are surprisingly sensitive to the choice of data source and

methodological decisions that analysts make (see Mishel & Roy, 2006; Murnane, 2013; and

Heckman & LaFontaine, 2010 for more detailed discussion). National longitudinal surveys




                                                                                                    5
resolve some of these challenges, but they rely on self-reported data on educational credentials,

which are subject to substantial measurement error, and face issues with non-random sample

attrition (Murnane, 2013).

       Because of these limitations, the federal government has required all states to develop

longitudinal datasets that track individual students over time and enable the state to report four-

year graduation rates (US DOE, 2008). Furthermore, many states have taken additional steps,

linking these data with information on post-secondary educational enrollments from the state

higher education system or from the National Student Clearinghouse, an organization which

tracks individual student enrollments at more than 95% of U.S. colleges and universities.

       These datasets present real opportunities for policymakers to understand educational

attainment patterns in their state. Most importantly, they allow states to determine how many

students entered a particular grade (such as grade 9) in a particular year. By tracking these

students over time, analysts can then determine what proportion of these students graduated from

high school or attended college in a set interval of time. These longitudinal state datasets thus

provide more precise information about when students fall out of the educational pipeline than

national surveys do.

       That said, these state datasets face several important limitations, which we highlight

below. Most importantly, they do not track students after they leave the public educational

system of a particular state (e.g., to go to a private school or out-of-state). This raises the

question of how to treat such students in calculations of statistics such as the high school

graduation rate. The answer to this question can have marked impacts on estimates of high

school graduation rates for particular schools and districts and for particular subgroups of




                                                                                                      6
students. Consequently, the answer is directly relevant to the design of state accountability

systems.

Research Questions

       This paper highlights the value of using state longitudinal datasets to shed light on

income-based gaps in educational attainments, the sources of these gaps, and progress in closing

them over time. We address three broad questions:

   1. How do the educational attainments of Massachusetts students from low-income families

       compare to those of their peers from more affluent families?

   2. Does information on achievement and school attachment gaps present before entry into

       high school account for much of the income-related gaps in educational attainments?

   3. How have the educational outcomes of low-income students in Massachusetts changed

       over the past decade, both absolutely and relative to those of higher-income students?

Data and Methods

Data and Sample

       To address our research questions, we have integrated several datasets provided by the

Massachusetts Department of Elementary and Secondary Education (DESE). The process

through which we obtained these administrative data may be instructive to other researchers. In

2001, DESE began the process of building a data system that would provide longitudinal

information on the academic progress of all students attending the state’s public schools. In

2007, DESE created an Office of Planning and Research to make better use of the data coming

out of the new system to support research on a variety of questions relevant to educational policy

making in the state. Recognizing that the agency had limited capacity to pursue research

internally, the director of the office, Carrie Conaway, reached out to academic and research




                                                                                                  7
organizations to promote use of state data for research relevant to improving public education in

the state.

        We recognized the potential value of the DESE longitudinal data system and proposed to

use it to study the intended and unintended consequences of standards-based reform policies in

the state. The DESE supported this project because the lessons learned could prove useful to

Massachusetts policymakers. The next step was to develop a Memorandum of Understanding

that permitted DESE to provide us with longitudinal data on Massachusetts public school

students while abiding by the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act,

which the U.S. Congress passed in 1974. Under the terms of the MOU between DESE and

Harvard University, which lawyers from the two organizations negotiated and endorsed, our

group at Harvard use the DESE data only to address questions that Associate Commissioner

Conaway approves. To the extent that new projects fall outside the original agreement, both sides

agree to either modify the MOU or develop a new one to govern each project. We agreed to keep

the data secure on encrypted computers at Harvard, which only members of our research team

access, and to provide drafts of our research papers to Ms. Conaway 30 days before presenting

them at conferences or submitting them to peer-reviewed journal.

        The arrangement with DESE has worked out well. DESE has provided our team with

annual data updates for all Massachusetts students. Ms. Conaway’s team has answered a great

many questions about the data, for example, how the state assigns individuals to a graduation

cohort or how exceptional cases are treated in estimating high school graduation rates. Ms.

Conaway has also approved using the DESE data for a variety of projects of interest to the state,

including several doctoral dissertation projects proposed by students working with us. The

original MOU that we negotiated has formed the basis for collaborations that DESE has




                                                                                                    8
developed with other researchers. Importantly, the state provides these data free of charge.

          Our research team has contributed in a variety of ways to the quality of the DESE data

and to its constructive use. For example, we were able to secure funding to add to the DESE

data system information from the National Student Clearinghouse (NSC) on post-secondary

enrollment and educational attainments of Massachusetts public school students. We were also

able to work with the Secretary of Education in Massachusetts to convince several public

colleges and universities in the state to provide data to the NSC, and consequently to the DESE

data system. DESE found the NSC data such a valuable addition to its information system that it

subsequently used Department funds to pay for updates. To make the research findings more

useful to state policymakers, Ms. Conaway has also instituted a policy that researchers who use

state data produce a research brief appropriate for non-academic audiences. The Commissioner

distributes those briefs to superintendents and principals through his weekly email to the field.

          The data we obtained from DESE track students throughout their public school careers

(K-12) and include unique student identifiers, state test results, demographic characteristics,

school and district identifiers, and responses to surveys that students complete just before taking

the state tests in 8th and 10th grades. This database includes all students in the state public school

system. It contains information about students’ educational attainments through the end of high

school.

          To these data, we have matched information on post-secondary attainment from the

National Student Clearinghouse (NSC). The NSC merged students to the state data system using

their proprietary matching algorithm that relies primarily on student names and dates of birth.

This dataset indicates whether students have enrolled in college, the date of their enrollment, the

name of the school they attended, and key information about the school, such as whether it is a




                                                                                                      9
two-year or a four-year institution. Thus, by combining these datasets we can track students

throughout the Massachusetts public school system and through college.

       Massachusetts presents a valuable case study because it is one of the highest performing

school systems in the country. Since the Massachusetts Education Reform Act of 1993, which

introduced standards-based reforms and state-based testing, Massachusetts has invested

substantially in K-12 public education. As part of these reforms, the state began administering

the Massachusetts Comprehensive Assessment System (MCAS) mathematics and English

language arts (ELA) examinations in 1998. Since then, the state has been praised for having

among the most rigorous academic standards in the country and examinations that align closely

with these standards (Finn, Julian, & Petrilli, 2006; Quality Counts, 2006). Furthermore,

Massachusetts students are consistently among the nation’s top performers on the National

Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) examinations (NCES, 2008).

       Massachusetts is also a state with a population and an economy somewhat different from

much of the rest of the country. In 2007, per capita income in Massachusetts ($51,254) ranked

third among the 50 states and its percentage of the adult population with a four-year college

degree (38%) ranked first (U.S. Census, 2009). In Figure 1, we present the monthly

unemployment rate (top panel) and annual poverty rate among children (bottom panel) for

Massachusetts and the United States as a whole. While both unemployment and child poverty

trended up substantially starting in 2009, rates in Massachusetts remained well below national

averages. These economic patterns may contribute to some of the trends in the educational

attainments of Massachusetts students that we document.

       In many of our analyses, we focus on students who were first-time 8th graders in the 2003




                                                                                                  10
through 2008 school years.1 (Throughout the paper, we refer to school years by the spring of the

school year.) These cohorts were scheduled to graduate from high school in 2007 through 2012.

We narrow our sample to relevant years to examine longer-term educational outcomes, and we

expand it when examining trends in intermediate outcomes over time. We choose 8th grade as

our baseline in most analyses because nearly all students in the state are in school in 8th grade;

students cannot drop out of school until age 16. In our primary sample, 38% of the students are

low-income. These students tend to go to school in urban districts and to be from racial/ethnic

minority groups: of the low-income students, 64% attend an urban school, 19% are African-

American, 28% are Hispanic, and 46% are white. In comparison, 88% of higher-income students

attend school in a non-urban district and 92% are white.

Measures

        We define low-income students as those eligible for a free- or reduced-price lunch, which

includes those whose family income is less than 185 percent of the poverty threshold income

designated by the U.S. Census Bureau. We refer to all other students as “higher income”. The

low-income indicator in our dataset is obviously time-varying; students can move in and out of

eligibility. There is also some concern that this indicator underreports the number of low-income

students in high school as students do not complete the necessary paperwork. As a result, we

define students as having low family income if they are ever recorded as qualifying for the

program. Thus, higher-income students are those who never qualified. It is important to keep in

mind that we treat as “higher income” students who come from families with incomes just above

the threshold for reduced price lunch eligibility. Thus, the contrasts we draw between the

educational attainments of low-income and higher-income children are much less stark than


1
 The state data system began in 2002, and we use these data to identify (and exclude) any students who appear as 8 th
graders in 2003 but were also in the 8th grade in 2002.


                                                                                                                  11
those described in national studies comparing outcomes for children from families at the 20th and

80th percentiles of the income distribution.

        The advantage of this approach is that we may classify as low-income students who do

not complete the necessary paperwork in later grades and that we more accurately identify

students near the margin of the threshold as low-income. However, we may also mis-classify

students as low-income whose families only had a temporary decline in income, perhaps during

the recession. We find that the median low-income student in our data reported being eligible for

free- or reduced-price lunch (FRPL) in 91% of the possible reporting periods. Thus, this issue is

not a major concern. In Appendix A, however, we present results with an alternative measure,

classifying students as low-income if they met the FRPL standard in the majority of the periods

they appeared in the dataset. The central findings are quite consistent across these alternative

measures.

        Our key outcomes include two measures of students’ educational attainments: whether

students graduated from high school and whether they attended college. We define our high-

school graduation outcome directly from the state data. In each semester, the state records

whether students were still enrolled in school, had dropped out, had graduated from high school,

or any of a range of other outcomes (including expulsion, transferring out, etc.).2 We treat GED

recipients as non-graduates (Murnane, 2013; Cameron & Heckman, 1993). We define our

college attendance outcomes using information provided by the National Student Clearinghouse

for all students in the state. We measure whether students attended college, the type of college



2
  In some of our analyses, we focus on the group of students with defined high-school completion outcomes; in other
words, we exclude students who transferred out of the Massachusetts public school system (or who died). We do
this because we have no information about whether students who transferred went on to graduate from high school
or not. If we include this group of students with missing high-school completion outcomes, we get nearly identical
results about the magnitude of the income-related gaps, although the absolute proportions of students who graduate
from high school are lower.


                                                                                                                12
they initially attended (two-year or four-year), and whether students graduated from college,

although we can only examine this final outcome for a small proportion of students. Whenever

possible, we track students’ progress until six years after their cohort enters high school. For

example, we track 2003 8th graders through 2009. For students who progress on track with their

cohort, this provides college enrollment information two years after they graduate from high

school.

          Our remaining predictors are standard variables from state data systems, such as student

demographic characteristics, scores on state tests, and school attendance. In 8th grade, all students

took the MCAS mathematics examination; for most analyses, we standardize these scores by

grade and year, although we also use scaled scores to examine trends over time. We also create a

standardized measure of school attendance defined as the proportion of the school days in a

particular year that the student actually attended school.3 To examine the effect of school

attended, we define each student’s school as the first high school that they attend after leaving 8th

grade.4 Finally, we examine student performance on the 10th grade exit examinations. Because

the state’s scaled scores have such a coarse scale, with multiple raw scores mapping on to a

single scaled score, we use raw scores in our main analyses.5

Data-Analytic Strategy

          To examine income-related gaps in educational attainments and trends in these gaps over

time, we use simple cross-tabulations. To examine the extent to which income-related gaps in

  Technically, we use as the denominator the number of days the student was in “membership” in the school system,
meaning that they should have been enrolled. Thus, a student who transferred into the school system late in the year
would not be counted as having poor attendance.
4
  Students who drop out before entering high school are included in our analysis but are coded together as having a
“missing” school.
5
  Although multiple raw scores map to the same scaled score, each raw score corresponds to only one scaled score in
a given year. For example, in 2004, all students earning 23 to 26 points received a 220. The state derives its scaled
scores by using a piecewise non-linear transformation that leads to clumping of students near the scaled score
thresholds. There are no such issues with the raw scores (see MA DESE, 2011, for more information on the MCAS).


                                                                                                                  13
attainments can be accounted for by 8th grade attendance and test scores, we fit OLS regressions

of the following basic form for student i:

       𝑌𝑖 = 𝛽0 ∗ 𝐿𝑂𝑊𝐼𝑁𝐶𝑖 + 𝑋𝑖′ 𝛼 + 𝜀𝑖

We include different predictors in the vector Xi and use different measures of educational

attainment as outcomes in different models. We begin with a baseline model that predicts the

outcome of interest as a function of low-income status alone (i.e., we do not include any

additional covariates in the model). To examine how pre-existing student characteristics affect

income gaps, we add to the model students’ standardized 8th grade attendance and standardized

8th grade mathematics score. Additional models include student demographic characteristics and

school fixed effects, explicitly comparing students within the same school. We fit linear

probability models for ease of interpretation, although we find nearly identical substantive results

with logistic regression models.

       Finally, we use a regression-discontinuity design to analyze the effect of barely failing

the 10th grade exit examination on students’ educational attainments. The state assigns students

to either pass or fail the exit examination on the basis of a rigidly applied cutoff score on the test.

As a result, students scoring just on either side of the cutoff have similar academic skills, but are

assigned to a different status (see Murnane & Willett, 2011, and Lee & Lemieux, 2010 for

detailed discussions). In essence, we are looking for a discontinuous disruption in the probability

of earning each educational attainment for students on either side of the cut score.

       We implement this regression-discontinuity design using the approach laid out by Imbens

& Lemieux (2008) and described in detail for this particular context in our previous work

(Papay, Murnane, & Willett, 2010). We re-center the raw test scores by subtracting out the value

of the corresponding minimum passing score such that a student with a score of zero had




                                                                                                    14
achieved the minimum passing score. We use local-linear regression analysis and focus attention

on students who fall in a narrow window around the cut score. We also seek to understand

whether the effect of barely failing these exit examinations has changed over time in the state.

Here, we estimate the regression-discontinuity model described above for each three-year period

(given the limited sample of low-income students, we focus on three-year windows), essentially

looking at a “moving average” effect of failing within each period.

Educational Attainment Gaps

       In Massachusetts, higher-income students graduate from high school, attend college, and

persist in college at greater rates than their low-income peers. In Figure 2, we present the

proportion of low-income and higher-income 8th graders in Massachusetts (in 2003 through

2006) who graduated from high school, attended college, and attended a four-year college within

two years after their cohort graduated from high school. Clearly, the distribution of educational

attainments heavily favors students with higher family incomes, and the income gaps increase as

attainments rise: there is a 20 percentage-point gap in high school graduation rates, a 31

percentage-point gap in college-going, and a 39 percentage-point gap in four-year college

attendance. Nearly 65% of higher-income 8th graders go on to attend a four-year college,

compared to fewer than 25% of low-income students. Among the 2003 8th graders, the cohort we

can follow the longest, 37% of higher-income students graduated from a four-year college within

four years of their cohort’s high school graduation compared to just 8% of low-income students.

Explaining Gaps in Educational Attainment

       Identifying these gaps in educational attainments raises the question of why they arise.

We describe three stylized facts about low-income students in Massachusetts and provide

evidence – both descriptive and causal – about how they contribute to income-related attainment




                                                                                                   15
gaps. In particular:

(1)   Low-income students enter high school with much weaker skills (as measured by test

      scores) and poorer school attendance than higher-income students.

(2)   Low-income students tend to attend high schools serving primarily other low-income

      students.

(3)   Low-income students perform worse on high-school exit examinations than higher-income

      students.

Pre-existing differences in achievement and attachment to school

       Low-income students have much lower test scores and are absent much more frequently

than their higher-income peers. The median 8th grade mathematics score of low-income students

is equal to the 16th percentile score among higher-income students. Similar patterns emerge in 8th

grade attendance; here, low-income students lag behind higher-income students by 0.45 standard

deviations, equivalent to approximately one additional week of school. By and large, these gaps

do not suddenly emerge in 8th grade, but have existed since elementary school.

       Clearly, many factors contribute to income-related educational attainment gaps. These

begin at the time of conception and include many things outside the control of schools, such as

nutrition, health care, and myriad experiences within and later outside the family. Not even the

richest of longitudinal datasets capture more than a small portion of the relevant influences. Our

strategy is simply to ask what proportion of income-based gaps in educational attainments can be

accounted for by differences in pre-high school experiences that are summarized in grade 8 math

scores and attendance.

       In the left hand bar of each set of bars in Figure 3, we illustrate the income gap in one

measure of educational attainment: high school graduation, college attendance, or 4-year college




                                                                                                   16
attendance. The subsequent bars in each set illustrate the extent to which differences between

low-income students and higher-income students in 8th grade mathematics achievement,

attendance, school attended, and other student demographic characteristics account for the

income-based gaps. Differences in 8th grade math achievement alone account for 1/3 to 1/2 of the

attainment gaps. Notice that attendance patterns add explanatory power over and above the

impact of 8th grade test scores, suggesting the importance of attachment to school.6

Differences among high schools

        One factor that may account for income-based gaps in educational attainments among

students with the same grade 8 math scores and attendance are differences in the high schools

they attend. Indeed, as illustrated by comparing the heights of the third and fourth bars in each

set in Figure 3, differences among high school attended do account for a small proportion of the

income-based gap in each of the three educational attainment measures. However, more than

one-third of the income-based gap in each of the educational attainment measures consists of

differences among students with the same grade 8 mathematics score and attendance who attend

the same high school.

        Importantly, demographic characteristics (such as a student’s race, gender, age, English

proficiency status, and special education status) explain very little of the remaining income-

based gaps in educational attainments, when estimated in a model that controls for 8th grade math

achievement, 8th grade attendance, and high school attended. In other words, these income-based

gaps do not simply reflect the effects of student race or other standard demographic

characteristics. Instead, as indicated by the height of the right-most bar in each set, many

unobserved factors, including the conditions of poverty, contribute to income-related gaps in

6
  Since grade 8 math scores, attendance, and student demographic characteristics are correlated, the contribution of
each in accounting for the income-related gap in attainment depends on the order in which the variables are added to
the model.


                                                                                                                 17
educational attainments, particularly in post-secondary enrollment.

         A complementary way of examining income-based gaps in educational attainments is to

explore whether the size of the gap is different for students who enter high school with strong

skills than for those who enter with relatively weak skills. In Figure 4, we present rates of high-

school graduation, college-going, and four-year college-going for low-income and higher-

income students at the 10th, 25th, 50th, 75th, and 90th percentiles of the 8th grade state mathematics

test-score distribution.7 The bottom part of each bar represents the proportion of low-income

students scoring at that percentile who attain the outcome within two-years after their cohort

graduates from high school. The full bar represents the same value for higher-income students,

so the striped area represents the income-based gap. We see strikingly different patterns across

the test-score distribution and across outcomes, suggesting that different margins are at play at

different parts of the distribution. For example, there is a large gap of nearly 19% points in high-

school graduation rates among students with very weak 8th grade skills, but this gap narrows with

student performance such that there is no gap among students at the 90th percentile. In contrast,

among students at the 90th percentile, there are quite large gaps in four-year college-going. For

both college-going and four-year college-going, gaps are largest near the middle of the test-score

distribution, reaching a maximum of more than 20% points among students scoring at the

median.

High School Exit Examinations

         Income-based gaps in educational attainments are present even among students who

express plans to attend college. Of students who take the 10th grade examinations, a large

majority – 82% of low-income students and 90% of higher-income students – say they plan to

 For precision, we include all students within 0.05 standard deviations on either side of the relevant percentile in
each year.


                                                                                                                       18
continue to post-secondary education.8 While the income gap in college-going plans is only 8

percentage points, the gap in actual college attendance is 30 percentage points. Among students

who report college-going plans in 10th grade, only 59% of low-income students actually do

attend (within two years of their cohort’s high-school graduation), compared to 82% of higher-

income students. Thus, there are substantial barriers to college attendance even among students

who remain in school through 10th grade and think that they are on target to attend college.

         For most high-school students, matriculating to college requires them to graduate from

high school by passing a sufficient number of courses and demonstrating proficiency on state

exit examinations in mathematics and English language arts. Exit examinations increase the cost

of graduation for students who fail them because they must retake and pass the examinations.

This is not much of a concern for most higher-income students, as 94% of these students pass

both tests on their first try. However, 23% of low-income students fail at least one of these tests,

and almost 8% fail both, on the first attempt. Thus, because low-income students perform worse

on these tests, the exit examinations are more likely to pose an obstacle to graduation for them.

         Importantly, identifying group differences between students who pass and those who fail

does not provide causal evidence that failing an exit examination presents a barrier to graduation.

Students who fail the examination have, on average, much lower academic proficiency and

presumably would have had a much greater probability of dropping out even in the absence of an

exit examination requirement. We can, however, exploit the natural experiment presented by the

state’s assignment of students to pass or fail the test using a sharp cutoff to draw causal

inferences about the effect of passing the test for students scoring near the cutoff. Using a

regression-discontinuity design and data from the 2003 through 2009 10th grade cohorts, we

                                                                                                           19
compare the outcomes of students with essentially equal proficiency but who fall just on either

side of the cut score. We focus our attention on mathematics because most students who fail an

exit examination fail this exam.9

        Because we have reported similar results elsewhere (Papay, Murnane, & Willett, 2010;

Papay, Murnane, & Willett, 2014), we simply illustrate key findings here, using more cohorts of

data than were available to us in the past. In Figure 5, we show the fitted local linear regression

over the sample average probabilities of graduating or attending college. Even among students

with the same 10th grade test score, low-income students have much lower probabilities of

graduating from high school or attending college. Furthermore, the effect of barely failing the

test is much greater for low-income students. This is represented by the jump in the fitted

probability at the cut score. For low-income students, barely failing the test reduces the

probability of graduation in five years by 2.8 percentage points (p<0.001) and decreases the

probability of attending college within two years of cohort graduation by 3.5 percentage points

(p=0.012). Barely failing the exit examination does not reduce the probability of high school

graduation or college enrollment for higher-income students.

Trends over Time

        Thus far, we have documented large income-based gaps in educational attainments and

identified several important determinants of these gaps. From a policy perspective, though, a

critical question is whether attainments and gaps are increasing or decreasing. Longitudinal state

datasets enable researchers to look within the system for evidence of progress. Examining

educational attainments is particularly useful because of the well-known limitations of

examining trends in state test scores over time (see Koretz, 2008).


9
  We have discussed elsewhere the opportunities and limitations of examining in the same analysis the effects of
failing either or both of the exit examinations (Papay, Murnane, & Willett, 2011; 2014).


                                                                                                                   20
Trends in Educational Attainments

       Over the past decade, as Massachusetts has made substantial public investments in

support of its standards-based reform strategy, educational attainments for both low-income

students and higher-income students have increased. Moreover, income-based gaps in

attainments have grown smaller.

       In Panel A of Figure 6, we display income-related gaps in high-school graduation rates

measured four, five, and six years after students enter high school. This figure reveals two

important patterns. First, income-related gaps in high school graduation rates have declined

substantially over the time period we examine. The gap in four-year graduation rates has fallen

from 27 percentage points for students who were in 8th grade in 2003 to 22 percentage points for

the cohort of 8th graders in 2008. This represents nearly a 20% reduction. Second, this figure

shows the limitation of using 4-year graduation rates to measure educational attainments. The

income-based gaps in six-year high school graduation rates are much smaller than the gaps in

four-year or “on-time” graduation rates. This is because low-income students are much more

likely than higher-income students to take more than four years to graduate from high school. In

fact, 12% of all low-income students who graduate from Massachusetts public schools take more

than four years to do so, compared to just 3% of higher-income students. As a result, the income-

related gap in six-year graduation rates is more than 20% smaller than the gap in four-year

graduation rates.

       Importantly, the narrowing gaps over time seen in panel A do not fully reflect the

improvement in graduation rates for low-income students because the graduation rate of higher-

income students in the state has also increased. In panel B, we illustrate this trend, showing the

improvement in overall four-year graduation rates for low-income students and higher-income




                                                                                                     21
students. We choose four-year rates, despite their limitations, because they enable us to examine

more cohorts. We present two estimates of the four-year graduation rate in each bar. The solid

portion represents what we call the “raw” graduation rate, simply the proportion of students in

each 8th grade cohort who are known to graduate on-time with their cohort. In other words, 52%

of Massachusetts low-income 8th graders in 2003 graduated from a Massachusetts public high

school four years later in 2007, and 79% of higher-income students in this 8th grade cohort did

so. This figure necessarily understates the true graduation rate because it includes students in the

denominator who may not belong there – namely students who are recorded in the database as

having left the Massachusetts public school system prior to graduation, either by transferring to a

private school (or to home schooling) or who left the state. The striped section of each bar

adjusts the graduation rate by removing from the denominator students who, according to

information provided by high schools, fall into this category.10 However, to the extent that

students may be misclassified as transfers, the full bars may overstate the actual graduation rate.

Regardless, though, we see attainments increasing for both groups.

           Given that our college-going data derives from a national dataset, the transfer issue is less

important for analyses of college enrollment. In Panel C, we present results on trends in college-

going, showing the proportion of low-income students (solid bar) and higher-income students

(total bar) who enroll in college one and two years after cohort graduation. The pattern is similar

to the high-school graduation patterns: the gaps are smaller when students have more time to

take the next step, attainments are rising, and income-based gaps are narrowing over time. For

example, the percentage of low-income students enrolling in college within two years of their

cohort’s scheduled high school graduation was 6 percentage points higher for the 2006 grade 8

cohort than for the 2003 cohort (an increase of nearly 15 percent), and the income gap was 2

percentage points lower for the later cohort than for the earlier one.

Trends in Intermediate Educational Outcomes

         We can gain additional insight about educational progress by examining trends in

intermediate educational outcomes, namely, test scores, attendance, and course selection. If

schools are becoming more effective, such outcomes should also be improving and gaps should

be narrowing. Test scores are rising for both low-income and higher-income students, and again

low-income students are catching up.11 We can see this pattern clearly by examining test-score

distributions for each group over time. In Figure 7, we present Quantile-Quantile (QQ) plots that

show the relationship between two test-score distributions. For example, in Panel A, we compare

the 2003 and 2011 8th grade mathematics test-score distributions for low-income students. Each

point represents a particular quantile on the distributions. The dashed lines illustrate that a low-

income student scoring 240 in 2011 (the “Proficiency” cutoff) is at the same point in the low-

income score distribution as a low-income student scoring 224 in 2003 (just barely above the

“Needs Improvement” cutoff).12 In Panel B, the dashed lines illustrate that a higher-income

student scoring 240 in 2011 (the “Proficiency” cutoff) is at the same point in the higher-income

score distribution as a higher-income student scoring 230 in 2003. The diagonal line indicates the

pattern we would see if the two distributions were identical. As such, the degree to which the

plot differs from this diagonal line indicates how different the two distributions are.

         Trends in attendance also show improvement for both low-income and higher-income

students and gaps closing over time. In 2003, the gap was over 3 percentage points, or about 5.5



11
   Over the past two decades, Massachusetts students have also exhibited substantial achievement growth on the
National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP). This growth has been more rapid – for all students and for
low-income students – than in the rest of the nation. However, we do not focus on gaps in the NAEP for several
reasons. First, the test is not aligned to the state standards in Massachusetts. Second, the definition of low-income
students is different than the one we use throughout the paper.
12
   This corresponds to the 69th percentile, although the exact mapping to percentiles is not apparent from the chart.


                                                                                                                    23
days. By 2011, attendance for both low-income and higher-income students had improved and

the gap narrowed by 14%, or about one day a year. In total, these patterns contributed to the

average low-income 8th grader attending school by 2.6 more days in 2011 than in 2003.

         Finally low-income students are taking more advanced courses earlier in high school.

Based on data from surveys that students took when they complete their state testing, 29% of

low-income students in the 10th grade in 2003 were in Algebra I or General Math in 10th grade.

By 2011, only 10% of low-income 10th graders were in such courses. Furthermore, in 2011,

nearly 30% of low-income 10th graders enrolled in Algebra II, compared to just 14% in 2003.13

Test Score Gaps by Time in the Public School System

         Further evidence that students’ educational histories affect their eventual attainments –

and that Massachusetts schools are succeeding in narrowing achievement gaps – comes from

examining how the performance of students changes as they spend more time in the state’s

public school system. In Figure 8, we present the income-related mathematics test-score gap in

grades 4, 6, 7, 8, and 10 (the years for which we have a sufficiently long panel of test data). Each

line represents students who entered the Massachusetts public school system in a particular grade

and stayed through 10th grade. For example, the bottom line shows the income-based gap in test

scores for students who entered in grade 4, pooled across cohorts.14 Notice that we are

comparing low-income and higher-income students who arrived in the system in the same grade

and who stayed through 10th grade.

         We find striking patterns. The downward slope of each of the lines in Figure 8 illustrates

that the achievement gap between low-income and higher-income students closes the longer

13
   These patterns of high-school course-taking are not as definitive as other trends measured in 8 th grade, because
they could reflect changes in high-school dropout behavior. However, given that attainments are increasing
throughout this period, we believe these reflect, if anything, an understatement of the shifts in course-taking.
14
   Each line provides score trends for a common sample of students, those who have non-missing test scores in each
of the tested grades. The patterns look similar when we look at all relevant students in a particular grade.


                                                                                                                  24
students spend in the state’s public school system.15 For example, among students who entered

the system in 4th grade, the gap narrowed from 0.94 SD in 4th grade to 0.68 SD in 10th grade, a

reduction of more than 0.25 SD. Among students who entered the system in 8th grade, the gap

narrowed from 1.16 SD to 0.95 SD in two years.16

Trends in the Effects of Educational Accountability

         As illustrated in the top panel of Figure 9, low-income students are passing the 10th

mathematics and English language arts exit examinations on their first attempt at much higher

rates than they were ten years ago, and the income-based gap in passing rates has narrowed

substantially. In 2003, 87% of higher-income students passed both tests on their first try,

compared to just 56% of low-income students, a gap of more than 30 percentage points. By

2011, this gap had narrowed to 12 percentage points. This trend does not reflect substantial shifts

in the test-taking population: among 2003 8th graders with low family income, 76% continued on

to take the 10th grade exit examinations; among the 2008 8th grade cohort, the comparable figure

was 80%. Indeed, given the negative correlation between family income and test scores, these

patterns should produce a trend in the opposite direction.

         One consequence of the improvement in the academic performance of 10th graders over

the last decade is that that the exit examination requirement has become an obstacle to

graduation for fewer low-income students in recent cohorts than in earlier cohorts. But what

15
   There are several possible explanations for the vertical separation of the lines, which indicate that income-related
test-score gaps are larger for students who arrive in the state school system later in the schooling careers. Most
obviously, low-income students who arrive in the state later in their careers may be different than those who arrive
earlier. Students who appear in our Grade 3 comparison are those who entered the state in 3rd grade and whose
families remained until 10th grade. By contrast, those in the Grade 8 comparison entered in 8 th grade and stayed
through 10th grade. It is likely that, on average, students who enter in 8 th grade are more mobile. While this analysis
controls explicitly for differential mobility within each line, it does not do so across lines.
16
   In theory, this pattern could also result from higher-income students hitting the test-score ceiling earlier than low-
income students. However, in practice, for the sample of students who arrive in the state in grade 4 or beyond, this is
not a concern because very few of these students hit the test score ceiling. For example, on the grade 10 test, fewer
than 10 students who enter the state in any of these cohorts, or less than 0.4% of the sample for a given cohort, hit
the ceiling.


                                                                                                                      25
about those low-income students who did fail the 10th grade MCAS mathematics examination?

(Recall that just failing this examination lowered the probability of graduation by 2.8 percentage

points for low-income students in the 2003 to 2009 10th grade cohorts.) Are high schools better

able to support struggling students today than they were a decade ago? To answer this question,

we fit the regression-discontinuity model in equation (1) for a moving three-year window across

the years in our data. In the bottom panel of Figure 9, we plot the estimated effects of barely

passing the examination (instead of barely failing it) on the probability that low-income students

graduate from high school within five years of their cohort entering high school. We plot these

effects for each year, using the middle of the three-year moving window in each case.17 As the

figure illustrates, the estimated effect of barely failing the test for low-income students fell from

approximately 4 percentage points in 2004 to 1 percentage point or less in 2008. Thus, failing the

test poses less of a hurdle to graduation for low-income students today than it did several years

ago.18

Conclusion

          That low-income children in the United States have much lower achievement and lower

educational attainments, on average, than higher-income students has been well documented.

Indeed, this is one of the principal findings of the “Coleman Report,” published in 1966. As

mentioned above, both family-related and school-related factors contribute to this pattern. A


17
   We estimate three different versions of each effect, from models where we use bandwidths for our local linear
regression analysis of 3, 4, and 5 score points, and find quite similar results in each case.
18
   We can only speculate about why the effect of failing for students on the margin of passing has fallen over time.
One possible explanation is that students are now doing much better on the 10 th grade examination. As a result, the
students who are on the margin of passing are now drawn from further in the tail of the test-score distribution. For
example, the average 8th grade mathematics score of low-income students within three points of the cutoff on the
10th grade test in 2008 is more than 0.3 standard deviations lower than such students near the cutoff in 2004. An
alternative explanation is that the improvement in performance has reduced the number of failing students that
schools need to serve. For the average low-income student near the cutoff in 2004, 26% of her peers in the school
failed the test. By 2008, that figure had fallen to 16%. Finally, schools and districts may be more successful in
providing remediation and support to students who fail.


                                                                                                                   26
difficult question is how schools can do a better job of educating low-income children and

perhaps even level somewhat the playing field on which they compete with higher-income

children.

           There are many stories in the media and even some quantitative studies of individual

schools that have improved the achievement and educational attainments of low-income students

markedly.19 However, to our knowledge, until quite recently there have been no systematic

analyses of the success of a state school system in closing income-based gaps in academic

achievement and educational attainments. One reason is that the requisite data were not

available. Now almost all states have data systems that track the academic progress of students

in public schools. In this paper we show how these data can support a wide range of analyses

that shed light on the nature of income-based gaps in educational attainments and progress in

closing these gaps.

           We document large gaps in educational attainments between low-income and higher-

income students in Massachusetts. These gaps become greater at higher levels of attainment. We

show that low-income students arrive in high school lagging behind their higher-income peers in

test scores and school attendance, and they attend different schools. However, even when we

compare students in the same high school with similar characteristics, 8th grade test scores, and

8th grade attendance, large gaps in subsequent attainments remain. Differential responses to the

state’s exit examination policy may account for part of this remaining gap, as low-income

students perform much worse on these tests and barely failing them reduces attainments more for

low-income students than from higher-income students. But, clearly the effects of poverty (or its

correlates) produce substantial disadvantages in educational attainments for low-income youth.

           Importantly, we also document clear signs of progress over the past decade as educational
19
     See, for example, Dobbie & Fryer (2011) and Angrist et al. (2010).


                                                                                                    27
attainments of low-income students in Massachusetts have increased and income-based gaps in

attainments have closed substantially. This pattern contrasts with the national trend of increasing

income-based inequality in educational outcomes that Reardon (2011) has documented. In

summary, the analyses we conducted provide evidence that the educational system in

Massachusetts has made substantial progress in reducing educational inequalities and in

improving the life chances of low-income students. Of course, the analyses also show much

more work remains in the effort to provide all Massachusetts public schools with the skills and

educational attainments they will need to thrive in 21st century America.

       We close with three suggestions for other researchers conducting analyses of educational

attainments using state longitudinal databases. The first is to recognize that disadvantaged

students often take longer than other students in reaching educational goals, including high

school graduation. Consequently, gaps between disadvantaged students and other students in

reaching academic goals “on time” will be larger than gaps measured one or two years later than

“on time.” Furthermore, in examining the effects of educational interventions on students’

attainments, researchers should recognize that understanding the ultimate effects may require a

relatively long time horizon, particularly for low-income students.

       Second, there is great value in examining trends over time. For example, analysis of any

one of the cohorts of Massachusetts students in the last decade would have shown substantial

gaps in attainments between low-income and higher-income students. While no surprise, given

the history of such patterns, the results for a single cohort might suggest that the substantial

Massachusetts investments in public education over the past two decades have not borne fruit.

The analyses of trends in attainments that we present tell a quite different story.

       Third, good research always raises new questions and consequently it is useful to plan a




                                                                                                   28
program of research rather than a single study. State longitudinal datasets, such as the one we

examine, provide invaluable information in developing such a program. In our case, further

questions include some that can be addressed with more finer-grained analysis, such as whether

the progress that we documented takes place throughout the state’s 300 districts or has been

concentrated in a subset of districts. However, even the best dataset leaves many open questions:

Did the progress stem from observable changes in the day-to-day experiences of low-income

students in Massachusetts public schools? What combination of policies produced these

changes? Understanding the sources of the improvement in the schooling of low-income

students will require detailed analysis of the school-level and classroom-level practices that have

facilitated it, research quite different from the analyses described in this paper.
