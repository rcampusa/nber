                              When Market Share Matters




                                          ABSTRACT



      We investigatepricing to market when the exchange rate changes in cases where
     firms' future demands depend on their current market shares. We show that i)
     profit maximizing foreign firms may either raise or lower their domestic currency
     export prices when the domestic exchange rate appreciates temporarily (i.e. the
     "passthrough'from    exchange   rate changesto import prices may be perverse); ii)
     current import prices may be more sensitive to the expected future exchange rate
     than to the current exchange rate; iii) current import prices fall in response to
     an increase in uncertainty about the future exchange rate. We present evidence
     that suggests the behavior of expected future exchange rates may provide a clue
     to the puzzling behavior of U.S. import prices during the 1980s.

      With the dramatic swings in the value of the dollar over the past six years has come
the observation that foreign producers charge different prices in U.S. markets than in other
markets, that is, they "price to market." Furthermore, these price differentials appear to
be sensitive to the level of the exchange rate.                It   is well known, for example,          that pricy
German cars became far more expensive in the U.S. than in Europe during the 1980-84
appreciation of the dollar. Since then, as the dollar has declined substantially,U.S. prices
of these cars havefallen dramaticallyrelative to the prices of thosesold in foreign markets.1
Most of this unprecedented fluctuation in relative prices is reflected in the recent failnre

of foreign exporters to pass through exchange rate changes into dollar prices. Based on
historical relationships, the dollar prices of U.S. imports did not fall fast enough as the
dollar first appreciated, and those prices have subsequently risen by only a small fraction
of what we might predict based on the decline in the dollar's value. This recent drop
in the degree of pass-through has become critically important because it has halted the

long-awaited improvement in               the U.S. trade deficit.2 The efficacy of further attempts to
push down the value of the dollar will hinge on whether the magnitude of the pass-through
remains smalL
      Why would we expect foreign exporters to sell their goods at a higher price in the U.S.
than abroad when the dollar appreciates? One obvious answer is that foreign producers
may not be thoroughly foreign, in that some of their costs of selling in the U.S. market
are denominated in dollars. Foreign firms must advertise, sell and distribute their goods

in their overseas markets, incurring associated costs abroad.3 A second answer is that an
appreciation of the dollar may reduce foreign producers' elasticity of demand. A foreign
monopolist with fiat marginal costs will keep its foreign currencyprice constant if demand
has constant elasticity, but will reduce its dollar price by a percentagethat is less than half
that of the exchange rate change if demand is linear. In standard oligopolistic models in
which foreign firms face U.S. competition, the dollar price falls proportionately less than
the dollar appreciation even with constant elasticity demand.4 A third explanation for
pricing to market, offered originally by Krugman (1986), emphasizes dynamic supply-side
effects. When foreign firms gain competitive advantage through an appreciation of the

dollar, it may be costly for them to step up sales quickly. Marginal costs of exports to
the U.S. must rise, and, consequently, prices become higher than abroad, Baldwin and
Krugman (1986) and Dixit (1987), consider adjustment behaviorwhen foreign firms face
fixed costs of enteringa market that are larger than the fixed costs of remaining. In these

models,    a large enough exchange rate shock, even if it is temporary, results in a permanent
change in the level of imports — an effect now best known as hysteresis                                   —   as well   as a

permanent reductionin the degree of pass-through.

nor have they risen as rapidly as history would predict duringthe subseepseri depreciation. In addition, foreign profit margins

liooper (1987) for a thorough discussion of the behavior of these profit margins, and for the import an forecasts of the trode

     None of these explanations,however, offers a convincing reason for the abrupt fall in

the pass-through that occurred as the dollar began to appreciate in 1981.       It   is hard to

argue that the "domestic content" of foreign firms' production costs rose suddenly or that
the elasticity of demand jumped upward, due to a change in the number of foreign and
domesticfirmsin import-competingindustries. Indeed, the "beachhead" model of Baldwin

(1986), and Baldwinand Krugman (1986) predicts that competition increases in the U.S.
market when the dollar appreciates, driving prices down. This effect tends to magnify,

rather than reduce, the exchange rate pass-through during that period.
     This paper takes a different approach by focusing on dynamic demand-side effects
in an oligopolistic market. These effects can both induce hysteresis and explain why
the degree of pricing to market may change substantially through time. In our model,
the future demand for each firm's product depends in part on its current market share.
Because demand is in   a sense "sticky," firms' current strategic choices will affect future
as well as current profits. The future exchange rate then becomes important because it
determinesthe value of future profits. Thus our approach emphasizes not only the extent
to which foreign firms will pass through current exchange rate changes, but also how the

pass-throughis affected by expected future exchange rates. Indeed,we show how the pass-
through can be different in magnitude and even      in sign   depending on whether exchange
rate changes are thought to be temporary or permanent.
    In responseto a temporary appreciation of the dollar, for example, foreign exporters
to the U.S. will reduce their dollar prices by less in our model than in the standard static

oligopoly framework. This occurs because the appreciation increases the value of current
relative to future dollar profits, expressed in foreign currency. When the value of the dollar
is temporarily high, foreign firms will find investmentsin market share less attractive, and

will preferinstead to let their current profit margins grow. In fact, the expectationthat the
dollar will depreciate over time may erode the value of future profits so much that foreign
firms will actually rai3e their dollar prices when the exchange rate appreciates. In other

                                             3
circumstances,perfectly flexible dollar prices   will   appear completely rigid in response to
current exchange rate fluctuations.
     Permanent dollar appreciations,on the other hand, do not create such incentives to
shift profits from tomorrow to today. Instead, foreign firms' relative costs fall in both
periods in response to a permanent appreciation. Foreign exporters will compete more
intensely and unambiguously drive prices down. Indeed, permanent appreciations may
lower prices by more in our models than in a static oligopoly model. Our results suggest

that, once the temporary appreciation of the dollar has been fully unwound, further dollar
depreciation that is perceived as permanent will lead to a much greater degree of pass-
through and a much more rapid rate of improvement in the U.S. trade balance.
    The uncertaintysurroundingfuture exchange rates also has an effect on current prices
in our model. Foreign firms' future profits are typically convex in the exchange rate since

a dollar appreciation is associated with both a reduction in dollar costs and an increase
in the foreign currency value of dollar profits. A more variable exchange rate therefore
adds to the expected return on a (risk-neutral)foreign firm's investment in market share,
and so prompts more vigorouscompetitionfor market share today. Prices in the domestic
market therefore fall.
    The plan of this paper is as follows, Section 1 presents a general two-period model
in which market shares matter, There we emphasize that our basic results are sensitive

neither to assumptions about the nature of competition (Cournot or Bertrand), nor to
the precise form of demand. In section 2, we specialize the model to a simple 'switching
costs" model that follows Klemperer (1987a) in order to get a sense for the magnitude
of the effects on the pass-through of exchange rate changes. Section 3 then turns to

disaggregatedbilateral export price data to investigatethe sensitivity of pricing to market
to the expected degree of permanence in exchange rate changes. Section 4 concludes.

1. A General Market Share Model

   In this section we present a simple two-period model in which firms' second-period
demands,and hence their second-period profits, depend on their first-period market shares.
This dependence can arise from a number of factors.
     First, consumers may face substantial costs of switching between brands of a product
even if the brands are ex ante undifferentiated.5 For example,consumerswho havelearned

to use one type of computer system find it costly to learn a new one, even though the sys-
tems may be functionally identical. When they purchase more computer equipment, these
consumers have       a clear incentive to buy only hardware and software that are compatible
with their current system. In addition to such learning costs, there may be transactions
costs of switching suppliers. An examplewould be the costs of returning rented equipment

to one firm and then renting identical equipment from a competitor. Okun (1975) em-

phasizes the costs of breakingpersonalsales relationshipsin industrial transactions. More

recently, Krugman and Baldwin (1987) have built a "book-of-the-month-club model" in
which long-term contracts between buyers and sellers are costly to abrogate in the short

run. Firms themselvesencourage these attachments using such devices as repeat purchase
discounts.

     Second,    a consumer may be unwilling to switch from a brand that he has tried and
liked to an untested rival brand (if brands are "experience" goods in the terminologyof

Nelson, 1970). Indeed, consumers incur search costs even in finding out about the existence
or price of a competing product.6 Past sales also serve to advertise a firm's product to
those consumers who have not previously purchased its product.
     Another reason why past market share matters is provided by networkexternalities,
which give consumers incentives to purchase products that other consumers have purchased

previously! For example, as more compact-disk players were sold, the disks themselves

became cheaper and more abundant, raising the value of a CD player to new and old users
alike.

     That these or other effects   —
                                       including perhaps 'irrational" brand loyalty       —   make

market share important is attested to by the emphasisplaced by many businessexecutives
and corporate strategy educators on market share as a goal and a measure of corporate
success. Corporate planning models often rest heavily on the assumption that the future
demand for a product will be positively correlated with its present sales.

     Considertwo firms, a domestic firm D and foreign firm F, each maximizing its profits
over two periods of competition in the domestic (say U.S.) market. In period one, firm
D chooses its first-period strategic variable, vF, to maximize its total discounted future
profits:

                               =        vfl+Air(cf(v?,iifl,e2)                                     (liz)

taking F's first-period strategic variable, vf, as given. Total profits, irD, are the sum
of the firm's first- and second-period profits, irf and irf, respectively. Second-period
profits can be written in reduced form as a function of the firm's first-period market share,

f, and the   second-period exchange rate,    e, expressed here in units of foreign currency
per dollar. Future profits are discounted by the factor AD into first-period terms.            It is
convenient to assume that a higher value of i4 represents more aggressive play, so             that
the firm's market share   isan increasing function of iij. Thus for quantity competition
we write     = q,   and for price competitionwe have = _pl' where and            q
                                                                                 are i's

first-period quantity and dollar price, respectively,   i=   fl F.   In   what follows, we remain
within a partial equilibrium framework, assuming that the exchange rate, as well              as    the
aggregateprice level, is exogenous to the firms.
     Firm F chooses   vf analogously    to maximize the present discounted value of its own-

currencyprofits:

                       = e1irf(vf,vf,ej)+A'e2i4(af(v,vf),ez).                                      (ib)

 irf and     ir are the firm's first- and second-period profits in dollars, e1 and e2                                  are the
 first- and second-period price of dollars in terms of the foreign firm's currency, and                                      )f
is   the discount factor used by the foreign firm to value second-period profits in terms of

first-period profits in its own currency. Each firm's costs of production are denominated
in its own currency, and its cost curve is the same in both periods.
        In non-cooperative equilibrium, given                   e1   and 2, we have the first-order conditions:

if market share had no value (in which case = 0). How much more aggressively they
compete, however, dependson how much they value future market share, and this depends
in part on the exchange rate.

        Notice that firm i's discount factor is inversely proportional to the interest rate in i's

home market, A' = j3/(i                       where       measuresthe duration of the second period relative
to the first. More generally, we could think of /3 as indexing the importance of current
market share for future profits. If capital is perfectly mobile internationally, the domestic

and foreign interest rates will be related to expected depreciation according to Covered
Interest Parity:
                                                        AD   = AFe/e                                                        (3)

foreign firm's home market, since our main focus is on how the foreign firm's prices will

      Equations (5a)-(&d) tell us the effect of changes in exchange rates on firms' first-period
choices   vf and uf.        In each case we have separated the overall effect into two components:
a cost effect,    C, and a real interest rate effect, I.
      The first-period cost effects, Cf and                Cf are familiarfrom the standard static duopoly
model. A temporary appreciationof the dollar exchange rate — an increase in e1 — results in
a proportionate decreasein the foreign firm's first-periodcosts measured in dollars. (Note

that from the second-order conditions, 6°f is unambiguously positive and proportional to
F's marginal costs). Even if market share did not matter, the foreign firm would translate
this competitive advantage into more aggressive play. The term Cf measures D's response
to F's more aggressive behavior: with a positively (negatively) sloped reaction curve D

behaves more (less) aggressively. With price competition these effects unambiguously

lower F's dollar price (raise vf) and with quantity competitionthey usually do so. (With

quantity competitionand homogeneous products, they do so if pD                                >   i,   which is true for

any stable symmetric equilibrium.)

the standard models of exchange rate pass-through in oligopoly by Dornbusch (1987) and

Krugman (1986).'
      The terms        C and C are the second-period cost effects. They measure the impact
on firms' first-period behavior of the reduction in                       F's second-period costs brought about
by   a future appreciation of the dollar. Such a change in costs affects the intensity of
second-period competition,changing the marginal value of market share to both firms and,
therefore, the aggressiveness with which firms compete for market share in the first period.
In F , the term e2 _____ .is precisely the change in the marginal value of market share to
F caused by its dollar cost reduction resulting from a change in e.                                   While we cannot be

definite about its sign (for example, market share might be an important determinant of

the second-period outcome only when firms' costs are similar) we expect it to be positive,
that is. we expect market share to be more valuable to a firm when its costs are lower.14
Assuming this term is positive,                      is positive and also proportional to the sensitivity of

first-period market         sh::eto F's first-period strategic variable,                            Similarly,     the sign of
     is the sign of
                          e20D, which measures the change in the marginal value of market
share to D caused by a change in F's costs resulting from the exchange rate change. We
expect this term to be smaller in magnitude than the corresponding term for F (since
customer loyalty and other market-shareeffects tend to insulate D from effects resulting
from changes in F's costs) and negative. Thus we expect yD < 0 and jy0 < Fj, at
least around the symmetric equilibrium. Hence we also expect C' to be positive,15 and
      to be smaller in absolute value than                  c(. It follows that with either price or quantity
competition, this cost effect acts to lower prices in the first period. The intuition for this
fall in prices is that a future appreciation of the dollar lowers F's second-period costs and

thereforeraises the value to F of market share today. This effect does not arise in standard
static models.
      Observe      that the effects of a permanent percentage change in the exchange rate (i.e.,
dej/eg = de2/e2) are simply the sums of the cost effects:

                                          dD            dD

                                           de1           de2
Thus the effects of a permanent exchange rate change exceed the cost effects of a temporary

exchange     rate change.16
     In addition to cost effects, this model gives rise to what we call real interest rate
effects. A temporary appreciationof the dollar makes future dollar profits relatively less

valuable than current dollar profits. Firms therefore place less emphasis on market share
and instead let their current profit margins grow. This effect not only tends to raise the
price of exports to the U.S. relative to other markets, but also raises the absolute dollar
price of exports to the U.S. when the dollar appreciates. Note that from equation (4), a
temporary appreciationof the dollar is associated with a rise in the U.S. interest differential.
The impact on domestic firms is exactly the same                         as   on foreign firms; more precisely, in
a symmetricequilibrium if = If. Provided that the firms are nut too asymmetric (and
always if reaction curves are upward sloping) these terms are positive.17
    While the real interest effect leads to very substantial pricing to market by a foreign

exporter, it also implies that the same price changes will occur even in thoroughlydomestic
industries. Such an outcome is general to any model of intertemporalprofit maximization
     This suggests a presumption that t.he effect.! of a permanent exchange rate changeare greater here than in a standard model
in which market share is amimpartant, and in which the only effects present are C' and Cf. There are reasonsfar caution on
this point, howerer. First, incorporating the market-share effects changes firms' s'al,,e functions in the special model of the
                                                                                                  —

in which firms have some ability to shift profits over time. Keynes refers to a similar effect,
which posits positive correlationbetween the level of prices and the nominal interest rate,
as Gibson's paradox18 Phelps and Winter (1970), Phelps (1986) and Fitoussi and Phelps

(1986) discuss the tendencyfor high real interest rates to raise markups in a single-economy
model. Indeed, Fitoussi and Phelps (1986) place much of the blame for the persistently

high rates of unemployment in Europe on this kind of mechanism.
       Of course, if we had fixed the U.S. interest rate instead,then the effect of a temporary

exchange rate change would               be absent in the absolute level of dollar prices in the U.S.
market. The required fall in the foreign interest rate, however, would raise the return on
investments in foreign market share, and the relative dollar price of the identical good
in the foreign market would neverthelessfall. Thus, regardless of the change in either

country's interest rate, as long as the interest differential increases with the temporary
dollar appreciation,the differential between U.S. and foreign prices increases as well.
     In fact, in a model more general than this one, we would see interest rate effects in
the U.S. market even if only the foreign interest rate moved in response to the increase
in expected dollar depreciation. Assume firms produce for both the U.S. market and the

foreign market and are capacity constrained, or, more generally, have increasingmarginal
costs in the short run. Then a temporary dollar appreciationwhich leaves the U.S. interest
rate unchanged but reduces foreign interest rates makes foreign market share relatively
more valuable than U.S. market share. It follows that firms will reallocateoutput toward
the foreign market and away from the U.S. market, thereby raising U.S. prices.
     In the current model, the total effect of a temporary exchange rate appreciation on
prices is ambiguous, since the real interest rate and cost effects are opposed. It is quite
plausible that the two effects are                     so that import prices will appear
                                              of similar magnitudes,

to be sticky in response to changes in the value of the dollar that are perceived to be

  '°See lCeyne (1930). See also Baroky and Summer, (1905) for empirical evidenceof Gibson', paradox. Lowerreal interest

temporary. This stickiness arises despite the fact that prices are perfectly flexible. In the
example of the next section, the real interest rate effect can easily dominate, leading to
a perverse response of import prices to exchange rate changes: dollar import prices may
rise when the dollar appreciates. In general, the real interest rate effect must dominate if

firms' costs are sufficiently low.
        An expected future exchangerate change gives rise to an interest rate effect that
is equal and opposite to a temporary change. To see this, observe that a permanent

appreciationis equivalent to the sum of a temporary appreciation and an expected future
appreciationof equal amounts. The relative values of future profits do not change in this
case. Since, therefore, for future exchange rate changes the cost effect and real interest rate
effect are in the same direction, current prices may be more sensitive to expected future

exchange rate changes than they are to contemporaneouschanges.

     Finally, we consider an implication of uncertainty about future exchange rates in our
model. If firms are risk neutral, then D chooses      v to maximize:
                    E() = (v,vf') +
Similarly,   F chooses uf' to maximize:

                 E() = ei(v, vf, ei) + E(e2(f (i/f, vf'), e2)).
We assume     that Uncovered Interest Parity holds, so that equation (3) becomes:

                                           =

    Proceedingas before, we can derive         the effect of a small increase in the variance of
e2 by consideringa family of distributions of      e, fb with variance 5 and constant mean;
members of the family are derived from one another by mean-preserving spreads. We then
have:

    At this level of generality, we cannot unambiguously sign V°" and VD. However, in
the limiting case in which switching costs, customer loyalty, etc., are so strong that in
the second period each firm acts as a monopolist in its first-period share of the market,

ir' is a convex function of e1 (since a monopolist's profits are a convex function of its
costs). It follows that e21r' is             a convex function of            e2,   and this is sufficient to show that

 jJ2E(e2ir') > 0.              Also in this case,        ir is independent of the future exchange rate, so
that VD = 0 and yE' > 0. Hence in either pricecompetitionor quantity competitionin the
limiting case, adding a mean-preserving spread to the distribution of the future exchange
rate lowers first-periodprices.19
     The intuition for this result is that the future profitability of an overseas market is
typically a convex function of the exchange rate: dollar costs are lower and so dollar
profits are higher exactly when dollars are more valuable. Therefore greater exchange rate

uncertainty increases the value of overseas market shares, hence lowers current prices in
these markets.20
      It is important to note that this result may be reversed if firms are sufficiently risk-
averse. Even though an increasein the varianceof the future exchange rate raises foreign
    0An exception is quantity competition with extreme negative values of ji1 hut this could not arise in stable, symmetric
 equilibrium.
   '°To see one aspect of this convexity, consider the marginal consumer in the second period when the exchangerate takes its
 expected value. With a variable exchange rate, the foreign firm will sell to this consumer only if ouch a sale turns out to be
profitable. As the variability increases, this option to odi l,ecome, more valuable and so on investment in market share yields a
higher expectedreturn. (This intuition is only partial since it ignores infrarnarginalconsumers.)Similarly,Dint (i98) studies
 how the option value of remaining i,a a market depends on the variability of the exchangerate. In our model,however,unlike
 Dixit's, participation in the market is not an either/or proposition. Is, our model, foreignfirms increase their participation in a
 continuousway by competing more aggressively as variatsilityofthe exchangerote, and hence th. option value of market share,
increase,.

                                                                 'S
firms' expected returns on investments in market share, it also makes these returns more

risky. For firms that are highly risk-averse, the increasein expected return will be insuffi-
cient to offset the added variability. They will thereforebe less willing to sacrifice certain

first-period profits for a risky investment in market share, and so they will raise prices.
    So far, we have discussed the effects of exchange rate changes on only the first period
of our model. The effect of an unanticipated exchange rate change that occurs in the last
                                              a standard oligopoly model.21 (In the last
period is just the cost effect that is present in
period there is no future, so that market share is no longer valuable.) If the reason that
market share matters is that each firm has some monopoly power over its previous market
share, then the second period will in general be less competitivethan a standard oligopoly
model, and the cost effect may be smaller. Thus, exchange rate pass-through in the last
period of a model in which market share matters seems likely to be smaller than in                                               a
standard oligopoly model, and, indeed, this is the case in the exampleof Section 2.22
    In reality, we are rarely in either the first or last period of any market. In a multiperiod
version of this model, each period will havesomecharacteristicsof the first and last periods:
we expect that the effects of exchange rate changes on first-period prices, on which we have

focused, will be present but perhaps diluted.23

2.   An Example Quantity Competition Among Producers of Perfect
                            Substitutes with Consumer Switching Costs
      We illustrate the preceding analysis by consideringa simple example: in the first pe-
riod producers selling a homogeneous product engage in Cournot competition, and in the
      The second.periodequilibrium may also he affected i,y temporary changes in flrot.periotleachasige rates. A changein       e

   22 This
           comparisonis ambiguous for two reason!. First, the last period of a market,I.are ,no,lel is not always less competitive
titan a standard oligopoly model (see iclemperer, tOB7It). Second,eve!,in a monopoly, the cost effect, is not necessarilysmaller
than in a standard Oligopoly.
   20 Ia a
           multiperiod model, firms will have the (flrst.period) ince,tive we have emphasizedto inivest in capturing market share
that will be valuable in the fut,,re, bs,t the (last.perioel) incentive to price hiixh to exploit market share may keep prices Front
falling too far. In the following mult.iperiodmodel, the effects of exchangerates on average prices in any period will simplybe
the average of the effects on our "first period," and the fairly standar,l effect!! on o,ir "secondperiod? Let there be overlapping
generations of customers who each live two periods, let the conditions of the motiel in the text apply to each generation of
conss,mors,and let firms be able to discriminate on price perfectly between generations. Farrell and Shapiro (1987) provide a
cleverly conotructed multiperiod model of switching co,t.s hut make a nnmi,er of very special assumptions. To our knowledge,
no satiofyingand tractable multiperiod model of market.share competition exists.

                                                                16
second period each firm behaves  as a monopolist on its share of the first-period market.
A simple interpretation of this model would be that first-periodconsumers have costs of
switching between firms in the second period.                        It is clear that with large enough switching
costs, in the non-cooperative second-period equilibrium, each firm will behave as a monop-
olist within the segment of the market that bought from it in the first period. Kiemperer

(1987a) shows that the same result can arise with relatively small second-period switching
costs.24

      We make the model somewhat more general than that of the previous section by

allowing n° foreign firms and n domestic firms, with N                               =        + a. The representative
foreign and domestic firms produce outputs                      q' and q, respectively, in the first period. In
equilibrium all firms of a given type will produce the same output, so that total industry
output is Q = *qF' + qD. For simplicity, we assume linear demand, p = A — Q, in both
periods. We also assume that all firms have constant marginal costs of c units of their own
currency. A foreign firm's second-period dollar profits are then just                                                      since

the term in brackets,           _e2)2), is the profit a monopolist                         with costs c/e2 would earn

in the second period.
    It is now straightforward to derive the response of the first-period dollar price, Pi
to a change in both the first- and second-period exchange rates around the symmetric

equilibrium:

wherefor convenience we have set e1 = e2                 = 1, and X = (I/2)(l+(l+A(N2_1)/N2)i2).2S
It follows that the effect of a permanent exchange rate change is:

                                              dp1 + dp1       —    Xn*c

       The economic significance of X is that in the unique equilibrium each firm produces
a first-period output
                             (4)x.           Thus, in the standard model in which market share is

unimportant to firms, X = 1. Note that this is also the case here if either A = 0 (firms
place no value on the future) or if N = 1 (a monopolist always captures the whole first-
period market and so can ignore market share effects in choosing its first-period output).
With X = 1 we havethe standard Cournot oligopoly results. Future exchange rate changes
have no effect      (i. = 0) and the effect of a current change,= _n*c/(N + 1), derives
purely from the impact on foreign firms' costs expressed in dollars and, for a given size
oligopoly N, is proportional to foreign firms' market share, na/N, and the foreign firms'
costs, c. With linear demand the price elasticity with respect to the current exchange                             rate
is
     (N-)j' which is lessthan one, even when all firms are foreign.
       More generally,      X is the fraction of the standard single-period Cournot output that
each firm produces, and so can be thought of as a measure of competitiveness in the first

period. Provided that          A>   0 and N >       1,   we have that X> 1, and that             X is increasing in
both   A   and N. In fact, X is relatively insensitive to N for N                   2,26 hut    it is more sensitive
to   A.27 For reasonable values         of A, X is approximately linear in A, which is sensible since
the value that firms place on future market share is linear in A.
       Note that A need not be less than 1. If the "second period" consists of several subperi-

ods, in all of which first-period market share matters, then                  A   may be substantially larger.28

More generally, we can simply think of,\ as representingthe importanceof current market

share for future profits.
     We can now isolate the different effects discussed in the preceding section, and give

a sense for their relative importance. As we saw in the foregoing section, the effect of

changing either the current or future exchange rate consists of two parts, the cost effect
and the real interest rate effect.

     We discuss first the cost effects. The effect on price of a change in the current exchange


of   ,
rate that operates purely through lowering foreign firms' costs in dollars is the last term
       which in this examplecan be written —N-f(2-.__)(nc). We note that this term

is directly proportional to the number of foreign firms,   n, for given N, and to first-period
costs, c.   It is not very sensitiveto the number of firms N, given the share held by foreign
firms,   n./N, or to the value of future market share, which       is   proportional to   \.   As we
mentioned earlier, the effect is solely that of the exchange   rate on price in any single-period
Cournot model.
     The effect on current price of a change in future costs caused by a future exchange
rate change is the second-period cost effect. As the dollar appreciates in the second period,

foreign firms' dollar costsfall, causing F's return on an investment in market share to rise.

(The return to D on an investment in market share does not change with the exchange
rate in this example.) Competitionbecomes more vigorous in the first-period equilibrium.
As a result, P1 falls by ---(2-—r)((X — l)2n*c). Like the first-period cost effect, this
cost effect is directly proportional to the fraction of foreign firms (since only foreign firms'
costs are affected) and to second-period costs, c, and is not very sensitiveto N. However
this cost effect is very roughly proportionalto .\: the more firms care about market share,
the more a change in its value affects current behavior.
     The cost effect generated by a permanent change in the exchange rate,    +
is just the sum of the cost effects, here given by       For the demand structure in

this example, the effect of a permanent exchange rate change is always greater than the

                                               19
analogous effect in the standard Cournot model; for A                         = I the effect is about 20 percent
larger than in the standard model, whereas for A = 4 (which could represent the case in
which the "second period" was actually several repeated periods, or a two-period model
in which firms cared even more about market share than in our model) the effect is about

60 percent larger than in the standard model.29 Observe, on the other hand, that the cost
effect of a temporary exchange rate change is always less than the effect of a temporary

change in the standard model (since X/(2X— I) < I). Also note that                                if a fraction (1 — a)

of foreign firms' marginal costs are actually incurred in the U.S., the cost effects (but not
the interest rate effects) would be multiplied by a. The model in the previous section and
our example have assumed              a = 1.
      The impactson current pricesof the first- and second-period real interest rate effects in
this example are, respectively,                   2-j)N(A — e) and —  N(A — c). As noted
in the previous section, they are equal and opposite, and therefore cancel for permanent
exchange rate changes. Because the interest rate effects influence domestic as well as
foreign firms, these effects are independentof the degree of foreign penetration into the
domestic market. In addition, the real interest rate effects grow slightly more important
as the total number of firms, N, increases,30 and are approximately linear in A. Recall
that these effects arise even if firms have zero costs.
      The overall effect        of   a temporary exchange rate change is the sum of the cost and
real interest rate effects. As shown earlier, these effects oppose each other, and either can
dominate. Indeed, a temporary appreciation of the dollar would actually be associated
with an increasein the dollar price of U.S. imports, if (X — 1)N(A — c) > nte. If a fraction

(1—a) of foreign firms' marginal costs are incurred in the U.S., then the condition becomes
(X — 1)N(A — c) > antc. To understand when a temporary appreciation will raise prices,

   aaNote however, that the effectin the second period elan unanticipated changein the exchange rate is        =—,       which
is a fraction (N + 1)/2N of that in the rtandard model. Thus in a world in which all periods have some of the characteristic,
 of each of our two periods, the effect of a permanent changein the exchange rate wo,,ld he more similar to that in a standard
 oligopoly model.
   30For A = 1 the magnitudes are .5G(.4 — e), .12k — c), and .18k — e) for N = 2, 3, and , respectively.

note that    a monopolist'smarkup with linear demand is (A — c)/2.              A   rough approximation
of   (X —   1)   is A/5, so the condition for a temporary dollar appreciation to have no effect at

all on dollar import prices is approximately:
                                              share of market
                                           foreign
                  —
                 A—            (
              O(5/2)\percent profit margin of  a monopolist in the market
which is not unreasonable.
      A short appendix summarisesthese results on the sensitivity of dollar import prices
to exchange       rate changes.
      To gain         a sense for the magnitude of the pass-through elasticities for the model of
this section,we present in Table I computationsof the percentagechange in dollar import

prices in response to          a one percent temporary appreciation of the dollar. Table la shows
the values       of   the elasticity,      for different values   of A   and different fractions of costs
that are denominated in foreign currency. The top row of the table (A = 0) gives the
standard Cournot pass-through.Tables lb and Ic separate this elasticity into the cost and
real interest rate effects, respectively. In the tables that follow, we assume that 50 percent
of the foreign firm's costs are denominated in dollars. Table Id shows the effect on the
pass-through of different levels of foreign penetration into the domestic market (holding
the total number of firms constant). Table le allows N to increase, holding constant
instead the fraction of the market controlled by foreign firms at one half. Finally, Table
if shows the impact of higher costs on the sensitivity of price changes to the exchange
rate. The tables illustrate the results discussed above. They also show that the degree
of pass-through attributable to both the cost effect and the interest rate effect are larger,
ceteris paribus, when prices are lower, i.e., for larger A, larger N, and larger c.

    It is clear from these tables that the pass-through from a temporary exchange rate
change may easily be perverse: a temporary appreciation can reduce the profitabilityof a

marginal investment in market share enough to increase the current dollar price. Notice
that in these cases, pricing to market will be most extreme, since foreign currency prices
of foreign exports will rise proportionately more than the exchange rate.
                                                     21
     The elasticities reported in Table 2 are for an analogous set of computations, except
that here the dollar appreciation is assumed to be permanent. As we saw above, a perma-
nent dollar appreciation tends to make the dollar price of U.S. imports fall more rapidly
than does a temporary appreciation. Comparing the elasticities reported in Tables 1 and
2 makes clear that expected future exchange rate changes can easily have a much greater

effect than current exchange           rate changes on current prices.
      Finally, we consider the effect of increasing the variance of the future exchange rate.
A Taylor series approximationto future expected profits for the foreign firm yields:


                               (E(e24(e2)) (/)d(e21r2(e2))
where the middle expression is evaluated at the expected future exchange rate,                                  We can

compute     that around the symmetric equilibriuman increase in the variance, 6, of future
exchange rates lowers dollar import prices:

Thus with risk-neutral firms, an increasein uncertainty about future exchange rates lowers
current prices.

3. Data Analysis
      It is beyond the scope of this paper to test comprehensively the model above. In this
section, we look instead at aspects of               a simple but important implication of our model:
that the degree of pricing to market depends on the perceived permanence of exchange
rate changes.31 While it is not in itself surprising that permanent appreciations exert
more downward pressure on              p ices than temporary appreciations,              such a distinction might

help explain the puzzling behavior of U.S. import prices during the 1980s. There is now
     The permanence of exchange rate changes can also affect the degree of pricingto market in model, where there is a cost
of adjusting oupply. Krugman (1986) discusses an example in which there are increasing marginal costs of expanding sales in
a firm's overseas market. A model of this typemight explain the empiricalresults presented below; note, however, that such
a model would not generate the perverse response, discussedin the foregoing sections. of dollar import prices to temporary
exchange rate changes.

a growing consensus that the dollar prices of U.S. imports during this period have moved
too little in response to exchange rate changes to be consistent with historical experience.
To the extent that the unprecedentedrise in the dollar's value was believed to be more

temporary than prior appreciations, profit-maximizing firms in our model would cut prices
to the U.S. market by little, if at alL32
      There is, in fact, some evidence that suggeststhe recent appreciation was viewed                                       as

a temporary phenomenon by historical standards. Survey data on exchange                                      rate expecta-
tions, for example, show that during the period from 1982 to 1985, respondentsconsistently
believed the dollar would begin to depreciate rapidly within the next twelve months.33 In-

deed, nominaldepreciation at an annual rate of 7 to 10 percent was expected on average
by this measure.
      A more common measure                 of expected depreciation, the nominal interest differential
between U.S. and foreign euro-currencydeposits, yields the same qualitative conclusion.

Figure 1 shows a simple average                 of   the differences between twelve-month euro-dollar de-

posits and similar depositsfor the pound, mark, yen and French franc. By this measure,
the dollar was expected to depreciatemost rapidly in the early 1980s, just when the rate
of   appreciation was also the greatest.34
       Of course, our model focuses on real and not nominal magnitudes. Calculation of
expected real depreciation,however,                  is   further hinderedby the inability to observe expected
inflation,     Nevertheless, expected real depreciation appears to be positively correlated
with our estimates of expected nominal depreciation. Table 3 presents estimates of both
expected nominal depreciation of the dollar and expected inflation in the U.S. relative to
several of     its major trading partners. We have chosen a variety of measures to ensure

     To he sure, over the Roxtirog rate period it is difficult, if not impossible,to reject the hypothesis that the real exchange
rate follow, a random walk over relatively short forecast horizons (see, for eoample, ttleeoe aml Rogoff, 1986). Newer evidence
for the longerintervals which are more relevant to o,,r analysis,however. quggesto that as much as 50 percent of real exchange
rate changes axe temporary (See Huioinga,1986).

  04The interest differentialis not a perfect measure of expected depreciation heca,i,e ii is contaminated by the exchange risk
premium. However, the alternative survey meas,xre,whichis free from this kind of contamination,shows expected depreciation
to be greeter duzing this period. Thus the interest differentialmay well ,mderstate expecteddepreciation.

                                                               23
that the appearanceof a substantial increase in expected real depreciation is not due to
the peculiarities of any one measure. We report three (out of many possible) ways of
calculatingexpected real depreciation in the bottom portion of Table 3, Regardless of the
precise measures used, the early 1980s were characterized by expectations of unusually
large future real depreciation.
     To investigate the role of expected depreciation more closely, we examine the differ-
ential effect of exchange rate changes on prices charged by foreign exporters in different
markets. Consider the one-period percentagechange in a British exporter's dollar price
on exports to the U.S. less the percentage change in his dollar price on exports to Japan:

                                                  UKUS —           UK,.JA .
                                                                                                                       (6)

If there is pricing to market, a current appreciation of the dollar relative to the yen will
raise   the relative price of exports to the U.S. market, so that expression (6) will be positive.
Note the effect   a temporary versus permanent appreciation. The model above would
                         of

predict that the more the dollar is expected to depreciate in the future, the greater the
quantity given in (6) will be. Indeed, prices in our model may often be more sensitiveto
expected future exchange rate changes than to current changes.
        A simple way           to capture pricing to market and its sensitivity to exchange rate ex-

pectations is to project a measure of expression (6) onto the change in expected future
depreciationof the real dollar/yen exchange rate and the contemporaneous change in the
real exchange rate:35

                    Ap1 UKUS — APUKJA = PiAE,(AeY+M) + ,82Ae9M + e.                                                    (7)

where the superscript i represents the ith industry, AeTSJ4 is the change from period
  —   I to     in   the log of the real dollar/yen rate, and AE,(AeJA) is the change from
period t —      1   to        in expected depreciation of the real dollar/yen rate over the following
        generd, the relationship between discrete percextage changes in price and changes in exchange rates is not linear so
that equation (7) is only a llrst.order approximation.

                                                            24
period. If there were no pricing to market, we would expect all the terms in equation (7)
to be zero. If there were pricing to market but all industries behaved in exactly the same
way,  then (to a first-order approximation)the error term, c, would be zero. Finally, with
pricing to market and diversity across markets, the error terni would appear random over
i. (Notice that any such variation across industries is independent of the exchange rate
terms, so that the Gauss-Markov assumptions are satisfied.) Thus equation (7) represents
a crude but informative test of a basic property of our model.
       The coefficient /3i in equation (7) measuresthe degree of pricing to market that occurs
in response to an expected future depreciation in the dollar/yen rate. That is, a 1 percent-

age point increase in the expected future depreciationof the dollar,
                                                                                                              = 1),
given no change in the current spot rate, (AeSM                         = 0), results in a proportional increase
of   j   in the relative price of exports sent to the U.S. versus exports sent to Japan.36 Con-
                                                  our model predicts j3 > 0, Similarly,
ventional static models would yield /3j =                  0, while

the coefficient P2 measuresthe effect of a permanent depreciationof the dollar on pricing
to market. If, for example, changes in the dollar/yen rate are passed through one-for-one
into dollar import prices (so that there is no pricing to market) we would expect    = 0.
If, on the other hand there is no pass-through at all, we would expect P2 = —.01 Finally,
the pass-through from a current depreciation that is expected to be purely temporary is
given by i2 — /3k. If, for example, Pz —                   = 0, there is no pricing to market         in response to

temporary exchange rate changes. If fl2     = — .01, the dollar prices of U.S. imports are
insensitive to temporary exchange rate changes. If P2 — Pi < — .01, the pass-through for

temporary exchange rate changes tends to be perverse: in response to a current apprecia-
tion of the dollar, foreign exporters raise their dollar prices on exports to the U.S.
       To measure the price term on the left-hand side of equation (7), we use highly disag-
gregated bilateral export unit value data from the U.N. Our sample covers annual exports
                                                                               and JA

to each of the US, JA, and the UK.37 The term t.seTS is measured by the change over
the last twelve months of the dollar/yen rate, adjusted by the CPI in the US and Japan.
In the regressions that follow, we used the two relatively standard measures of expected
real depreciation given in lines 7 and S of Table 3. Thus the term AE(aef..;A) is either

the change in the twelve-month forward discount or the survey expected depreciation of
the dollar/yen rate, plus the change in inflation in Japan over the previous twelve months
less the change in inflation in the U.S. over the previous twelve months.
      It is well known that the bilateral unit value indexes we use are subject to substantial
measurement errors. Nevertheless in this context, their problems are attenuated. First,

by using bilateral export data we ensure that the exchange rate changes on the right-hand
side of the equation can be measured with precision. When using multilateral data, for

example, it is difficult to know the precise weights that should be applied to measure "the"

exchange rate change. Second,  the potentially large measurement errors contained in the
price data themselves are less of a problem here because they are on the left-hand side
of the equation. Thus by selecting noisier measures of price changes, we are able to use
cleaner measuresof the explanatoryvariableS.
     Tables 4a and 4b present estimates of equation (7) using the interest differential and
the survey measuresof expected depreciation,respectively. The estimates were performed
using OLS. We used the averaged data for all variablesover the two-year periods reported
in Table 338 We report the usual OLS standard errors in Tables 4a and 4b, as we discov-
ered that the standard errors calculated using a heteroskedasticity-consistent covariance
estimate were smaller. Each table gives regression results for six sets of relative bilat-
eral export price changes; the last set of regressions combine all the individual bilateral

regressions.

  0Tlu some cases these unit value data show oudden, huge jumps in level from one year to the next. We hove eliminated
indu,triee which contained one-year jumps of more than 4011 percent, which were most likelyt,o be data errors.
  aainitially we estimated equation (7) on the origInalannual data. The re,ulting parameter estimates were similar ta those
reported in Table 4, hut the standard errors were large. On the oseomption that the imprecisionwas attrihutahle to both
measurementerror in the data and logs in response to exchange rote changes, ac ,,oed two averages of the data over two-yror
nonoverloppingintervals.

     There is no overwhelming evidence that expected future depreciation influences the
degree of pricing to market. Nevertheless, the magnitude and sign of the estimates of both
coefficients have interesting interpretations in terms of our model, and may shed light on

the recent behaviorof the pass-through relationship.
     The estimates of f3 are not always the same sign, but whenever they are statistically
different from zero, they are positive: higher expected future dollar depreciation implies

increasing prices in the U.S. market relative to other export markets. In the combined
regression, the point estimates are statistically positive at the 10 percent level. In addition,
the magnitude of these effecte is impressive. For example, the last point estimate of
in Table 4a implies       that, given the current spot rate, a              1   percent increase in expected
dollar depreciation      is   on average associated with an increase of about 4 percent in               the
price of exports sent to the U.S. relative to similar exports sent to Japan and the U.K. Of
course, if current market share affects firms' profits more than one year into the future,
then a 1 percent increase in expected depreciationover the next twelve months is likely to
be associated with a larger cumulativeexpected depreciationover a longer, more relevant
horizon. The estimated magnitudes of fl in Table 4b are similar to those in Table 4a. lithe

survey data contain measurement error, however, these estimates are biased in magnitude
and statistical significance toward zero.39
     The estimates of P2 are usually more than an order of magnitude smaller than the
estimates of    j,   and in only one case in          fourteen regressions is an estimate statistically
different from zero. We therefore cannot reject the hypothesis                    that permanent changes in
the value of the dollar have n.o effect on the degree pricing to market. The standard errors
are small enough, however, that we can reject the hypothesis that there is any substantial
degree of pricing to market in response to permanent exchange rate changes. Thus, fully

permanent depreciationsappear to be passed through into import prices one-for-one.
    Estimatesof the difference, P2 —  are almost always negative and less than —.01: a

                                                         27
completely temporary appreciationof the dollar is associatedwith a rise in import prices.
The right-most column of Tables 4a and 4b tests the hypothesis that P2 —                                     P1   = 0.    In
several cases, including the conibined regressions, this difference is statistically negative

at the    5   percent level. In the last regression               of   Table 4a, the estimates imply that a                 1


percent temporary appreciation leads on average to an increase of 4.4 — 0.3 = 4.1 percent
in relative prices of exports sent to U.S. markets. The correspondingnumber in Table

4b is 1.4. These results illustrate the case of perverse pass-through we discussed above.

Naturally,one rarely sees such large effects in practice because most exchange rate changes
have a substantial permanent component.                      In fact,    our estimates in Table 4a imply that
the combination of a contemporaneous appreciation of 3.5 percent and an increase of 1

percent in expected depreciationover the following 12 months would leave dollar import
prices constant.40 These figures suggest                that the 4 percentagepoint rise in the real interest
differential witnessed during the              lOSOs   would cancel the effect on dollar import prices of

tbe first    percentage points of dollar appreciation.
              14

      Our findings suggest that one must know bow much                     rate change
                                                                                 of a given exchange

is expected to be permanent in order to determine the magnitudeand even the sign of the

effect on dollar import prices. In sum, the estimates reported in Tables 4a and 4b provide

sonic support for the view             that expected depreciation may have a large role to play in
explaining      the pricing behavior of foreign exporters to the U.S. market during the 1980s.




  40The last regression in Table 4a implies that an increase of 1 percc,t in expected dollar deprec,atton raises dollar import
prices by 4.37 perce, and that a 3.5 percent current appreciationlowersdollar import prices by 3.5+ 3.5(0.20) = 4.41 perce,t.

4. Conclusion
     We have constructed a model in which market share matters in order to study the

effects of exchange rate changes on international pricing. We stressed that the return        a
firni expects to earn on its current investment in market share is sensitive to the expected

future exchange rate. Thus we found that foreign firms price more aggressively in the
domestic market, attempting to gain more market share, when the price of the domestic
currency is expected to remain permanently higher. Conversely, when a current exchange
rate appreciation is thought to be temporary, foreign firms will behave less aggressively,
perhaps even raising prices denominated in the domesticcurrency. Finally, we found that
an uncertain future exchange rate is likely to make market share more valuable, and so
drive down current prices.
     We also exploredsome tentative empirical evidence      that suggests a possible relation-
ship between the degree of pricing to market and expectedfuture depreciation. If producers
regarded each year's appreciation during 1981-S as more temporary than past apprecia-
tions, our modelsuggeststhat the pass-throughof exchange rate changes into dollar import
prices should have been lower than historicalexperience would predict. Indeed,our empir-
ical investigationsuggests that purely temporary dollar appreciations are associated with
an increase in dollar import prices. Expected depreciation may have played a substantial
role in foreign exporters' recent decisions to raise prices in the U.S. market relative to those
in other markets.
