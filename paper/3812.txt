       CO-INTEGRATION, AGGREGATE CONSUMPTION, ANDTHE DEMAND
        FOR IMPORTS: A STRUCTURAL ECONOMETRIC INVESTIGATION

                              JIBSTRACT

     This paper uses a two-good version of Hall's (1978)
representative agent, permanent income model to derive a structural
import demand equation for nondurable consumer goods. Under the
identification restriction that taste shocks are stationary, the
model is shown to imply that log imports, log domestic goods, and
the log relative price of imports are co-integrated.
     The data decisively reject the null hypothesis that imports,
the relative price of imports, and the consumption of home goods
are not co-integrated. We employ the non-linear least squares
technique recently proposed by Phillips and Loretan (1990> to
estimate the parameters of the import demand equation.
     The long-run price elasticity of import demand is estimated to
be -0.95. The elasticity of import demand with respect to a
permanent increase in real spending is estimated to be 2.20. These
estimates fall within the range reported in studies by Helkie and
Hooper (1986), Cline (1989), and the many studies surveyed by
Goldstein and Kahn (1985)
     The message of this paper is that, at least for non-durable
consumer goods, it is possible to interpret the traditional import
demand equation as a co-integrating regression, and to interpret
the price and expenditure elasticities estimated from such a trade
equation as a co-integrating vector. Estimates of the
co-integrating vector can be used to recover estimates of the
utility parameters of the representative household. The similarity
between the OLS and Phillips-Loretan estimates of the parameters
suggests that the simultaneous equation bias is not large.

                       A   STRUCTURAL ECONOMETRIC INVESTIGATION

1. Introduction:
      This   paper uses a two-good version of Hall's (1978) representative agent,

permanent income model to derive a structural econometric model of the demand

for imported consumer goods. With strongly separable, isoelastic preferences,

the log of the demand for foreign goods is shown to be linear in the log of the

relative price of imports, the log of the demand for domestic goods, and the log

of an unobservable shock to tastes.

      The permanent income hypothesis implies that the demand for domestic non-

durable goods and the demand for foreign non-durable goods share a common

stochastic trend (Stock end Watson (1988)) and that this trend may be identified

with the marginal utility of wealth. The data do not reject the null hypothesis

that log imports of non-durables and log consumption of domestic non-durablea

each have a unit root. Since the data also do not reject the hypothesis of a

unit root in the relative price of imports, the permanent income hypothesis,

along with our specification of preferences and the assumption that shocka to

preferences are stationary implies that log imports, log domestic goods, and the

log relative price of imports are co-integrated, and that the model's structural

parameters -   the   elasticity of marginal utility with respect to foreign goods

consumption, , and the elasticity of marginal utility with respect to home

goods consumption, a,      are   exactly identified by the co-integrating vector.

      Using the approach suggested by Grenger and Engle (1987), we find that the

data decisively reject the null hypothesis that imports, the relative price of

imports, end the consumption of home goods are not-cointegrated. While OLS
might be used to provide an asymptotically consistent estimate of the co-

integrating vector, it is subject to the simultaneous equation bias that is

likely to be present in our application. To correct for this bias, we employ

the non-linear least squares technique recently proposed by Phillips and Loretan

(1990) to estimate the parameters of the structural import demand equation.

      The results of the empirical work may be summarized as follows. The long-

run price elasticity of import demand is estimated to be -0.95 during our sample.

Given the precision of the estimate, it is not possible to reject the null

hypothesis of a unitary long-run price elasticity, thus putting our estimate in

the range of earlier empirical studies (Goldstein and Kahn (1985); Helkie and

Hooper (1986); Gline (1989)). The elasticity of import demand with respect to

a permanent increase in real spending is estimated to be 2.20 during our sample,

roughly the same as reported by Helkie and Hooper (1986), somewhat smaller than

reported by Gline (1989), and somewhat larger than the average of the many

studies surveyed recently by Goldstein and Kahn (1985). In the context of the

optimization problem of the representative household, the Marshallian price

elasticity of import demand is not constant but in fact converges to -1 as the

share of total spending that falls on imports rises, while the elasticity of

import demand with respect to a permanent increase in real spending converges

to 1 as the share of spending that falls on imports rises. An advantage of our

utility-based, co-integration approach is that, by recovering consistent

estimates of the utility parameters via Phillips-Loretan non-linear least

squares, we are able to estimate the permanent income elasticity of import demand

without having to specify a proxy for permanent income or having to estimate a

time series model for actual income.

      The paper ends with some concluding remarks.
2. The Model:
         We begin by deriving the demand for non-durables foreign goods, F, from

a standard (Hall (1978)) intertemporal optimization problem. Letting P denote

the price of imports in terms of domestic goods, H the consumption of domestic

non-durable goods, A assets, y labor income, and r the real interest rate,

the representative household selects (He, F, A+1) t —          0,   .   .   , I so as to:

(4)              max E E (1 + 6)tu(Ilt;Ft)
                         i—S


         s.t.



(4')               + PF + A÷1 — (1 + r)A + y.



The    first-order conditions    are given by:


(5a)             u —
(5b)             u —
(5c)                — (1 + 6y'E(A+1(1 + r,1));


where      is the Lagrange multiplier on the accumulation constraint (4').

         We shall assume that u is strongly separable and satisfies:


(6)              u(H, F) —     DH'(1   -   a)'    + BF'"(1 -



where      and      are random, stationary shocks to preferences with means B and 0

respectively.          Hodrick (1989) employs this Specification of preferences in a

intertemporal optimization problem of a representative household in a two-country

world. Using (6), (Sa) and (Sb) are easily solved for the optimal consumption

of domestic and foreign goods as a function of                                    and

Using   the fact that:

we may express the demand for foreign goods as:

                                                                                d1t)/.



                                                           4
        A well known property of the standard permanent income model             is   that    the
marginal    utility     of consumption follows a martingale (Hall (1978)). In the

context of our two-good specification, the marginal utility of wealth follows

a martingale, as does the marginal utility of consuming an extra home good, while

the marginal utility of consuming an extra foreign good divided by the relative

price of foreign goods follows a martingale. If the variance in forecasting the

marginal utility of wealth            is snail, log       itself is well approximated by the

following random walk:




(12)            logA '    (6   -   r) + 1ogAj + ( -

Taking logs of both sides          of (la) and (7b) we obtain:


(13)              — b/r,                - (1/,i)logA,,;
(14)            h—         - (l/a)logA.

Thus, the permanent     income hypothesis implies that the log consumption of foreign

goods and   the log consumption of home goods share a common stochastic trend, and
that this trend can be identified with the marginal utility of wealth, logA.
       While the theory implies that the log consumption of home goods, h and

foreign goods,     f share     a common stochastic    trend, these two   variables are       not

necessarily     co-integrated      (Cranger and Engle (1987)). In fact, as is revealed

by   equation   (10),




(10)              —
                         - (l/)p + (a/?)h + e;
the permanent income hypothesis implies that         and h ate co-integrsted if and

only if the log relative price of foreign goods, p, is stationary. By contrast,

if the log relative price of foreign goods is non-stationary in levels, the

permanent income hypothesis -     along with the identifying restriction thst the
shocks to preferences b and d are stationary -       implies   that      h, and p most

be co-integrated. Furthermore, by the results of Stock and Watson (1988), the

existence of two stochastic trends among three non-ststionsry variables implies

that there exists a unique (at least up to a scale factor) co-integrating vector,

In the context of our model, if two stochastic trends are found to be present

in the data, these trends can be identified with the log marginal utility of

wealth logA and the log relative price of foreign goods Pt. The unique co-

integrating vector is (1, I/ti, -a/J', as is defined by equation (10).

      It follows that, in a co-integrating regression of              on Pt and h, the

utility parameters rj and a -    the   elasticities of marginal utility with respect

to foreign and home goods -     are just identified. Holding constant the marginal
utility of wealth, the elasticity of the demand for foreign goods with respect

to the relative price of foreign goods is given by             —   -l/t, the coefficient
on Pt in the co-integrating regression of        Ofl Pt and h. The elasticity of the

demand for foreign goods with respect to the consumption of domestic goods -         the
correct "sctivity variab1e on the right-hand-side of the import demand equation

(10) derived from the theory -    is   given by e1 — a/v, the coefficient on h in
the co-integrating regression of        on Pt and h. In Section 4, after presenting

estimates of a and rj, we shall use (7) and these estimates to obtain estimates

of the Marshsllian price elasticity of import demand holding constant real

expenditure C — H + PF,         c' as well as of the elasticity of import demand

with repect to a permanent increase in real spending, f
3 The Data

        The NIPA accounta provide quarterly, seasonally adjusted nominal and 1982

dollar data on non-durable consumer gooda imports beginning with 1967:1. The

theory presented in Section 2 models the consumution of foreign goods, not their

importation. Because importers maintain inventories, imports of foreign goods

are a noisy signal of consumption of foreign goods. The NIPA accounts do not

provide   data on the spending on              or consumption of domestically produced consumer

goods, but    of   course do provide quarterly, seasonally adjusted nominal and 1982

dollar data on non-durablea consumption. I will first show that, for plausible

target inventory behavior, log imports of foreign goods are equal to log

consumption of foreign gooda plus a stationary, serially correlated disturbance.

I will then use this relationship to derive a measure of log home goods

consumption   that      is   equal to the true        value of   log home goods consumption plus
noise, noise that is stationary if  p, and h are co-integrated. I conclude
this section with a discussion of the impact of measurement error on the
estimation of the model.
        Consider the following target inventory model. Letting M denote the 1982
dollar value of imports received                  during quarter t    that were ordered at the
beginning of quarter t-l, letting I denote the 1982 dollar value of
inventories of foreign goods on hand at the end of quarter t-l, and letting I°
denote the 1982 dollar value of desired inventories of foreign goods on hand at
the end of quarter t, we auppose that importa are determined by:


(15)                —            +   E1I° -
where

(16)          It —           +        -
                                          F.
                                                      7
It follows immediately that:




(17)                     -       —           -


which can be used, along with (15) to show that:



(18)               —      -          -              +         - E_2F_1) +                  -


If   desired inventories are proportional to sales




(19)          10 — kF0;


we see that imports are equal to consumption of foreign goods plus noise:


(20)          H0 — F0     + k(F0         -
                                             F01)
                                                    - (1+Ic) (F0 -   E_1FO)    + (1+k) (F0_1      -

Dividing   both sides of (20) by F0 and taking logs we see that




(21)          a0          +




where:



(22)               —
                       k(F0
                              - F01)/F0 - (1+k) (F0 -         EL_LFO)/FO
                                                                              + (14-k)   (F01 -   10_3F01)/F0.




                                                         8
Thus, if both the growth rate in foreign goods consumption the variance in

forecasting foreign goods consumption are small, the log of imports, m is

approximately    equal to log foreign goods consumption          plus stationary noise z.
        Consider next   the consumption of domestically produced non-durable goods.

Our measurement of           is defined as follows;




(23)           H' — (E - PFtMt)/Pst


where E is the NIPA definition of quarter t consumption of non-durable goods

valued in current dollars, P, is the NIPA deflator for non-durable consumer

goods imports, and P5 is the producer price index for non-durable consumer

goods. A constant, or even random but stationary mark-up of the unobservable

deflator for home goods over the ppi for home goods could be incorporated without

changing the thrust of the argument. It follows that;



(24)           N' —   lt +   P(F'5
                                     -




where   P —             H is the 1982 dollar value of quarter t consumption of

domestic non-durable goods. H' is the 1982 dollar value of measured quarter t

consumption of domestic goods, and               is the 1982 dollar value of quarter t

consumption of imported non-durable goods. Dividing both sides (24) by H and

using (20) we obtain;




(25)          h' a       +


where     —
              -k(F - F'1)/J1 + (1+k)('F      -
                                                 E.1F)/H   -   (1+k)(F'1 -
         We now investigate the impact of measutement error on the co-integrating

equation. Using (21) and (25) to substitute for f and h in (10) we obtain:



(26)                     -
                             (1/'ÜP + (a/n)h' +


where:



(27)             —
                     e   +     -


The stationarity of e is assumed, and the stationary of          is implied by target

inventory behavior. Since u —         -zPF/H,     u will be stationary if     Pt, and

h are co-integrated with co-integrating vector (1, 1, -1].

         Notwithstanding these theoretical predictions, the co-integration of m.

Pt and h' is an empirical issue. A rejection of the null hypothesis that

Pt and h' are not co-integrated end that v has a unit root will be consistent

with co-integration among           p, and h and the stationarity of e. Moreover,

if m, p, and h' are co-integrated and the null of a unit root in v is

rejected, the parameters of interest, a end s, can be recovered from the co-

integrating vector defined by equation (26). (1, 1/rj, -a/q)'.




                                                                                        S

4. Testing for Unit Roots and Stochastic Trends

       We begin by reporting the results obtained from Fuller(l976) and Augmented

Dickey-Fuller(l981) tests of the null hypothesis that the series m, Pt and h'

possees a unit root.           The alternative hypothesis is that these series are

stationary about a deterministic trend. The Fuller test is just a t-test that

the coefficient fi   is   equal to zero in the following regression:




(28)         Ax —    p5   + p1r + flx1 +       c,.

The ADF test allows            to be serially correlated, and is a joint F test that

  —    — 0 in the following regression:




(29)         tc —         +   p1t + flx..i +   pAx1 + c1.

       The results of these tests are reported in Table 1 and are easily

summarized. Neither test can reject at even the lOX level the null hypothesis

of a unit root in any of the three variables mt, Pt, and h'.               With no strong

evidence against the null hypothesis of a unit root in m, p, or h', we turn

next to an investigation of the number of stochastic trends that are present

among the three variables in our system.

       Stock and Watson (1988) demonstrate that any system of m 1(1) variables

has a common trends representation, and that in a system comprised of m 1(1)

variebles being driven by n         a common trends, the number of linearly independent

co-integrating vectors must equal m -           n.   It follows immediately from Stock and

Watson's result that if there exists one common trend among a variables, then

all m(m-l)/2 possible pairs of these variables must be co-integrated. Of course,

if there exists n —            m    -   1   common trends among m variables, the co-integrating

vector is unique up to scale.

        The theory, along with the unit-root results rapottad in Table 1, predicts

that two common trends, one identified with the log marginal utility of waalth

logA and the other identified with the relative price of imports Pt. should be

driving the non-stationary components of the system'e three variables, m, Pt,

and h'. It follows that the parameters of interest, a and v, can be recovered

from the unique co-integrating vector defined by equation (26), [1, l/r, -a/q]'.

Alternatively, if shocks that drive logX also drive the non-stationary component

of Pt (or vis-versa), there is only one common trend in the system and all three

possible pairs of variables should be co-integrated.

        We now test the null hypothesis that none of the three possible pairs of

the system's three variables are co-integrated.                       If we fail to reject this

hypothesis, then there exists either two or three common trends among the

system's three variables.                       We test for co-integration by using the approach

suggested by Granger and Engle (1987). To test the null hypothesis that m and

h' are not co-integrated, we first run the regression:



(30)         nit
                   —       +       flh'     +



We   then regress changes in the estimated residuals,                        on one lagged level

of the residual and the lagged change:



(31)         th't      —
                           SoCmht_t             + PACmhtl +




                                                         12
The test is just a t-test on the coefficient 6; the appropriate critical values

are those reported in Engle and Yoo (1981) since the co-integrating regression

has a constant term. We also allow for the alternative that m snd h' are

stationary about a deterministic trend by first running the regression:




(30a)         m —      p5   + p1t   +      +


and then estimating:



                        —               + pAc,_1 +
(31a)        aca.t          6i's,'t-i

The appropriate critical values for a t-test of                  —   0   are those reported in

Phillips and Ouliaris (1989) since the co-integrating regression has a trend

term.

        The results of these tests sre reported in Table 2 and are easily

summarized. Neither test can reject at even the 10% level the null hypothesis

that any of the three pairs of variables (m5, h's), Cm5, p5), and (h'5, p5) are

not co-integrated.           With no strong evidence against the null hypothesis that

there does not exist one common trend among sit, i'5             or      h'5, we turn next to a

test of the hypothesis that there exists two common trends, as predicted by the

theory.

        Theory, along with the unit root results reported in Table 1, predicts that

m5, p5, and h'5 are co-integrated with co-integrating vector (1,                 i/vp, -a/vp)':


(26)          m5
                   —        - (i/vp)p5 +   (a/vp)h'5   +   V5.




                                                  13
In light of the results reported in Table 2, a tejection of the null of no co-

integration among rn5 Pt, and h'5 is evidence in favot of the model. Moreover,

a rejection of the null of no co-integration implies that the parameteta of
                                                                                              4
interest, a and t,         can   be identified from the data. Granget and Engle (1987)

suggest estimating         [1, l/r, -e/]' directly from the first-stage OLS regression:



(32)            a5 — p0 +          +        + fl2h'5   +



If    it is found   that,      in the Dickey-Fuller regression:



(33)            dE,,,5,5
                           —            +


     is   significantly negative, the OLS estimates of [1, l/, -a/n]' given by

(1, -fi1,     J'   are consistent, despite the fact that     Vt is correlated   with Pt and

h'5 and is also likely to be serially correlated.

          Recent resesrch, as summarized in the excellent recent survey of Campbell

and Perron (1991), has documented that, with the samples sizes svailable for

macroeconomic time series research, the OLS estimate of the co-integrating vector

can be severely biased. Furthermore, it is not possible to test hypotheses

about the parameters of the co-integrating Vector when these are estimated by

OLS    (Campbell and Perron (1991), p. 56). Fortunately, both Stock and Watson
(1989) and Phillips and Loretsn (1990) have discovered tractable methods for

obtaining asymptotically FIML estimates of the co-integrating vector. For this

reason, we will rely on the co-integrating regression primarily for its estimates

of          and tc,,5 that are needed to test the null of no co-integration among

m5, p, h'5.

5. Co-integration. Consumotion. and the Demand for Imports: Emoirical Results

        The results of the Crenger-Engle test of the null hypotheeis that m, Pt.

h' are not co-integrated are presented in the top panel Tehle 3. The critical

values are those reported in Phillips and Ouliaris (1989) since both a conatant

and a linear time trend are included in (32), the co-integrating regression.

It is seen that the estimated value of        is -0.4119 with a standard error of

0.0863 end a t ratio of -4.774. Under the null hypothesis that                        is a

random walk, the estimated       is significant at the 1% level using the Phillips-

Ouliaria critical values.      If instead we use the critical values for a Dickey-

Fuller test with 100 observations computed from a Monte Carlo and reported in

Figure 1, a no co-integration null can be rejected at the 2.5 percent level.

        In light of the results reported in Table 2, we conclude that the data are

consistent   with the prediction of the modal that exactly two stochastic trends
and thus one co-integrating vector describe the data. The OLS estimate of the
co-integrating   vector is [1, 0.96, -2.33]. This impliea an OLS estimate            of ,
minus the elasticity of marginal utility with respect to the consumption of

foreign goods, of       —   1.04 and an OLS astimate of a, minus the elasticity of
marginal utility with respect to the consumption of home goods, of               —   2.37.
        As discussed above, if v is correlated with the regressors Pt and h's, OLS

estimates of the co-integrating vector can be severely biased in small samples.

We would expect the structural preference shock, b to be positively correlated

with p. That is, a transitory rise in consumption of foreign goods brought

about by a jump in b would be positively correlated with Pt and thus negatively

correlated with -Pt. We would also expect the structural preference shock, d

to be positively correlated with h. It follows that e —       (b   -
                                                                       d)/   -




is   likely to be negatively correlated with the regressors in equation (26).


                                         15
       Phillips and Loretan (1990) propose a parametric procedure for estimating

the co-integrating vecror in an equation in which the variables are in fact known

to be co-integrated. The Phillips and Loretsn approach tackles the simultaneity

problem by including lagged and lead values of the change in the regressors.

The approach deals with the autocorrelation in the residuals by including lagged

values of the stationary deviation from the co-integrating relationship.

Phillips and Loretan prove that the estimates of the co-integrating vector

obtained from this approach are asymptotically FIML. They also show that the

likelihood ratio test can be used to test hypotheses about the parameters of

the co-integrating vector.

       Let y denote the vector [1, r, p, h'j' and let 9 denote the vector

[ps,     fl1, fl2]'. The Phillips-Loretan equation is given by:


                                             j—r           j—r'
             m —       + p(m.1 - 9 'y) +     E           + E u ah'_ +
(34)               9
                                             j-t
The 9 vector is estimated by non-linear least squares. The implied estimates

of 9 along with standard errors are reported in Table 4.

       As shown in Table 4, the NLS estimate is quite similar to the OLS estimate

of the co-integrating vector. The NLS estimate of the co-integrating vector is

[1, 0.94, -2.2l}. This implies a NLS estimate of ,,         minus the elasticity of

marginal utility with respect to the consumption of foreign goods, of         — 1.05

and a NLS estimate of o, minus the elasticity of marginal utility with respect

to the consumption of home goods, of         —   2.27.
       We now use these NLS estimates of         end o to construct estimates of the

familiar Marshallian price elasticity and the permanent expenditure elasticity

of the demand for imports. If total real expenditure C — H + PP is to remain


                                        16
constant in the fsce of an increase in the relative price of foreign goods, (1)

can be used to show thst:




(35)        (, -   1)(1   -
                              s)dlogP/17 — (s/a + (1          -
                                                                  s)/tj)dlogA;


where s is the share of spending thsr falls on domestic goods. Substituting for

logA in (13), we obtain the expression for the Harshallian price elasticity:




(36)                —   -(l/q)fl   -   (1   -   ,)(1   -
                                                           s)/(O,s/a) + (1       -
                                                                                      s)))


Since our estimate of vp,                — 1.06 exceeds 1, the estimated Marshallian

elasticity must, in absolute value, exceed l/n" —                   0.94.   In our sample (1 -      a),
the share of total non-durablea spending that falls on imports, rises from 0.01

in 1967 to 0.04 in 1990. Using our estimate of a"1' —                   2.27,        we determine that,

in our sample, the Marshallian price elasticity of the demand for imports falls

in the following range:



(37)        0.94    61pC         0.95.




       We now derive an expression for the elasticity of import demand with

respect to a permanent increase in real expenditure, holding constant the

relative price of imports. From (13) and (14), we see that the source of such

a permanent rise in real spending must be -a permanent decline in the marginal

utility of wealth. Using (7) it is straightforward to show that:



(38)        dlogC —     - (s/a + (1    -
                                            s)/)d1ogA.

                                                  17
Substituting for logA in (13) and differentiating with respect to logC, we

obtain:



                    —   (o/)(l/(a + (o/r)(l -

Thus, since o" exceeds           the elasticity of import demand with respect to a

permanent rise in real expenditure is bounded above by 2.21, the NLS estimate

of fl. Using the fact that (1 - a) is less tha 0.04 fn our sample, we obtain:



(40)         2.12   f,c;p    2.21.



       These elasticity estimates are firmly in the range of those reported in

the many studies surveyed by Goldstein and Kahn (1985), and those reported by

Helkie and Hooper (1986) and dine (1989). However, it should be pointed out

that the Marshallian price elasticity and the permanent expenditure elasticity

are not constant if, as is the case in our sample, the share of spending that

falls on imports is changing over time. Indeed, it is easily verfied from (36)

and (39) that, as as the share of spending on imports, (1 -   s),   rises over time,

the permanent expenditure elasticity must decline over time from 2.21 to 1.00,

while the Marshallian price elatsicity must rise -   in absolute   value -   over   time

from -0.94 to -1.00. An excellent recent paper by Marquez (1991) emphasizes the

importance of allowing for time varying elasticities in empirical trade models.

       One message of this paper ia that, at least for non-durable consumer goods,

it is possible to interpret the traditional import demand equation as a co-

integrating regression, and to interpret the price and expenditure elasticities

estimated from such a trade equation as a co-integrating vector. The striking


                                         18
similarity between the OLS and Phillips-Loretan estimates auggests that the

simultaneous equation bias is not large.

      A second message of this paper is that the permanent income theory, along

with the empirically testable restriction that the log relative price of imports

and the log marginal utility of wealth are not co-integrated, predicts that the

co-integrating vector for      p. h) is unique, and that estimates of this co-

vector can be used to identify exactly the paramaters of the household utility

function. An expenditure elasticity in excess of unity is consistent with the

theory when the concavity of the sub-utility function for home goods exceeds the

concavity of the sub-utility function for foreign goods. Our estimate is that

the elasticity of the marginal utility of home goods consumption, a, is a bit

more than twice the elasticity of the marginal utility of foreign goods

consumption.




                                       19
6. Concludins Remarks

       This paper has employed a two-good version of Hall's (1978) representative

agent, permanent income model to derive a structural econometric specification

of the demand for imported consumer goods.                With separable, isoelastic

preferences, the log of the demand for foreign goods is shown to be linear in

the log of the relative price of imports, the log of the demand for domestic

goods, and the log of an unobservable shock to tastes.

       A recent paper by Ceglowaki (1991) also employs the permanent income

hypothesia and the utility function (6) to derive two alternative equations that

can be used to estimate the parameters a and t.           Ceglowski shows that, in our
notation:




(41)        at+t   -
                       m —    c1 +          - log(P1/P5))      +


where i is the nominal interest rate and           is refered to as a rational error

in forecasting the intertemporal marginal rate of substitution, but, as is

acknowledged on page 127 of Ceglowski (1991), it also includes the error in using

imports to proxy for consumption of foreign goods. To estimate (l/,) in (41),

her equation (5), Ceglowski employs an instrumental variables procedure to

correct for the correlation between the forecast error and the ex poet real

interest rate. Ceglowski also demonstrates that



(42)         m+1
                    —   c2   + (1/ri)   -
                                            log(P1/P5))    +   (a/n)h'   +   ç41.




                                             20
To estimate (i/i) and (a/q) in (42), her (7), Geglowski employs instrumental

variablea to correct for the correlation between (i -          log(P,51/P5)) and z1.
She finds that XV estimation of these two equations give dramatically different

estimates of (l/q). In fact, the IV estimate of (l/t) from equation (41) is 0.39

-   less   than half the estimate of (l/,) obtained from (42) -   with   a standard error

of 0.68. Ceglowski reports estimates of the Marshallian price elasticity fc

she does not investigate the theoretical predictions and empirical implications

of the co-integration relationship that is the focus of this paper, nor does she

derive, discuss, relate to the permanent income hypothesis, nor estimate the

permanent expenditure elasticity c tp

           In   this paper, we have shown that the permanent income hypothesis implies

that the demand for domestic goods and the demand for foreign goods each have

a unit root, a prediction that is not rejected by the data. Since the data also

do not reject the hypothesis of a unit root in the relative price of imports,

the assumption that shocks to preferences are stationary implies that log

imports, log domestic goods, and the log relative price are co-integrated. Using

the approach of Granger and Engle (1987) we were able to decisively reject the

null hypothesis that imports, the relative price of imports, and the consumption

of home goods are not co-integrated.

           The estimation technique proposed by Phillips and Loretan (1990) was

employed to estimate the parameters of the structural import demand equation.

The long-run price elasticity of import demand was estimated to be -0.95. The

elasticity of import demand with respect to a permanent increase in real spending

was estimated to be 2.20, roughly the same as reported by Helkie and Hooper

(1986), somewhat smaller than reported by dine (1989), and somewhat larger than

the average of the many studies surveyed recently by Goldstein and Kahn (1985).


                                             21
In the context of the optimization problem of the representative household, the

Marshallian price elasticity of import demand is not constant but in fact

convetges to -l as the share of total spending that falls on imports rises, while

the elasticity of import demand with respect to a permanent increase in real

spending converges to 1 as the share of spending that falls on imports rises.

An advantage of our utility-based, co-integration approach is that, by recovering

consistent estimates of the utility parameters via Phillips-Loretan non-linear

least squares, we are able to estimate the permanent income elasticity of import

demand without having to specify a proxy for permanent income or having to

estimate a time series model for actual income.

The Dickey-Fuller(198l) critical values for F from Table VI for sample 100 are:

                           5.47 at the 10 percent level;

                           8.73 at the 1 percent level.
The sample is 1968:2 through 1990:2. All three equations were re-estimated with
four, three, and two lags of      and the 1sg length for calculating the F-test
was chosen as recomended by Campbell and Perron (1991). Using this approach,
the null hypothesis of a unit root in h was never rejected at even the 10
percent level.
