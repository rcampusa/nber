                                            ABSTRACT

Electric vehicles have a unique potential to transform personal transportation. We analyze the
transition to electric vehicles with a dynamic model that captures the falling costs of producing
electric vehicles, the decreasing pollution from electricity generation, the increasing
substitutability of electric for gasoline vehicles, and the durability of the vehicle stock. Due to the
external costs from pollution, inefficiencies under business as usual result from the mix of
vehicles as well as the transition timing, the severity of which depends on substitutability. We
calibrate the model to the US market and find the magnitude of the inefficiency is rather modest:
less than 5 percent of total external costs. The optimal purchase subsidy for electric vehicles and
the optimal ban on the production of gasoline vehicles both give about the same efficiency
improvement, but the latter leads to a sharp increase in gasoline vehicle production just before the
ban. Phasing out gasoline vehicles with a bankable production quota reduces deadweight loss
substantially more than the other policies, but may lead to a very large deadweight loss if set
incorrectly.

1         Introduction
Transportation is a substantial source of global and local air pollution (Davis and Killian
2011, Tschofen et al 2019). Several new technologies including electric vehicles, fuel cell
vehicles, biofuel powered vehicles, and improved gasoline vehicles hold promise for decreasing
this pollution. Of this suite of technologies, electric vehicles are unique in that, over the near
term, they are commercially viable and have the potential to yield dramatic reductions in
air pollution. The driving range of electric vehicles has increased and their production costs
have decreased due to technological advances in batteries, electric motors, and materials.
These changes, along with investments in complementary infrastructure such as charging
stations, are making electric vehicles viable substitutes for many transportation uses. At the
same time, emissions from electricity generation have fallen dramatically thereby reducing
the pollution from electric vehicles (Holland et al., 2018). This combination of falling costs,
falling emissions, and increasing substitutability has led to calls for a radical transformation
of our transportation systems toward electric vehicles including policies that ban gasoline
vehicles.1
        Substantial research has analyzed electric vehicle adoption and policy in static models.2
However, static models are not well suited to study the transition from a fleet dominated by
gasoline vehicles to a fleet dominated by electric vehicles.3 This paper constructs, analyzes,
and simulates a dynamic model of the electric vehicle transition. The model allows us to
analyze questions about the timing of electric vehicle adoption and how the timing is affected
by policies such as an electric vehicle purchase subsidy or a gasoline vehicle production ban.
Furthermore, the model allows a comprehensive welfare assessment of these policies.
        Our model accounts for important dynamic aspects of the electric vehicle transition.
First, as coal plants retire and investments in renewables and battery storage grow, the
    1
     Twelve countries currently have planned fossil-fuel vehicle production bans, e.g., Norway in 2025 and
Britain and France in 2040. (See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phase-out of fossil fuel vehicles Accessed
12/16/2019)
   2
     Examples include Archsmith et al. (2015), Holland et al. (2016), Yuksel et al. (2016), Muehleger and
Rapson (2018), Davis (2019), and Xing et al (2019).
   3
     There are two papers with dynamic models closely related to ours. Creti et al (2018) have a dy-
namic model of vehicle adoption but assume a fixed vehicle stock and perfect substitution. Langer and
Lemoine (2017) analyze adoption of a green technology but do not explicitly model replacement of a dirty
good.


                                                    1
trend of decreasing pollution from electricity generation is predicted to continue. Holland et
al. (2018) document an extraordinary decline in air pollution from electricity generation in
2010-2017 and determine the corresponding decline in damages from electric vehicles. Our
model allows for declining damages from electric vehicles over time. Second, electric vehicle
production costs are projected to continue to drop primarily due to improvements in the
production of batteries. Falling costs could be due to learning by doing, scale economies, or
exogenous technological change. Our main model allows for exogenously declining produc-
tion costs of electric vehicles, but we extend the model to incorporate endogenously falling
production costs through learning by doing. Third, the substitutability of electric and gaso-
line vehicles may change over time either because of improvements in range, charging time,
or complementary infrastructure such as charging stations (e.g., indirect network effects).
Our main model assumes a range of substitutability, but we also analyze substitutability
that increases exogenously over time or endogenously through investments in complemen-
tary infrastructure. Fourth, vehicles are durable goods that depreciate. Thus we use dynamic
optimization techniques to determine how the current stock of vehicles depends on future
policies, costs, and consumer preferences.
   The model allows us to study the transition from a variety of viewpoints. First, we solve
a planner's problem that fully accounts for external costs from both gasoline and electric
vehicles. Next we determine the business as usual solution that occurs in the marketplace
when the external costs are ignored. Comparing these two solutions reveals two sources
of inefficiencies: in the timing of electric vehicle adoption and in the long run vehicle mix.
The adoption timing inefficiency is largest at high or low levels of substitutability between
electric and gasoline vehicles because the market adopts electric vehicles too late or too early.
The vehicle mix inefficiency is largest at intermediate levels of substitutability in which the
planner would fully transition to electric vehicles but the market does not. To assess the
magnitude of the inefficiencies, we calibrate our model for the US market. Overall, the largest
deadweight loss occurs at intermediate levels of substitutability, but the loss is modest: less
than 5 percent of total externality costs.
   The calibrated model also offers insights into second best policies for improving the
efficiency of the transition. Up to now, the most common electric vehicle policy has been


                                               2
subsidies for their purchase. We show that these subsidies can improve the adoption timing
and reduce the deadweight loss for all levels of substitutability. Dynamically adjusting
subsidies modestly improves their performance. Another policy is a ban on the production
of gasoline vehicles. Twelve countries have currently announced bans and similar policies
have been proposed for the US. In our model, a production ban can reduce deadweight loss
if the planner's solution calls for a complete transition to electric vehicles. An unfortunate
feature of the production ban, however, is an inefficient build up of the stock of gasoline
vehicles in anticipation of the ban. A third policy, which we introduce and evaluate, is
a bankable gasoline vehicle production quota. This policy caps cumulative production of
gasoline vehicles and can be implemented by an intertemporal cap-and-trade program. The
bankable production quota results in the smallest deadweight loss by a substantial margin,
even compared to dynamically adjusted subsidies.
   In addition to the general literature on electric vehicles, this paper contributes to several
other literatures. A number of papers use dynamic models of transitions between technolo-
gies to analyze the design of subsidies (Kalish and Lilien 1983; Meyer et al. 1993; and
Langer and Lemoine 2017) and learning by doing (Van Benthem et al. 2008; Chakravorty et
al. 2012; Amigues et al. 2016; Bahel and Chakravorty 2016; and Creti et al. 2018). Relative
to this literature, which assumes that technologies are perfect substitutes, a distinguishing
characteristic of our work is that we allow electric and gasoline vehicles to be imperfect sub-
stitutes and also consider substitutability that is exogenously and endogenously increasing.
Another literature analyzes issues related to electric vehicle charging infrastructure such as
the effect of charging standards and the relationship between charging infrastructure and
electric vehicle policy (Springel 2016; Li et al. 2017; Zhou and Li 2018; and Li 2019). We
contribute to this literature by describing the relationship between infrastructure develop-
ment and the substitutability of gasoline and electric vehicles and how this relationship
affects the transition to electric vehicles.




                                               3
2         Model
Consider a continuous time model in which society benefits from the stock of gasoline and/or
electric vehicles. The benefit per unit of time in dollars is given by U (G, X ) where G(t)
denotes the stock of gasoline vehicles and X (t) the stock of electric vehicles at time t.4
Letting UG and UX denote the partial derivatives, we assume U is concave with UG > 0
and UX > 0.5 The degree of substitutability between gasoline and electric vehicles plays
an important role in determining the transition between them. Substitutability can be
measured by either the cross-partial derivative UGX or a cross-price elasticity, and the use
of these concepts is interchangeable in our model.
        The stocks of gasoline and electric vehicles evolve over time by production of new vehicles
and retirement of existing vehicles due to events such as accidents and mechanical failure. Let
g (t) denote the production of gasoline vehicles and x(t) denote the production of electric
                                                                        = -aG + g and
vehicles at time t. The state equations for the stocks of vehicles are G
 = -aX + x, where G
X                  and X
                        are time derivatives and a is the vehicle retirement rate. The
                                  1
expected lifetime of a vehicle is a . If there is no production of new vehicles, then the stock
of vehicles decreases exponentially.
        Each vehicle has a one-time production cost and ongoing usage costs. Let cg denote
the production cost of a gasoline vehicle, and let g denote the usage costs of driving a
gasoline vehicle per unit of time. Usage costs include both private operating costs, e.g., fuel
purchases, and external costs, e.g., emissions of air pollution.6 We assume that both cg and
g are constant over time. At time t, total production costs are given by cg g and total usage
costs are given by g G.
        Electric vehicles initially have greater production costs and/or greater usage costs than
gasoline vehicles, but that these costs are falling over time. Let the production cost of an
electric vehicle at time t be cx (t) with c
                                          x < 0 and c
                                                    ¨x  0. Decreases in cx over time are due to,
for example, exogenous improvements in battery technology.7 Let usage costs of driving an

electric vehicle per unit of time at time t be x (t) with x  0. Decreases in x over time are

due to, for example, decreases in external costs from air pollution as the electricity grid gets
cleaner. Let the limits of production and usage costs for electric vehicles be limt cx (t) = c
                                                                                             ^x
and limt x (t) = ^x .

       The planner's problem determines the production of gasoline and electric vehicles to
maximize discounted benefits net of production and usage costs. Let r > 0 be the interest
rate and assume the planner starts in an initial steady state with a positive stock Gss of
gasoline vehicles but zero electric vehicle stock.8 The planner's problem is

                                    
                        max            e-rt (U (G, X ) - cg g - cx x - g G - x X ) dt                   (1)

                                          = -aG + g ; G(0) = Gss
                                         G

                                         X                                                              (2)
                                                 g  0 ; x  0.

In this optimal control problem, the control variables are the production levels g and x, and
the state variables are the stocks G and X .
       The planner's problem describes the first best solution and also characterizes the outcome
of a competitive equilibrium if all externalities are corrected by Pigovian taxes. Modifying
the planner's problem allows us to analyze other market outcomes. For example, if we
modify the objective function by ignoring the externalities, then the solution characterizes
the outcome of a competitive equilibrium in which the externalities are not corrected, the
so-called "business as usual" or BAU outcome. As explained in detail below, modifying the
planner's problem in other ways allows analysis of policies such as electric vehicle subsidies
or gasoline vehicle production bans.
       Necessary conditions for the planner's problem are derived in Online Appendix A. These
   8
    Assume further that UG (0, 0) > (a + r)cg + g which ensures that Gss is positive and that Ux (Gss , 0) <
(a + r)cx (0) + x (0) - c
                        x (0) which ensures that no electric vehicles are produced at t = 0.

conditions include the state equations for G and X and the corresponding adjoint equations


                                      = (a + r) + g - UG ,                                      (3)


and
                                      = (a + r) + x - UX ,
                                     

where  is the adjoint variable for G and  is the adjoint variable for X . Because the objective
and state equations are linear in the controls, and the controls must be non-negative, we
present the Kuhn-Tucker first order conditions:


                                 g  0  - cg  0       g ( - cg ) = 0
                                x  0  - cx  0 x( - cx ) = 0.

These conditions show that the adjoint variables are bounded above by the production costs
and equal production costs when g or x is interior.
   Consider interior production of gasoline vehicles. When g > 0, the first order conditions
imply that  = cg and hence because cg is constant over time we have  = 0. The adjoint
equation for G then implies
                                       UG = (a + r)cg + g .                                     (4)

To interpret this equation, define the full marginal cost of the gasoline vehicle as (a + r)cg + g ,
which is the sum of annualized depreciation, investment, and operating costs. If gasoline
vehicles are produced, then the annual marginal benefit of a gasoline vehicle equals its full
marginal cost.
   Interior production of electric vehicles has a similar interpretation. If x > 0, then  = cx ,
so taking the time derivative gives  =c
                                      x , and the adjoint equation for X implies


                                     UX = (a + r)cx + x - c
                                                          x .                                   (5)


This equation is analogous to (4) except it has an additional cost -c
                                                                    x > 0, which is the
opportunity cost of producing the electric vehicle at time t instead of waiting until it is



                                                 6
cheaper to produce in the future. The full marginal cost of an electric vehicle, (a+r)cx +x -c
                                                                                             x ,
includes this opportunity cost, and, under our assumptions, decreases over time.9
      In the initial steady state x(0) = 0 and X (0) = 0, so the initial steady state stock of
gasoline vehicles, Gss , is determined by UG (Gss , 0) = (a + r)cg + g . The initial steady state
production of gasoline vehicles is g = aGss .
      Several elements of the model deserve additional explanation. The benefit function U rep-
resents the benefits to society from optimally allocating the stocks of vehicles to consumers.
Adding a vehicle may require the existing stock of vehicles to be reallocated. This benefit
function is consistent with well functioning markets for new and used vehicles. The stocks of
gasoline and electric vehicles G and X are only differentiated by fuel type. In practice, many
other attributes may matter to consumers including the age of the vehicle. The assumption
that usage costs for a gasoline vehicle, g , are constant over time does not necessarily imply
that gasoline technology is stagnant. If certain components of the usage costs, e.g., the
social cost of carbon, are increasing over time, then we are implicitly assuming that other
components of the usage costs (e.g., fuel economy) are changing to offset these increases.
On the electric side, we assume usage costs are decreasing due to declines in external costs
over time. This does not require modeling vintages of electric vehicles if declines in external
costs arise due to improvements in the electricity grid, rather than efficiency improvements
to the electric drivetrains. An improvement in the grid leads to a contemporaneous decrease
in external costs from the entire fleet of electric vehicles regardless of the ages of the vehicles.
Finally, usage costs are independent of the stock of vehicles. This does not hold if expanding
the stock of vehicles causes each vehicle to be driven less.


2.1       Terminal steady state

Before analyzing the optimal time paths, consider the terminal steady state in which all im-
provements to electric vehicles and the electricity grid have been completed, i.e., production
costs have converged to c
                        ^x , and usage costs have converged to ^x . Let g  be gasoline vehicle

production in the terminal steady state. Note that g  = 0 if there exists some T such that
g (t) = 0 for all t > T . Our first proposition gives conditions that determine whether or not
  9
      The time derivative of the full marginal cost is (a + r)c
                                                              x + x - c
                                                                      ¨x .

                                                        7
it is optimal to have gasoline vehicle production in the terminal steady state. All proofs are
in the Appendix.

Proposition 1. Let X  be defined by UX (0, X  ) = (a + r)c
                                                         ^x + ^x . Gasoline vehicle production

is zero in the terminal steady state, i.e., g  = 0, if


                                      UG (0, X  ) < (a + r)cg + g .


Conversely, g  > 0 if UG (0, X  ) > (a + r)cg + g .

       In the proposition, X  is the number of electric vehicles which would be optimal if there
were no gasoline vehicles in the terminal steady state. The proposition states that gasoline
vehicle production is zero if the marginal benefit of a gasoline vehicle, when there are no
gasoline vehicles but X  electric vehicles, is less than the full marginal cost of a gasoline
vehicle. Terminal steady state gasoline vehicle production is zero if this marginal benefit is
small, but is positive if this marginal benefit is large.10
       Dividing the first two marginal benefits in Proposition 1 yields a condition on society's
marginal rate of substitution (MRS) between gasoline and electric vehicles. In particular,
g  = 0 if
                                      UX (0, X  ) (a + r)c
                                                         ^x + ^x
                                                                 .
                                      UG (0, X  ) (a + r)cg + g
                                                 >

i.e., gasoline vehicle production is zero if the MRS at (0, X  ) is smaller than the ratio of
full marginal costs. If the vehicles are perfect substitutes and the MRS is one, then the
result implies that gasoline vehicle production is zero if the full marginal cost of an electric
vehicle is cheaper. If the vehicles are not good substitutes and the MRS is not one, then the
full marginal cost of an electric vehicles would need to be substantially cheaper in order for
gasoline vehicle production to be zero in the terminal steady state.
  10
    If U is derived from an underlying discrete choice model, the marginal benefit UG (0, X  ) would be
interpreted as the utility gain to the individual with the highest gain in valuation from a gasoline vehicle
relative to optimally having either no vehicle or an electric vehicle.

2.2       Transition From Gasoline to Electric Vehicles

Now turn to the transition from gasoline to electric vehicles. By assumption, g (0) = aGss > 0
but x(0) = 0, i.e., gasoline vehicles are initially produced but electric vehicles are not. This
leads to two key transition times: tg , the time when gasoline vehicle production stops, and
te , the time when electric vehicle production starts. More precisely tg is defined such that
g (t) > 0 for t  [0, tg ] but g (t) = 0 for t > tg .11 If tg =  then gasoline vehicle production is
always nonzero. Similarly, te is defined such that x(t) = 0 for all t  [0, te ) but x(t) > 0 for
all t  [te , ).
       For these transition times, there are two possible solutions to the planner's problem. If
te < tg , then there is a period of time in which gasoline and electric vehicles are both produced.
We call this a simultaneous solution. If tg < te , then there is a period of time in which neither
gasoline nor electric vehicles are produced. We call this a gap solution due to the gap in
vehicle production. Surprisingly, this solution obtains for reasonable parameterizations of
the model, namely, if vehicles are perfect substitutes. This result and other details of the gap
solution are given in Online Appendix B. Here we focus on specifying the transition times
in the simultaneous solution.
       The simultaneous solution is characterized first by production of gasoline vehicles only,
then by production of both gasoline and electric vehicles, and finally by production of electric
vehicles only. Before te , the solution has g = aGss > 0 but no electric vehicle production.
Electric vehicle production begins at te so (5) must hold at this time. Substituting G(te ) =
Gss and X (te ) = 0 into (5) yields an equation which characterizes te (see the proposition
below). Over the interval [te , tg ], both gasoline and electric vehicles are produced so both
(4) and (5) must hold and the vehicle stocks (and hence production) are determined by these
equations. Note that the costs of electric vehicles are falling so more vehicles are produced
     > 0. Because the right-hand-side of (4) is constant over time, it follows that G
and X                                                                                < 0 over

this interval. If tg < , then gasoline vehicle production ceases at tg . The characterization
of tg involves solving a differential equation (see the proposition below). After tg the stock
of gasoline vehicles simply decreases exponentially, i.e., G(t) = G(tg )e-a(t-t
                                                                                             g)
                                                                                                  for every t > tg .
  11
    It may be optimal to temporarily cease gasoline vehicle production to draw down the existing stock of
gasoline vehicles. In this case, which is explored in Online Appendix C, g (t) need not equal zero for all t > tg .


                                                        9
Because the gasoline vehicle stock is decreasing, the electric vehicle stock increases toward
a terminal steady state, as determined by (5).
    The following proposition characterizes the transition times:

Proposition 2. In the simultaneous solution, the transition time te is the solution to


                            UX (Gss , 0) = (a + r)cx (te ) + x (te ) - c
                                                                       x (te ).                        (6)


If tg < , the transition time tg is the solution to

                               
                                   e-(a+r)( -t
                                                 g)
                     cg =                             UG (Gsim ( ), X sim ( )) - g d                   (7)
                             tg


where Gsim (t) = G(tg )e-a(t-t
                                  g)
                                       and X sim (t) satisfies UX (Gsim (t), X sim (t)) = (a + r)cx + x - c
                                                                                                          x
for all t > tg .

    The characterization of te in (6) shows that electric vehicle production begins when the
full marginal cost of the electric vehicle falls such that it exactly equals the marginal benefit
of an electric vehicle given a zero stock of electric vehicles. Because gasoline vehicles are in
steady state at te , equation (6) can also be written in terms of the MRS:

                            UX (Gss , 0) (a + r)cx (te ) + x (te ) - c
                                                                     x (te )
                                         =                                   .
                            UG (Gss , 0)         (a + r)cg + g

If there are individuals who highly value electric vehicles, the MRS when X = 0 could be quite
large. In this case it might be optimal to produce electric vehicles even if their full marginal
costs substantially exceed the full marginal costs of a gasoline vehicle. Conversely, if electric
vehicles are seen as inferior even by the individuals with the highest relative valuations
(perhaps due to range anxiety), then the full marginal costs would need to fall below the full
marginal costs of a gasoline vehicle before electric vehicles are produced.
    The characterization of tg in (7) shows that gasoline vehicle production stops when the
cost of producing a gasoline vehicle equals the present value of the lifetime benefit of driving
a gasoline vehicle net of usage costs from that time on. Two points are worth noting about
(7). First, the discount factor e-(a+r)( -t
                                                      g)
                                                           reflects both the interest rate, r, and rate of


                                                           10
vehicle retirement, a. Second, the path of the gasoline vehicle stock after tg , given by
Gsim (t) = G(tg )e-a(t-t ) , is decreasing exponentially because no new gasoline vehicles are
                       g



produced after tg . However, G(tg ) is not equal to Gss because during the interval [te , tg ]
both gasoline and electric vehicles are produced so the stocks evolve to satisfy both (4) and
(5).


2.3     Market outcomes and BAU

A market economy does not have a planner making decisions to produce gasoline and electric
vehicles. Rather these decisions are decentralized to firms and consumers through markets
and prices. The solution to (1) describes the first best solution to our model, which can
be decentralized by Pigovian taxes that fully reflect the externalities. If such taxes are
politically infeasible, it may still be possible to improve outcomes by implementing market
policies such as a subsidy on the purchase of electric vehicles or a ban on the production
of gasoline vehicles. Our framework allows us to analyze the welfare consequences of such
policies.
   We start by describing the Business As Usual (BAU) market outcome. Under BAU
consumers ignore all externalities, and there are no market policies put in place to try to
                               pvt     pvt
correct for this behavior. Let g   and x   be the private operating costs of gasoline and
electric vehicles, i.e., the usage costs without the externalities. To describe how electric
vehicles are adopted over time by a competitive market, we use the optimal control problem

                                   
                    max               e-rt U (G, X ) - cg g - cx x - g
                                                                     pvt     pvt
                                                                         G - x   X dt     (8)
                     g,x       0

subject to the constraints in (2). This problem is similar to (1), but with the modification
                                   pvt     pvt
that g and x have been replaced by g   and x   . The solution to (8) gives us the time
paths of production (g and x) and vehicle stocks (X and G) under BAU. To find the welfare
associated with the BAU outcome, we substitute the time paths into

                               
                                   e-rt (U (G, X ) - cg g - cx x - g G - x X ) dt,        (9)
                           0




                                                      11
and then evaluate the integral. Notice this function is the objective function of the original
planner's problem, which includes the externalities. With the value of this function at the
BAU time paths in hand, we can calculate the deadweight loss of BAU relative to the first
best.
   We follow a similar procedure to analyze other market based policies such as taxes or
subsidies. In particular, by modifying (8) to reflect the private costs that result from a given
policy (e.g., lower purchase costs from a subsidy), the optimization results in the vehicle
time paths that would obtain under the policy. We then calculate the deadweight loss of the
policy by evaluating these time paths with the integral in (9) and comparing to first best.
   One possible source of deadweight loss is due to an inefficient vehicle mix. The following
corollary, which follows directly from Proposition 1, provides some guidance on when the
BAU terminal steady state has inefficiently positive production of gasoline vehicles.

                                          
                            pvt
Corollary 1. If (a + r)cg + g   < UG (0, XBAU ) < UG (0, X  ) < (a + r)cg + g , then gasoline
vehicles are produced in the terminal steady state under BAU but not under first best.

   The corollary says that the vehicle mix is inefficient in the terminal steady state--i.e.,
gasoline vehicles are produced under BAU but not under first best--if both marginal benefits
                                        pvt
are in the interval between (a + r)cg + g   and (a + r)cg + g . This condition depends critically
on the external costs and the degree of substitutability between gasoline and electric vehicles.
If externality costs are large, then this interval is large and it is more likely that the BAU
vehicle mix is inefficient. If vehicles are poor substitutes, then the two marginal benefits in
the corollary are both large and the vehicle mix is not inefficient because gasoline vehicles are
produced under both BAU and first best. If vehicles are good substitutes, then the marginal
benefits are both small and the vehicle mix is not inefficient because gasoline vehicles are
not produced under either BAU or the first best. The vehicle mix is only inefficient at an
intermediate level of substitutability where the marginal benefits are in the interval so that
gasoline vehicles are produced in the steady state under BAU but not in first best.
   Deadweight loss also may result from the inefficient timing of the transition to electric
vehicles. The next proposition shows that this transition time can be too early or too late
under BAU.


                                               12
Proposition 3. Under BAU, the transition time te may be greater or less than under first
best.

The proposition is proved by numerical example below in Figure 2 and Table 2. Here we
illustrate the key role played by the degree of substitutability. Figure 1 shows the determi-
nation of the transition time te for both first best and BAU in the simultaneous solution.12
The bold curves illustrate the solution to (6) for first best. The value for te occurs when the
                                          x falls to the (bold) marginal benefit UX (Gss , 0).
(bold) full marginal cost (a + r)cx + x - c
The thinner curves illustrate the solution to (6) for BAU. Notice that both curves shift down
in moving from first best to BAU. The full marginal cost shifts down by the amount of the
external costs.13 To see why the marginal benefit shifts down, first note that BAU ignores
external costs and so the initial steady state stock of gasoline vehicles is larger under BAU
than in first best: Gss     ss 14 This higher initial stock shifts down the marginal benefit
                     BAU > G .

UX if UGX  0. How much this curve shifts down depends on the substitutability between
gasoline and electric vehicles. The figure shows two possibilities. If they are poor substitutes
(as in Case 1), then the curve does not shift much and te                 e
                                                        BAU is less than t , as shown on

the left part of the figure.15 Conversely, if they are good substitutes (as in Case 2), then
UX (Gss                                        e                      e
     BAU , 0) shifts down a lot in which case tBAU can be later than t , as shown on the

right. Thus the electric vehicle transition can occur too early under BAU if vehicles are poor
substitutes, but can occur too late if they are good substitutes.
       Although the terminal mix inefficiency and the adoption timing inefficiency may not be
the only sources of inefficiency, combining these two results gives insight into the overall
magnitude of deadweight loss under BAU. Corollary 1 shows that the terminal vehicle mix
inefficiency is largest at intermediate levels of substitutability, but Proposition 3 shows that
the adoption timing inefficiency is largest at high or low levels of substitutability. Thus
the two inefficiencies are unlikely to exacerbate one another, which suggests that the overall
inefficiency may be limited.
  12
     A similar argument holds for the gap solution.
  13
     Note that the private and social full marginal costs have the same asymptote since the externality costs
go to zero.
  14
     More precisely, using (4), the steady state gasoline vehicle stocks are determined by UG (Gss , 0) = (a +
r)cg + g and UG (Gss BAU , 0) = (a + r )cg + g . Because UGG < 0 and g > g , we have G
                                             pvt                            pvt          ss
                                                                                            < Gss
                                                                                               BAU .
  15
     For example, if they are additively separable, UGX = 0, and the curve does not shift down at all.

                                        In our main model, the benefit function is constant over time. In practice, electric vehicles
                                        may become better substitutes for gasoline vehicles over time as more charging stations
                                        are built, charging times decrease, consumers and mechanics become more familiar with
                                        the technology, information campaigns promote electric vehicles, and so on. Some of these
                                        changes may be reasonably modeled as independent from electric vehicle adoption--e.g.,
                                        research in battery technologies that reduces charging times--but other changes may be
                                        better modeled as jointly determined with electric vehicle adoption--e.g., building charging
                                        stations. To model exogenous substitutability, simply note that the benefit function can shift
                                        over time and all the preceding analysis holds. To model endogenous substitutability, we
                                        introduce complementary infrastructure that affects the benefits of adopting electric vehicles.
                                        In particular, let W be the cumulative stock of complementary infrastructure, w be the
                                                                                               = w be the state equation, and cw

                                        of two-sided externalities. The planner avoids this externality. See Li et al (2017) for an empirical analysis
                                        of the effect of charging stations on the demand for electric cars.

       Our main model also assumes that electric vehicle production costs decline exogenously
over time. In practice, cost declines may also depend on electric vehicle adoption. Endoge-
nous cost declines can be modeled as learning by doing. More specifically, let the marginal
cost of producing electric vehicles decrease in cumulative electric vehicle production, denoted
                                                   = x.18 The marginal cost of electric vehicle
by a new state variable Z (t) with state equation Z
production then becomes cx (Z, t).
       We extend the theoretical model by analyzing endogenous substitutability and learning
by doing in Online Appendix D. Because the results are generally robust to these extensions,
our numerical simulations below consider these cases.



3        Model Calibration
To assess the magnitudes of the inefficiencies described above, we present a numerical sim-
ulation. This section summarizes the calibration of parameters. Further details are provide
in Online Appendix E. To analyze the full roll-out of electric vehicles, the simulation starts
in 2005, but the calibration is based on observed values in 2018. Instead of an infinite time
horizon, the simulation has a finite terminal time, and, except where noted, the results are
not significantly affected by the terminal conditions.19
       Baseline parameter values are shown in Table 1. The annual externalities and operat-
ing costs from gasoline, g , and electric vehicles, x , are calculated from data in Holland et
al (2016), Holland et al (2018), and American Automobile Association (2017). The produc-
tion cost of a gasoline vehicle, cg , is from the average transaction price for light duty vehicles
(Kelly Blue Book 2017). Production costs of an electric vehicle are based primarily on the
cost of lithium ion batteries (Kitner et al 2017) and asymptote to the production cost of a
gasoline vehicle. The vehicle retirement rate is assumed to be the same for both types of
vehicles and is calculated from production and stock information published by the Bureau
  17
     In the simulation section, we assume that UW (G, 0, W ) = 0, i.e., there is no benefit to investments in
substitutability when there are no electric vehicles. We make a similar assumption for the exogenous case.
  18
     See, for example, Van Benthem et al (2007), Amigues et al (2016), and Bahel and Chakravorty (2016).
  19
     We value any terminal vehicle stocks at production costs.

of Transportation Statistics (2017) and Bureau of Economic Analysis (2017).
       The final calibration step involves specifying a functional form for the benefit function
U (G, X ). The functional form must satisfy the concavity assumption and ideally be parsi-
monious with parameters which we can identify from estimates in the literature. In addition,
our focus on the introduction of electric vehicles and the end of gasoline vehicle production
requires the functional form to admit corner solutions with only gasoline or only electric
vehicles.20 We use the benefit function


                                 U (G, X ) = A ln(G + X + GX ),                                      (10)


where A,  , and  are parameters to be calibrated.21 This function nests both linear and
convex indifference curves, and the parameters  and  can be interpreted as the relative
preference for electric vehicles and as the degree of substitutability, respectively. If  = 0,
vehicles are perfect substitutes and  describes the slope of the linear indifference curves. If
 > 0 indifference curves are convex, which reflects a social preference for balanced consump-
tion of the two types of vehicles. Further note that either G = 0 or X = 0 implies unitary
demand elasticity. We use observed data on prices and quantities in 2018 and calculate a
cross price elasticity using results in Xing et al (2019),       GpX   = 0.01, to calibrate the benefit
  20
     This requirement rules out the simplest versions of widely used functional forms such as Cobb-Douglas
or constant elastiticity of substitution (CES).
  21
     We also explore sensitivity to the more flexible benefit function U (G, X ) = A(G + X + GX ) , which
has an additional parameter,  , to fit.



                                                   16
function parameters A,  , and  .
       Although we refer to it as baseline, we do not want to place undo emphasis on the
estimated cross price elasticity of 0.01. The data in Xing et al (2019) considers the fleet of
electric vehicles up to 2014. Although the vehicles in the fleet had a range of characteristics,
from relatively expensive vehicles with large batteries and long range (e.g., the Tesla Model
S) to relatively inexpensive vehicles with small batteries and short range (e.g., the Nissan
Leaf), the vast majority of actual vehicles sold were of the latter type.22 Our calibration
has only a single representative electric vehicle with a fairly large battery and long range.
This vehicle is likely to be a better substitute for gasoline vehicles than the baseline cross
price elasticity would indicate. Accordingly, in the simulation section we consider a range of
possible cross price elasticities, and also allow for exogenously and endogenously increasing
substitutability over time.



4        Simulation Results
We use the open-source program BOCOP (2017) to simulate numerical solutions to (1) and
(8). BOCOP implements a local optimization method in which the optimal control problem
is approximated by a finite dimensional optimization problem using a time discretization.23
Where possible, results from BOCOP are verified by solving the necessary conditions nu-
merically in Mathematica.


4.1       Time paths of vehicle stocks and production

Figure 2 shows the time paths for production and stocks of electric and gasoline vehicles
under two scenarios. In the "First Best" scenario, usage costs include both private costs
and external costs. In the "BAU" scenario, usage costs only include the private costs.
Panel A of Figure 2 uses the baseline cross-price elasticity of            GpX   = 0.01. In both scenarios,
gasoline vehicle production is not noticeably affected by electric vehicle production. In fact,
  22
     Table 1 in Holland et al. (2019) shows the electric vehicle fleet in 2014. Around 70 percent have batteries
smaller than 25 kWh.
  23
     The optimization problem is solved by IPOPT, (Interior Point OPTimizer) using sparse exact derivatives
computed by Automatic Differentiation by OverLoading (ADOL-C).


                                                      17
electric vehicle production only serves to increase the total stock of vehicles. This reflects the
poor substitutability of electric vehicles for gasoline vehicles implied by the low cross price
elasticity. BAU leads to more gasoline vehicles in the initial steady state because it does not
account for the external costs from these vehicles. On the electric side, the terminal stock
of electric vehicles is the same in First Best and BAU because external costs from electric
vehicles fall to zero over time. Because the vehicles are poor substitutes, electric vehicles
are adopted too early under BAU, as described in the discussion of Prop. 3. In particular,
the First Best production of electric vehicles begins in 2031, but BAU begins production of
electric vehicles in 2028.24 The deadweight loss of BAU relative to First Best is $18.5 billion.
       Panel B of Figure 2 shows time paths for          GpX   = 2. In this case, electric and gasoline
vehicles are better substitutes so electric vehicle production results in a substantial reduction
in gasoline vehicle production under both First Best and BAU. Electric vehicle adoption
causes the stock of gasoline vehicles to decline, but does not decrease the total stock of
vehicles. Although production of gasoline vehicles declines, it never ceases so the terminal
time has a mix of electric and gasoline vehicle production. Under BAU, the total vehicle
terminal stock is approximately equal to First Best, however, BAU has an inefficient vehicle
mix: too few electric vehicles and too many gasoline vehicles. BAU electric vehicle production
begins too late, which, in conjunction with the fact that BAU electric production begins too
early in Panel A, proves Proposition 3. The deadweight lass from BAU in Panel B is $20.9
billion.
       In Panel C of Figure 2, substitutability is even better (       GpX   = 5.5), and electric vehicle
production again begins too late under BAU. First Best has a period of simultaneous pro-
duction of both gasoline and electric vehicles before ceasing production of gasoline vehicles.
In contrast, BAU production of gasoline vehicles continues throughout. Because BAU does
not cease gasoline vehicle production but First Best does (as described in Corollary 1) the
vehicle mix inefficiency is large, and this elasticity results in the largest inefficiency with
$29.9 billion in deadweight loss.
  24
    Our calibration is based on the state of the electric vehicle market in 2018. A subsidy scenario, which
decreases the production cost of the electric vehicles by $7500 to reflect current subsidies, replicates the
market outcome with a stock of 1 million electric vehicles in 2018 but ramps up electric vehicle production
more quickly than actually occurred.

       Panel D shows the time paths with            GpX   = 8. This very high degree of substitutability
leads to the gap solution in which gasoline vehicle production ceases slightly before electric
vehicle production begins. Gasoline vehicle production ceases under both BAU and First
Best, but electric vehicle adoption occurs too late under BAU, and the deadweight loss is
$23.7 billion.
       Three things are notable about the results in Figure 2. First, consistent with Proposi-
tion 3, electric vehicle production can begin too early or too late. Panel A of Figure 2 shows
electric vehicle production under BAU can begin too early if electric and gasoline vehicles are
poor substitutes. Conversely Panels B-D show production can begin too late if the vehicles
are better substitutes. Thus the adoption timing inefficiency is largest when the cross-price
elasticity is large or small, and smallest at intermediate elasticities.
       Second, the terminal vehicle mix inefficiency is largest if gasoline vehicle production does
not cease under BAU but does under First Best. This occurs at intermediate levels of
substitutability. At low substitutability, gasoline vehicle production does not cease under
either first best or BAU. At high levels of substitutability, gasoline vehicle production ceases
under both first best and BAU.
       Third, consider our prior observation that the total deadweight loss may be limited
because the adoption timing and terminal vehicle mix inefficiencies are largest at different
elasticities. Consistent with this observation, the deadweight losses for all elasticities in
Figure 2 are relatively small: BAU deadweight loss is less than $30 billion over 70 years
or an annualized value of about $1.5 billion. For comparison, total annual gasoline vehicle
external costs in the initial steady state are approximately $38 billion per year.25 Thus
deadweight loss is less than 5 percent of initial external costs.


4.2        Second Best Policies

Implementation of the first best through Pigovian taxes that fully reflect externality costs
may not be politically feasible. Nonetheless, it may still be possible to improve on BAU
outcomes by implementing market-based policies such as a subsidy on the purchase of an
electric vehicle or a ban on the production of gasoline vehicles. To analyze such policies,
  25
       $345 per vehicle multiplied by 110 million vehicles.

                                                          20
we modify (8) to account for the policy, and then evaluate this solution using the welfare
function (9). To avoid comparing inferior policies, we use a numerical search routine to
calculate the policy of each type that minimizes deadweight loss. Unless the policy fully
internalizes all external costs, it will not attain the first best solution so we call the optimal
policy of each type the second best policy.
       Table 2 shows the results for three second best policies: an electric vehicle purchase
subsidy which is constant over time (EV Subsidy), a policy that bans gasoline vehicle pro-
duction after a certain time (GV Ban), and a bankable gasoline vehicle production quota
(GV Quota) which limits cumulative production of gasoline vehicles. First consider the EV
Subsidy. Relative to BAU, the second-best EV Subsidy reduces deadweight loss for all four
elasticities. For the low elasticity shown in Panel A, the second-best EV Subsidy is actually
a tax of $762 per vehicle. In this case, electric vehicles are adopted too early under BAU
and the tax delays their adoption. In the other panels, electric vehicles are adopted too late
under BAU and the second-best EV Subsidy is positive and hastens their adoption time.
The largest reduction in deadweight loss (about a 40 percent reduction) is in Panel C where
the EV Subsidy improves both the adoption timing and the terminal vehicle mix inefficiency.
       The second policy (GV Ban) prohibits gasoline vehicle production after a certain time.
For low and medium elasticity in Panels A & B, gasoline vehicle production does not cease
in the first best, so it is not surprising that the the second best GV Ban never actually bans
gasoline production. This policy simply replicates BAU and does not reduce deadweight loss,
so it is not shown in Table 2. With the high elasticity in Panel C, gasoline vehicle production
does cease in the first best, and the second best GV Ban prohibits gasoline production
after 2026. In both panels C and D, the second best GV Ban reduces the adoption timing
inefficiency and the terminal vehicle mix inefficiency. Notice that the deadweight loss from
the GV Ban is about the same as that from the EV Subsidy.
       Unfortunately, the GV Ban leads to perverse incentives. Because vehicles are durable
goods, production and purchase decisions are based on future benefits. The anticipation of
a future ban causes gasoline vehicle production to optimally spike before the ban occurs.26
  26
    Production capacity constraints would obviously reduce the ability of producers to spike production of
gasoline vehicles. With capacity constraints, producers would produce at capacity until the ban goes in place
and would have an incentive to install additional capacity in anticipation of the ban.

Panel A of Figure 3 shows the production and stocks of vehicles under first best and the
second best GV Ban for     GpX   = 5.5. The second best GV Ban prohibits gasoline production
after 2026, and there is a spike in gasoline production and a coincident increase in the gasoline
vehicle stock just before that date.
   The third policy (GV Quota) is a bankable gasoline vehicle production quota which limits
cumulative production of gasoline vehicles. This policy is similar EPA's phase-out of lead in
gasoline during the 1980's and could be implemented with an intertemporal cap-and-trade
program. The cap-and-trade program would begin with an initial bank of permits and a
permit would be retired with the production of each gasoline vehicle. Panel B of Figure 3
shows the production and stocks of vehicles under first best and the second best GV Quota
where the optimal size of the initial bank is 161 million for      GpX   = 5.5. The GV Quota
does not lead to a production spike. Table 2 shows that the GV Quota does quite well in
comparison to the subsidy or ban polices, as its deadweight loss is less than half that of
the other policies. This advantage occurs because the GV Quota introduces a shadow cost
on the production of each gasoline vehicle, which leads to a reduction in gasoline vehicle
production well before the electric vehicle transition.
   Online Appendix G considers additional second best policies: electric vehicle subsidies
that vary over time and a more flexible quota policy. For dynamic subsidies, we allow
the subsidies to vary over three parameters: the initial subsidy value, the terminal subsidy
value, and the decay rate of the subsidy. We then optimize over the parameters singly or
pair-wise to calculate second best dynamic subsidies. The EV Subsidy, which is constant
over time, compares well with the dynamic subsidies and attains a deadweight loss within
10% of the best dynamic subsidy we calculate. For a flexible quota policy, we consider a
two parameter quota with an initial bank of permits and annual injections of permits. The
optimized flexible quota is identical to the GV Quota in the high-substitutability cases in
which it is optimal to cease production of gasoline vehicles. In addition, the flexible quota can
reduce deadweight loss substantially in the low-substitutability cases in which it is optimal
to reduce production of gasoline vehicles but not to cease production completely. With this
modification, the gasoline vehicle production quota can be applied to a broader range of
situations.

4.3       Extensions

Two of the key drivers of the electric vehicle transition are the substitutability between
electric and gasoline vehicles and the fall in production costs of electric vehicles. In this
section we modify the preceding model to account for increasing substitutability and learning
by doing.
      Suppose at first that substitutability is exogenously increasing over time. In our benefit
function in (10), substitutability is determined by the parameters  and  : one-to-one perfect
substitutes require that  be one and  be zero. Thus increasing substitutability arises as 
increases toward one and  decreases toward zero. However if  and  move independently,
benefits for a given fleet of vehicles may be decreasing. To avoid this result, we assume that
 and  move together such that benefits increase over time.27 In particular, we assume 
decreases exponentially to zero, and  increases toward one such that the marginal rate of
substitution is held constant at some level of gasoline and electric vehicles. In essence this
holds the indifference curve constant at a point but shifts it inward everywhere toward the
line which is tangent at the point (see Online Appendix F for details). With this formulation
we have  = o e-t , where  captures the speed at which substitutability increases and o
implies the baseline cross price elasticity of 0.01 at time zero. For  = 0.1, the cross price
elasticity takes 75 years to reach 8. This decreases to 37 years for  = 0.20.28 The First Best
time paths of production for various values of  are given in Figure 4. For low values of 
(Panels A and B) gasoline production is never halted. For intermediate values of  there is
a period of simultaneous production of gasoline and electric vehicles. For high values of ,
the first best features a gap solution.
      Next consider a substitutability that increases endogenously through investment in com-
plementary infrastructure (e.g. charging stations). As above, the parameters  and  need
to be jointly determined so we let  decay exponentially toward zero as a function of the cu-
mulative stock of investments W . Figure 5 shows the first best vehicle production and stocks
for very high cost and low cost charging infrastructure. In Panel A, charging infrastructure
has very high costs, no investment occurs, and electric vehicles are simply adopted based on
 27
      This means that, for a fixed X and G, we have Ut > 0.

      These calculations assume G stays fixed at 110.

their low level of substitutability. In Panel B, charging infrastructure is low cost and hence
is installed. Investment in charging infrastructure is very rapid and quickly makes electric
vehicles nearly perfect substitutes for gasoline vehicles. Indeed, investment is so rapid that
the gap solution occurs as evidenced by the decline in total vehicle stock before electric car
production begins.
   The second best analysis for increasing substitutability is shown in Table 3 for the exoge-
nous substitutability with  = 0.1 and 0.2 and the endogenous substitutability with low cost
charging infrastructure. Comparing Panels A & B shows that with a faster increase in substi-
tutability the optimal subsidy is larger and the transition occurs sooner. With endogenously
increasing substitutability (Panel C) the transition occurs even earlier. As under constant
substitutability, both the second best EV Subsidy and GV Ban result in small reductions in
deadweight loss, but the GV Quota can result in a large reduction in deadweight loss.

   To model falling costs from learning by doing, we estimate the relationship between
the cost of lithium ion batteries and cumulative electric vehicle production Z and a time
trend (see Online Appendix E.) The resulting cost function for electric vehicles is cx (Z, t) =
cg + 21961e-0.06t- ln(Z +1) , where  = 0.16 is an estimated parameter which captures the speed
of learning. Comparing this cost function to the baseline cost function shows that they are
identical when Z = 0 and both asymptote to cg . Thus the key difference in the cost functions
is that learning by doing drives down the electric vehicle production costs faster.
   Figure 6 compares the first best with exogenous production cost decreases (our baseline)
to the first best with learning by doing for the four cross-price elasticities. Comparing the
first best outcomes implicitly assumes that any learning spillovers are internalized and do
not result in additional inefficiencies. In all four panels, learning by doing results in an earlier
transition to electric vehicles by as much as ten years. In all four panels, production of electric
vehicles spikes when production starts. This increase in production causes costs to fall quickly
down the learning curve. The optimal spike trades off inefficiently large production with the
ability to produce electric vehicles sooner at lower costs and thus depends on the discount
rate as well as the substitutability of electric vehicles for gasoline vehicles. In panel A, the
spike in electric car production does not perceptibly affect gasoline vehicle production. In
panel B, the spike causes gasoline vehicle production to plummet but then recover to its
steady state level. In Panels C & D, the spike causes gasoline production to cease and
the high levels of substitutability leads to the gap solution. The second best analysis for
 GpX   = 5.5 , shown in Table 4, largely conforms to the previous findings: i.e., shows modest
reductions in deadweight loss from the EV Subsidy or GV Ban and a substantial reduction
in deadweight loss from the GV Quota.
   Explicitly modeling investments in complementary infrastructure and learning by doing
in electric vehicle production costs shows two things. First, the simple models described
here lead to spikes in investment and production. Because these spikes are likely unreal-
istic, carefully modeling capacity constraints may be an important step in future analyses.
Second, the fundamental nature of the time paths is not dramatically altered by invest-
ment in infrastructure or learning by doing. The extended models probably suggest greater
substitutability and faster declines in costs than we assume in our baseline calculations.

4.4     Sensitivity

We analyze the sensitivity of the simulation results in three ways. First consider the effect
of several parameters on the terminal steady state production of gasoline vehicles. The
social cost of carbon (SCC) is used to determine the external costs associated with global
pollution from electric and gasoline vehicles and is an important element in policy discussions
of electric vehicles. The value of a statistical life (VSL) is used to determine the external
costs of local pollution. The final parameter is the limiting value of the production costs for
electric vehicles (^
                   cx ). Table 5 shows, for various elasticities, the smallest non-negative values
for these parameters such that gasoline vehicle production ceases in the first best terminal
steady state. For low cross-price elasticities, either a high VSL or a high SCC would be
required in order for gasoline vehicle production to cease. For example, if               GpX   = 2, the VSL
would have to exceed $171 million or the SCC would need to exceed $516 per ton in order
for gasoline vehicle production to cease. These levels greatly exceed most credible estimates.
At higher cross price elasticities (above six), gasoline vehicle production would cease even
with VSL of zero or a SCC of zero because the gasoline and electric vehicles are such good

lead to gasoline vehicle production ceasing. If the vehicles are poor substitutes (             GpX   = 0.01)
electric vehicles would need to be essentially free in order for gasoline vehicle production to
cease. At higher cross-price elasticities, gasoline vehicle production ceases even if electric
vehicles are more expensive than gasoline vehicles.
    Next, Table 6 shows how the second best results change when we vary the SCC. For
 GpX   = 5.5, Panels A and B analyze modest decrements and increments to our baseline SCC
while Panel C shows a very high SCC of $200. For all SCC's, the second best EV Subsidy
and GV Ban can reduce deadweight loss, but the GV Quota reduces deadweight loss most.
Electric vehicle adoption is insensitive to the modest changes in SCC, but tg is sensitive with
even modest changes in the SCC leading to decades difference in the time when gasoline
vehicle production ceases. For the very high SCC, which is on the upper end of the range
of some current estimates, the First Best electric vehicle transition occurs quite early (2021)
and the BAU deadweight loss is substantial. Correspondingly, there are substantial gains
from any of the second best policies.
    Finally, we study what happens if policy is set based on an incorrect estimate of the cross-

price elasticity. Panel A of Table 7 shows the deadweight loss that results from different EV
Subsidies. Suppose, for example, that a policy maker estimates that the cross-price elasticity
is 0.01. The appropriate policy is a negative subsidy (a tax) of $-762, which results in an
$18.0 billion deadweight loss if the cross-price elasticity is indeed 0.01. However, this same
subsidy would result in a higher deadweight loss of $41.3 billion if the actual cross-price
elasticity is 5.5. This is more than double what the deadweight loss would have been if the
cross-price elasticity had been correctly estimated (as shown in the main diagonal of Panel
A). In contrast, Panels B and C show that setting a gasoline production ban or quota based
on the incorrect cross-price elasticity can increase the deadweight loss by a factor of almost
100. Although we do not analyze uncertainty explicitly, this suggests that a price mechanism
(such as a subsidy) may dominate a quantity mechanism (such as a quota) in a model in
which there is uncertainty about the cross-price elasticity. Note that the deadweight losses in
the first row of Panel B and C are simply the deadweight losses from BAU. Comparing these
deadweight losses with the other deadweight losses in the table shows that basing policy on
the incorrect cross-price elasticity can be much worse than no policy at all.

5     Conclusion
This paper studies the transition from gasoline vehicles to electric vehicles using a theoretical
model and numerical simulations calibrated to the U.S. market. The theoretical model
shows that BAU electric vehicle production can begin too early or too late depending on the
substitutability of gasoline vehicles for electric vehicles. Similarly, the vehicle mix inefficiency
depends on substitutability but is highest at intermediate levels of substitutability in which
the first best transitions to electric vehicles but BAU does not. These offsetting effects
suggest that inefficiencies may not be large. Our numerical simulations assess the magnitudes
of these inefficiencies for the U.S. and find modest levels of deadweight loss: less than five
percent of total external costs.
    Electric vehicle purchase subsidies have been implemented by a number of countries. For
example, the U.S. provides a tax credit of $7500 for the purchase of an electric vehicle and
several states offer additional subsides. Our numerical simulations show that such subsidies
can reduce deadweight loss. We calculate optimal purchase subsidies ranging from $-750
(for very low substitutability) to $3500 (for a very high SCC), which are well below the
current U.S. subsidy. These purchase subsidies are constant over time, but more compli-
cated dynamic subsidies do not yield much additional efficiency improvement. The constant
subsidies also seem to be robust in the sense that the additional deadweight loss from using
an incorrect cross-price elasticity is not extreme.
    Gasoline production bans are increasingly attracting the attention of policy makers. We
find that a gasoline vehicle production ban can reduce deadweight loss if the cross-price
elasticity is such that ceasing gasoline vehicle production would be first best. If gasoline
vehicle production does not cease in first best, the ban cannot reduce deadweight loss, so the
second-best ban simply replicates BAU. The ban can also result in very large deadweight
loss if it is based on an incorrect cross-price elasticity. In particular, deadweight loss can
be almost two orders of magnitude larger than BAU if the regulator bans gasoline vehicle
production when the true cross-price elasticity is small. Even in the case in which the
production ban is effective, it leads to an inefficient spike in production in anticipation of
the ban due to the durability of the vehicles. For those countries that have proposed a


                                                35
production ban, the dates of implementation range from 2025 to 2040. Our results for the
U.S. suggest that the optimal time to ban production of gasoline vehicles varies quite a bit
depending on the model assumptions and parameters. On the one hand, if substitutability
is very low, then it is never optimal to ban gasoline vehicles. On the other hand, with a very
high SCC or endogenous rollout of inexpensive charging infrastructure, then our simulations
optimally implement the ban around 2018.
   A bankable gasoline vehicle production quota has not yet been part of the policy dis-
cussion surrounding electric vehicles, but our results point out several advantages of the
policy. A bankable quota results in the smallest deadweight loss of all policies considered
by a substantial margin. In contrast to a production ban, a bankable quota does not lead
to an inefficient spike in production because it introduces a shadow value on every vehicle
produced. It can also be modified to be effective even in the case in which gasoline vehicle
production does not cease in the first best. Like the production ban, however, it is sensitive
to incorrect estimates of the cross-price elasticity. Finally, a bankable quota is similar to poli-
cies that were effective to phase out leaded gasoline, which may help boost its acceptability
to policy makers.


Appendix
Proofs of Propositions 1-2

Before proving Propositions 1-2, we state and prove the following lemma, which allows us to
solve for the adjoint variable for gasoline vehicles from the adjoint equation:
Lemma 1. The adjoint equation (3) for gasoline vehicles is solved by the function
                                        t
                    (t) = e(a+r)t           e-(a+r) [g - UG (G( ), X ( )]d + K                (11)
                                       t0

for an arbitrary constant K .
With an initial condition (t0 ) = 0 , the adjoint equation is solved by
                                 t
               (t) = e(a+r)t         e-(a+r) [g - UG (G( ), X ( ))]d + 0 e-(a+r)t0            (12)
                                t0

With a terminal condition, the adjoint equation is solved by
                                            
                      (t) = e(a+r)t            e-(a+r) [UG (G( ), X ( )) - g ]d.              (13)
                                        t


                                                     36
Proof. The adjoint equation (3) is a first-order differential equation of the form

                                                 - (a + r) = f (t)

where f (t) = g - UG (G(t), X (t)) is a function of t. Using the integrating factor method, the
solution to a differential equation of this form, which can be easily verified, is
                                                          t
                              (t) = e(a+r)t                   e-(a+r) f ( )d + K ,
                                                         t0

where K is an arbitrary constant.
   If (t0 ) = 0 , we set (11) equal to 0 and solve for K , which implies K = 0 e-(a+r)t0 .
Substitution in (11) yields (12).
   For the terminal condition, instead of using the transversality conditions, we use the
terminal condition (T ) = 1 with an arbitrary end period T . We then determine the
constant KT with this arbitrary end period and take the limit of KT as T  . With this
terminal condition in (11) we can solve for KT which yields
                                                   T
                      KT = 1 e-(a+r)T -                e-(a+r) [g - UG (G( ), X ( ))]d.
                                                 t0

We then take the limit as T   of KT and substitute the result into (11) which gives

                   t                                                    
 (t) = e(a+r)t         e-(a+r) [g - UG (G( ), X ( )]d -                     e-(a+r) [g - UG (G( ), X ( ))]d
                 t0                                                    t0

which simplifies to (13). Note that the solution does not depend on the arbitrary constant
1 .

Proof of Proposition 1
Proof. To prove the condition for banning gasoline vehicles, we show that the solution sat-
isfies the first order conditions with g  = 0. As t  , if g = 0 and x is such that (5) is
satisfied, then for some T1 we have (G, X )  (0, X  ). We can then evaluate the adjoint
variable using (13) from Lemma 1, which shows that for t > T1
                                                
                        (t) = e(a+r)t              e-(a+r) [UG (G( ), X ( )) - g ]d.
                                        t

                                                
                              e(a+r)t                 e-(a+r) [UG (0, X  ) - g ]d.
                                            t

                                  = (UG (0, X  ) - g ) (a + r) < cg
which implies (t) < cg . Together with g = 0, the remaining first order condition is satisfied.
   A proof by contradiction demonstrates the condition under which gasoline vehicles are not
banned. Suppose g  = 0 which implies that g (t) = 0 for all t > T1 for some T1 . But this implies
that for some T2 with t > T2 > T1 we have G  0 and X  X  so that UG (G, X )  UG (0, X  )


                                                              37
where  means "arbitrarily close to", i.e., within an -ball. Again using (13) from Lemma 1,
we have that for t > T2
                                                    
                      (t) = e(a+r)t                    e-(a+r) [UG (G( ), X ( )) - g ]d.
                                            t

                                                    
                              e(a+r)t                  e-(a+r) [UG (0, X  ) - g ]d.
                                                t

                                   = (UG (0, X  ) - g ) (a + r) > cg
which contradicts the first order condition   cg .



Proof of Proposition 2
Proof. To characterize te note that x > 0 over the interval [te , tg ] so (5) must hold including
at te . But at te we have G(te ) = Gss and X (te ) = 0. Substituting these into (5) UX (Gss , 0) =
(a + r)cx (te ) + x (te ) + c
                            x (te ) which can then be solved for te and characterizes te . (6) follows
directly.
    To characterize tg , we focus on the adjoint variable . During [te , tg ], we have g interior,
so that  = cg . After tg ,  evolves according to the adjoint equation (3) which we can solve
using (13) from Lemma 1 to have
                                         
                   (t) = e(a+r)t            e-(a+r) [UG (Gsim ( ), X sim ( )) - g ]d.            (14)
                                     t

But at tg , we have (tg ) = cg which implies the result
                              
                                  e-(a+r)( -t ) (UG (Gsim ( ), X sim ( )) - g )d.
                                                       g
                      cg =
                             tg
