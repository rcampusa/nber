         Monetary and Fiscal Policy with Flexible Exchange Rates



                                ABSTRACT


     The implications of "perfect" capital mobility for the effective-
ness of monetary and fiscal policy and the transmission of disturbances
under floating or fixed exchange rates were drawn in the classic paper
by Mundell (1963). With fixed rates, fiscal policy moves output but
monetary policy does not, and vice versa under flexible rates. These
results are among the most enduring and best—known in international
economics.

     The flexible—rate version of the Mundell model was dynamized by
Dornbusch (1976). A crucial feature of both the Mundell and Dornbusch
analyses is the exclusion of the exchange rate from the money—market
equilibrium condition. However, if the domestic price level is sensitive
to changes in the exchange rate, then a movement in the rate changes
real balances. Thus fiscal policy influences real balances through the
exchange rate, opening the way for effects on home output in the Mundell
model or the price level in the Dornbusch version.

     In addition to excluding the exchange rate from money—market equi-
librium, Mundell and Dornbusch do not consider constraints of long—run
portfolio balance. In a stationary economy, these would require balance
on the current account in the long—run equilibrium, while the Mundell—
Dornbusch model permits current account imbalance indefinitely.

     In this paper we revisit the Mundell—Dornbusch model to study its
behavior with the price level dependent on the exchange rate, and with
long—run portfolio balance constraints. We find that the flexible—rate
fiscal policy result is a special case, dependent on the assumption of
insensitivity of the price level to movement in the exchange rate.

            Monetary and Fiscal Policy with Flexible Exchange Rates


I. Introduction and Summary

    The implications of "perfect" capital mobility for the effectiveness of

monetary and fiscal policy and the transmission of disturbances under floating

or fixed exchange rates were drawn in the classic paper by Mundell (1963).

With fixed rates, fiscal policy moves output but monetary policy does not,

and vice versa under flexible rates. These results are among the most enduring

and best—known in international economics.

      The ineffectiveness of monetary policy under fixed rates depends on

 perfect capital mobility and the inability of the monetary authorities to

 sterilize balance of payments surpluses or deficits. By now, it is well

 known that during the fixed rate period many countries did indeed sterilize

 to a large extent. Earlier evidence on this is cited In Whitman (1975); more

 recent empirical work confirming this proposition has been reported by Obstfeld

 (1980). Thus the sharpness of Mundell's result for monetary policy with fixed

 rates does not hold up in light of the empirical evidence on sterilization.

      However, the flexible—rate result for fiscal policy has fared better.

The model was dynamized by Dornbusch (1976). In his paper, a change in fiscal

policy (for example, an increase in government purchases), gives rise to a

 change in the real exchange rate that yields an exactly offsetting change in

 the trade balance, transmitting the entire disturbance abroad. A crucial fea-

 ture of both the Mundell and Dornbusch analyses, though, is the exclusion of

 the exchange rate from the money—market equilibrium condition. This is a

 focal point of this paper.

      If the domestic price level is sensitive to changes in the exchange rate,

 then a movement in the rate changes real balances. Thus fiscal policy influ-

 ences real balances through the exchange rate, opening the way for effects on

 home output in the Mundell model or the price level in theDornbusch version.

 This reduces the effect ttansinitted abroad.
                                    —2—




     In addition to excluding the exchange rate from money—market equilibrium,

Mundell and Dornbusch do not consider constraints of long—run portfolio

balance. In a stationary economy, these would require balance on the current

account in the long—run equilibrium, while the Mundell-Dornbusch model permits

current account imbalance indefinitely. This is a point noted earlier by both

of the present authors [see Branson (1972), Buiter (1978)].

     In this paper we revisit the Mundell—Dornbusch model to study its behavior

with the price level dependent on the exchange rate, and with long—run port-

folio balance constraints. We find that the flexible—rate fiscal policy

result is a special case, dependent on the assumption of insensitivity of the

price level to movement in the exchange rate.

     In section II below we review the Mundell—Dornbusch model, and in section

III we present an example of the consequences of inclusion of the exchange

rate in the money market equilibrium condition. Then in section IV we intro-

duce a full prototype model with stock adjustment and rational expectations.

Section V gives the complete results in a Mundell—style model with a rigid

price of domestic output, and section VI gives the results with flexible

prices. In general, with flexible exchange rates fiscal policy matters.


 II. The Mundell—Dornbusch Model

      With "perfect" capital mobility and a freely floating exchange rate,

 the exchange rate is the transmission belt by which monetary policy af-

 fects real output q, while movement in the exchange rate makes output

 invariant to fiscal policy. These are the results of Mundell's classic

 paper (1963), (1968). With the price level fixed and the interest rate

 determined by the world market (and static exchange—rate expectations),
                                 —3—



an increase in the money stock increases the level of real income consis-

tent with money—market equilibrium. The increase comes through deprecia-

tion of the currency (a rise in the exchange rate e) until the increase

in the real current account balance gives the requisite increase in income.

However, an increase in government spending does not move the money—market

equilibrium q; the currency appreciates until the trade balance deterior-

ates exactly to offset the fiscal expansion.

     Dornbusch (1976) up—dated and extended Mundell's model. He added

exchange—rate dynamics with "perfect foresight" expectations about move-

ment in the long—run equilibrium exchange rate e. In the basic model of

Dornbusch's paper, the level of output is exogenous, and the rate of in-

flation p responds to the excess demand for goods. Here movements in p

 (or short—run effects on p) are the analog to changes in output q in

Mundell. Briefly, in section V of his 1976 paper, Dornbusch treats a

 case with short—run variability in output. Here the analogy to Mundell

 is clearer.

      In both models, monetary policy moves the domestic price level in

 the long run, and the rate of inflation in the short run. This is the

 analog to Mundell's effectiveness of monetary policy. However, in

Dornbusch as well as in Mundell, a change in government spending moves

the exchange rate to create an exactly offsetting effect on the current

account balance. Fiscal policy is "ineffective" in both cases; it has

no effect on q in Mundell's version, and no effect on p or    in Dornbusch.


A.   Fiscal Policy Effects

     The ineffectiveness of fiscal policy in the Mundell model can be

illustrated simply. Money—market equilibrium is given by an "LW' curve,
                                          —4—




        (1)        £(i, q)


where q is domestic output. The interest rate is fixed at the world

rate i by "perfect" capital mobility:


        (2) i=i
 If a forward discount on the domestic currency, c, were included, (2)

would be

        (2') 1 = 1* + c


The IS curve describing goods market equilibrium is



        (3) q = a(q — T, 1) + g +    x(-       ,   a)


Here a is private absorption, T is real tax revenue, g is government pur-

chases, and x is net exports.

     With i fixed by (2) and p given exogenously, or, alternatively, by a

supply curve p = p(q)        with        > 0        equation (1) determines q. There is
                                    Pq
no room for fiscal effects here. Given T, 1, g, and q, the exchange rate

is determined by the goods—market equation (3) at the value which sets x =

q — a   —
            g.   An increase in g will require a decrease in e to maintain goods—

market equilibrium. Thus in the Mundell model, the exchange rate is determin-

ed by requirements of goods—market equilibrium, and fiscal policy changes

generate offsetting changes in e.


    The Dornbusch model is more complicated, being dynamic, but the result

is the same. Dornbusch writes his model as linear in the logs of quantities

and prices and the level of the interest rate. His "LM" curve, analogous to

the combination of (1), (2'), and          — 0 (—e), is
                                           -.5—




        (4) p —     = —q + Xi +           —   e)

where e is the long—run equilibrium exchange rate. (This is Dornbusch's

equation (3), in our notation.) His "IS" curve (in the basic model with

q exogenous) is given by


        (5) p     ,rln(D/Y)   lr[u + (e —     p)   + (-y —    l)q    —   ci]

This is Dornbusch's equation (8); his u is "exogenous" expenditure, our g.

D is real demand, and Y       is   exogenous real output.

        In long—run equilibrium e =      , so      (4) determines p independently of u

(our g), just as in Mundell, money—market equilibrium determines q. An increase

in u requires a change in e given by de/du =                 —1/cS   to hold   = 0 in (5). With

perfect foresight, d = de, causing no disturbance in the money market. Thus

again, the effect of a change in g (u here) is to generate an offsetting change

in e.


B.      The Role of Capital Mobility


        The Mundell—Dornbusch assumption of "perfect" capital mobility combines

two assumptions. This first is freedom of capital movement —— absence of

impediments to capital flows in the forms of capital controls, taxes, etc.

The second is perfect substitutability of assets denominated in home currency

and foreign exchange. The Mundell financial "sector" of equations (1) and

 (2) can be obtained by simplifying a more general structure with imperfect

 substitutability as follows. Assume three assets —— money N, bonds B, and

net claims on foreigners F. Then a plausible financial—market structure

 [see Branson (1977), Katseli—Narion (1980)] could be written:
                                         —6-




    (6)
          M   =   m(i,   q) ;                  (8)

                                                            f(i,
                                                              .
                                                                   I   ,




    (7)       =   b(i, i q,          ;
                                               (9) W N + B + eF



                                                     *
If we assume that the foreign interest rate i is fixed by world—market

conditions (small—country assumption) and that b. and f. -*                , then   the

B and F equations (7) and (8) collapse to the perfect capital mobility

condition i =     i.     (In Branson (1977, p. 73) the FF and BB curves become

vertical at r =     r*.)
     In the more general case of less—than—perfect substitutability, I

can move relative to i and the extreme form of the Mundell—DornbusCh

fiscal policy result disappears. An increase in g will raise i relative

to i. This will yield an appreciation of the currency and a decrease in

x, partially offsetting the g increase. But the offset is only partial,

because the increase in I raises velocity, permitting an increase in q,

given N. Thus it is clear that the result of literally zero effect of

fiscal policy on q (or          in the Dornbusch model) is an extreme case with

assets being perfect substitutes it is not a general result with "high"

substitutability. This is already a familiar result in the literature.


     For example, in his earlier paper on "Flexible Exchange Rates and

Employment    Policy," Mundell (1961) showed that with        zero capital mobility,

flexible exchange rates increase the closed—economy effectiveness of

fiscal policy. A fiscal expansion leads to a trade deficit and deprecia-

tion of the currency in that paper.21 This effect is also seen clearly in


     his 1968 adaptation of this paper, Mundell added a footnote calling
  attention to the difference between the zero and perfect capital mobility
  cases. See Mundell (1968, p. 247, fn. 9).

    Brarison (1976). In intermediate cases between zero and perfect capital

    mobility, the exchange rate may appreciate or depreciate, depending on the

    relative size of current—account and capital—account effects, thus partially

offsetting or supplementing the effect of the critical fiscal expansion.

See Branson (1976) and the discussion of Dornbusch (1980) for a fuller

discussion of the empirical evidence on the capital—mobility question.

In the discussion below we will follow the now—traditional literature

in assuming perfect substitutability and the "arbitrage" condition with

risk—neutral speculation, so that


             I =   i   +   ()
This    will permit us to focus on the importance of exclusion of the exchange

rate from the money—market equilibrium condition.


C.      Stock vs Flow Equilibrium


        In the conventional model with perfect capital mobility, movements in

the current account balance offset the effects of fiscal policy on equi-

librium outtut. In equation (3) above, the real exchange rate (pie) ad-

justs to provide offsetting variation in x to movements in g. This implies

that in momencary equilibrium the current account balance is in geiera non-

zero. If iran initial equilibrium the current account is balanced, Then

the change in x that offsets a change in g must unbalance the current ac-

count. In the model of equations (1), (2), and (3), net foreign investment

(     the   current account) is non—zero indefinitely. This implies that the

rest of the world is willing to accumulate claims on or liabilities to the

home country in indefinite amounts and that the home country is willing to

issue them. There is no requirement of portfolio balance in this model.
                                  —8—



The current account imbalance in the Mundell—Dornbusch model will upset

portfolio balance in both the home country and the rest of the world

and, by altering wealth, change saving behavior. The IS and LM sched-

ules will not settle to a full equilibrium as long as net foreign in—
                                                                             8

vestment is non—zero. The implication is that in long—run equilibrium,

the current account balance must be zero.-'The simplest form of this model

was developed in Branson (1976), where it was apparent that the Nundell

(1963) results can be obtained with any source of endogenous adjustment of

the money stock; they are not unique to the international setting.

     In sections IV and V below we will analyze monetary and fiscal policy in

a framework that includes explicit consideration of stock vs flow equilibrium.

In the instantaneous short run, with historically—given values of the stocks

in the system, and with static expectations, flow equilibrium conditions de-

termine the level of output and employment, the vector of prices and interest

rates, including the exchange rate, and the rates of accumulation of the stocks.

These provide the dynamics that move the system from one equilibrium to the next,

and toward a steady state in which the relevant stocks are constant. This

characterization of instantaneous and long—run equilibrium is developed,

e.g., in Branson (1972, 1976) and Buiter (1975, 1978). Long—run equili-

brium in section IV will include the requirement that the current account

be in balance, so that the national rate of accumulation of net claims (or

liabilities) on foreigners be zero. With rational expectations or perfect

foresight even the current momentary equilibrium depends on the entire

future path of the economy.




'This assumes no real growth in long—run equilibrium.

III. The Exchange Rate and Money—market Equilibrium


     The importance of the exclusion of the exchange rate from the money—

market equilibrium condition (1) in the conventional model can be seen if

we write p =    p(e)   with 0 < p     < 1 there and in the IS curve (3). In this

case, a change in government spending g moves the price level. This changes

the real money stock, shifting the LM curve. The result is a change in the

equilibrium level of output q, in either the Mundell or the Dornbusch

version of the model. By writing p =            p(e),    we convert equations (1) —   (3)
into a simultaneous system in e and q.

     Consider the revision of equations (1) and (3) to include p =              p(e):

     (1') pe) =


     (3')   q   a(q — T, 1) + g +                a)


If we substitute i =        i   from (2), this is a two—equation system in q and e.

Initialize p = e = 1 and take the total differential of (1') and (3') with

di* = 0 to obtain
                       A
                                                                   0

Here x =    ax/a().        The determinant of the coefficient matrix Det(A) < 0.

The solutions for a change in g, with dM = dT                  0 are given by

                                            dg
                                                 —
                                                     Det(A)    £q < 0
                                  —10—



An increase in g causes an appreciation of the currency (de/dg < 0) but not

enough to eliminate the effect on q. For comparison to section IV it is

useful to note that a balanced—budget expansion with dT = dg would multiply

each of these multipliers by the quantity 1 > [1 —          + Xa)] > 0 .   This
                                                     aq(l
would preserve the signs of the fiscal—policy results, simply reducing

their magnitudes. As long as the exchange rate enters the excess demand f or

money with a positive sign, dq/dg > 0 in the short run.

     These results are illustrated in Figure 1. The g increase initially

takes the IS curve to 11S1 .   The result is upward pressure on the interest

rate and appreciation of the currency (e falls). The rise of p/e shifts

the IS curve back to the left. But as e falls, p falls, increasing the real

money stock. LM shifts right to a new equilibrium at point 2. There e,
                I
p and pie have fallen and q has increased. Fiscal policy has an effect

through the exchange rate changing real balances.

     Clearly this result can be generalized. Any argument for inclusion of

the exchange rate in the demand function for nominal balances will eliminate

the extreme result of the conventional model that dq/dg =     0.   We chose to

include p(e) both because it provides a clear example and because there is

good econometric evidence for this link.   [See Bruno (1978)]. However,

the same result would be obtained if we include wealth as an argument in

the money demand function. Then as the exchange rate falls, if the country

is a net creditor in foreign denominated assets, the home—currency value of

wealth falls, reducing the demand for N. Similarly, the inclusion of exchange—

rate expectations in the demand for money would make the effect of fiscal

policy non—zero.

      Thus it is apparent that the usual result depends on a very strong
                                                   —11—



assumption ——       that    the exchange rate can be excluded from the money—market

equilibrium condition. Since there is ample evidence that it must be

included at least through its effect on the price level, it seems clear

that the conventional wisdom is too extreme. The basic model of monetary

and fiscal policy with floating exchange rates needs modification to

include the exchange rate properly in specification of the LN curve, or

of the financial sector generally. We next turn to a full specification

of the basic model with perfect capital mobility.

Table 1 gives a list of definitions of symbols.

               Equation (11) is the LM equation, equating the supply of real balances

 to the demand. Money demand depends negatively on the nominal interest rate,

 positively on a transactions variable, proxied by domestic value added, and

  (in principle) positively on real financial wealth. The price index used to

 deflate nominal money balances is the consumer price index which is a function

 both of the price of domestically produced goods and of the price of imports
       *                 *   the foreign currency price of imports, is set equal to unity

           .
                   (Pf
  for simplicity). A depreciation of the exchange rate will therefore, cet.

 par., reduce the real stock of money. Equation (12) is the IS equation.

 Domestic private absorption (expressed in terms of domestic goods) plus

  government spending on goods and services plus the trade balance surplus

  (expressed in terms of domestic output) equals domestic production. Private

  absorption depends on real disposable income, the real interest rate and

  real private financial wealth. Net exports decline when the terms of trade

  improve and when private domestic absorption expands. The marginal pro-

  pensity to import is less than unity. For simplicity we assume that all

  government spending is on domestic output. Private capital forniation and

  real capital stock adjustment are omitted.

    Equation (13) reflects the assumption of risk—neutral speculation in

the foreign exchange market: the domestic interest rate equals the exogenous

world interest rate plus the expected proportional rate of depreciation of

the home currency. Private financial wealth equals the sum of private

holdings of domestic money, domestic government bonds and foreign bonds

(equation 14). It is assumed that only domestic residents hold domestic

government bonds. All foreign lending or borrowing is done in foreign

currency—denominated bonds. The general price level used to deflate

nominal assets and nominal income is defined in (15). The Mundell—DornbusCh

analysis represents the special case where    ,   the weight of home goods

prices in the c.p.i., is unity. Equation (16) defines real private dis-

posable income. Real national income is defined in (17). Note that changes

in the terms of trade can alter the real income corresponding to a given volume

of domestic output. The open—economy government budget constraint is given

in (19). It is assumed that a competitive interest rate is paid on official

foreign exchange reserves. The balance of payments identity is given in

(20). Complementing these flow constraints are the stock—shift constraints

for the public sector (21) and the private sector (22).    These constrain

the instantaneous portfolio reallocations that public and private agents

can engage in. Expectations are either static (23a and 24a) or rational

 (23b and 24b).


      We shall make two further simplifying a.aumptionS about government

 financing behavior. The first is that the government always balances its

 budget by endogenous changes in taxes. Thus, when we consider fiscal

 policy, we shall be deriving short—run and long-run balanced budget multi-

 pliers. This is represented by (25):
                                                  —16—



(25)Vg+iB_ei*R_pTO.

The second assumption is that the government does not engage in "flow"

open market operations and does not sterilize balance of payments deficits

or surpluses. This means that


(26a)         = 0


We shall assume that there is a pre—existing stock of government debt,

i.e. that


(26b) B > 0


The implication of (25) and (26a) is, from (19), that


(27) lI = eR



        Our model is the standard neo—Keynesian open—economy model. The

country is small in the market for its imports and in the world capital

market but large in the market for its exportable. The terms of trade are

therefore endogenous.

        Under a freely floating exchange rate,                     = R    0 ,   and therefore,

given our assumptions of a balanced budget and of no continuous open market

operations, 11 = 0             .     The model can be summarized as in equations (28)—(30).

  V. Adjustment With a Fixed Price of Domestic Output, V.


              In this section we study the behavior of the model of section IV

         with a fixed price of domestic output V. This is the version of the

         model that is closest in spirit to the original Mundell model. The

         price rigidity permits us to observe output effects of policy ex—

         periments. In subsection A we study the model with static expecta-

         tions; in subsection B we consider rational expectations.




         A.    Static expectations

              If exchange rate expectations are static, e = 0      .   The impact

         multipliers are derived from the matrix equation (31).

       is assumed to be positive. This will be the case if depreciation of

the exchange rate, by raising the general price level, reduces the real

supply of money balances by more than it reduces the demand for real money

balances. This is more likely the larger the effect of import prices on

the c.p.i. (the smaller             ).        If the country is a net external debtor
(F >    0),   exchange depreciation will increase the real value of debts to

the rest of the world. This will reduce                        the demand for money if 9w   is

positive. e assume that                       is sufficiently small for this demand effect

to be dominated by the effect of changes in e on the real money supply.

There probably is little loss of generality in assuming                         = 0 : money is

dominated by short bonds as a share of value and wealth—related demand for

money is likely to be small at the margin. See Ando—Shell (1975) for a

case where it is literally zero.                          is assumed to benegative. This

will be so if a depreciation of the exchange rate boosts total (domestic and

foreign) spending on home            goods. This is the traditional assumption of

the elasticities approach: exchange rate depreciation shifts the IS curve

to the right. This effect, captured by - x5                        is present but it is countered

to the qualification of net ownership claims on the rest of the world, ex-

change rate depreciation, by raising the general price level, reduces real

wealth. This reduces absorption and is captured by              (M+B—aW). Exchange

rate depreciation, by turning the terms of trade against the depreciating

country, reduces the real income corresponding to a given value of domestic

output. This is reflected in ay(ci_)(l_c)                 Against this goes the

    In the IS—LM space of Figure 2, an open market purchase of bonds shifts

the LM curve to the right, at a given exchange rate. The resulting in-

cipient demand for foreign bonds (capital outflow) causes the exchage rate

to depreciate (35a). This depreciation shifts the IS curve to the right

and, by raising the general price level, shifts the LM curve back to the

left, although not all the way to its original position.                   In the Nundell-Dornbusch

analysis the effect of the exchange rate on the LN curve is ignored. In

that model the new short—run equilibrium would be at E1t rather than at
                                                                                   is in
as in our model. The current account, Which was balanced at E0

surplus      at       .   Output increases.
        An increase in public spending raises output, causes the exchange rate

to appreciate and turns the current account into deficit. This case

is essentially the same as shown in Figure 1 in section III earlier.

The IS curve shifts to the right at a given exchange rate.                   The

incipient stock—shift inf low of capital causes the exchange rate to appre-

ciate. In the Mundell model the appreciation proceeds until net exports
                                                                                     In our

model, the appreciation of the exchange rate shifts the 124 curve to the

right, preserving effectiveness of fiscal policy under a floating exchange

rate and perfect capital mobility.

      An increase in net claims on the rest of the world shifts the IS curve

to the right through the wealth effect on private absorption. Output expands

and the exchange rate appreciates. Any wealth effect on the demand for money

is assumed to be small enough not to reverse this result.



      A.l    Long—run stock equilibrium


      Long—run equilbrium is defined by the IS—LM equilibrium plus current

account balance: F = 0             in (30). The long—run equilibrium conditions

determining the steady—state values of e, q, and F are

Note that these steady—state conditions and consequently the steady—state

multipliers are the same for both static and rational expectations. These

multipliers are obtained from (38).

             is negative if exchange rate depreciation improves the current

account. The elasticities effect is reinforced by the increase in the

domestic currency value of service account income denominated in foreign

exchange (assuming F Is positive). It is also bolstered by an adverse

terms—of—trade effect which reduces absorption and by the reduction in real

financial wealth associated with the rise in the general prive level result-

ing from the depreciation.                 is negative if an increase in F worsens

the current account. This will only be true if the current_account—improving

 effect of increased foreign interest income is more than offset by the

 boost to absorption caused by an increase in F via the wealth effect.

Note that the 2x2 submatrix indicated in (38') has a negative determinant.

It simplifies the long—run comparative statics to assume that the marginal

wealth effect on the demand for money is zero:                     2. = 0   .    This is assumed
in the derivation of the long—run multipliers below. The steady—state

multipliers can now be derived easily.

        The signs of these long—run multipliers are as expected. Expansionary

fiscal policy creates a current account deficit in the short run and a

lower stock of claims on the rest of the world in the long run (40e). Expan-

sionary monetary policy has the opposite effect on F in the short run and

on F in the long run (40f).

       Assuming i =                 0       ,   the only direct consequence of the lower long—run
stock of external net worth associated with an increase in g is on the

IS curve. It shifts to the left relative to the new short—run equilibrium.

The result is a depreciation of the exchange rate and a decline in output

relative to the new short—run equilibrium. Relative to the initial equili-

brium, however, the exchange rate appreciates and output expands.

       The long—run effect of an open market purchase is to further increase

output above its new short—run equilibrium level. The exchange rate appre-

ciates relative to the new short—run equilibrium level but not enough to

bring it below the initial equilibrium value: there remains a long—run de-

preciation of the currency.



A.2 Stability

       The stability of the model under static expectations can be studied

by substituting the short—run equilibrium solutions for e and q ((34) and

(36)) into the dynamic equation for '      given in (30). Linearizing the
resulting expression at the long—run equilibrium yields:



         =                                  —                      (M+B_aw)he

               —   (X+sx )he+ F


This is the full version of the simpler "super Marshall—Lerner" condition

in Branson (1977).

       A clear destabilizing influence is exercised by the effect of larger

external net worth on the service account (j* >     0).   Foreign asset accumu-

lation causes exchange rate appreciation (h < 0) and provided the Marshall—

Lerner conditions are satisfied this will cause the trade balance to


deteriorate ((x+sx)h < 0).          Increased service account income raises


absorption and this causes the trade balance to deteriorate (sxai*s <          0).

Larger F boosts output which will also increase absorption and reduce


net exports (sxaays1h <       0).   The exchange rate appreciation resulting

 income.             It   improves the terms of trade, raising real income and absorp—

                                                                       1—a

 reduces the real value of foreign interest income                           which works in the

 opposite direction (sxaay                    e         hF > 0). Larger F , by increasing


wealth, raises absorption and worsens the trade balance (sx a                            < 0).
                                                                                   awp
 The exchange rate appreciation further raises wealth by lowering the

 general price level. (This assumes the country is not a very large

 net foreign creditor in which case exchange rate appreciation would cause

 a large capital loss on external holdings). This again worsens the trade

 issue.


       B.        Rational Expectations

                 With rational expectations or perfect foresight, the model of

equations (28), (29) and (30) becomes:

               is    negative if the effect of an increase in F improving the service account

        is more than balanced by a deterioration in the trade account.
                                       —28—




        For this system to have a unique "saddle path" converging to the steady

state, the determinant of the matrix in (46) must be negative. This will al-

ways be the case if         is positive. In e—F space, the   = 0 locus is down-

ward sloping. If the F = 0 is upward—sloping, a unique downward—sloping sad-

dle path exists. This is shown in Figure 3, where the saddle path is labeled

SS' .     if - is negative, the F=0 locus too is downward—sloping. A unique
convergent solution then exists only if the '=O locus is steeper than the e=O locus.


        F is predetermined at any given moment but e is free to make discrete

jumps in response to "news". Unanticipated current or future (announced) pol-

icy changes or other parameter changes cause e to jump     onto   the unique con-

vergent solution path. This is the implication of the assumptions of complete

(short—run and long—run) perfect foresight and an efficient foreign exchange

market. For simplicity, we only consider the case where the policy changes

are both unanticipated and implemented as soon as they are announced.

          To obtain the complete solution under rational expectations, we com-

bine the information of Figure 3 with the long—run comparative statics of

equations 40a—f.

           The long—run effect of an open market purchase is for both F and e

to rise. In Figure 4, the initial long—run equilibrium is at E0, the new

one at E1. In response to the unanticipated open market purchase, the ex-

change rate depreciates at once to e01. With F predetermined, this is the

only way the economy can move onto the convergent solution path through E1.

The exchange rate overshoots its long—run equilibrium and after the initial

jump    depreciation,   appreciates smoothly towards e1. Along the adjustment

path, the current account is in surplus and external assets are accumulated.
                                      —29—



 With static expectation, too, the exchange rate depreciates in jump fashion and

 afterwards appreciates continuously towards the new long-run equilibrium.!!

 It can be shown, however, that the jump will be smaller under rational ex-

 tations. The intuitive reason is that with rational expectations speculators

 are aware of the future appreciation of the currency. This increases the

 demand for domestic money and reduces the amount of the initial depreciation.-'


       The comparison of the impact effects of an open market purchase under

static and rational expectations is represented in Figures 4 and 5. In Fig

ure 4, the economy moves to E01 on the O locus with static expectations,

above E01 ,    the rational expectations equilibrium. In Figure 5, with static

expectations, the new momentary equilibrium is at E1 , say      .   The domestic
                                                                         *
interest     rate is equal to the exogenous world interest rate at i          .   With

rational     expectations, the new IS and     LI'1 curves have to intersect at an
                                                                     S

                                   From   Figure 4, we know that
                                                                     e

immediately after the unanticipated open market purchase. Since we know also

from Figure 4 that the exchange rate sharply depreciates on impact, the new

equilibrium must lie between A1 and A2 ,        i.e.   at a point such as E2

e is higher at E2 than at E0 but lower than at E1 .             Thus, relative to

   ,   the    IS curve shifts to the left and the LM curve to the right. q has

increased at £2 relative to E0 ,        but   it can be either below or above the

value of output associated with E1




'With static expectations, it is irrelevant whether the policy changes are
  anticipated or unanticipated.


'With static expectations the economy always moves along the eO locus in
  Figure 3. This can be seen by noting that (35c) gives the same relation-
  ship between e and F under static expectations as does O under rational
  expectations (46).
                                       —30—


       The long—run effect of a balanced budget increase in public spending

is for both e and F to fall. The solution in e-F space is shown in

Figure 6. The original long-run equilibrium is at               ,   the new one at E1
On impact, the exchange rate appreciates with a jump to E01 .           It   overshoots

its new long-run equilibrium value. Afterwards, the country runs a current

account deficit and the exchange rate depreciates smoothly toward E1 .             Since

e is positive along the adjustment path, the currency is at a forward discount

throughout. The jump appreciation of the exchange rate is less under rational

expectations than under static expectations because the forward discount reduces

the demand for domestic money. The reasoning is identical to the case of an

open market purchase. The impact effect on output under rational expectations

is positive but many either fall short or exceed that under static expectations.


 VI. Adjustment with a Flexible Price of Domestic Output


       We now consider the case in which output is always equal to its full

 employment level and the price of domestic output, V, adjusts flexibly

 to clear the domestic goods market. This is the version of the model that

 is closest in spirit to Dornbusch (1976). Full employment output is taken

 to be constant, Changes in labour supply due to changes in the terms of

 trade are not considered. See Branson—Rotemberg (1980) for these complica-

 tions. The recent paper by Dornbusch and Fischer (1980) treats a version

 of the model, simplified by the elimination of domestic bonds and the ser-

 vice account in the balance of payments. Our results can be considered an

 extension of theirs to include these aspects of portfolio choice and dynamic

 behavior.


 A.   Static Expectations

 two short-run endogenous variables determined by the 1J4 and IS curves

 are V and e

to the changes in the predetermined or exogenous variables M, B, F and g

are obtained by totally differentiating (28) and (29):

The effect of a change in V on money market equilibrium is given by 8

         We assume that, on balance, an increase in V will tend to create

Qualitatively, these results are similar to those derived for the fixed

domestic price level case (reported in 34-37), with the role of q as the

short-run endogenous variable taken over by V •                                 An open-market purchase

causes exchange rate depreciation (53a) and a rise in the general price level

(55a ).    Note that an increase in the money supply will only be neutral (i.e.

will only lead to a depreciation of e and a rise in V by the same percen—

tage as the rise in M) if nominally denominated public sector debt (bonds)

is absent from the model. This will be the case either if bonds are not

neutral but B happens to be zero or if bonds are neutral, in which case

they cease to be part of private sector net worth. With B omitted from

the model, it is immediately apparent from (28) and (29) that money is neutral
                1/
in the short-run.—

    With a positive value of B entering into private sector wealth,      a

 percentage rise in V and e equal to the percentage rise in M (brought

 about either by a helicopter drop or by an open market purchase) would not

 leave the real equilibrium unaltered: the real value of the stock of in—

 terest-bearing public debt would be reduced, With output given exogenously,

 there would be downward pressure on the interest rate. With perfect capital

 mobility and static expectations, this would be translated into further de-

 preciation of the exchange rate. After an initial open market purchase, the

 original i,q equilibrium is regained via further depreciation of e and an

 increase in the price level.

          A balanced budget increase in public spending raises V and causes the

 exchange rate to appreciate (53b and 55b). In i—q space, the IS curve

 shifts to the right at given e and V, creating excess demand for home

 goods and, by raising i above i         threatening a stock-shift gain in re-

 serves. The original i,q equilibrium is restored by a rise in V and a

 fall in e that shifts the IS curve back to its original position. The

• increase in V and the reduction in e exactly cancel each other out as

 regards their combined effects on          money market equilibrium.

    A larger value of net claims on the rest of the world will be

associated with an appreciation of the currency (53c) and an increase in

the price of domestic output (55c).

     An increase in public spending will lead to a current account deficit

(assuming the initial equilibrium to be a stationary state). An open market

purchase will not affect the current account (or any other real variable),

if money is neutral which in turn requires bonds to be neutral. If bonds

are non-neutral, then e increases more (in percentage terms) than V.

This improvement in competitive position should lead to a current account

surplus

worsen the current account. The elasticities approsch suggests that this

will be so, provided the Warshall-Lerner conditions are satisfied (x+sx(O).

Against this, the monetary approach focuses on the effect of changes in the

       The long—run effect of an expansionary open—market operation is to

raise the price of domestic output (59d), depreciate the exchange rate (59b),

and to increase the stock of private claims on the rest of the world (59f),

with no effect on i and q. The impact effect with flexible prices is to

create a current account surplus, which increases the long—run stock of

external wealth. If there are no domestic bonds or if domestic government

debt is neutral, an increase in N causes e, V, and p to rise in the same pro-

portion as the increase in M with no effect on F. In that case, the impact

effect and steady state effect are identical.

       A balanced—budget increase in public spending leads to long—run exchange

rate appreciation (59a), an increase in the price of domestic output (59c), and

(probably) a net loss of external wealth (59e). The impact effect of a

balanced budget increase in g is to create a current account deficit. This

is matched by a decline in the long—run stock of external wealth.


       Note that with e falling and V increasing, there is a magnified

long—run appreciation of the real exchange rate (or loss of competitiveness)

as a result of an increase in g .   To maintain current account equilibrium,

private absorption has to fall. This fall in absorption is brought about by a

reduction in external vealth,1 For both fiscal and monetary policy, the

long—run eudogeneity of F reduces the magnitudes of the effects on e and V

but does not reverse them.


      A.2 Stability

         To analyze the stability of the system under static expectations,

we substitute (52) and (54) into (20). This yields:


A'We must asse that the loss of service account income when F falls
  is not too strong.

                                             -              h (F;.)ahe(F;.)
                                                                                     )1+

             This   external wealth adjustment equation will be stable if an

increase in F causes the trade balance to deteriorate by enough to offset

the increased service income from the rest of the world. Since a higher

value of F raises V and lowers e ,                         a significant deterioration in the

trade balance due to loss of competitiveness is certainly possible. The

precise stability condition (for local stability) is                        <0
                                                                       --

        B.        Rational Expectations


                  With rational expectations and a flexible domestic price level,

the dynamic model of (28), (29) and (30) becomes:




              M                               M+B+eF
             Vael
                       =    L(i+—q
                             .*
                                e'
                                              Vael
                                                       )




                                                i + ct(.- -
             a(()11_(q_g)
                                    +
                                        :-a                     ), MeF))+
                                                   + g +
                                                             x(,a(.,.,.))        =    q

             F =     Y-xi,      a(',,•)) +    iF

              Satisfactory treatment of this model would involve dealing with a

system of three simultaneous differential equations, in e ,                          V     and F. To
be able to continue our convenient diagrammatic analysis, it is necessary to
                                                —39—

remove     V from the model. This can be done provided one of the following

three conditions is satisfied:


          1. Absorption is interest inelastic (a = 0)

          2. It is the nominal rather than the real interest rate that
                                                                   S


              affects absorption, in which case i+                      is the appropriate

              argument in the a function;

          3. While exchange rate expectations are rational,expectations

              about the price of domestic output are static. In this case,
                      S

              i+a is the appropriate argument in the a function.

                                     S

 We shall include           i +              as the interest rate argument in the absorption

 function to stay as close as possible to the analysis of the fixed domestic

 price level case.

              Linearizing the system at the long-run equilibrium where                       =   = 0,

 we obtain:

          For reasons of space, we shall ignore the possible ambiguities,

indicated in (61'), attached to the signs of                   and

          We therefore have a saddlepoint equilibrium with the same general

properties as the one drawn in Figure 3.. Combining the downward slope of

the convergent saddle path with our long-run comparative static results,

the complete dynamic adjustment paths after an unanticipated open market

purchase and an unanticipated balanced budget increase in public spending

can be derived. The diagrams drawn from the fixed domestic price

level case can also serve for the flexible price level case. Thus in

Figure 4, after an unanticipated open market purchase, the currency jump—

depreciates from E0 to                  ,   overshooting its long-run equilibrium. The
current account goes into surplus. After the initial jump, the currency

gradually appreciates to E1 with F rising along the way..!.!                The absence

of long-run neutrality may seem surprising even if bonds are net worth, as

domestic and foreign bonds are perfect substitutes. The reason that a resto-

ration of the original value of private bond holdings (domestic and foreign)

does not take place in the long run is the following. Let the open-market

VWe assume that bonds are net worth and that money therefore is not neutral.

purchase increase M by a fraction A •          M+B   is constant. If this operation

were to be neutral in the long run, e and V would have to increase by

the same fraction A .      To maintain real net worth at its original level with

M+B constant, F will have to increase by a fraction ó           ,   defined   by:

(l+A) (M+B+eF) =   M+B+(l+A)e(l+6)F .    However, any change in F will affect
                                                                       *
the current account equilibrium through its effect on the term i F (it will

also affect disposable income). Therefore, unless there is debt neutrality,

changes in portfolio composition effected through current account deficits

or surpluses will not make open market purchases neutral, even in the long

run.

          The dyi-iamics of a government spending increase under rational

expectations are shown in Figure 6.       The impact effect of an unanticipated

increase in g is a jump appreciation of the exchange rate from E0 to E01

which overshoots its long-run equilibrium. The economy runs a current account

deficit. After the initial shock, the exchange rate depreciates smoothly

towards E1 with the economy reducing its stock of claims on the rest of the

world.

          As with a fixed V, rational expectations reduce the magnitude

of the initial jump in e relative to what it would be under static expec-

tations. Under static expectations, the impact effect on e exceeds the

long run effect. For example, with an open market purchase, the initial

jump depreciation overshoots the long—run equilibrium depreciation. After

the jump, the currency appreciates steadily. Speculators and arbitrators

endowed with rational expectations are aware of this steady future rate of

appreciation. They immediately increase their demand for the domestic

currency, thus reducing but not eliminating the magnitude of the initial

jump and the extent to which the exchange rate overshoots its long—run

equilibrium.
