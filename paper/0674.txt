                       The Steel Industry Consent Decree



                                    ABSTRACT



          This study analyzes the Consent Decree of the United States'
                                                                       basic
 steel industry which reformed
                                plant seniority systems to accomodate issues
 of equal employment
                      opportunity. The plant—by—plant litigation
                                                                  brought
 under Title VII and Executive
                                Order 11246 is shown to be the main catalyst
 which brought representatives of
                                    the steel industry, of the United Steel
 Workers of America, and of the
                                  appropriate government agencies to negotiate
 this industry_wide solution.   The principal terms of the steel industry
  Consent Decree are: the establishment of a mechanism to
                                                             implement the
 Decree; the uniform institution of
                                      plant—wide seniority; the retention of
 pay rates after transfer to a position
                                          that provides a lower pay rate than
 the previous position; the establishment of goals for
                                                         minority representa-
 tion in trade and craft jobs; and a back pay settlement.
                                                              The analysis of
 these provisions reveals two
                               related points. Black representation in trade
and craft jobs increased in
                              the four year period after the Decree, with an
indication that the increase was greater than pre—1974
                                                          employment trends
would have predicted.

that underutilization of blacks in these positions still
                                                           persists.

         The production workforce in the basic
                                                  steel industry totaled
 530,000 employees in 1974, so that when,
                                             on April 15, 1974, the United
 Steelworkers of America and nine
                                    companies in the industry entered into 'a
 Consent Decree with the United States
                                          as represented by the Attorney
 General's Office, the Department of
                                       Justice, the Secretary of Labor, the
 Office of Federal Contract Compliance
                                          (OFCC), and the Equal Employment

 Opportunity Commission (EEOC), the employment practices of a key segment of

 the United States manufacturing sector
                                          were affected. The nature of' the
 basic steel industry, the nature of the actors involved, the historical

 relationship of these principal actors, the economic climate and general

 timing of the negotiations are factors specific to the case of the Steel

Consent Decree that helped to determine the unique process and outcome

embodied in the Decree.

        Consent decrees had been emerging since the time of the American

Telephone and Telegraph Consent Decree as a method for parties to form the

substance and implementation mechanisms of the equal employment opportunity

policies with which they would live. Many
                                              consent decrees, particularly
those involving white—collar jobs, were negotiated in settings without

unions. In cases in which employee organizations
                                                     were present, their
role tended to be limited. In the steel case, not only was the United

Steelworkers of America (USWA) a principal actor, but it instigated the

process. The USWA was also a union operating in a
                                                     multiemployer setting.
The relationship between the USWA and the array of employers had reached

a stage of maturity in which collective bargaining
                                                     was being governed
for the first time by the Experimental
                                         Negotiating Agreement (ENA). The
negotiations of the Decree coincided with the initial ENA collective bar-

gaining negotiations. Furthermore, through the early l970s, the steel

industry was a contracting industry hard pressed by increased
                                       —2—



competition from imports, by a general economic recession, and by the com--

pounding problems of extensive new capital investment to modernize the

domestic steel production process. All such environmental factors which

helped to determine the process, as well as the outcome, of the Decree

deserve attention in an analysis of the steel industry's consent decree.

Moreover, employment policies in this key manufacturing sector impact on

other sectors, so that an analysis of the Decree should be mindful of such

spillovers.

       Specifically, this paper is divided into four sections. Section I

describes the setting in which the actors caine to negotiate the Decree.

This section will consider the following categories of environmental fac-

tors: the demographics of employment, the economic environment of the indus-

try, the environment described by pre—existing litigation, and other poli-

tical and positioning considerations of the parties. Section II describes

the principal terms and features of the Consent Decree. For the substantive

features of the Decree, there is an analysis of the impact of each feature

on employment outcomes in the steel industry in Section III. In the final

section, broader impacts of the Steel Consent Decree are indicated ——

specifically   the spillover of the Steel Decree's terms to the aluminum

industry.

  I. The Setting for Negotiations


 p1oyment Trends in Basic Steel

         One factor shaping the perceptions of
                                               employer and employee repre-
 sentatives in the period leading up to the formulation of the Consent

 Decree was the size and distribution of the minority
                                                           workforce within the
 steel industry's total workforce. The larger the percentage of minorities,

 and the more unequal the distribution of
                                                minorities between positiOns
 affording different economic opportunities, the
                                                      greater the effort one
 would expect from the minorities within the USWA to move the union to ad-

 dress the issues of equal employment
                                        opportunity. In this section, such
 employment trends in the steel industry are
                                                  considered for the decade
 preceeding the Consent Decree.

        Table 1 presents employment changes in the steel industry workforce
 form 1966—74.   In 1966, one observes the basic pattern of employment that

 the Consent Decree would ultimately be
                                             designed to change. Out of a work—
force of 798,556 employees, 14.26% or 113,860 were black.        This black

workforce was heavily concentrated in blue—collar occupations, and within

the blue—collar occupations, black employees show a higher representation

in lower skilled jobs. Of all craftsmen in 1966, 6.31% were black, as com-

pared to 20.28% of all operatives and 28.19% of all unskilled laborers.

       However, the trends over the next eight years, presented in Table 1,

do not show movement toward greater
                                      inequality in this employment distri-

bution. Industry employment fluctuated over this eight year period with an

overall downward trend. Within this relatively unstable employment frame-

work, black representat ion in all major
                                             occupational categories is very
stable. Black employment in the industry increases slightly from 14.26%

in 1966 to 14.82% in 1974, while total employment fell from 798,556 to

  699,245 over the same period. Black
                                         representation in white—collar jobs
 shows modest increases through the
                                      period, while in blue—collar Positions
 there is little fluctuation. Throughout
                                             this time, blacks are relatively

 underrepresented in white—collar jobs and in trade and craft jobs within

 blue—collar occupations. Despite a slight upward trend in black represen-

 tation in trade and craft Positions, in
                                            1974, the year of the Consent De-
 cree, black representation in these positions is only 42% of their repre-

 sentation in the blue—collar workforce.

        Although one does not observe any trend toward
                                                         greater inequality
 in the occupational distribution by race
                                             over these eight years, the pat-
 tern of underrepresentatjon of blacks in trade and craft and white—collar

 occupations persisted over time. The persistence of this
                                                             pattern formed
 the basis for complaints in litigation in the
                                                 steel industry that ultimate—
ly brought on the negotiations over Consent
                                               Decree I which governed the

distribution of minorities across production and maintenance occupations

and Consent Decree II which addressed the issue of
                                                      minority employment
opportunities in white—collar jobs.



The Economic Environment of the Steel Industry

       Even with gains in industry employment in 1973 and 1974, employment

in basic steel decreases by nearly 100,000
                                              employees from 1966 to the year
of the Consent Decree. This general employment decline is consistent with

the decline in the competitive position of
                                             the United States basic steel

industry. Such a position would reinforce the companies' interest in a—

voiding costly settlements of discrimination charges.
                                                         Furthermore, an
effective remedy of the inequality of
                                        employment opportunity would neces-
sarily have to consider any business contraction which would translate into

contracting employment.
                                 —6—



      Figures presented in Table 2 describe business trends in the steel

industry in the period prior to the Consent Decree. From 1960 to 1970,
                                                                    1/
profits as a percent of sales declined steadily from 5.8% to 2.6%, with

increases in profitability in 1973 and 1974. Comparatively modern

steel production processes abroad also hurt the competitve position of the

United States steel industry in the world market. Steel imports increased

steadily over the decade, accounting for 4.7% of domestic consumption in
                                                        2/
1960. In 1968, the percentage had increased to 16.7%.

      Furthermore, the problems confronting the steel industry during the

business contraction of the early 1970s were compounded by extensive capital

investment projects to replace obsolete and energy inefficient production

equipment. In 1970, $1.73 billion of new capital investment was undertaken
                             3/                                        4/
in the basic steel industry.    In 1975, the figure was $3.71 billion.

       Imports of steel and industry employment and profitability point con-

sistently to contraction in the basic steel industry through the 1960s and

early 1970s. However, statistics for 1973 and 1974 just as consistently in-

dicate expansion of the industry. The protracted period of contraction may

well have been a factor that heightened industry's interest to avoid costly

litigious proceedings concerning employment opportunity in the industry, yet

the 1973—74 upturn in the industry may have presented negotiators of the

Decree with brighter prospects for the industry. One representative of

the USWA familiar with the negotiation of the Steel Consent Decree felt that

the long—term declining position of the industry was not an important or
                                                         5/
explicit consideration in the negotiation of the Decree.      The improving

position of the industry in 1973 and 1974 may have partly been responsible

for this perspective, yet a mechanism that would effectively address the

issues of minority employment opportunity required a design which

recognized long—term industry contraction and the accompanying employment

contraction which basic steel was to face through the remainder of the

1970s. The Decree's design and its effectiveness in light of this indus-

try situation are discussed in the following sections.



A Background of Litigation

         The environment as described by the employment and industry trends

set the framework within which the USWA, the steel companies and the govern-

ment would operate. More specifically, it was the litigation brought under
                    I

Title   VII and Executive Order 11246 which provided the catalyst that brought

the parties to negotiate over the industry's basic seniority/employment

opportunity practices. The steel industry had been confronted with issues

concerning the possible discriminatory effects of seniority systems in place

at various plants in several cases over a long history. The decisions on

this issue are divided into two distinct groups by the Second Court of Appeals

decision in United States v. Bethlehem Steel Corporation (Lackawanna Plant)

in June 1971. The set of decisions prior to this appeals court deci-

sion did not provide for any seniority "carryover" or "rate retention" and

generally did not threaten any plant's seniority system. These decisions

include itfie1d v. United Steelworkers of America, Local 2708 (l958);6/

Federal District Court decisions in United States v. H.K. Porter (l968)'

and the United States v. Bethlehem Steel Corporation (Lackawanna Plant)

(1970);8I and In the Matter of Bethlehem Steel CorDoration (Sparrows Point

Plant) OFCC Docket #102—68 (1970), The second set of cases reversed

the trend set by the early decisions, and threatened seniority systems

in place by providing for remedies of rate retention and seniority

carryover generally for the affected class of minority employees. These
                                       —9—



 cases include the Court of Appeals decision in United States v, Bethlehem

 Steel Corporation (Lackawanna Plant) (1971),lO/ In the Matter of Bethlehem

 Steel Corporation (Sparrows Point Plant) (l973),l and the District Court

 decision in United States V.   United States Steel Corporation (Fairfield
Plant) (1973).12/

        The first case to address the possible inequalities inherent in a

steel seniority system was Whitfield v. United Steel Workers of America,

Local 2708 (1958). Before the Fifth Circuit prior to Title VII in 1958,

the court left the seniority system at the Arnico Steel Corporation's plant

in Houston, Texas unaltered, stating that when ".. .a large company substi-

tutes a program of equal job opportunity for previous discriminatory

practices.. .it is impossible to place Negro incumbents holding certain jobs,

especially unskilled jobs, on absolutely equal footing with white incumbents

in skilled jobs." The court      .   .attach{edj   particular importance to the

good faith effort of the parties in working toward a fair solution. .        .The

Union and the Company. . .have a contract that from now on is free from any

discrimination based on race. Angels could do no more.             As this

language indicates, the Whitfield opinion focusses on how fairly the com-

pany and union represent the interests of minority employees. Court

opinions for cases heard after the enactment of Title VII would

require language that would encompass both the duty of fair representation

and the provisions of the equal opportunity legislation.

       Following Whitfield is the array of cases brought under Title VII

and Executive Order 11246. The case responsible for the first decision

under this legislation on these seniority—based issues was United States

v. H.K. Porter Company (1968) heard in the northern district of Alabama.

Despite the fact that the departmental seniority system in Porter helped
                                 — 10—




to maintain inequalities in the racial compositions of departments, the

trial court rejected the government's arguments for a remedy of the

institution of a plant—wide seniority system. Rather, the court found that

skills, training, and hazards differed significantly from job—to—job, and

it would therefore be inappropriate to assume:

          that the employees in this steel mill are in no danger
       of injury from the performance of the jobs around them
                                                              by14,
       employees with less than the full amount of experience...

       As the appeals process began in Porter, United States v. Bethlehem

Steel Corporation (Lackawanna Plant) (1970) was brought under Title VII in

the western district of New York and a hearing panel was established In The

Matter of Bethlehem Steel Corporation (Sparrows Point Plant) (1970) under

Executive Order 11246. Both cases involved larger steel plants than in

the Porter case (1968), and thereby were more typical of steel mill opera-

tions. In the Lackawanna (1970) case, the government again sought a

revamping of a department—wide seniority system which helped maintain a

system in which 83% of all black employees were concentrated in eleven of

the company's eighty—two departmentsl5/ by allowing blacks employed in

these eleven departments to transfer with rate retention and without loss

of seniority privileges.

       The trial court rejected the government's argument here as well.

Among the reasons for the court upholding the department—wide system were:

       (1) that the eleven departments in question were by no means

exclusively black departments, with two—thirds of the employees white;

       (2) that the earnings of blacks in these departments were 96.7%

of the average hourly earnings of all plant employees, despite greater

seniority of white employees throughout the plant;

       (3) that these eleven departments provided more stable employment
                                  —11—



 subject to fewer cyclical layoffs;

        (4) that the level of transfers was significant under the existing

 seniority system without rate retention and carryover;

        (5) that the company had in place a system to cure the racial

 imbalance in representation in departments;

        (6) and that the government's remedy was fraught with potential dis—

ruptive effects on incentive pay programs, the job classification scheme,

and expectations for promotion of employees outside the "affected' class.161

       The affirmation of the department—based
                                                 seniority system was miti-
gated by the trial court's granting of preferential transfer
                                                                rights to
employees (white as well as black) in the eleven departments based on plant

seniority, but without rate retention or seniority carryover•

       Following on the Lackawanna (1970) decision, a hearing panel for the

Office of Federal Contract Compliance's case, In the Matter of Bethlehem

Steel Corporation (Sparrows Point Plant) (1970) followed the trend of the

previous cases, rejecting the need for any remedies, much less remedies with

rate retention or carryover. The decision of the hearing panel stressed, in

much the same fashion as did the trial court in Porter
                                                          (1968), the business

necessity for the existing system in the steel industry setting.

       The decisions consistently left in place the department—wide senior-

ity systems in each case. As the appeal process continued for this set of

cases, the consistent trend of the trial courts and the OFCC case hearing

panel would be reversed. In June of 1971, the Second Circuit Court of Ap-

peals reversed both the trial court in Lackawanna (1970) and the trend of

decisions on such seniority issues. The fact -that the departmental segrega-

tion did not impact greatly on earnings did not convince the Second Circuit

that the affected class of minorities should therefore not be given special
                                   —12—



consideration in future transfers. As for the effect on promotion expecta-

tions of those in the non—affected class, the appeals court posited that

those "hopes arise from an illegal system," and further that "if relief

under Title VII can be denied merely because the majority group of employees,

who have not suffered discrimination, will be unhappy about it, there is

little hope of correcting the wrongs to which the Act is directed.l7/

The Appeals Court felt the trial court "put it backwards" in denying relief

because the existing system did not deter all transfers. The criterion of

the Appeals Court was "what would be necessary to insure sufficient incen-

tive to transfer so that the effects of past discrimination could not be

               ,,181
perpetuated.

          In connection with this line of argument, the Second Circuit granted

seniority carryover and rate retention for members of the affected class and

removed the special transfer privileges of white employees in the eleven

departments. The "black only" or affected class only approach was to be

a strong catalyst in moving the USWA to adopt the Consent Decree approach

of addressing these issues.

          In Januray of 1973, after review of the hearing panel's recoinmen—

dations, the Secretary of Labor, James Hodgson, ignored the panel's recom-

mendations in his decision on Sparrows Point, OFCC Docket #102—68. Secre-

tary Hodgson "framed a remedy which is consistent with the evidence and the

relevant court decisions, particularly relying on the Second Circuit Court
                                               19 /
of   Appeals in United States v. Bethlehem."

          As the trend in decisions was being reversed, a case involving the

seniority system of the large Fairfield plant of the United States Steel

Corporation was pending in the northern district of Alabama. Wishing to

settle Fairfield out of court, the USWA and the government representatives
                                   —13—



urged the Fifth Circuit to deliver a decision on the appeal of Porter (1968),

still awaiting a hearing. A Fairfield settlement could then be reached

based on the guidelines that the Fifth Circuit would prescribe in Porter.20/

No decision was forthcoming, and so the Fairfield case was heard in the

northern district of Alabama over several months in 1973, "with more than

10,000 pages of testimony, and over ten feet of stipulations and exhibit."2

Judge Pointer's decision would form the basis of the substance eventually

embodied in the Steel Consent Decree.

       Pointer's decision partially adopted the government's request for

a remedy involving rate retention and carryover. But seeking an "even-

handed" approach, the provision that plant seniority would govern promo-

tions, layoffs, and other areas would apply to all employees in the plant.

Rate retention applied to those minorities that were included within the

definition of affected Fairfield employees. Pointer's decision was the

last deicison to have a significant impact on the seniority discrimination

issue. The decision in the Porter (1968) appeal would be based upon a

stipulation of the parties in 1974.



Other Positioning Considerations

       With the trend in key cases modifying seniority systems with "black—

only" remedies, and with the Fairfield decision presenting a middle—ground

remedy, potential benefits of negotiation of the Consent Decree now existed.

In review of the development of this environment conducive to negotiation,

three specific factors moved the USWA to promote negotiation. The trend

in decisions toward remedies providing for black only modifications to

seniority systems, the USWA felt, would create undesirable fragmentation

within their membership, and other disruptions at the plant level. Second,
                                —14—



the USWA had advocated plant—wide seniority for some time, but left the

determination of the system to the discretion of locally autonomous bar-

gaining. Finally, the cases that were being decided were but a fraction

of all cases involving seniority and equal employment opportunity in basic

steel. According to one company representative, the ability of the com-

panies, the USWA, and the government representatives to avoid the

escalating costs associated with a plant—by—plant approach to seniority

remedies was the principal factor which motivated these parties to adopt

an industry—wide solution.22/

        Beyond these specific reasons that made the time right for the

Consent Decree, the declining condition of the industry was a broader

environmental factor that made it more desirable to avoid court cases and

settlements that would be costly to the industry. This was particularly

important, since, even after Fairfield, industry representatives felt

they could win appeals of the decisions and win decisions in upcoming cases
                                                                          23/
on grounds of "business necessity," as in the H.K. Porter case of 1968.

Industry conditions would not allow the company representatives the lux-

ury of overlooking less costly approaches to the issue.   Also pointed out,

the general employment picture did not indicate any easing of the problems

as blacks, from 1963 to 1974, were still by and large segregated out of

trade and craft occupations.

        One final consideration in the development of the environment

necessary to allow negotiation of the Consent Decree was the well—developed

bargaining relationship of the USWA and industry representatives. In 1974,

the basic collective bargaining agreement was expiring and to be replaced

by a successor agreement negotiated for the first time under the Experi-

mental Negotiating Agreement (ENA). Parties had planned on taking advan—
                                 —15—



tage of the opportunity of memorializing the negotiated settlement of the

seniority/employment opportunity issues in the collective bargaining agree-

ment. Once it was decided to include the result of these
                                                             negotiations in

the collective bargaining agreement, timing of ENA negotiations put pres-

sure on the parties to reach agreement by the expiration date of the

previous collective bargaining agreement. If issues on the Consent Decre

were left unresolved, the parties were fearful that such issues would be
                                                    24/
subject to the decision of a third party arbitrator,      since under the
ENA any issue of successor collective bargaining agreement unresolved by

the bargaining deadline was to be decided by an arbitrator.     Furthermore,
the USWA Executive Board felt the seniority issues could even threaten

the ENA procedure itself:

        It would be unwise to subject that negotiating procedure
        [ENA] to the stress of reforming seniority. The success
        of the new procedure will depend heavily upon the effec-
        tiveness with which it meets our [USWA's] members needs
        in 1974. If the seniority issue were to be handled under
        the new procedure, the resulting tensions could seriously
        threaten the ENA. 25/

        The economic and employment settings in the basic steel industry

came together with the trend of legal decisions on seniority systems' dis-

criminatory impact in such a way that it was of mutual interest to the USWA,

the steel companies, and government representatives to negotiate an industry—

wide solution to the problem. Pressure to address the issue was also brought

to bear on the negotiations by the bargaining deadline of the industry's col-

lective bargaining agreement.



II. The Provisions of the Consent Decree —— Consent Decree I

       Once parties decided to address the seniority system and discrimin-

ation issues in negotiation, the remedies focused on a concept that had
                                —16—




been inherent in debates on civil rights issues since the late l950s,

the concept of "rightful place." Under this doctrine, the remedy devised

would have to concern itself with the fact that seniority systems in plants

throughout the industry had denied blacks and other minorities their right-

ful place in terms of occupation, earnings and future job opportunities.

This doctrine can be applied in two ways. Retrospectively, how would a

remedy address the fact that minorities had been denied their rightful place

over past years and thereby been on lower earning paths for a significant

part of their careers? Prospectively, how would the Consent Decree alter

the seniority provisions in plants across the country to permit minorities

to reach their rightful occupational and earnings levels. This section

describes the remedies prescribed for the steel industry in Consent Decree

I; that is, the part of the Consent Decree package that considered the

situation of the production and maintenance workforce in basic steel (Consent

Decree II will not be directly addressed in this discussion, as the negotia-

tion of Decree II did not involve the USWA. Decree II altered employment

practices in white—collar positions and in hiring practices. Generally,

Decreee II, formulated after Decree I had been settled, followed the outline

of Decree I in form and substance.)    More specifically, the basic features

of Consent Decree I were: the establishment of a mechanism to implement the

Decree; the uniform institution of plant—wide seniority; the particular

application of plant continuous service for transfer opportunities; the

retention of pay rates, or "red circling't when transferring if the new

positions's rate of pay was lower than the rate at the former position;

the establishment of trade and craft goals for minority representation;

and a back pay settlement. For the provisions which altered employment

practices and relationships among employees, the impact of the provision
                                        —17-



 in the first four years of the Decree, from 1974—78, will be analyzed in

 Section III.




 The Implementation Mechanism

         Because of the familiarity with the steel industry achieved by

 Judge Pointer from the lengthy Fairfield hearing, the government asked

 Pointer to be the judge to enter the Consent Decree. The first of three

 levels of the mechanism for implementing the Decree was thereby estab-

 lished. The District Court of Northern Alabama would maintain
                                                                 jurisdic-
 tion over the Decree, its substance as well as implementation, for a

 period of at least five years from the date of the Decree.

         At a second level, and coordinating the implementation activity at

 all plants covered by the Decree, is the Audit and Review Committee. The

 A&R Committee was a continuation of the Seniority Study Committee of the

 Coordinating Committee of Steel Companies and the United Steelworkers of

 America. To this Seniority Study Committee the government added a repre-

 sentative to form the A&R Committee. The Decree sets out four broad

 responsibilities for the A&R Committee:


        (1) oversee the implementation of and compliance with the Consent

Decree at the plant level;

        (2) take up the resolution matters that remain in dispute at the

plant level;

        (3) begin a review of the experience under the Decree no later

than December 31, 1975 with regard to transfer opportunities and records,

achievement of trade and craft goals, and related matters;

        (4) bring to the District Court any issue which it is unable to
                                  26/
resolve or clarify on its owii.
                                  —18—



        The lowest tier of the mechanism is occupied by    plant—level   Imple—

mentation Committees. The role of these committees a defined in the

Decree is to:

           (1) take the functional steps necessary to assure compliance with

trade and craft goals, timetables, and implementation ratios;

           (2) provide information to plant employees;

           (3) consider grievances which are Decree related' (other grie-

vances are to be handled by the pre—existing grievance machinery);

           (4) be available to employees at convenient hours.27/

This self—enforcing monitoring mechanism benefits from the knowledge and

experience of the TJSWA and the companies with these issues. Furthermore,

the provision for evaluation built a legitimizing influence into the

process.



The Institution of Plant—Wide Seniority

        At the heart of the Decree is Section 4(a) which provides in part:

        plant continuous service. . . shall be used.., for all
        purposes in which a measure of continuous service
        is presently being utilized [under the contract.] 28/

Plant service date would be the ruling criterion in selection of employees

for promotion, transfer, layoff and recall. Furthermore, in contracts

which provide for use of seniority in such matters as vacation selection,

overtime allocation, and shift scheduling, plant continuous service governs

the selection. This section specifically forbids "leap—frogging or a

reshuffling of the relative positions of employees at the time of the Decree;

rather it is a prospective remedy applying to future job vacancies or

closings. As the Consent Decree is further described, the experience under

the first four years of the Decree will be analyzed in considering the effec—
                                   —19—




 tiveness of this prospective remedy, particularly in the area of transfers

 and the achievement of equality in minority representation in trade and

 craft positions.



 Trans fers

          An important distinction to be made on the transfer according tr

 plant   service aspects of the remedy is that the Consent Decree does not

 alter lines of progression within departmental units. In this way, a

permanent vacancy within a department will be filled from below within a

department. Once employees fill the chain of vacancies within a depart-

ment, an entry level vacancy occurs. This resultant opening is then

filled on the basis of plant Continuous service. To promote transfer

within these limitations, the Decree provides for criteria governing dis-

tribution of the information Concerning job openings, for the availability

of training opportunities, and for a forty—five day trial period during

which an employee who transfers may return to his old position.



Rate Retention

          The notion of rate retention is a feature of the Decree intended

to promote transfers. Any employee whose plant service date predates

January 1, 1968, whether the employee is a member of the "affected class"

or not, will receive upon transfer the rate of the new job or the rate of

his previous position (based on an average of pay rates from the last sev-

eral pay periods prior to transfer) whichever is greater. The rate re-

tention feature applies for a two year period, with each
                                                           eligible employee
allowed two transfers with rate retention.
                                    —20—




 Trade and Craft Goals

           The Audit and Review Committee is instructed to carry Out an analysis

 of the utilization of blacks and other minorities in trade and craft occu-

 pations in plants covered by the Consent Decree. This analysis is to identi-

 fy whether minorities are underutilized in various groups of trade and craft

 occupations. Where it is identified that "underutilization" exists, goals

 and timetables are to be formulated to move employment toward the standards

 developed in the Decree. A fifty percent implementation rate is established

 by the Decree, so that where underutilization exists, one—half of entry

 level vacancies which occur are to be made available to minorities. Under-

 utilization is generally decided on the goal of having minority representa-

 tion in trade and craft positions equal to the minority representations in

 the plant as a whole.




Back Pay

           The above provisions of Consent Decree I are primarily forward

looking, addressing the prospective "rightful place" notion; that is, how

were minorities to be given the, opportunity to attain a representative po-

sition within the economic system of the basic steel industry. However,

inherent in the forward looking remedies is the understanding that minori-

ties had been denied their rightful place in that system for past years

due to a seniority system which locked employees into relative positions

determined partially by past discrimination. The back pay provision of

Consent Decree I specifically recognizes the past discrimination and the

loss of economic opportunity due to that discrimination. Negotiations led

to the establishement of a $35 million fund from which "affected class em-

ployees" would be able to claim back pay. However, toward the end of the
                                   —21—



  process, the Inland Steel Company withdrew from the
                                                         negotiations and final
  settlement to reduce the total number of
                                              companies involved from ten to
  nine. Since Inland is basically a single

 III. Living with the Consent Decree —— An
                                           Analysis of Impact

       All of the provisions of Consent Decree I come together with the

stagnant economic environment of the steel industry of the mid—1970s to

create a particular set of incentives and
                                            opportunities for production
and maintenance (P&M) employees in the
                                         industry. This specific set of in-
centives and opportunities determine how
                                           quickly the industry would realize
the employment goals of the Decree, if at all. In this section, the
                                                                       experi-
ence of the industry in changing employment
                                              patterns, specific resolutions of
back pay issues, and other issues related to Consent Decree I
                                                              are anlyzed.



Minority Representation in Trade and Craft Occupations

        At the center of the Decree as well
                                              as the prior litigation was the

underrepresentation of minorities in trade and craft positions in the indus-

try. Here, the changing patterns of representation of the black workforce

in trade and craft positions is analyzed. The method for the analysis is

based on the Chi—square test. For 103 plants in 1974 and 124 plants in 1978,

data on the number of blacks and non—blacks in trade and craft positions and

non—trade and craft positions are compared to the expected number of blacks

and non—blacks in those positions. The expected number is calculated based on

the Decree's goal that minorities should be represented in trade and craft

positions in the same proportion as their representation in the plant as a

whole. In addition to the Chi—square analysis, the deviation of the expec-

ted number of blacks in trade and craft positions from the actual number is
              30 /
calculated.          This deviation is standardized according to the binomial

standard deviation formula,            NP(l—P), where:

                         N =   total number of black and white
                               trade and craft employees,

                         P     percentage of all black and white
                               production and maintenance emplo-
                               yees that are black.


      Before results of the analysis are presented, certain factors inher-

ent in the employment situation should be noted. Since expected represen-

tation figures are based on current percentages of minorities within plants,

it will become more (less) difficult for a given plant to realize the goal of

equal representation in trade and craft positions should minorities gain

(lose) in plant—wide representation from 1974 to 1978. Table 3 illustrates

this point. Although industry totals show a very stable minority represen-

tation in the P&M workforce with an increase of 0.41 percentage points in

minority representation, plants of certain companies show more marked changes.

Specifically, certain plants of the Armco Steel Corporation are expected to

have a more difficult task in equalizing representation in trade and craft

jobs as minority representation at Armco plants increased 5.85%. The

opposite is expected to hold for the Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation

and the National Steel Corporation.

           Summary statistics indicate the general situation in regards to black

representation in the steel industry. In 1974, in 106 plants blacks held

3824 of the 42,221 trade and craft positions. Based on the proportion of

blacks in the total P&M workforce, blacks would have been expected to hold

10,163 of these craft jobs. This deviation is represented by a Chi—square

statistic of 6223.1, significant at well above the .001 level, while the

expected black representation in craft jobs is 68.75 standard deviations off

the acutal. (The size of this industry—wide deviation should be thought of

as a curnmulative account, not an average of underutilization in individual

plants.)

           The 1978 figures show movement toward equalizing the distributions of

black employees across the P&N workforce; however, the inequality is still

very evident. Blacks held 4949 of the 40,348 craft positions, whereas they
were expected to hold 10,215 of these positions. This fact is sunutarized by

a Chi—square statistic of 4358.9, while the actual number of blacks in trade

and craft jobs is a slightly lower but still significant 57.08 standard devia-

tions from the expected.

       Aside from asking whether Consent Decree I realized the goal of

equalizing the racial composition across blue—collar occupations, a different

question in gauging the industry impact of Consent Decree I is: to what de-

gree is the employment distribution in trade and craft positions different

from what it would have been in the absence of the Decree? Ideally, one would

apply characteristics of individual employees at each plant to seniority rules

as they were prior to the Decree, and compare that outcome to the actual out—

          All projected trends fall short of the     actual   increases in bldk
  representation   in trade and craft jobs from
                                                  1975 to 1978. From the actual
  employment trend it appears that
                                      the Consent Decree had its
                                                                   largest impact
  from 1974 to 1975. Due to the lack of data from EE0—l
                                                         forms for 1976 and
  1977, annual changes in minority
                                   representation cannot be tracked from
  1975 to 1978. However, the
                                average annual increase over this three year
  period is comparable to the
                              average increases yielded by the three projec—
 tions. The projections yield the
                                    following average percentage point increases
 for 1975 to 1978
                  respectively: 0.27%, 0.18%, 0.15%, while the actual increase
 after 1975 in black representation is 0.23%.

         Industry data from the A&R Committee
                                                  and from EEO—l Forms show move-
 ment toward equality in the racial
                                       composition of blue—collar workforce a—
 cross occupational categories, with
                                        some evidence supporting the claim that
 this movement was more rapid than
                                      it might have been in the absence of
 Consent Decree I. Although the
                                    movement is toward equality, the racial dis-
 tribution in 1978 is one of
                                inequality. These two facts are also evident
 in the analysis of data on the plant level. Figure 2 shows
                                                            the distribution

of standard deviations of
                            expeced black representation in
                                                                craft jobs from
actual for the plants in 1974
                                 and 1978. A plant in which blacks are repre-
sented in trade and craft positions in the exact
                                                    proportion as they are in
that plant's total P&M workforce will be represented
                                                        by a standard deviation
of zero in the distribution.
                                 Any plant in which the eected number of
blacks in craft jobs is
                          greater than the actual number will
                                                                 be represented
by a positive standard deviation.

        From inspection of the 1974 distribution the underutilization
                                                                      of
blacks in plants is
                    immediately obvious. Virtually all of the 103 plants
show an underutilization of
                            blacks. Any standard deviation greater than

                               Standard Deviations Away From the   Expectation

  1.645 indicates a deviation of expected from actual representation that
                                                                              is
  significant at the .05 level. For 1974, the mean of the deviations is 5.07,

 the median is 3.12. Approximately 82% of the plants have significant devi-

 ations from expected representations.

           For 1978, after four years under Consent Decree I, one sees from

 inspection a shift in the distribution of standard deviations to the left,'

 consistent with the industry—wide trend. The mean and median of the 1978

 distribution are 3.75 and 2.12 respectively, both still
                                                            significanly posi-
 tive. Approximately 56% of all plants in 1978 continue to show significant

 underutilization of blacks in trade and craft positions.    Blacks have gained
 in their representation in trade and craft positions. However, one cannot

 say that blacks have attained their "rightful place" after four
                                                                   years.
           Figures 3a—e and 4a—e are histograms showing the geographic break-

 down of these overall distributions according to a geographic classification

 of   plants described by Richard L. Rowan in The Negro in the Steel Industry.
                                                                                 34 /



 In both years, the Great Lakes Midwestern region accounts for a substantial

 proportion of the underutilization of blacks in craft jobs. The mean of the

Midwest distribution is 2.8 units and 2.0 units greater than the mean of

the industry—wide distribution in 1974 and 1978
                                                  respectively. However,
the mean of the Midwest distribution also shows the
                                                      greatest percentage
decrease over the four year period.

          Further investigating the nature of underutilization of blacks

in trade and craft positions, the analysis turns to the investigation of

underutilization of blacks in the six broad classifications of trade and

craft positions defined by the industry's Audit and Review Committee. These

craft categories are electrical, metalworks,
                                               machinist, moulder, bricklayer,
and millwright. Table 4 shows the changes in employment by race for each of

                                           that black employment in these classes
   for all regions increases.

  it does not decrease as
                             quickly as does the white employment.

in the industry. The
                      bricklayer grouping shows a movement away from the
expected black representation
                              over these four years, while
                                                           electricians
and millwrights show the
                         largest discrepancy between eected and actual
representation for blacks.




       Exjenc Under Consent Decree I for Non—Trade and Craft Positions
        Black representation in trade and craft Positions shows
                                                                movement toward
the expected representation.
                              Still, by 1978, whether at the
                                                             plant level, by
region or by specific craft grouping, blacks were "underutilizedn
                                                                    Trade

with the terms of Consent Decree I, while the implementation ratio of 5O/

continued in effect. bat was the specific experience with regards to trans-

fers in the industry in the early years of the Decree, and how did employees

react to the incentives contained in the Decree? Thereas, the previous

analysis shows how transfer activity into trade and craft jobs has operated

over the first four years of the Decree, this section will concern itself

with transfer activity between non—trade and craft jobs.

        In a report filed with the United States District Court in the

Northern District of Alabama, the Audit and Review Committee examines the

experience under the first two years of the Decree. Table 5 summarizes

this transfer activity.

        Among males, transfer activity is relatively equal for all races

while white males make somewhat greater use of the voluntary return ex-

perience. Females, particularly black females, make relatively greater use

of the transfer experience; however, females still make up only 3.2 of the

P&M workforce.


        In this same report, the Audit and Review Committee makes another

point: although the transfer prvisions were designed to allow employees

to select more desirable positions, the experience of the first two years

demonstrates that younger employees benefited most from the system. Transfer

systems, depending on the size and logistics of plants, are either two or

three stage processes. No matter what the system design, or the race or

sex of the employees, younger employees (those with less than five years of

service) accounted for over half of all transfers as shown in Table 6.

Voluntary returners also were accounted for primarily by younger employees.

Among the reasons employees gave for using the 45—day return option, the

most common was that the new position did not meet expectations in terma of

 (d) temporary and permanent promotional opportunities, or (e) general working

 conditions."         Other reasons include using the option to call attention

 to other grievances, to improve short—term earnings due to brief periods of

 overtime opportunities in specific departments or to obtain better seasonal

working conditions. Based on these latter reasons, the Audit and Review

 Committee altered the Decree, with the courts' approval, to prohibit an

 employee from transferring for a six month period after using the 45-day re—
                36/
 turn option.




Benefits   Conferred   Under Rate Retention

        1ale employees with service predating 1968 and female employees in

the workforce on the effective date of Consent Decree I were eligible for

the rate retention option. The Audit and Review Committee's analysis of

the experience under this provision shows that 2555 employees made use of

rate retention through March 31, 1977. The Committee estimated that 13% of

all transferring employees benefited from the rate retention provision.

The breakdown of employees using this provision by race and sex is shown

in Table 7.




Back Pay Tenders

        The Consent Decree provides for a $250 minimum payment to any

employee in the affected class and general guidelines for the calculation

of actual payments. Table 8 summarizes the results by the Audit and Review

Committee. The $30,940,000 fund was so allocated to "affected class" em-

ployees, that an average payment of $660 was made. The unions' contribu—

tion to the $30,940,000 fund was $4,420,089.

           Finail:, the Audit and Review Committee compiled statistics showinp

the   acceptance rates of back pay tenders by company through December 1976.

Bethlehem Steel's experience shows the lowest acceptance rate of just under

90%, as opposed to approximately 97% for other companies. This rate was

attributable to that company's Lackawanna and Sparrow's Point plants, at

both of which private Title VII cases were pending, and at both of which

concerted efforts were made by the proponents of those suits to deter
                            37!
acceptance of tenders.            The complete set of acceptance rates is shown in

Table 9.     Indeed, a representative for the union familiar with the Consent

Decree's negotiation, expressed the view that those who were most vocal in

expressing disapproval with the terms of Consent Decree I were representa-

tives of organizations that would be deprived of fees from the "undermining
                          38/
of pending lawsuits."

           In connection with the back pay and rate retention provisions of

the Consent Decree, an understanding of the nature of the earnings differ-

entials between occupations is necessary. No specific information on the

steel industry wage bill by occupation is available. Furthermore, job

classes and working pay scales in the basic labor agreement do not

apply consistently to given occupations in plants across the country.

However, certain facts about pay rates are revealing. Trade and craft jobs

often al1 in classes 14 to 18 of the basic agreement which sets out a
                         39 /
total   of 34 classes.          Not rarely, operative positions, in which black

representation exceeded 20% through the l970s, are classified above these

mid—range positions. Furthermore, many non—trade and craft jobs offer in—
                                                                            40 /
centive   pay opportunities greater than those in trade and craft jobs.

Despite the focus of the Consent Decree on changing marked racial inequali-

ties in the occupational distribution, the industry minority—to—nonminority

that this ratio is not far from
                                    unity, transfers will not necessarily pro-

IV.   Impacts Outside of the Steel Indu
        Outside of the   impact   of the Steel Industry Consent Decree analyzed

here, the negotiation of this industry's equal employment opportunity policy

had an impact reaching well beyond the scope of the steel industry. As

mentioned previously, the terms of the Steel Consent Decree were included

as part of the terms of the industry's collective bargaining agreement.

Historically, the negotiations for the steel industry are visible and pat-

tern—setting. Most pronounced among such bargaining spillovers is the

relationship of basic steel with the aluminum industry. Jhat makes this

relationship particularly strong is the fact that the USWA is the principal

employee representative in both industries.

        As a result of this historical pattern the terms of the basic steel

Consent Decree were incorporated practically verbatim within the framework of

the aluminum industry's collective bargaining agreement. The legal setting

of the aluminum industry's equal employment policy did not directly involve

government or court participation. The policy was the product of collective

bargaining. This fact was eventaully to have a significant impact on future

processes of the determination of equal employment policies. Specifically,

with the array of litigation associated wit United States v. Brian Weber

taking place in the setting of the aluminum industry, an opinion with a

great impact on the scope of collective bargaining was put forth by the
                                            —5 (j..




Supreme Court. In this way, the Steel Industry Consent Decree was to have

an impact on industrial relations even beyond the implications for the

specific field of equal employment opportunity.



V. Conclusion

       The process of negotiation that produced the Consent Decree must in

the end be evaluated against the alternative that had been available to

minority employees —      litigation    conducted on a plant—by—plant basis. The

major steel companies and the USWA were able in the negotiation process to

bring their expertise to the issue of seniority reform more directly than

might have been possible under a process carried out in court; moreover,

once responsible for the outcome, these key actors in this employment

setting, together with the participating government representatives,

were in a position of defending that outcome. Although litigation might

have allowed for greater direct particination of minorities, the Consent

Decree negotiation helped to limit the costs involved in reaching a settle-

ment. Furthermore, under the Decree, a mechanism for self—enforcement and

evaluation of progress that would not have been possible under the litiga-

tion of individual cases was instituted.

       While the employment outcomes for the steel industry that might have

resulted from case—by—case litigation cannot be known, the experience of

the industry in the first four years of the Consent Decree I does reveal

two related points. Black representation in trade and craft jobs increased

over the period, particularly from 1974 to 1975, with an indication that

the increase was greater than pre—1974 employment trends would have

predicted. However, the 1978 black/white employment figures show that

extreme underutilization of blacks in these positions still exists. The
                                   -5-


lack of more rapid movement toward equality in the occupational distribu-

tion could be due to earnings differentials that do not always favor trade

and craft jobs or to a mechanism for changing the distribution that is

ineffective in the post—1974, contracting steel industry (after the brief

1973—74 upturn). To gauge the degree to which these or other factors are

responsible requires the analysis of more detailed data.
