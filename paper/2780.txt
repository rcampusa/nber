     Dbservers have often characterized asset markets as being subject to

periods of tranquility and periods of turbulence.     Until recently, however,

researchers were unable to produce closed-form asset pricing formulas in a

aodel environment of time-varying risk.    Some work by Abel provided us with

the insights needed to produce such formulas.    This paper gives an exposition

of how to develop the formulas in   an, environment where   the formulas may be

obtained using a simple extension of standard tools.

     While the paper is intended mainly as an exposition      of new work, it

also contains a report on the asset market effect of fiscal reform.       IC is

found that entering a period of week coordination between government      spending

end taxing (tax rate) policy is good for stock prices.

      The purpose of this paper is to provide an exposition in a familiar


setting of some new methods in asset pricing and to indicate some aspects

of the extension of these methods to the open economy. While the paper is

designed as an exposition of these new ideas, the fiscal policies studied

in Section III may be applicable to discussions of the asset-market

effects of recent U.S. fiscal policy efforts.

      The paper builds on some work by Andrew Abel (1986) on obtaining

closed-form asset pricing formulas for a model environment where agents

understand correctly that the nature of risk is time-varying.   j/   In

particular, Abel's work was the first that allowed time-varying dividend

riak and obtained explicit closed-form pricing formulas for a representa-

tive-agent asset-pricing model where agent preferences display constant

relative risk aversion.

      Researchers have often described asset markets as being characterized

by periods of turbulence and periods of tranquility. Before Abel's work,

however, we were unable to study explicitly agents' reactions to new

information about the riskiness of the asset pricing environment in a

framework of a well-specified time-series model of tranquility and tur-

bulence.   Indeed, typical in asset pricing work is the examination of

agents'   reactions to inconceivable once-and-for-all shifts in higher

moments.    These shifts are inconceivable because the models are solved



  /   Others who have adopted and extended the Able model include
Ciovannini (1987) and }Jodrick (1987) both of whom include money in their
models and can therefore price assets in nominal terms. In Appendix II,
some aspects of nominal asset pricing are discussed.

typically conditionally on the agents supposing that relevent higher

moments are assuredly constant through time.      Researchers then study the

effects of risk chsnges by changing moments (apparently forever) in a

pricing formula constructed under the assumption that such moments would

never change.     The asset market applicability of the study of such miracu-

lous events is unclear.

        If risk, in some sense, changes through time then one way to model

explicitly intertemporal variations in the risk environment is by making

rik     the outcome of a stochastic process.   The advantage to adopting an

explicit stochastic process for risk is that a stochastic process is

useful for separating shocks to the risk environment from predictable

changes in the risk environment. Since it is the agents' reactions to

their understanding of the time variation in risk that provides the link

between the risk environment and asset prices we should model carefully

the formation of agents' beliefs about the current and future riskiness of

their environment.

        Abel studies risk as a time-series process asauming representative

agents with rational expectations,   constant-relative-risk-aversionperiod

utility functions and assuming a particular functional form for

distribution functions generating the underlying shocks.     This paper will

study agents' reactions to shocks in the time-series process generating

their stochastic environment without assuming a representative agent and

without making particular functional form distributional assumptions.      In

fact,    in this model the stochastic environment enters the rational

expectations problem in a very familiar way and obtaining explicit closed-
                                   -3-


form solutions requires only a minor extension of the now well-know method

of linear undetetermined coefficients.

     In order to simplify the analysis some of Able's assumptions are

           For clarity, the simplest assumption set has been chosen.      In
changed.

making the assumption substitutions, however, a possibly important aspect

of decision making may be lost.   In particular,   it is assumed that time-

separable quadratic preferences are capable of capturing adequately the

consumption-saving decision facing agents.   Given this approximation it is

simple to obtain closed-form asset pricing functions for a wide range of

distribution functions for the exogenous variables without assuming that

individual agents are very similar aside from the functional form of

preferences. While the quadratic preferences assumption buys a lot of

simplicity it also coats something in terms of a possibly important dimen-

sion of risk aversion.   With quadratic period utility, agents are risk

averse with respect the risks involving the returns on their asset holding

but they are risk neutral with respect to the riskiness of the underlying

environment. Quadratic preferences induce linearity in the second moments

(or variancea) of returns.   This linearity is the source of much of the

simplicity of the present approach.

     The paper is divided into four additional sections.     In Section II

the basic asset pricing model is developed for an infinitely lived

representative agent inhabiting a world with time-varying risk.     Two

simple experi- menta ("warm-upa") are conducted in this section to

familiarize the reader with the asset-price solution algorithm. The warm-

ups are chosen to illustrate simply environments that might be encountered

in practice. In the first example,    dividend risk moves exogenously and is
                                                   -4-


unconnected to any other aspect of market fundamentals.                   In the second

example the dividend risk is modelled as a function of past disturbances

to dividends.         In Section 1111 the model is subjected to two kinds of

fiscal policy experiments. The first fiscal experiment studies how fiscal

feedback policy (from the level of output) influences the asset market

impact of   a   shift in the riskiness of the environment. The second fiscal

experiment studies the asset market effect of entering a period of "fiscal

reform".    Section IV contains some concluding remarks.                 The text of the

paper is followed by three appendices,                  the firsc listing some text-

referenced coefficients,             the second discussing some issues concerning

nominal asset pricing and the third explaining a heterogenous-agent multi-

country reinterpretation of the model.


                           II.           A   Real Asset Pricing Model

     The model to be developed in this section is suitable for pricing

assets in a hypothetical world that functions without money.                   Initially it

is assumed that a family of representative agents inhabits a closed

economy where output is exogenous, government is absent.                  Preferences are

of the representative agent are represented by a quadratic period utility

function with lifetime utility being the discounted sum of the period

utilities.      Some of these assumptions will be relaxed later.              The agent's

problem is:




     maxE       i—O
                      u(cJ$
                                 1
                                     ,       O<fl<l
subject to:

where

        Et — the mathematical expectation operator conditional on
              complete time t information,

   u(       )
                —    the   period utility function,

   ct+i —            per   capita consumption in period t+i,

   qt+i —            price   of equity in terms of consumption goods at time t+i,

   kt÷i — number of equity shares held by the representative agent at
          time t+i,

   dt÷i —            dividend paid at the beginning of t+i to the holder of one
                     equity share during t-t-i-l.

        The agents'           first order condition for maximizing expected lifetime

utility at time t is:
                                —
       (I)           u'(c)q         PE(u'(c÷1){q1 +

Define zt              u'(c)q;      at   u'(ct)dt. Equation (1) now becomes:


       (2)           z — flz+1 + Ea1.
To simplify,               assume that a fixed capital stock is the only factor of

production, that all output is paid to equity holders as dividends and

that there is one equity share per representative agent.                  Therefore,

dt —    yt,         where    y is per capita output at time    t.   Output depreciates

fully in one period so that storage is futile.                  In equilibrium, therefore,

ct —    yt.
        The solution of (2) is:



                 —
                     :1Etat+i$i.
                                                    -6-


The solution excludes dynamically-based inteterminacies and is the
                                                                   type of
solution that will be dealt with throughout the paper.

     Now, assume a particular functional form for period utility:


                  -
    (3)
           u(c)       ac   -
                                (l/2)c
which is quadratic utility. j/                    Since choices are invariant to linear

transformations of the period utility function,                  the constant has been

suppressed a constant in (3) which has been writton to highlight the fact

that marginal period utility for quadratic preferences is a one parameter

family of functions.

     Using (3) and ct       —      yt   —   dt,   equation (2) becomes


    (3a)     —                 +              -
                  $Etzt+1          $Et(a
which may also be written as


  j/ Quadratic utility is objectionable to some--apparently on aesthetic
grounds. It is sometimes mentioned that any fixed-psrameter quadratic
utility function will eventually be "out grown" by an economy growing
without bound. Another way of phrasing this objection is to say that
attention should be restricted to model environments where per-capita
consumption can grow without bound. This seems to me to be a singularly
unworldly restriction.
      Another line of attack on quadratic utility is that other utility
functions such as constant relative (or constant sbsolute) risk aversion
seem a priori "more plausible". Such a point is, of course, unarguable.
One can argue, however, that since empirical work on the stock market
(e.g., Flood, Hodrick, and Kaplan (1987)) rejects many popular period
utility functions including constant relative riak aversion, constant
absolute risk aversion, risk neutrality and quadratic utility there is no
way to choose among the popular forms on the basis of conformity with the
data.   Consequently, for studies like the current one it seems sensible to
adopt the utility function which makes exposition as transparent as
possible--quadratic utility.
      One objection to quadratic period utility which should not be dis-
missed is that quadratic period utility implies risk neutrality with
respect to the riskiness of the environment. As was mentioned in the text
this is the technical source of this paper's simplicity.

Like Yt       ht is an exogenous variable and it will provide most

"action" presently.            In particular, the time series process for ht will be

the vehicle for modelling tranquil and turbulent periods.              Notice that the

t subscript on ht refers to the period of the information set relevant to

the ht calculstion.

        Before moving on to the "warm-ups" notice that equation (3b) is a

first-order linear stochastic difference equation in the variable             z       with

the composite forcing process given by the right-hand-most term in (3a) or

(3b).        The experiments to be performed here all involve altering the

composite forcing term.             If we had simply adopted a linear time series

                                                     solve (3b) directly
process for the composite forcing term then we would
                                                               This would be an

expedient method of solving for Zt, but it would not allow us

riskiness of the environment in isolation from other aspects of the

forcing process.

        Our choice of period utility function implies the moments of              y   that

will appear in the forcing term in (3b).              With quadratic utility the first

 two moments of       y will       appear.   If a different period utility function had

been adopted different moments would appear in the forcing process.

     The variable zt is the marginal utility attached to a unit of the

equity.     It is equal to period marginal utility of goods times the
                                                                      goods
price of the equity.    It turns out that it is convenient to work with   z
rather that qt and so moat of the discussion centers on
                                                        Zt.    Usually this
is a harmless simplification but not always;   in example 2 in this section

we study a situation where the simplification is not harmless.

     The exposition begins with some pedantic examples to make clear the

aspects of the this type of problem end solution method that are familiar

from previous work and those that are novel to this approach.

Example 1: Constant first moment,    first order auto-regressive
conditional variance

     Assume the following time series processes for   y and ht:
     (4a)
                   y+w
     (4b)                      -l<$cl,
where wt is mean zero and serially uncorrelated. The stochastic process

for yt end ht are assumed to be such that both are always positive.

Further, a is large enough compared to any possible value of   y that
period marginal utility of consumption is always positive, which requires
                                              -9-


Yt   <   a.   Imposing an upper bound of a on Yt implies boundaries on ht. 1/

Innovations in ht+l can come from a variety of sources and maybe

correlated with innovations in the             y process or not. iI
  ll One way to keep variables positive is to introduce stochastic
processes of the form:

                 —   X   +          Xt       Lit+l       0.
      Xc+l                   "t+l        '




where vt+l is a positive stochastic coefficient with Etvt÷l — '.' and xt
is any variable in the model. If written in the standard linear form, the
additive disturbance becomes proportional to xt. It is convenient to
think about many of the variance and covariance processes in the paper in
                                                   are assumed for variables
these terms.   Further, when stochastic processes
like y, one can think of the disturbances as being generated as above.
      The requirement zt > 0 implies that ht is bounded above as well as
below would be necessary,therefore, for the variance process, to impose
conditions such as 0 < ti < 1 with a moving upper bound on t-'c+l such that
                                                Weil pointed out to me the
ht+1 meets the variance upper bound, Phillipe
upper bound implied by the condition      > 0.       z
      In applied work one would work with noncentral higher moments (here
the second moment) rather than with variances and covariances so that
variance conditions could be ignored. On using this type of model in
practice see footnote 4.

                                      a dynamically-based indeterminacy

modeling (and identification and estimation in applied
unfamiliar (possibly nonlinear) forcing process. In fact, the nonlinear
rational expectations model in this paper is even more tightly constrained
than the typical linear rational expectations model in the sense that more

exogenous variable equations need to be estimated along
equation than in the linear case for fully efficient estimation.
      The choice of exogenous variable processes used in the examples was
guided by the goal of exposition--not estimation--and may not be a good
approach in applied work.    For instance, to estimate parameters in
example  3  (below in the text), I would estimate simultaneously:
 (i) equation (lOa)--the reduced-form pricing function; iii) equation
 (9a)--the yt process; and (lii) a process on y. The yt process will
                                                                        to
place additional overidentifying restrittions on the model (compared
 estimating only  the reduced-form pricing function  and a            y
                                                              process).  From
 discussions with Robert Hodrick, and Adrian Pagan it seems to me that it

 equation (3a) rather than invoking the decomposition allowing the
 transition to equation (3b). It would be simple in example 3 to
 reformulate the pricing function to exclude ht and put the agents'

     An explicit example where Yt shocks drive                  is given later.   For
                                               ht
now, we need not be concerned with how conditional variance shocks enter

the model or how they might be correlated with shocks to other variables.

Since Etyt÷l is constant,             recognize from (3b) that the only variable

entering the forcing process is ht.                This equation can be solved using the

method of linear undetermined coefficients by "guessing'               that the solution

is linear in ht,        substituting the trial solution into the equilibrium

condition and treating the resulting equation as an identity.                In

forcing process. The term ht was used in the text for ease of exposition
and could be reintroduced for experiments once one has obtained consistent
estimates of the behavioral parameters.
     In practice,        h
                     is difficult to model because the researcher has no
direct observations on ht and because constructing ht requires that the
researcher correctly model the agents' Etyt+l. This point was made by
Pagan (1984) and is very closely related to Flavin's (1983) critique of
some of the empirical stock-price variance bounds literature.   At the time
of Flavin's paper it was pointed out to me by Richard Porter that the
variance bounds literature could be consistently recast in terms of first
and second moments and that message seems to extend here.

        In    this example, two things are responsible for the stochastic

behavior of the price of equity,                       q. First, real output       disturbances will

influence yt and thereby                    u' (ye)   — u' (ct) The influence
                                                                 .                 of current         output

ing agents'           beliefs about the variance of future real output shocks shows

up in    h.        Information that makes agents think that future output variance

will be higher, will lower 't at the rate All/u'(ct).                            Notice that A11

deponds on         ,        which     is one of the parameters in the ht time series


process.           If        is large then a shock to ht is relatively persistent and

has a large effect on qt as compared to a case where                              is small and shocks


to ht are transitory.                      Notice that the framework can handle very

persistent shocks to ht in that it can handle any                              such that jfl      < 1/fl.

Examole       2:      ARCH

         The methods of Engle                 (1982) and Bollerslev and Engel (1986) suggest

an alternative formulation of the behavior of the conditional variance,

ht.      Retain equations (3b) and (4a), the equilibrium Euler equation and

the yt process respectively,                     but alter the structure of the conditional

variance equation to:

                               +
      (7)
                 h—h                Lw2.

This    example differs from the previous one in that output shocks, wt,

alter agents' beliefs about the distribution of future output shocks.                           If

an output shock is large (in absolute value) the agents will raise their

current beliefs about the variance of future output shocks.                        Here, make

use of the fact ht —               Etw+l and     recognize that (7) is structurally very

similar to (4b)          .
                               Consequently the       trial solution for zt retains its

previous functional form but with                     Sw   replacing   ht.   In particular:



                                       2

       In this example,              the effect of a positive output shock, Wt,        on equity

price, qt (compared to wt —                0)   depends on specific parameter magnitudes

since positive          w both decreases current marginal utility of consumption
acting toward increasing equity price and increases agents perception of

future variance acting toward decreasing equity price.                        The net result

will depend on specific parameters.

     A negative     wt, on the other hand,       lowers qt (compared to wt —   0).   jJ

This example preaents an interesting possible asymmetry in the reaction of

equity price to positive versus negative real shocks.


                    III.   Government Policy and Asset Prices

     In this section the model developed above will be used to study two

issues.   First, how does government expenditure policy influence the way

changes in an the economy's stochastic environment impact the asset

market?   Second,   how does the asset market react to entering a period of

likely fiscal reform?       The concept of likely fiscal reform     is,

characterized here by an upward shift in the covariance of innovations in

government spending and innovations in the income tax rate.           This

definition of fiscal reform does not take a stand on the direction of

movement of tax rates or government expenditure;          it considers only the

association between government spending changes and tax rate changes.

While the questions studied in this section have some independent interest

they were chosen to illustrate some aspects of the model.           The first

question is chosen to illustrate the asset pricing effect of the

interaction of first moment and variance processes and the second is



  1/ Examining equation (6), it is clear that while the present approach
is helpful for examining the impact of underlying risk shifts on asset
price, it is no big help in examining the effects of underlying volatility
shifts on asset-price volatility. The problem is that to convert to asset
price one must divide zt by the marginal utility of consumption. Since
this marginal utility will in equilibrium involve the level of output, the
conversion to asset price from Zt involves dividing by a linear function
of a stochastic disturbance. Asset price is therefore, in this set up, a
nonlinear function of the underlying disturbances. Studying the
volatility of asset price usually requires that the expectation of asset
price be calculated. Such calculations for nonlinear functions are
distribution-function specific and will be avoided here.

chosen to illustrate the adaptability of this kind of model to studying

time series processes involving the covariance.

        This section uses the closed-economy equity-pricing model introduced

earlier.      The closed economy is a useful fiction here since income tax

rates need not be uniform across countries.           Without uniform taxes agents

need not face the same effective prices, making aggregation much more

difficult than is the case presently.

1.      Introducing the government

       Introducing the government requires that the budget constraints and

equilibrium conditions be modified. It is assumed that the government

purchases goods in the goods market, collects a proportional income tax

and collects a lump-sum tax.     The government's budget constraint is:


      (9)       —
                    ry   +

where   t    is per-capita government consumption rt is the income tax rate

and   e is the per-capita lump-sum tax.           The after-income-tax average

individual budget constraint is now:


      (9a)
             c + qk      +   —    + (1   -

Goods market equilibrium requires:


      (9b)
             c+g—y
       For the issues studied in this section it is assumed that government

purchases do not influence the marginal utility of private consumption.

The average Euler equation for equities,          written for equilibrium is

been used in place of ct and private after-tax income becomes the pay-out

to equity holders. Lump-sum taxes are present only as a government-budget

balancing item.

2.    Government feedback oolicy. volatility,                             and the equity market

      The question to be investigated here is:                              "How does government expen-

diture policy influence the way in which volatility impacts the equity

market?" To investigate this question we adopt the following settings.


                                                                  <

                                                                                     < 1.


      Further, to focus on expenditure policy set rt — 0 all                                   t.       The impor-

tant difference between the set up currently and that used previously is

that now a government expenditure policy rule has been adopted. According

to this rule, equation (bc), government spending is determined by a

constant,    past government spending,                 the amount of current output and a

white noise disturbance,             c.
        The short cut of examining the influence of policy on zt rather than

on   q   is adopted.         As before, the transformation between zt and                               q   can be

made by dividing zt by marginal utility.                              Keep in mind that by

concentrating      on            we are looking only into the future.                                This is

reflected in equation (9c) by the fact that the entire right-hand-side of

the zt equation gives zt as the current expectation of future events.

      Following the methods of the previous section, substitute (lOa),

(lOb) and (lOc) into (9c) with rt+1 — 0 and find that the forcing process

(for Zt) is linear in Ft                             ht, gt, and gtyt•                   The following trial

solution is therefore attempted:

      The equity-market impact of ht                               is       given by A43, which is proportional

problem only through agents' forecasts of future squared output.

      Government expenditure policy can influence the asset market impact

of changes in risk.               In particular, the asset market impact of risk is

,,   which can assume any value between        -l and 1. j/     When q < 0 government

spending policy is counter-cyclical and the spending feedback exacerbates

the effect of risk on the market.         When n > 0 government spending is pro-

cyclical and dampens the effect of risk on the market.                 What is going on

is that counter-cyclical government spending policy,             ,j   <   0, induces a


negative covariance of   t   and   y.     A larger absolute negative covariance

(as would be induced by a positive ht shock) acts toward lowering the

marginal utility of future dividends.              This acts in conjunction with the

standard effect of ht to give larger variations in the equity market as a

result of ht disturbances. On the other hand, when q > 0 the above

covariance is positive and its effect is to act toward offsetting ht's

standard effect.

       The effect isolated here is conceptually distinct from the way the

equity market reacts to an output shock.

partial derivative of zt with respect to ht.              It is therefore answering a

question about the equity market impact of a risk shock as distinct from

an output shock.

3.     Fiscal reform and the equity market

       The question to be studied here is:            "What is the equity market

effect of entering a period of likely fiscal reform?" To confront the

question with our tools, "fiscal reform" must be a recurring event with

agents understanding the time series process of fiscal reforms.                   We can

       p1) C 1, would ensure A43 C 0. It is not clear, however, why in
this model such a condition should be imposed since long-run output is not
time-varying.
                                         -   18   -




then   come-to-grips with the narrower question:               "What is the equity market

effect of a disturbance to the "fiscal reform" time series process?" The

following settings are adopted:

                —
  (13a)             y,

  (13b)         — g +
                      Vt,


  (13c)         —   r    +
                             x,

  (13d)      Ex   V
              tt÷lt+l              t


  (13e)                           + 6.
              ESt1

       In equation (l3a), output has been set at a constant allowing us to

concentrate attention on fiscal policy disturbances.                In (13b) and (13c)

government spending and the tax rate respectively are assumed to follow

stochaatic processes around fixed means.               The disturbance terms   in (13b)

and (13c), Vt and xt, are white noises.               The conditional covariance of Vt

and xt is given by 6t-l and the conditional expectation of the time-series

process of this covariance is given by equation (13e).                The conditional

covariance,    6,       is playing the same type of role played previously by ht.

       A   period of "fiscal reform" is defined presently to be a period when

St is high.     For an economy to move into a surprising period of fiscal

reform is to have the economy receive a high              S.    The fiscal reform model

used here is cynical in that nothing ever happens to the means of per-

capita government spending and the income tax rate.                This is intended only

as an analytical convenience allowing separation of the riskiness of a

fiscal reform period from the type of reform expected.

        Notice   that the present idea of fiscal reform deals only with the

coordination of tax and spending policies.                       It is eclectic with respect to

the direction of change of both spending and the tax rate.                              A   period of

fiscal reform is therefore a period when the tax rate and per-capita

spending are likely to move in the same direction.

        For this issue we follow previous practice by substituting from

equations (13s)-(13e)                   into equstion (lOc) and noticing that the forcing

process (for zt) is linear in                  5.    The trial   solution       therefore     is:



    (16)             —              +
                             Aso

                                       fi
The constant     term, A50 is given in the appendix.                    Since A51 < 0, we find

that entering a period of likely fiscal reform, i.e.                        ,   entering     a period of

close coordination of tax and spending policy, decreases zt.                                Conversely,

entering a period of weak coordination of tsx rates and per capita

spending increases zt.

        The intuition for this result is that (roughly) things that are good

for zt are things that increase the expected future marginal utility of

after tax dividends. The tax rate enters after tax dividends negatively

while government spending enters marginal utility positively.                                The covari-

ance of the tax rate and spending therefore enters negatively.

                          IV.   Concluding Remarks

     The purpose of this paper was to exposit and apply in a simple and

familiar framework some ideas developed recently by Abel.   This line of

research allows us for the first time to ask in a consistent way questions

concerning agents'   reactions to predictable and unpredictable alterations

in the riskiness of their environment. The framework seems to have wide

potential applicability to problems such as options pricing and optimal

government stabilization policy where the nature of and reactions to time-

varying risk are at the center of the problem.

                    Some Aspects   of Nominal Asset Pricing

     The model developed in the text was designed to allow pricing of

assets in real terms in a hypothetical world that functions without money.

One is interested, however,    in nominal asset pricing since nominal units

are the typical units of real-world asset pricing.                  While   it is outside

the direct realm of this paper, this appendix gives an example of asset

pricing in a nominal environment where risk may be time-varying.

     Money is introducedvia the simplest mechanism available in the

.trrent literature, strong cash-in-advance.            In this monetary introduction

scheme, also known as a Glower constraint,          it is assumed that agents must

use money to buy goods.    It is also assumed that when the money is

acquired by agents, the agents know exactly the quantity of goods that

they will purchase with the money.       Later a somewhat looser version of a

Glower-constrainedmodel will be discussed.

     Accommodating money in our model requires that we reset budget con-

straints.     In particular, it is assumed that all money enters (leaves) the

model via lump-sum transfers (taxes) from          (to)    the government.       The

government,   which takes no role in this economy other than provider of

money, has a budget constraint given by           PG   —   Mt
                                                                -
                                                                    Mj, where t is the
money price of goods and Mt is the per-capita money stock.

     The private individual now must obey a pair of constraints, the first

tonstraining his purchases of asset and the second constraining his pur-

chases of goods.    This is natural in a cash-in-advance               economy since only

goods carry the special condition that they must be purchased with money.

The constraints are:

respectively.          Previously defined symbols retain their meaning.                      B    is

per-capita nominal bonds and it is the nominal rate of interest.                              The

Euler equation for bond holding is

    (A2.5)      (1 +    i)                                  +

where   w,,   is the covariance of             t÷l     and    t+l   conditional on time t informa-

tion.

        Leaving aside wt for now, we see                    that    the moments of   t+l   will enter

          as directed by utility function choice.                        If quadratic utility is

chosen,       the first two moments of the Yt+l distribution will be important

in determining the nominal interest rate.                           For other utility function

choices other moments will enter the pricing function.

        To the extent that money is exogenous to the private sector we have

much less economic guidance when calculating Etnt+l.                           The problem is that

we have no way of knowing offhand what mathematical function of money is

being given a distribution function by the policy authorities.                              For
                                            -   24   -                              APPENDIX II




example,    suppose policy    authorities        choose a rule       like   Mt — M +   ut   where

ut is white and has some known distribution. Since agents need to

calculate Ecnt÷l they must calculate MtEt(l/Mt÷l) and if a distribution is

given for ut÷l then aspects of that distribution function must be invoked

in the calculation and, in general, the calculation will be a function of

the entire shape of the distribution function.

     For the above reason moments of the money supply rule other than

those typically considered important for nominal interest rates might

entet a reduced-form interest rate function,                     Df course there is no good

reason for the authorities to adopt a distribution pertaining to the level

of money.     The monetary authority could make agents' calculations a lot

easier if they were to adopt a rule on gt÷l,                 e.g.,    gt+l — g +   wt+l,     where

wt÷l is white noise.         For a monetary authority rule on               t÷l   no moments of

wt÷l's distribution other than the mean,                 zero,    would enter the nominal

interest rate reduced form.

     The reader may have noticed that the above methods for introducing

unusual moments of the monetary disturbance into the interest rate reduced

form are essentially unrelated to the asset pricing framework.                         These

moments are being introduced by the model's requiring agents to form

expectations of nonlinear functions of the policy variables.                        For the same

reasons these moments could turn up in standard descriptive macro-models.

Suppose, for example, that agents are following a log-linear macro-model.

The solution of the model (e.g.         ,
                                            for      the interest rate)      might require the

model's agents to form expectations of future logs of money.                        If the

policy authority is following money-supply a rule on the level of money

with an additive shock then descriptions of the distribution of that shock

(possibly including higher moments of the distribution) will appear in the

reduced form expressions for the endogenous variables.

     A much more interesting area of study is suggested by the term ut in

(A2.5).   Through this term the covariance of a monetary variable, nt+l,

and a real variable, gt+l,   can influence the nominal rate of interest.

Similar covariance terms have been an important topic in macroeconomics

since its inception.

     The model used in this appendix was adopted for ease of discussion.

Essentially the same points apply in the cash-in-advance models of the

type used by Hodrick (1987) and Giovannini (1987) where money must be

gathered before the resolution of other aspects of the period's

uncertainty.   This alteration in the timing of the resolution of

uncertainty simply alters the timing of variables entering the interest

rate reduced form.

                Heterogenous Agent. Multi-Country Reinterpretation

      The analysis in the text was based on a representative-agent closed

economy model to facilitate comparisons with other work in that setting.

The purpose of this appendix is to show that the model we have used has a

much broader interpretation than we have placed on it.                   Indeed we will

find that once quadratic period utility has been assumed, aggregation in a

world of heterogenous agents is straightforward.

       In a world where agents from different countries are endowed with

different wealth levels and have different period utility functions but

where each agent has quadratic period utility, each agent faces the

following problem:


      max
            E i=O (1    [l/2](c4.)2)$u,
                                 1
                                                   D <       fi   < 1

The symbols in the above problem retain moat of their previous meaning,

but now symbols with a j superscript apply only to individual j, where

j —   l,2,3,...J.
       It is not necessary to make any special assumptions about the country

of location of the individuals for asset pricing. ]j                    However, certain

assumptions are required for simple aggregation. First, all agents use

the same expectation operator; information is therefore homogenous across


  j/ Of course locating agents by country would be crucial for country-
bookeeping such as current account, capital accounts, etc.

agents.    Second,   the subjective discount rate,        fi,   is   identical for all

agents.    Third, all agents face identical prices for goods and assets.

     The parameters in the period utility function and individual wealtha

can differ across individuals. As before, however, constant terms in the

period utility functions have been ignored and each individual's period

utility function has been normalized by dividing the function by 1/2 of

the parameter attached to (cj)2.         Individual period-utility-function

differences are therefore contained entirely in the parameters a).

     Each individual's optimization problem will imply an Euler equation

like equation (1) in the text.         Average these equation across individuals

to obtain:


                                  -
  (A3.l)   (E[a      -

Retaining the assumption of no government spending or taxation,

equilibrium requires


                 -
     (l/J)EcJ


If all output is paid out as dividends we obtain an Euler equation very
similar to (3a) in the text.          The only difference between (A3.l) and (3a)

is that in (A3.l), the Euler equation parameter derived from the period

utility functions is the average across j of the constant terms in

individual period marginal utility while m in (3a) is the representative

agent's constant term in period marginal utility.

     This implies that the results in the previous section are not very

sensitive to the closed economy representative agent assumption.                  They

would,    however,     be sensitive        to different        discount    rates   across   agents   or

agents    facing     different      effective       prices    as would happen in a multi-

country    setting     with      goods or asset       market    distortions.
