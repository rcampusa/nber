Elections, Political Polarization, and Economic Uncertainty

                                          ABSTRACT

We examine patterns of economic policy uncertainty (EPU) around national elections in 23
countries. Uncertainty shows a clear tendency to rise in the months leading up to elections.
Average EPU values are 13% higher in the month of and the month prior to an election than in
other months of the same national election cycle, conditional on country effects, time effects, and
country-specific time trends. In a closer examination of U.S. data, EPU rises by 28% in the month
of presidential elections that are close and polarized, as compared to elections that are neither.
This pattern suggests that the 2020 US Presidential Election could see a large rise in economic
policy uncertainty. It also suggests larger spikes in uncertainty around future elections in other
countries that have experienced rising polarization in recent years.

1. Introduction
       Uncertainty surrounding economic policy has been a topic of increasing importance over
the past decades around the world. A multitude of events including wars, financial crises, and
pandemics have pushed governments to respond in unprecedented ways, including large fiscal
expansions, unconventional monetary policies, new regulations and a new legislative agenda. At
the same time, there has been a widening gap between political actors, parties, and coalitions.
These gaps involve disagreement about broad economic policies, both in terms of the objectives
of policy but also the means to attain them in response to any given crisis. As a result, the policy
regime in effect depends heavily on which party currently has control of government and elections
have come to be of primary importance when projecting the path of future economic policy.
Elections represent a key source of uncertainty that can affect the investment, spending, and hiring
decisions of both firms and individual households.
       National elections represent one of the clearest signals about the future of a country's
economic policy over the following years. In the months leading up to an election, policies are
generally proposed by candidates and expectations about who may win the election may evolve
rapidly. Particularly for elections that may hinge on just a few percent of the vote, an election may
represent an important shock to the policy and investment environment. In recent years, examples
of the both uncertain and consequential nature of elections abound. For instance, consider recent
elections such as those in Australia (2013; Tony Abbott), India (2014; Narendra Modi), the United
States (2016; Donald Trump), Brazil (2018; Jair Bolsonaro), and the United Kingdom (2019; Boris
Johnson). In each of these elections, competing candidates offered starkly different policy
proposals, and the change in leadership led to marked changes in economic policies. Many of the
results of these elections were unforeseen even days before the election itself.
       However, elections are not always so dramatic or consequential. In the United States,
voters did not see the two primary parties as especially far apart in the 1960s and 1970s. In
contemporary Germany and Austria, voters do not see the policy proposals of mainstream parties
of right and left as substantially different, and in fact, these parties routinely form "grand
coalitions" with one another. According to Boxell, Gentzkow, and Shapiro (2020), voters'
perceptions of the parties in some Northern European democracies are becoming less polarized
over time. Yet in the United States and several other democracies, voters have come to see the




                                                 1
parties' platforms as much further apart today than in the past, and they have grown quite hostile
in their evaluations of the out-party (Iyengar et al. 2019, Boxell, Gentzkow, and Shapiro 2020).
       In the United States, Baker et al. (2014) noted a strong correspondence between the trend
toward increasing polarization of Congressional voting behavior, increasingly polarized
perceptions of the parties' platforms, and a striking secular increase in policy uncertainty since the
1960s. As voters and investors come to see the parties as further apart, uncertainty about the
potential path of economic policy in the years ahead is magnified.
       Beyond long-run trends in uncertainty about economic policy, elections matter for driving
short-term swings in uncertainty within an electoral cycle. The extent to which elections may drive
more significant swings in economic policy means that firms are increasingly exposed to an
`electoral business cycle'. The classic political economy literature hypothesized that opportunistic
incumbents would attempt to use fiscal and monetary policy to increase economic growth
immediately before elections (Nordhaus (1975)). However, this effect could easily be undone or
reversed if policy uncertainty in the pre-election period leads to lower investment. Baker, Bloom,
and Davis (2016) demonstrate that firms often adopt a `wait-and-see' approach to dealing with
uncertainty, ceasing investments and new hiring while they wait for uncertainty to resolve. Canes-
Wrone and Park (2012) use OECD data since the 1970s to demonstrate that investments with high
costs of reversal are delayed in the immediate pre-election period, especially when elections are
close, and when the parties' platforms are far apart. Canes-Wrone and Park (2012b) use survey
data as well as data from housing markets to show that consumers delay certain major purchases
in the run-up to close elections.
       In this paper, we investigate patterns of economic policy uncertainty surrounding national
elections in more than 20 countries. We utilize a measure of economic policy uncertainty
previously developed by the authors that tracks the frequency with which newspapers discuss
topics related to economic policy uncertainty. Baker, Bloom, and Davis (2016) perform audits to
check whether the method accurately identifies articles about policy-related economic uncertainty.
Baker et al. (2019) show that similar methods can be used to successfully track stock market
uncertainty, as measured by the VIX and VIX-like measures.
       Using these measures of uncertainty both across and within countries, we find that
economic policy uncertainty consistently rises in periods near elections. Across all countries, we
find increases of 13% relative to the months preceding or following the election period.



                                                  2
        Focusing on more detailed data from the United States, we find that this trend is not
common to all elections. Many elections are associated with little change in uncertainty about
economic policy. For instance, elections in which the electorate is not substantially polarized do
not tend to produce as much uncertainty, suggesting that who is in charge is less impactful than
how divergent economic policies might be in the case of a win. Moreover, elections that are not
`close' tend not to provoke substantial increases in uncertainty. For these elections, expectations
about economic policies from the winning party are likely already crystalized. Since polarization
has steadily increased in recent years and presidential elections are more frequently close, election-
related spikes in uncertainty have become an important feature of the American investment
environment. Most notably, the election in November 2020 is both polarized and (according to
betting odds) perceived as close, suggesting this could induce a large spike in economic policy
uncertainty. 1
        Following this introduction, Section 2 describes the various datasets utilized in the analysis.
Section 3 describes our cross-country analysis and Section 4 focuses on a time series analysis of
elections in the United States. Section 5 concludes.


2. Data
2.1 Economic Policy Uncertainty Data
        Given that uncertainty surrounding elections will be primarily driven by considerations
about policy and politics, this paper uses a measure of economic policy uncertainty (EPU)
developed by Baker, Bloom and Davis (2016) as the primary outcomes measure of interest. We
obtain monthly country-level EPU data for 23 countries from https://www.policyuncertainty.com/,
which collects and hosts indexes of economic policy uncertainty for countries around the world
from a range of academic sources. These indices are derived from the fraction of newspaper articles
in a given country and month that discuss matters related to economic policy uncertainty.
        Table 1 displays the full coverage of our sample of policy uncertainty data across all
countries. This table also notes all the national election dates covered within our sample period.

  As of late September, the potential for economic upheaval resulting from electoral uncertainty has been
noted by a number of market participants. For instance, Interactive Brokers raised clients' minimum margin
requirements by over 33% to protect against market swings anticipated in the run up to the election. See
"Interactive Brokers boosts margin requirements ahead of US election", Financial Times, September 23,
2020.


                                                    3
We drop all periods within a country that contain only imputed economic policy uncertainty data
or have non-competitive elections. 2


2.2 Election Data
         We construct a database of elections across all countries in our sample that lie within the
range of dates for which we have policy uncertainty data. The coverage of our policy uncertainty
data varies widely ­ it spans 1900-2020 for the United States and the United Kingdom, but only
1998-2020 for Australia. For the year 2020, we only include data until February in our analysis.
We obtain election dates by combining information from the Constituency-Level Elections
Archive (CLEA) (Kollman et al, 2019) and the Manifesto Project (MP) (Volkens, et al. 2020), and
hand-collect data to cover elections missed by the CLEA and the MP.
         We focus on the set of national elections that determine and reflect the popular choice of
the executive. For Parliamentary systems, 3 this corresponds to Parliamentary elections while for
Presidential systems, this corresponds to Presidential elections. 4 Special elections or by-elections
for single parliamentary or congressional seats are excluded. For elections which cover multiple
months, we choose the month in which the election ends. Similarly, for multi-round elections ­ a
first round and then a runoff election ­ we define the election month to be the month of the final
round.
         The electoral cycle across these countries varies substantially. In some countries, elections
are on a fixed schedule, while in others the Government is able to call for elections on a more ad-
hoc basis. For instance, in the United States, national elections for the President, the head of the


2
  This affects data from China as well as some periods of data for Australia, Colombia, Greece, India, and
the Netherlands.
3
  We classify Australia, Belgium, Canada, Croatia, Germany, Greece, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, the
Netherlands, Pakistan, Spain, Sweden and the UK as parliamentary systems. Croatia, Greece and Sweden
follow unicameral systems. Australia, Belgium and Spain conduct elections for the lower and the upper
houses on the same date. In Canada (the Senate), Germany (the Bundesrat), India (the Rajya Sabha), Ireland
(the Seanad), Pakistan (the Aiwan-e-Bala Pakistan) and the UK (the House of Lords), members of the upper
house are not directly elected and we only use election dates for the Lower House. Japan and the
Netherlands have different election cycles for the lower and upper houses of their Parliaments, but have
substantially more powerful lower houses ­ hence, we only use election dates for the Lower houses. In
Belgium, elections are held only to fill slots in the legislature, but elections to the lower house of parliament
(the Chamber of Representatives) determine who forms the government and the composition of the Council
of Ministers. We therefore use dates for elections to the Chamber of Representatives.
4
  We classify Brazil, Chile, Colombia, France, South Korea, Mexico, Russia and the United States as
presidential systems.


                                                       4
executive branch, are held in November every four years, while in the United Kingdom, the
possibility of calling a snap election means that elections can be held at any time between the
formation of a government and the scheduled end of its 5-year term.


2.3 Polling Data
        We obtain data about the closeness of anticipated election results from Jennings and
Wlezien (2018). These researchers combine data on polls from different countries to construct, at
a daily frequency, the average expected vote share for each party in the period leading up to a
national election. We average across all polls within a country-month to obtain an average
expected vote share , () for each party  in each month  =  - 1,  - 2,  - 3, ... leading
up to the election. The number of polls entering the average is increasing over time ­ in the United
States, the average number of polls rises from around 4 per month in 1952 to around 6 per month
in 1976, 18 per month in 1988 and over 30 in 2016.
        We are primarily interested in the difference in vote shares of the leading political parties.
In the United States, this difference can be expressed as:


                                  , = |, () - , ( )|


We classify an election as close if the expected difference in major-party vote shares in the three
months before the election is less than 5%. 5 That is, an election is defined as close if:
                               ,-1 + ,-2 + ,-3
                                               < 5%
                                     3


2.4 United States Polarization Data
        We use data from the American National Election Study (ANES) to build measures of
polarization. Between 1952 and 2004, the ANES includes a direct measure of affect (like-dislike)


5
  At this writing in September 2020, the current US presidential election is not close by this metric.
However, the election appears to be closer with respect to electoral college votes. Some observers also see
the potential for no clear winner to emerge from the November 2020 presidential election, leading to a
protracted period of uncertainty and partisan conflict in a highly polarized environment. See, for example,
Cochrane (2020). We would like to use prediction markets to quantify the closeness of the election and the
likelihood of a hung election. Unfortunately, we do not have historical betting odds back to 1952 and must
use polling data for our long-span analysis.


                                                    5
toward either major party (variables VCF0316 and VCF0320 for affect towards Democrats and
Republicans respectively), measured on an 11-point scale from -5 ("Maximum Negative") to +5
("Maximum Positive").
        From 1996 onwards, the ANES began asking respondents to place the two major parties
on a direct like/dislike scale with 11 points from 0 ("Strongly Dislike") to 10 ("Strongly Like"), in
accordance with the methodology used by the Comparative Study of Electoral Systems (CSES).
We use this series to extend the affect measure from 2008 to 2016. 6
        We define our measure of Polarization as follows. For election , let  () be the set of
respondents with a valid affect  () for both the Democrats ( = ) and the Republicans ( =
), and let () be the number of respondents in  (). Let  be the demographic weight 7 of
individual  . That is, we define Polarization as: 8


                                            1
                                 =              | () -  ()|
                                            
                                                ( )



        Our measure of polarization is based on Affect, but we also consider Ideological
Polarization directly. Starting in 1972, the ANES asks respondents to place the two parties on a 7-
point scale with 1 denoting "extremely liberal" and 7 denoting "extremely conservative." Denoting
these scores by  () in analogy with the Affective measure, we compute


                                            1
                              =                 | ( ) -  ()|
                                            
                                                 ( )



        Figure 1 shows that our Ideological Polarization measure is strongly correlated with the
Affective Polarization measure over the time period for which both measures are available. Since

6
  Our Measure of polarization depends only on the differences between affect toward the two parties, and
hence should not be affected by the different centers of the two series.
7
  The weights we use (variable VCF0009z) reflect our choice to use the full data sample (including both
face-to-face and web interviews for 2012-16) and that the variables we use are defined as "code-0" variables
by the ANES.
8
  Our measures of polarization also covary strongly with the (demographic-weighted) shares of individuals
who self-report that they "strongly care" about who wins the Presidential Race (ANES Variable VCF0311),
and with the (demographic-weighted) share of individuals who are classified by the ANES as "Strong
Democrats" or "Strong Republicans". All measures show a strong increasing trend from the 1970s onward.


                                                      6
the latter is available over a longer time period, we use it in our benchmark calculations. Our results
are virtually unchanged if we use the former instead.


3. Electoral Uncertainty Across Countries
       Across our panel of countries, uncertainty about economic policy is correlated over time,
but exhibits substantial cross-sectional variation. Differential election schedules and cycles may
drive some of this variation in higher-frequency variation in national economic policy uncertainty.
We therefore examine the evolution of economic policy uncertainty across countries in the
proximity to national elections.
       Let ,  index countries and time (our data is monthly) respectively. We run variants of the
panel regression:
                                          =10

              =  +  +   +   (- = 1) +                                                             (1)
                                          =-10


where  ,  ,  represent a country fixed effect, a time (month-year) fixed effect and a country-
specific linear time trend respectively. This controls for long-run differences in levels across
countries, differences over time common to all countries, and finally country specific long-run
trends (e.g. rising policy uncertainty in the US), identifying the high-frequency impact of elections
over and above this.
       Table 2 shows our results for this approach. First, we run a barebones specification with
no fixed effects or trends, and then progressively add country and time fixed effects as well as the
country-specific linear trend. In our baseline specification (column 3), we note that the EPU index
rises by 13.2% (e0.124) in an election period relative to the mean level of EPU in any period outside
a 10-month window of an election. Figure 2 shows the time path of Log EPU within this window,
relative to the mean level outside the window, showing a clear spike in the months surrounding an
election.
       Our panel is unbalanced; data for the US and the UK extend back to 1900 but the data for
most of the remaining countries begins only in 1985 or afterwards. We re-run our regressions
restricting the data to the period after 1985 and find virtually identical estimates. We also confirm
that no individual country is responsible for our results by running a jackknife test, where we run
the regression while leaving each country out one at a time and obtain robust coefficients.



                                                  7
4. Economic Policy Uncertainty and United States Elections
        Next, we conduct a more in-depth study of the US case, taking advantage of a longer time
series and the availability of high-quality data on polarization. We obtain data on whether elections
were close or polarized for all elections in the US from 1952 onward. As noted above, we measure
polarization by the mean absolute deviation between party affect across individuals. We define an
election as polarized if it is above the median level of polarization in the data, 9 and we define an
election as close if the mean difference between the polled vote shares for the two parties in the
three months prior to the election is greater than 5 percentage points.
        Our data on polarization and closeness are at the election level, not at the monthly level.
To incorporate these measures into our analysis we first define the election cycle associated with
an election as the period of 31 months prior to and 16 months after the election, including the
election itself. 10 We classify each election cycle as being polarized or not and being associated
with a close election or not. We display a list of these elections as well as their various
classifications and results in Table 3.
        We first characterize the behavior of Policy Uncertainty in the periods surrounding a
typical US presidential election. To do this, we run the regression
                                           =2
                log  =  +  +   (ElectionDatet-m = 1) +                                                (2)
                                          =-6



where  indexes dates,  is a month fixed effect to deal with seasonality in the EPU index and 
is an election cycle fixed effect. The coefficient  represents the level of log  measured 
periods after an election (for instance, -1 corresponds to the month immediately prior to an
election), relative to the mean level over the entire election cycle. Our estimates are in column 1
of Table 4. These estimates suggest that EPU rises by 18.3% (e0.168) in the November of a typical
election relative to the surrounding election cycle.




9
  The median polarization level is around 2, reflecting a mean absolute difference of two affect points on a
scale of 11.
10
   By defining each election cycle to encompass leads and lags of the corresponding  variable
in (2), we can absorb the main effects of interaction variables considered below into  . Beyond that, it
matters little exactly how we select the 48-month interval that defines an election cycle.


                                                     8
4.1 Drivers of Uncertainty around US Elections
       We study the impact of whether an election is perceived to be close or not and the impact
of polarization on the behavior of policy uncertainty around a Presidential Election. Our main
regression model (which we henceforth refer to as the restricted model) is


                                     =2
           log  =  +  +  ( + Xc )(ElectionDatet-m = 1) +                                          (3)
                                    =-6



where  and  are month and election cycle fixed effects and the variable  is a dummy variable
which is constant at 1 if the election cycle meets a particular criterion and is 0 otherwise. In Column
2, we let  = 1 if affective polarization in the corresponding election is above its median value.
In column 3, we let  = 1 if the corresponding election was classified as close (i.e. the three-
month average difference in polls between the Democrats and Republicans was smaller than 5%).
In column 4, we let  = 1 if the corresponding election was both close and polarized by the above
definitions.
       Table 4 shows that both polarization and electoral closeness drive the behavior of policy
uncertainty in an environment of elections. Our estimates in column 2 and 3 suggest that in any
given period around an election our measure of policy uncertainty is 12.2% (e0.116) higher if the
election cycle is above median polarized, and is 18.6% (e0.171) higher if the election is close (polls
less than 5% apart). Column 4 shows that the interaction of closeness and polarization produces a
27.6% (e0.244) higher level of policy uncertainty than the typical election cycle that is neither
polarized nor close. Our estimates are robust to the inclusion of a linear time trend.
       Note that we restrict the value of  to be equal across all election cycles and across all
periods relative to the election. This restriction implies that the difference between the
(conditional) level of log  in a polarized election cycle relative to a non-polarized election
cycle measured  periods after an election is restricted to be constant and equal to .
       We also run an unrestricted variant of model (3),




                                                  9
                   log  =  + 
                                     =2

                                 +   (ElectionDatet-m = 1)                                              (4)
                                     =-6

                                 +  (ElectionDatet-m = 1)(X = 1) + 


In this specification, we can interpret  as the conditional excess log  in a polarized election
cycle relative to a non-polarized election cycle  months after an election. Table 5 shows our
estimates for this specification, with the columns specified analogous to the scheme in Table 4.
Figures 3, 4 and 5 plot the coefficients on the period dummies and the interactions of these
variables with indicators for election cycles that are polarized, close and both close and polarized
respectively. 11
         The final rows of Table 5 show the -values of two tests of the hypotheses we perform on
the 's. First, we test the null hypothesis that all the interactions are jointly zero (i.e. -6 =  =
2 = 0). While we fail to reject the null in the specification with interactions only for polarized
elections, we can reject it for the specifications with interactions for close elections and with
interactions for close and polarized elections. Second, we test the null hypothesis that all the
interactions are equal (i.e. -6 =  = 2 ). We fail to reject this hypothesis in any of our
specifications, which helps justify our choice of regression (3) as our baseline.


4.2 Polarization and Spikes in Uncertainty around Elections
         Let  () be the election cycle corresponding to election  and  be the number of dates in
an election cycle. Define the Election Spike for election  by


                                            =+2                                                         (5)
                       =  (log  - log () )
                                            =-6

where:
                                                   1
                                  log () =            log 
                                                   
                                                      ()


11
  An interesting pattern in each of these figures is a short-term dip in policy uncertainty around three
months before the election. This corresponds to the timing of the party conventions, when uncertainty about
candidates and party platforms is resolved.


                                                    10
       Intuitively, the election spike represents the cumulative excess policy uncertainty in an
interval starting 6 months before and ending 2 months after an election, relative to the baseline
level prevailing in that election cycle. We choose the longer pre-period to capture the run-up in
uncertainty associated with party primaries. We also compute the analogous measure for the period
from 2 months before an election until (and including) the month of the election, as this is the
period for which our cross-country regression suggests the run-up in uncertainty prior to the
election is highest. Figure 6 plots both of these spike indicators over time since 1952, also including
our measure of affective polarization. It shows that the size of the election spike closely tracks the
level of affective polarization in that election cycle. Above all, the recent increase in polarization
has been associated with especially large spikes in uncertainty.


5. Conclusion
       Policy uncertainty has been steadily growing in the United States since the 1990s. The
long-term trend tracks closely with increased political polarization. The two parties are viewed by
voters and investors as offering increasingly divergent platforms. The COVID-19 pandemic has
led to a massive increase in the federal government's role in the economy, a large increase in public
debt, and a growing fiscal crisis for state and local governments. Partly as a result, future
government policy is increasingly important as a factor in investment decisions of firms and
individuals.
       In this paper, we have shown that as polarization has grown and battles over control of the
government have become more hotly contested, presidential elections have come to be associated
with larger spikes in economic policy uncertainty. This finding dovetails with the observation that
stock market volatility, as measured by the VIX index, tends to increase in the month before
elections. 12 We have also found evidence of sizable election-induced spikes in policy uncertainty
in other democracies around the world.
       As the 2020 election approaches, policy uncertainty in the United States is once again high
and volatile. The US EPU index reached new highs in the Spring of 2020 during the uneven U.S.
response to the COVID pandemic. A variety of important policies are likely to change if the
incumbent president is unseated. As of this writing, the election is, according to betting markets,

reasonably close and highly polarized, heralding potentially high levels of policy uncertainty in
November 2020. Perhaps the greatest danger, however, lies in an election that is still being
contested in the courts in December or January.

Notes: Coverage of the dataset for EPU and Elections. Start and end dates of the sample are determined by the availability of the EPU series. We
obtain election dates by combining the Constituency-Level Elections Archive (CLEA) (Kollman, et al. 2019) and hand-collect data to cover
elections missed by the CLEA. We choose elections that reflect popular choice of the executive, corresponding to the Parliament in Parliamentary
systems and Presidential elections in presidential systems. For more details on the choice of elections, see main text.

*: Democrats won the popular vote but lost the Presidency.

Classification of US Presidential Elections with respect to Polarization, closeness and incumbency. An election is classified as polarized
if the level of affective polarization is higher than the median value over the sample. An election is classified as close if the difference
in expected vote shares, as measured by polling, is greater than 5% on average over the three months prior to the election. A negative
Expected Margin indicates an upset, where the party winning the presidency was on average expected to lose the election. The columns
for the Democratic and Republican vote shares need not sum to 100 if there were third-party candidates. Polling data from Jennings and
Wlezien (2016).

Notes: Estimation results for restricted specification. An observation is a month and the sample
runs from April 1950 to March 2018. Column 1 reports results for the baseline regression (2).
Columns 2, 3 and 4 add interactions for election cycles classified as polarized, close or both close
and polarized respectively (see specification (3)). An election is classified as polarized if the
corresponding level of affective polarization is above the median value. An election is classified
as ex-ante close if the difference in expected vote shares is greater than 5% over the three months
prior to the election. For details on classifications of elections, see Table 3. All specifications
contain a full set of month and election cycle fixed effects. HAC Standard errors in parentheses. *

       Notes: Time series of the level of policy uncertainty and a measure of affective polarization in the
       US for elections 1952-2016. Policy uncertainty (the left axis) is measured using the level of the
       EPU normalized so that the mean level between 1985 and 2009 is 100, and then averaged across
       months within each year. For 2020, we only include data until February. Affective polarization is
       measured by the mean absolute difference in affect between parties averaged over all respondents
       and weighted by demographic weights (right axis). Ideological polarization is an analogous
       measure, calculated as the mean absolute difference in ideological positions on a Liberal ­
       Conservative scale, between parties averaged over all respondents and weighted by demographic
       weights (right axis). Policy uncertainty data from policyuncertainty.com, and our polarization data
       is created using the ANES.

Notes: Coefficients on dummies for 10 periods prior to and after an election from regression (1)
(i.e. specification (3) in Table 2). The solid line reflects the behavior of log(EPU) in a period
surrounding an election relative to periods outside a 15-month window of an election. An
observation is a country-month-year, and the Dependent variable is log(EPU). The regression is
run on the global sample of countries listed in Table 1. The shaded region depicts the 95%
confidence intervals implied by standard errors clustered at the country level.

Notes: Coefficients in the Unrestricted Regression (4), column 2. The blue line depicts the
coefficients on the dummies for a given number of periods relative to the election, while the red
line depicts the coefficients on the interaction of these dummies with an indicator for a polarized
election cycle. An observation is a month and the sample runs from April 1950 to March 2018. An
election cycle is classified as polarized if the level of affective polarization is higher than the
median value over the sample. Results are robust adding a linear time trend. The shaded areas
represent 95% confidence intervals computed using HAC Standard Errors.

Notes: Election spikes as defined in (5) over time, for i) spikes starting 6 months prior to an
election to 2 months post an election in the US (left axis) and ii) spikes starting 2 months prior to
an election to the month of the election in the US (left axis), against affective polarization (right
axis). The election spike measures the cumulative excess uncertainty (in log points) in the run-up
to an election and immediately after it, relative to the level of uncertainty prevailing in the election
cycle. We measure this spike between the May of the year of the election and the January following
the election to adequately capture the run-up in uncertainty that can result as party primary
elections and debates occur, and the resolution of uncertainty when the newly-elected government
takes office.
