A Multiple Indicators Model for Volatility Using Intra-Daily Data

                                           ABSTRACT

Many ways exist to measure and model financial asset volatility. In principle, as the frequency of

the data increases, the quality of forecasts should improve. Yet, there is no consensus about a “true”

or "best" measure of volatility. In this paper we propose to jointly consider absolute daily returns,

daily high-low range and daily realized volatility to develop a forecasting model based on their

conditional dynamics. As all are non-negative series, we develop a multiplicative error model that

is consistent and asymptotically normal under a wide range of specifications for the error density

function. The estimation results show significant interactions between the indicators. We also show

that one-month-ahead forecasts match well (both in and out of sample) the market-based volatility

measure provided by an average of implied volatilities of index options as measured by VIX.

1. Introduction


Models to describe and predict financial asset volatility abound. In practice, in addition to a
model’s capability to reproduce stylized facts in observed time series and exhibit desirable
statistical properties, the ultimate way to evaluate a model is its usefulness as a tool in many
areas such as derivative products pricing, risk evaluation and hedging, portfolio allocation, and
the derivation of Value at Risk measures.
Yet, the concept of volatility itself is somewhat elusive, as many ways exist to measure it and
hence to model it (cf. the survey by Andersen et al., 2002). In recent times, the availability of
ultra-high frequency data and the work done on them has shed new light on the concept of
volatility: as a matter of fact, data sampled at regular intra-daily intervals can be summarized into
a measure called realized volatility which under some assumptions is a consistent estimator of
the quadratic variation of the underlying diffusion process. Such a measure was widely adopted
as a target of forecast accuracy, but the dependence of the measure upon the frequency of
observation of the data makes it difficult to come to clear conclusions. In principle, the volatility
measures derived from ultra-high frequency data should prove to be more accurate, hence
allowing for forecast efficiency gains. Nevertheless, the measures that make more intensive use
of such data are prone to all sorts of microstructure problems. Bid-ask bounce (Roll, 1984),
screen fighting (Zhou, 1996), price discreteness, irregular spacing of quotes and transactions can
all bias volatility estimates.
Even if the growing literature on realized volatility has delivered promising results (Andersen et
al., 2000; Barndorff-Nielsen and Shephard, 2002), what is of interest is the appropriate way to
provide accurate forecasts in the medium-to-long run, and the problem remains open as to
whether daily or intra-daily models deliver the most successful answer. In the first category one
can mention those models favoring the existence of long memory or high persistence in the
process of volatility, such as the daily component model by Engle and Lee (1999), or the
Fractionally Integrated GARCH (FIGARCH – Baillie et al., 1996; or FIEGARCH, Bollerslev
and Mikkelsen, 1996) or Long Memory Stochastic Volatility Models (LMSV – Breidt et al.,
1998; Deo and Hurvich, 1999). Intra-daily models are more recent: Ghose and Kroner (1996)
adopt a signal plus noise model to estimate a persistent component as in Engle and Lee (1999);
Andersen and Bollerslev (1997) show how accuracy of volatility forecasts can be improved if



                                                 2
one moves to analyzing five-minute returns; Engle (2000) derives a measure of volatility from
transaction data.
The approach which we will pursue here is one in which several measures of volatility can be
jointly used to see whether different features of observed time series can deliver an enrichment
of volatility forecasting for the medium run. As a matter of fact, next to the traditional volatility
modelling from daily returns measured as the log-difference of closing prices, we can consider
absolute returns on which considerable modeling effort is present in the literature (Taylor, 1986;
Ding, Granger and Engle, 1993; Granger and Sin, 2000) and, with the already mentioned
provisos, realized volatility as the standard deviation of intra-daily returns observed at regular
intervals. Furthermore, it has long been recognized that the spread between the highest recorded
daily price and the lowest recorded daily price is a function of the volatility during the day and,
as such, can lead to an improvement of the volatility estimates. Many authors (Taylor, 1987,
Gallant et al., 1999, Chou, 2001, Alizadeh et al., 2002, Brandt and Diebold, 2002) have devoted
considerable attention to the informational content of range data extending the relationship it has
to the volatility parameter in a geometric Brownian motion context (cf. the early papers by
Parkinson, 1980, Garman and Klass, 1980, and Beckers, 1983), and comparing its persistence
characteristics with the ones of daily returns (Brunetti and Lildholdt, 2003).
It should be stressed that the three variables have different features relative to one another: the
main difference is that the daily return uses information about the closing price of the previous
trading day, while the high-low spread and the realized volatility are measured on the basis of
what is observed during the day, the former taking all trade information into account, the latter
being built on the basis of quotes sampled at discrete intervals. Thus, a zero return is not
necessarily informative about what happened during the day, and, by the same token, a high
return may signal high volatility during the day while it may just be due to an opening price
much different from the closing price the previous day but very close to the closing price of the
same trading day, with a small high-low spread. Also, note that the same value of realized
volatility may correspond to different values of the range since we could both have recorded both
high and low values fairly far apart during the day with a smooth transition of price movements
between the two, or some vivacious price swings concentrated in a short period of time. For
these reasons, they are all potentially useful.




                                                  3
In the present paper we exploit the fact that absolute returns, daily range and realized volatility
are variables evolving as functions of the underlying time-varying volatility and all exhibit the
usual conditional persistence of financial time series. They can each be considered as indicators
of volatility and since they are all non-negative-valued they can be modelled with a multivariate
extension of the Multiplicative Error Model suggested by Engle (2002).           Each indicator is
modeled as a GARCH-type process possibly augmented with weakly exogenous variables. This
estimator is robust to a range of error distribution assumptions. We show that this three-variable
model possesses interesting properties in that the forecasts for each indicator are augmented by
the presence of the other indicators lagged and by asymmetric effects from the direction of price
movements. The model can be solved dynamically for multi-period forecasts and the dynamic
interdependence accounts for a substantial departure from the standard GARCH profile of
dynamic forecasts. We can use our three equation model to predict multi-step volatility.
The model is estimated with daily index data over a relatively long sample period. A careful
specification search selects models for each equation. We calculate 22-step volatility forecasts
and compare these with one month option-implied volatilities as measured by the VIX. We
examine the forecast performance both in and out of sample and estimate a combination of
forecast equation to see whether the forecasts derived in our framework have a significant impact
in predicting the VIX. The approach is quite different from that of Blair et al. (2001) who also
analyze volatility forecasting and VIX but inserting it as a weakly exogenous variable in the
conditional variance equation for the S&P100.
The reader should expect the following: in Section 2 we discuss the Multiplicative Error Model,
with some general considerations about the estimator and its properties, and about the
specifications of the three models adopted. Data issues and model selection procedures are
described in detail in Section 3. Model performance is analyzed in Section 4 focusing on the
characteristics of the model in multi-step-ahead forecasting. In order to show the usefulness of
our forecasts when compared to a measure based on implied volatilities representing market
evaluation of volatility, in Section 5 we build multi-step-ahead volatility forecasts and we use
them as regressors in a combination of forecast regression where the (log of the) volatility index
VIX is the forecast target. Concluding remarks follow.




                                                4
2. The Model

We assume that the evolution of a non-negative valued process xt , can be described by a

Multiplicative Error Model (MEM, as discussed by Engle, 2002). That is, xt is the product of a

time varying scale factor (which depends upon the recent past of the series) and a standard
positive valued random variable. Such a specification was adopted in Engle and Russell (1998)
for durations, Manganelli (2000) for volume transaction data and Chou (2002) for high-low
range. The scale factor is identified as the conditional mean if the error distribution is assumed to
have unit mean. In general, therefore,
                             xt = µt ε t , ε t | ℑt −1 ~ i.i.d . D (1, ϕ )                                       (1)
where µt can be rather flexibly specified as
                                          p            q
                            µt = ω + ∑ α i xt −i + ∑ β j µt − j + γ ' zt                                        (2).
                                         i =1         j =1

Further terms can signal the dependence of the series on weakly exogenous variables
(summarized in the vector zt ) included in the information set available at time t − 1 . The

conditions to ensure stationarity and positive means for all possible realizations have been
discussed in Engle (2002).


The density of the error term ε t was left unspecified thus far. While in general one should
specify the true DGP, it may be possible to find robust specifications. We now consider the
family of gamma densities that have been used for ACD models.
                                                 1                  ε 
                           f (ε t | ℑt −1 ) =         ε α −1 exp  − t  .
                                                     α t
                                             Γ(α ) β                β
                                                             1
The property of unit mean1 implies that β = , namely,
                                                            α
                     1                                                    1                            x 
 f (ε t | ℑt −1 ) =       α α ε tα −1 exp ( −αε t ) ⇒ f ( xt | ℑt −1 ) =       α α xtα −1µ t−α exp  −α t       (3)
                    Γ(α )                                                Γ(α )                        µt 

    Such a condition is not restrictive at all: consider that if ε t were to be such that E (ε t ) = αβ ≠ 1 , it could be
written as β ε t with E (ε t ) = 1 and β would be a multiplicative constant to be absorbed by µt .

The process would have conditional expectation E ( xt ℑt −1 ) = µt and conditional variance

                       µt2
Var ( xt | ℑt −1 ) =       . A comparison between various densities corresponding to different choices
                       α
of α subject to the constraint is reported in Figure 1: as well known, the choice of α = 1 2 , gives
the pdf of a chi-square with one degree of freedom, while α = 1 yields the unit exponential. In
general, values of α < 1 amount to attributing more weight to extremely small or large values of
the random variable while values of α > 1 generate a hump shaped density which approaches the
normal distribution for large values of α .

Let us suppose for the moment that the only parameters of interest are the ones defining µt (let

us call them θ ), and let us look at the corresponding log-likelihood function: the relevant object
for estimation is given by
                                                T
                                                          x 
                          log L = constant − α ∑  log µt + t                             (4)
                                               t =1       µt 




                                                       6
where the constant depends only on the xt ’s and α . It is clear that in maximizing this function

with respect to θ , the value assumed by α is irrelevant, as the first order conditions must obey
                            T
                              xt − µt  ∂µt
                            ∑
                        t =1 
                                       
                                 µt2  ∂θ
                                             = 0.                                 (5)

Even from a numerical point of view, an iterative procedure is unaffected (in a Newton-type
method the α terms present in the inverse Hessian and gradient would cancel each other)
resulting in exactly the same estimates (apart from rounding off errors when numerical
derivatives are used). Furthermore, these first order conditions coincide with the ones derived
from an auxiliary model that specifies the square root of the variable of interest,       xt , as the

product of the square root of the scale factor   µt and a half Gaussian error term ν t , namely,

              xt = µt ν t ν t | ℑt −1 ~ half Gaussian (standard) .                        (6)
This model has the clear advantage of being able to exploit any GARCH software which can
estimate the parameters θ in µt from a model for        xt with no equation for the mean (as done

for the ACD model by Engle and Russell, 1998; cf. also Engle, 2002).


Clearly, the second order conditions would differ, since the Hessian will be proportional to α
(e.g. for the exponential case it would be twice the Hessian for the chi-square), and,
correspondingly, the estimated parameter variance-covariance matrices. Note, however, that
(exploiting the results of Bollerslev and Wooldridge, 1992 and Lee and Hansen, 1994) the robust
variance covariance matrix, computed as the product
                         n l −1 n l −1
                        Var (ϑ ) = H OPG H
(with H the Hessian matrix and OPG the matrix of the outer products of the gradients) provides
the obvious benefit of making this discrepancy irrelevant since the α 's cancel out:
         n 1 l −1 2 n 1 l −1 l −1 n l −1
         Var (ϑ ) = H α =1 α OPGα =1   H α =1 = H exp OPG exp H exp                      (7)
                    α                 α

The strong lesson we learn from this discussion is that in the absence of justifications on the
most appropriate distribution to adopt for the error term in an MEM, the avenue of deriving its
parameter values through the estimation of an auxiliary variance equation for the positive square




                                                  7
root of the variable of interest2 with a GARCH specification and normally distributed errors is
straightforward and provides Quasi Maximum Likelihood estimators, hence consistent and
asymptotically normal as discussed by Engle (2002), building on results by Lee and Hansen
(1994). However, if we know that a Gamma distribution assumption for ε t is appropriate, then

the same procedure delivers consistency and efficiency for the estimators if α is known. Even if
α is not known, using robust standard errors shields against the specific shape of the Gamma
distribution. Introducing α among the parameters to be estimated would provide information on
the shape of the distribution of the error term ε t (some empirical results are discussed by Engle,

2002) which would be useful for simulating future values or scenario analysis but would not
have any impact on the values of the estimates of θ , nor on their standard errors as

Cov(θl,αl ) = 0 .
More specifically for the case at hand here, let us indicate the daily closing price as Ct , and

calculate the daily returns as rt = log(Ct / Ct −1 ) . Let us thus consider squared returns rt 2 , modeled

as an MEM
                          rt2 = htrε t , ε t | ℑt −1 ~ i.i.d . D (1,ϕ r ) ;                                   (8)
where htr is the conditional mean of rt2 . The square, hlt2 , of the high-low range is defined as

hlt = log( H t / Lt ) , where H t and Lt are the highest, respectively, the lowest recorded prices

during the day, and is modeled as:
                         hlt2 = hthηt , ηt | ℑt −1 ~ i.i.d . D (1, ϕ h ) ;                                    (9)
and the square of the realized volatility, dvt , defined as the standard deviation of observed
returns over J subperiods within the day, between market opening time and market closing time3,
                          vt2 = htvζ t , ζ t | ℑt −1 ~ i.i.d . D (1, ϕ v )                               (10)


2
    As established by Ding, Granger and Engle (1993), absolute returns exhibit high levels of serial correlation and can
                                                                                                          2
themselves be adopted as the first indicator of volatility. We prefer to think of the square root of rt as absolute
returns even if the choice between writing (6) for absolute returns or for returns (with Gaussian innovations) is
irrelevant from a numerical point of view, since the first-order conditions would not change.
3
  The merits of the choice of the appropriate J to balance estimation accuracy and microstructure pitfalls are
discussed in Andersen et al. (2000): empirically, 5 minutes intervals “work” in a foreign exchange framework
(Andersen et al., 2001), 15 minutes intervals are adopted by Schwert (1998), but we still lack a theory of what is the
optimal length to choose. In this context we choose J=78 and we adopted the method discussed by Zhou (1996) on
raw data to purge bid-ask bounce effects.


                                                                 8
Put together, we can write this trivariate MEM as a system of equations
                       rt2   htr   ε t         εt        
                       2  h                              
                       hlt  =  ht  : ηt         ηt ℑt −1  ~ i.i.d . D ( ι, Φ )                                               (11)
                       v2   hv  ζ              ζ         
                       t   t   t                t        
where : indicates the Hadamard product, ι is a unit (3x1) vector, and Φ is a 3x3 matrix
representing, respectively, the mean vector and the variance-covariance matrix of the innovation
terms. The multivariate estimation problem becomes a series of univariate problems when it is
assumed that the covariance matrix is diagonal.                                      There is no loss of consistency if this
assumption is false but there can be a loss of efficiency.
We can now turn to the details of the MEM specification. Let us consider the first MEM and
write the basic form of the model for the scale factor htr as

                       htr = ω + α rt 2−1 + β htr−1            (12)
In order to take asymmetric reactions to shocks, this base model can be expanded, either by
writing a threshold-type model involving the customary dummy variable for negative returns
dt = I ( rt < 0 ) ,

                                                 htr = ω + α rt 2−1 + β htr−1 + γ rt 2−1d t −1          (13)
or even adding lagged returns rt −1 as a different way of accounting for asymmetry (as in the
APARCH model, Ding, Granger, and Engle, 1992) given that they maintain their sign,
                                      htr = ω + α rt 2−1 + β htr−1 + γ rt 2−1dt −1 + δ rt −1               (14)

The main question we want to address at this stage is whether the inclusion of the lagged
variables hlt2−1 and vt2−1 , which are part of the information set ℑt −1 , adds significant explanatory

power to the specification for htr . If so, then some of the information contained in these
indicators relates to a variability in returns which cannot be accounted for by considering just
squared returns and possible asymmetric effects. By the same token, a way to account for further
asymmetric effects when returns in the previous day are negative is to include also the product of
the indicators by the same dummy variable d t −1 . A model which would take all these effects into
account can be written as
htr = (ω r + α r rt2−1 + β r htr−1 ) + γ r rt2−1d t −1 + δ r rt −1 + ϕ r hlt2−1 + ϑr hlt2−1d t −1 + ψ r vt2−1 + λr vt2−1d t −1 ,   (15)




                                                                          9
where a subscript “r” was added to the coefficients indicating that they refer to the specification
for returns. The augmentation of the GARCH(1,1) model in this case includes the six variables
rt −1 , rt 2−1dt −1 , hlt2−1 , hlt2−1dt −1 , vt2−1 , vt2−1d t −1 which are all known at time t-1.

A similar approach can be followed for the other two indicators. Considering again
hlt2 = hthηt , and picking six relevant variables from ℑt −1 , namely, rt −1 , hlt2−1dt −1 , rt 2−1 , rt 2−1dt −1 , vt2−1 ,

vt2−1d t −1 , one can write a full specification for hth as

hth = (ω h + α h hlt2−1 + β h hth−1 ) + δ h rt −1 + γ h hlt2−1d t −1 + ϕ h rt2−1 + ϑh rt2−1d t −1 + ψ h vt2−1 + λh vt2−1d t −1.    (16)
Analogously, for the realized daily volatility indicator we start from vt2 = htvζ t and add the

corresponding six variables, vt2−1d t −1 , rt −1 , rt 2−1 , rt 2−1dt −1 , hlt2−1 , hlt2−1dt −1 , to the base specification of
a GARCH(1,1) to get
htv = (ω v + α v vt2−1 + β v htv−1 ) + δ v rt −1 + γ v vt2−1d t −1 + ϕ d rt2−1 + ϑv rt2−1d t −1 + ψ v hlt2−1 + λd hlt2−1d t −1.   (17)


The question that we will discuss in the following section is based on the characteristics of the
data that one analyzes, namely, whether adding the lagged indicators adds substantial
explanatory power to the basic GARCH specification. In fact, it may happen that the MEM for
one indicator does not require the information set to be augmented, while there may be
significant effects for another.




3. The Data, Parameter Estimation and Model Selection

For our empirical models, we will use data on the Standard and Poor 500 index from January 4,
1988 to July 14, 1999 (2730 observations); we leave the last 217 observations for out-of-sample
forecast comparison purposes. We build series for absolute returns, high-low range and realized
volatility for this period: since the constructed variables have quite different scales relative to one
another, we rescale all three variables so that they are all expressed in annual percentage terms
and they share the in-sample quadratic mean of observed returns. Some descriptive statistics are
reported in Table 1 and suggest that the absolute returns and the daily range have more
characteristics in common with one other than each of them does with daily volatility. However,




                                                                        10
a more complete picture is obtained if one looks also at the scatter-plots in Figure 2 and the
correlation coefficients between the three series reported in the last lines of Table 1.

The absolute returns lie almost invariably below the daily range, signaling that the days in which
the previous day closing price is lower (higher) than the lowest (highest) intradaily price are
infrequent. A more dispersed pattern is shown between the absolute returns and the realized
volatility as reflected also by the correlation coefficient of 0.51. The fact that the correlations are


                                                                                                      11
relatively high but not nearly unity signifies that the indicators are different from one another.
These preliminary stylized facts coupled with the characteristics of persistence exhibited by the
absolute return, the daily range and the realized volatility series (cf. Figure 3), mean that an
effort aimed at modeling the interactions between these three variables in a conditional context
seems promising.


FIGURE 3 (at the end of the paper) about here


For each of these MEMs, we envisage the introduction of any of up to six weakly exogenous
variables in addition to a GARCH(1,1)-type model which is kept as the base specification in
order to avoid coefficient identification problems. For each indicator, therefore, we are
estimating 26=64 models ranging from the most general forms (15), (16) and (17) down to the
base specification kept as a benchmark.
The two model selection strategies that we will adopt and compare are:
     1. a general-to-specific strategy whereby we start pruning the coefficients that appear to be
         statistically insignificant (using Bollerslev and Wooldridge robust standard errors) in the
         most general expressions and go on to search down to the level where all coefficients are
         significant and
     2. the smallest value of the Schwartz Information Criteria (BIC) among the 64 models.
The chosen models from the general-to-specific selection procedure are reported in Table 2.

The results show that, when evaluated in terms of coefficient significance, the inclusion of other
variables in the information set appears to add explanatory power in each of the expressions. The
model for absolute returns includes an asymmetric effect captured by rt −1 (the term rt 2−1dt −1 seems

to be less important), and both the squared daily range and the squared daily volatility. The
model for the high-low range seems to be the most parsimonious with the presence of just an
asymmetric response of h h t to lagged values of the returns. Interestingly, the one model which
attracts the highest number of significant variables is the model for the daily realized volatility in
which there appear to be asymmetric effects from all variables, as well as lagged squared returns
and lagged squared daily range. Some diagnostics (reported in the top panel of Table 3) show
that there are no major specification problems: for reference we give the values of the BIC and
the estimated log-likelihood, as well as the results of an ARCH(2) test (5% critical value = 5.99)
and the Ljung-Box test Q(12) for the squared residuals (5% critical value = 21.03).

   The specification search guided by the lowest value of the BIC gives the results we present in
   Table 4. The model selected for the daily range is the same as before. For absolute returns,
   the model selected here does not contain lagged square daily volatility; the values of the
   coefficients do not change much, so the profile of forecasts between the two models will
   differ mainly because of the impact of this variable. The model for the daily volatility here

4. Model Performance

The three models thus estimated could be used separately for one-step-ahead predictions using
the estimated coefficients and the actual value of the right-hand side variables: the performance
of these single-equation models could be individually evaluated in relationship to the
performance of the corresponding GARCH models. The interest of what is being done here,
though, lies in the fact that the three equations together can be seen as a system which can be
used as a tool for multi-step forecasting for medium horizons. Let us consider the left-hand side
as a three dimensional vector ht , and consider that at time T+1 we have

                                    h r T +1|T   ω r          

where A* is a 3 by 9 matrix which includes the coefficients on the variables the value of which
is known at time T. To forecast the various future second-order moments conditional on
information at time T for maturities greater than 1, we need to substitute the right-hand side
variables with their conditional expectation as of time T. For a generic horizon k, we will have

The dynamic properties of the estimated system can therefore be evaluated by examining the
characteristic roots of the matrix A. In principle, there could be stable complex conjugate roots
that would give the system some dampened cyclicality in the forecasting. For the case at hand
the roots for the two sets of estimates are given as in Table 5.


                            Table 5. Characteristic Roots of the Matrix A

The roots are fairly similar across the two selection procedures: one can therefore expect that the
two multi-equation models will provide different forecasting profiles for the short horizon, while
they will tend to be very similar in the medium to long run. For this reason we will report the
graphs just for the models selected according to the smallest BIC criterion.
To evaluate the performance of the models let us first consider the profile of the out-of-sample
forecasts generated by the system starting on Jan. 2, 1998, the first day after the estimation
sample, and varying the starting date. We take the observed values as starting values for day T
(corresponding to Dec. 30, 1997 and forecasting from Jan 2, 1998 to July 13, 1998), T+4
(corresponding to Jan 8, 1998), and so on until the last starting value which corresponds to Mar.
6, 1998 for a forecasting horizon going from Mar.9, 1998 to Sep. 14, 1998. In Figure 4 we


                                                                 15
superimpose various profiles of the forecasts for different starting periods and for a horizon of
132 periods ahead. The forecasts for the daily range indicator exhibit the typical monotonic
profile of a GARCH(1,1) model. This is not the case for the curves corresponding to forecasts
obtained from the other two indicators: it is interesting to note that the forecasts produced by our
model may have a non-monotonic behavior with over- (or under-) shooting of their long term
(unconditional) values at intermediate horizons.


FIGURE 4 (at the end of the paper) about here


Let us now consider the term structure of volatility for an asset (or an index) at a given maturity
T+ k as the square root of the cumulated sum of j-step-ahead forecasts generated by expression
(18), when j=1, or (19), when j is between 1 and k (cf. Engle and Patton, 2001). This corresponds
to evaluating the square root of the cumulated sum of the expected values of each volatility
indicator at any time between 1 and k. As k increases the terms of the sum will tend to repeat
themselves. We thus have

For reasons that will be clearer in the next section when we discuss the comparison of these
forecasts with the VIX volatility index, we choose a horizon k equal to 22, that is, a one-month
ahead forecasts. In Figure 5 we report the values of the cumulative volatility forecast as the
(square root of the) average of 1-step, 2-steps, …, 22-steps ahead out-of-sample forecasts
obtained by the general-to-specific three-equation system (18) and (19) relative to the standard
GARCH(1,1) specification. As one would expect, for the h h t equation the differences between

the values obtained with our model and with the standard base specification are quite minimal
and can be ascribed to the presence of lagged returns in the former specification. For the other
two indicators the results show that the estimates obtained with our model are generally higher
and more persistent than the estimates obtained with the base specification when the absolute


                                                             16
return indicator is used whereas the reverse is true for the daily realized volatility equation. A
remarkable difference is observed for estimates on or about August 31, 1998 for which the base
specification provides much higher estimates. Whether this signals excessive volatility forecasts
by the latter set of models is an issue that requires a type of more specific evaluation. What we
need is an overall comparison of the two sets of forecasts gauged in reference to a market-based
volatility measure such as the volatility index VIX. We turn to this in the next section.

5. A Volatility Index as a Forecast Target

The Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE) is the world’s largest options exchange where
standardized stock and index options are traded.4 Among these options, CBOE offers an
(American-style) index option on the S&P 100 index called OEX, the value of which is
established as 100 times the current value of the index (e.g. on July 25, 2001 the index was
613.95 and hence the dollar value of the index was $61,395). OEX options are the most actively
traded on the CBOE and are very liquid. One interesting feature of OEX is that in 1993 the
CBOE created a volatility index called VIX, which is calculated as a weighted average of the
implied volatilities from eight at-the-money call and put options on the OEX which have an
average time to maturity of 30 days. The VIX index therefore measures the implied volatility of
a hypothetical option that is at-the-money and has 30 days to expiration.5 The behavior of the
series from Jan. 4, 1988 to Dec. 14, 1998 is shown in Figure 6. Standard Augmented Dickey
Fuller tests show that the unit root hypothesis is rejected, although the degree of persistence in
the series is very high.
For the purposes of this paper, the analysis of VIX in reference to volatility estimates with a
multiple indicator conditional model is relevant because we can use the value of VIX as a target
for our volatility estimates. Under several auxiliary assumptions, the optimal forecast of
volatility from past prices should match the Black-Scholes at-the-money implied volatility.
However, information such as forthcoming announcements known to traders but not to the

  The value of the index is reckoned to measure investors’ fears. A very high value signals bearishness as downward
risk is perceived to be higher than upward risk. Chartists look at VIX for possible trend reversals.

econometricians may lead to episodes of positive or negative discrepancies. The 22-period-ahead
horizon for the term structure of volatilities was chosen to ensure compatibility with the horizon
considered when VIX is constructed.6

We will therefore examine two main issues:
    •   whether the volatility forecasts provided by each set of MEMs (base and system
        specifications) and grouped according to the indicator they refer to contribute to the
        explanation of the behavior of the VIX index both in and out of sample. We will thus test
        whether the coefficients of the forecasts (grouped by indicator) are jointly equal to zero in
        a regression framework;
    •   whether the volatility forecasts provided by the MEMs for each indicator with a base
        specification and with a system specification help in explaining the behavior of the VIX
        index both in and out of sample. We will thus test whether the coefficients of each group
        of forecasts (base and system) are jointly equal to zero in a regression framework.
In order to answer these questions we ran two sets of regressions each over two separate periods
(estimation sample and out-of-sample). The slope coefficient and intercept may adjust for the
differences between the S&P500 and the S&P100 options and for potential, un-modeled

6
 We are not overly concerned with the fact that VIX Is calculated on the S&P100 index while we are calculating
volatility measures on the S&P500. The two indices have a high correlation (in the sample period of interest here




                                                       18
volatility risk premia. In this context, we use both the forecasts provided by the models selected
according to the smallest BIC criterion and to general-to-specific model selection procedure,
since they provide partially different outcomes. Two models were estimated, both using the log
of VIX as the dependent variable and the log of the one month volatility forecasts according to
the base specification, and the system MEMs as independent variables. The difference between
the two is that the second includes an AR(1) correction. It is not surprising that there would be
serial correlation in these estimates. Differences between the optimal econometric forecast of
volatility and implied volatilities would naturally arise from the reduced information set used by
the econometrician. For example, an upcoming election would be incorporated in VIX but not
GARCH and this would persist for many days.
The results are shown in Table 7 where we report the results of the in-sample and out-of-sample
analysis with the top panel referring to the smallest BIC selection criterion and the bottom one to
the results obtained with the general-to specific approach. The results are show that, with a few
exceptions, all coefficients are individually statistically significant. One notices that in all
specifications the constant term is highly significant and positive, signaling that the volatility
estimates together somewhat underestimate the volatility level. This could just be due to the fact
that our volatility estimates are referred to a wider-based index taking the average over a larger
number of stocks or it could be due to the American option premium in the OEX contract or it
could be due to a volatility risk premium. The specification which seems to have better
properties is one in which an AR(1) correction is introduced which interestingly, keeps the joint
explanatory power of the variables we derived. Beside an obvious improvement in the R2 and in
the value of the likelihood function, the diagnostics show the expected improvement since the
residual autocorrelation and ARCH effects are reduced. The contribution of various sets of
forecasts is assessed by means of HAC Wald F-tests and reported in the lower part of each panel.
We test whether each forecast has an impact by type of indicator (rows labeled absolute returns,
daily range or realized volatility) or by type of method (base specification or system
specification) by means of Wald-type tests. There is no clear indication of a better in-sample
model performance as a consequence of the selection criterion adopted. In both sets of results
one notices that some negative coefficients appear: concentrating on the high-low range, for


about 98% for the returns and 99% for the returns squared, with high cross-correlations). One should keep in mind
that the S&P500 is an average over a larger number of stocks and hence has a potentially lower volatility.


                                                       19
example, other things being equal, an increase in the forecast of the volatility value for this type
of indicator would imply a reduction in the value of VIX. However, it is unlikely that other
things are equal.
The same kind of analysis may be carried over to an out-of-sample combination of forecasts
exercised over the period January 2, 1998 to November 10, 1998, in which the same variable
(log(VIX)) is regressed on a constant and on the (logs of) 22-day-ahead volatility forecasts
obtained from the same models, keeping the coefficients fixed at their estimated in-sample
values. The results, again broken down between lowest BIC models and general-to-specific
models, are presented in the last columns under the heading Out of Sample. Once again, the
AR(1) correction achieves a substantial reduction in the values of the residual diagnostics tests
and, again, the significance of each set of forecasts is maintained judging from the F-tests. The
lowest BIC provides a slightly better performance: all parameters are significant. Some features
of this combination of forecasts can also be assessed graphically (Figure 7) since it seems that
the highest variance appears to correspond to periods in which the VIX index is higher and more
volatile.

6. Conclusions

The motivation for this paper stems from the consideration that various volatility indicators used
in the literature (absolute daily returns, daily high-low range and intra-daily realized volatility)
may present features which should be jointly combined in a dynamic model to enhance the
information content of individual measures. We have adopted a novel approach, called
Multiplicative Error Model (Engle, 2002), which is suited to model the conditional behavior of
positively valued variables choosing a convenient GARCH-type structure to model persistence.
It turns out that a wide variety of error assumptions can be accommodated with a standard easy-
to-use procedure and inference conducted on the basis of the robust variance covariance matrix.
For the problem at hand the chosen specification for the MEM is multivariate and is suitable to
be dynamically solved for short to medium range forecasting horizons. For the data at hand
(Standard and Poor 500), we show that the approach is rewarding in that the retained
specifications for each indicator are augmented by the presence of lagged values of other
indicators. In particular, we obtain the result that daily range and returns have explanatory power
for realized volatility, and daily range is the indicator with the most parsimonious model.
We evaluate the performance of this model by producing 22-step-ahead volatility forecasts for
each of the three indicators and by using them in a regression framework to detect their
explanatory power for an index of market volatility such as the VIX index. The results show that
the model performs well, with significant persistence of the VIX index being captured by this
forecasts both individually and grouped either by type of indicator and by type of specification
adopted.
The estimator thus derived is efficient when the choice of error distribution is within the class of
a Gamma distribution: it retains consistency when other more flexible and time-varying density
specifications may be more appropriate and research is under way to identify such densities. By
the same token, in the present context we adopted a diagonal structure for the variance
covariance matrix of the error terms, and further efficiency gains could be achieved by
considering more complex structures of correlations among the error terms, paralleling the
literature on multivariate GARCH models.
