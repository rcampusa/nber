              United States-Japan Economic Relations

     The bilateral relationship with Japan now dominates American
thinking on the benefits and costs of foreign trade. This paper
reevaluates the past and future course of U.S.-Japan economic
relations.  It identifies six distinct aspects of the
relationship that may underlie the continuing friction:
bilateral imbalance on merchandise
Japan to the United States, the     trade, capital flows from
sectoral trade distortions,     yen/dollar  exchange rate,
                            Japan's  technological
societal differences. For each source of conflict, catch-up, and
causes and potential remedies are assessed.          the main

      Several important conclusions emerge from the analysis.
 First, although the bilateral trade and capital-account
 imbalances were produced
                          primarily by macroeconomic factors and
 can therefore be viewed as "temporary" rather than long-term
developments, elimination of the imbalances without serious
damage may be difficult to achieve. In terms of sectoral
adjustments, the U.S.-Japan relationship is entering a new phase
as the two nations grow more similar in terms of technology base,
abundance of capital and skilled labor, and per capita income.
Two-way trade in technology and in technologybased services will
become increasingly important, while both nations will cope with
similar problems of adjustment to pressure from a new tier of
competitors in Asia and elsewhere. As the
                                            aggregate imbalances
diminish, sectoral trade conflict will be Concentrated
ends of the technology                                  on the two
                        spectrum, with issues raised both by
conflicting approaches to the phasing out of uncompetitive
industries and by the nurturing of new technologybased
industries.

    The bilateral relationship with Japan now dominates American
thinking on the benefits and costs of foreign trade. Japan has
become the model of all things modern and efficient, the standard
against which the United States measures its own economy and

finds itself wanting. But Japan is also firmly established as
the villain in the industrial adjustment woes that have plagued
the United States in recent years; most Americans remain unaware
that Japan has encountered many of the same difficulties in
reducing excess capacity, often in the same industries.

     Such paradoxes typify the intense and stormy relationship
between the world's economic superpowers. Against a background
of ever-increasing bilateral imbalances, ever-escalating
protectionist rhetoric, and even some action at the official
level, individual Americans continue to vote with their dollars

for still more Japanese imports. Can U.S. producers hope to
reverse the trend? Can American consumers be persuaded to give
up their Toyotas and their Sonys in favor of domestic goods?

These questions are themselves rapidly becoming obsolete. Thanks
to the recent flood of Japanese direct investments into U.S.
manufacturing industries, it is now often possible to "buy

American" without sacrificing Japanese design and quality.

    This paper reevaluates the past and future course of U.S.-
Japan economic relations. The first section asks whether there
is indeed a "Japan problem" and, if so, exactly what that problem
is. Section 2 examines the macroeconomic roots of the U.S.-
Japan bilateral trade imbalance and weighs alternative
macroeconomic remedies. Section 3 deals with trade issues at the
sectoral level. Section 4 reviews the technological rivalry
between the United States and Japan. Section 5 draws some
conclusions and looks to the future of the relationship.

1.    Is There a Japan Problem?

      Given the surfeit of recent writings, both scholarly and

popular, on the unprecedented size and
                                         continuing growth of the
U.S. -Japan trade imbalance, it may seem odd to ask what the

problem is, let alone whether a problem exists. Yet in some

important respects, Japan is perhaps better seen as part of the
solution rather than the source of the problem. To see why, it
is helpful to examine the various aspects of the U.S. -Japan

economic relationship that may underlie the continuing friction.
Here there are at least six possible candidates:

      (1) Growing bilateral imbalance on merchandise trade,
           Particularly on trade in manufactured goods
     (2) Growing net capital inflows from Japan to the United
           States

     (3) The yen/dollar exchange rate and perhaps also the
           present system of exchange-rate determination
     (4) Sectoral nontariff barriers (whether real or imagined)

           limiting Japanese imports of U.S. products and Japanese

           trade-distorting industrial policies, and export
           incentives depriving U.S. firms of sales at home and in
           third- country markets
     (5) Successful emulation by Japan of the technological
           supremacy of U.S. industry
     (6)   Social, economic, political, and cultural differences
           between the two nations.
                                    4

        These categories are not mutually exclusive. Automotive
products loom so large in total bilateral trade that this
"sectoral" issue necessarily has implications for aggregate

imbalances. The narrowing technological gap is intimately linked
to the sectoral composition of trade and is itself affected by
Japanese policies to promote economic growth. And while cultural
and social conditions in, say, Indonesia are equally exotic to an
American observer, Americans are much more interested in -- and
worried about --   contrasts    between Japan and the United States

precisely because of the growing economic rivalry. Still, it is
helpful to sort out the relative importance of each type of
irritant and to examine the main causes and potential remedies in
each.



1.1. Aggregate imbalance

        Highly aggregated measures of bilateral interaction are
regarded by most economists as the visible "symptoms" of
underlying macroeconomic conditions -- and, specifically,
caused either by defects of trade or industrial policies at home
or by skillful application of the same abroad. While the
symptoms are themselves problematic, the causes and thus the
effective potential remedies are to be found at the macroeconomic
level. Yet the justification of every new proposal for trade
legislation prominently features the latest hitherto unimaginable
data on the nation's global external imbalance and bilateral
deficit with Japan - -   with   the strong implication that tough new
                                 5

 trade policies (or creative new competitiveness policies)
                                                           are the
 measures required for the United States to redress the present
 imbalance.



 1.2. Capital inflows

      Matching Japanese global surpluses on merchandise trade and
 current account are massive foreign investments. The recent

 rates have been rivaled only by the petrodollar flood of the
 l970s. But the petrodollars
                              were recycled primarily through the
 Eurodollar market and went ultimately to many borrowers. In

 contrast, Japanese funds (autodollars?) have in large measure
moved directly into U.S. financial markets. Thus, while there is
no conceptual reason why the nation's largest bilateral

merchandise trade deficit and its largest bilateral capital-
account surplus should be with the same trading partner, it is

certainly true in this instance. If the oil surpluses had
materialized later, or if U.S. fiscal policy had changed sooner,
it is likely that more liabilities of the U.S. Treasury would
                                                              now
be held by Saudi Arabia, and fewer by Japan.

     The rapidly growing U.S. official debt to foreigners (or,
indeed, to anyone) raises important issues of intergenerational

equity. However, the concerns of many Americans focus on one
particular component of the capital inflows, direct foreign
investments in U.S. industries. On one hand, state and local
officials vie to attract new investments --
                                            jobs and the future
tax base are the main reasons. But
                                    domestic firms worry about
                                6

new competition as well as the effects on their own labor costs

and taxes.
     Apparently oblivious to U.S. official insistence on national

treatment by foreign governments for American subsidiaries
abroad, the president of Ford Motor Company called in early 1987

for further reductions in auto imports from Japan, to compensate
for increased production by Japanese plants in the United States.
In the troubled U.S. semiconductor industry, national security
concerns were raised in objection to the proposed acquisition of

Fairchild Semiconductor by Fujitsu, Japan's largest computer
           1
company.



1.3. The dollar/yen exchange rate
     The exchange rate, too, is viewed by economists as
fundamentally a symptom rather than a cause. However, the

relationships determining exchange-rate movements are poorly
understood. Professional opinion remains divided particularly on
the appropriate role and effectiveness of official intervention

in foreign-exchange markets, either directly, via purchases or
sales of foreign exchange, or indirectly, via manipulation of
discount rates.

     Through 1985, dollar strength offered a plausible
explanation of the nation's growing deficit on merchandise trade.

     1
        In August 1987, National Semiconductor Corporation
announced that it would buy Fairchild - - at what industry
analysts described as a bargain price, far less than that offered
earlier by Fujitsu. National was one of several U.S. companies
that opposed the sale to Fujitsu.
                                    7

  But the subsequent dramatic decline in the dollar failed
                                                            to
  induce a corresponding turnaround in U.S. trade performance.

 Analysts then rushed in to explain the non-event with traditional
 J-curves and newer "hysteresis"
                                 effects. While differing in
 their microeconomic underpinnings, both theories
                                                  suggest that for
 foreign trade, what goes up does not necessarily come down,
                                                                 or at
 least not as quickly as
                         policymakers would like. As a result of
 continuing growth in the U.S. trade deficit, a yen/dollar

 exchange rate of 160, seen in 1986 by American officials as an

 appropriate policy target, had given way to target values of 140
 or below by mid-1987.


 1.5. Who's the problem?

     While the domestic
                           consequences of large bilateral
 imbalances and major exchange-rate
                                        movements surely constitute
unsolved problems for U.S. policymakers, it is difficult to make

a convincing case that the basic fault lies with the Japanese
rather than elsewhere. True, the imbalances reflect mismatch
between the macroeconomic
                          conditions and policies of Japan and
the United States. But if the main problem is simply the
                                                              large
aggregate imbalance, the main cause is macroeconomic policy in
the United States.

     Indeed, only Japan's offsetting surpluses permitted the U.S.
economy to enjoy moderate growth during the l980s while
continuing on an unchanged macroeconomic course.
                                                      In retrospect,
perhaps the United States should have altered its fiscal policies
                                8

sooner. Does that mean Japan is at fault for leaving the United
States "free to choose" instead of being forced to confront
immediately the full implications of its actions?


1.6. Sectoral distortions
    Although customarily raised along with the issue of growing
bilateral imbalance, sectoral trade distortions present a
conceptually different type of problem for the United States.

The primary effect of such policies is to reduce the mutual
benefits from trade based on comparative advantage. While
individual firms and even industries often stand to gain from

distortive sectoral policies, national gains from export
promotion or import restriction are likely to be the exception
rather than the rule.2
     The conclusion that trade policies, whether good or bad,
affect mainly the composition of trade rather than the aggregate
balance stems from a general-equilibrium view of economic

activity. Simply put, although a trade policy may change the
balance of trade for a particular product or even an industry,
offsets arise via induced movements in exchange rates and input

costs, foreign retaliation, and other indirect channels.3

     2
        For a summary of the practical difficulties in using
trade policy tIstrategicallyt to promote national advantage, see
Richardson (1986).
        See McCulloch and Richardson (1986, pp. 61-64). Although
protectionist measures are traditionally condemned as beggar-thy-
neighbor policies, in reality they often turn out to be beggar-
thy-brother policies, impairing performance of other industries
in the same country. This is an important distinction for public
                                  9

      Likewise, any positive employment effects in a specific
 sector are offset by reduced
                              employment opportunities in other
 areas. Moreover, to the extent that the jobs "saved" are in
 relatively inefficient firms or in activities where the United
 States has lost comparative
                             advantage, the overall composition of
 employment opportunities may be adversely affected.4 Still, this
 does not alter the important
                              economic and political issues raised
 by the distribution of the gains from maintaining
                                                     relatively open
 international markets.

     A separate concern is the changing composition of U.S.
production. If the level of domestic
                                      activity in particular
manufacturing industries has important positive effects on other
parts of the economy, loss of market share in such "strategic"
activities could reduce future U.S. industrial competitiveness
across the board. No clear evidence of such externalities is
                                                              yet
available, but some fear that further
                                      delay in reversing present

servants, who seem relatively unconcerned about costs inflicted
outside the nation's (or even the congressional district's)
borders. For some examples of
                               undercutting indirect effects of
trade policies, see Baldwin (1982).

        An Opposite argument is sometimes made by analysts
concerned about deindustrialization  of the U.S. economy. They
believe that foreign targeting of basic   and hightechnology
manufacturing industries reduces u.s.
                                       employment opportunities in
"high-valueatI activities. But high        value-added per worker
may simply reflect firms' optimizing
rather than a technological           responses  to strong unions,
is far from obvious that    characteristic   of the industry. It
                         national policy ought to bolster the
resulting wage advantage by limiting imports. In the case of
steel, probably the industry most
employment in the United States andfrequently
                                     other
                                               targeted worldwide,
                                            industrialized
countries has dropped
                      dramatically while wages remain well above
the U.S. average for comparable skills and experience.
                               10

trends may leave the United States at a permanent competitive

disadvantage.


1.7. How important are trade distortions?
     The existence of subtle trade-distorting policies and

industrial practices on the part of Japan is acknowledged by
almost all international economists. The more interesting
question is how important such policies are in shaping the
overall relationship between Japan and the rest of the world, and
particularly with the United States. While there are differences
of opinion concerning the importance of such distortions to the
performance of individual sectors (see, for example, Borrus and
Zysman, 1985), there is broad agreement that the consequences for
the size of the aggregate imbalance are minor.
     Even when there are significant benefits to be achieved by
negotiating reductions in sectoral trade distortions, it is
crucial that this task be divorced from the more pressing
macroeconomic issues.5 The persistent linkage of aggregate and
sectoral issues allows policymakers to delay needed macroeconomic
remedies and promotes U.S. allegations of bad faith on the part
of Japanese officials when inappropriate means fail to achieve

their stated ends.


        Moreover, even the existence of a real distortion does
not assure that "corrective" policies will actually make things
better rather than worse. Examples such as textiles and apparel,
steel, autos, and semiconductors suggest that cartelization, not
active competition based on comparative advantage, is the likely
outcome of sectoral policy initiatives.

 1.8. Thchno1ogjca rivalry

      Perhaps most significant to the long-range development of
 the U.S. -Japan relationship is the successful emulation
                                                          by Japan
 of American technology.based
                               economic growth. While many nations
 have sought to close the technology gap with the United States,
 only Japan has come so far so fast.
                                          Once primarily an importer
 and adapter of technologies
                               developed elsewhere, Japan now rivals
 the United States in many areas of industrial innovation.

      Japan's challenge to American technological supremacy has
 important implications for the composition of bilateral trade
 flows. Through much of the post-World War II period, access to

 superior technology allowed the United States to compete
 effectively on world markets while
                                        maintaining average wages well
above those abroad. U.S. industrial exports were
                                                   increasingly
concentrated in the hightechnology
                                     industries, while the
remainder of U.S. manufacturing lost
                                      ground to foreign suppliers.
But with the loss of its decisive
                                  technological lead, U.S.
industry can no longer compete on the basis of unique products or
advanced processes alone. As a consequence, earnings in U.S.

manufacturing are becoming more closely linked to those in Japan
and other nations with access to advanced technologies and
                                                               to the
capital required to implement them.

     Another long-term issue is the influence of the "Japanese
model" of industrial development
                                 on policy choices of developing
nations, especially in Asia. Does the future hold "many Japans"
                                12

competing with the United States in world markets? South Korea
is often labeled the next Japan because of its successes in
promoting the same export industries -- successes fostered in
part by North American and European trade discrimination directed

at Japan's most competitive export industries. Nationalistic
Koreans reject the implied linkage with its one-time oppressor
but often privately admire Japan's economic strategy. Other
newly-industrializing nations are also studying Japan's
industrial policy and in some cases adopting certain elements.

The spectre of a world economy dominated by many nations all
saving, innovating, and exporting at Japanese rates raises
obvious concerns in the West.
     Beyond the important but narrow issue of increased

competition in high-technology manufacturing industries, the
challenge to the U.S. lead in scientific and technological areas
may have implications for the nation's key role in global
security systems. This latter issue is linked to the ambivalence
of the United States and its allies regarding increases in

Japan's military expenditures. Japan's military budget for 1987
broached the "one percent threshhold" relative to gross national
product for the first time since the end of World War II.



1.9. Being different
     The final but by no means minor problem area in U.S. -Japan

relations arises from the myriad social, political, and economic
structures of the Japanese nation that contrast so sharply with
                                    13
  their U.S. counterparts     While the net contribution of these
  differences to relative
                         economic performance and to the bilateral
 imbalances remains largely in the realm of conjecture,
                                                        many
 serious suggestions for relieving tensions between the two
 nations are based on efforts to reduce these differences,
                                                           whether
 by making the United States more like Japan (higher
                                                        savings,
 quality circles, a Cabinet1evel Department of Trade and
 Industry) or by making Japan more like the United States

 (deductability of mortgage interest, shorter work week, bigger
 defense budget). Made forcefully, such suggestions in effect
 challenge the relevance of traditional notions of national

 sovereignty in an increasingly interdependent
                                                 world economy.
      The importance of the many departures of Japanese

governmental and business practice from Western norms remains an
area of controversy even
                         among scholars. Overall, political
scientists such as Johnson (1982) seem more willing than

economists to attribute Japanese industrial and trade
                                                      successes
to unique structural features. But even economists are divided

on the importance of Japanese industrial policy and
                                                    government
firm relationships in comparison to a high savings rate
                                                        as key
factors underlying the "Japanese miracle."

     Contrasting economic and political systems also complicate
the narrower issue of what constitutes a level playing field
                                                                   in
trade and investment matters.
                                 Allegations of sectoral trade
distortions often arise from differences in administrative
structure and industrial
                            organization. So far, neither u.s.
                               14

trade law nor the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)
has been able to deal effectively with the resulting disputes.
Bilateral negotiations and ad hoc agreements, often short-lived,

remain the major approach for addressing U.S.-Japan sectoral
trade conflicts.

    A darker side of the contrasts between the two nations lies
below the surface. The overt U.S. racism of the World War II era
has receded, but subtle racism is a plausible explanation for the
very different official and private attitudes of Americans toward

Japan (and the newly-industrializing "four little dragons" of
Asia) and toward Canada or Europe. Government officials and the
media pass up no opportunity to remind the public of the
gargantuan U.S. deficit on trade with Japan, but how many
Americans realize that the nation's second largest bilateral
deficit is on trade with Canada?6

     However, racial prejudice is a two-way street, as Prime
Minister Nakasone's well-publicized gaffe in 1986 amply
demonstrated. In a nation where careful checks of ancestry are

part of the usual preparation for marriage, many Japanese
privately view the eclipse of U.S. industrial might as the
inevitable consequence of its ethnic and racial diversity.
     On this last score there may be grounds for some modest

     6
        Relative to gross national product, the Canadian surplus
on trade with the United States actually exceeds Japan's. But in
early 1987, Canadian government statisticians showed that U.S.
recording procedures have systematically missed certain U.S.
exports, particularly those transported by truck into Canada.
U.S. statistics have thus overstated the U.S. merchandise trade
deficit and particularly the bilateral deficit with Canada.

optimism The intensification of
                                    economic ties between the United
States and Japan has promoted a great desire on the
                                                    part of each
nation for better
                  understanding of the other. Even if the
primary motivation on each side springs from the lure of a large
and lucrative foreign
                      market, the resulting familiarity with a
Previously alien and inscrutible
                                    society can help to smooth those
frictions based on differences alone.

2.   Macroeconomic Roots of U.S. International Imbalance

     Like an economic Sputnik, the rapid growth of the U.S. trade
imbalance galvanized the American public. To many observers,
escalation of the U.S. trade deficit in the l980s was simply
tangible and dramatic evidence of the nation's declining
industrial competitiveness, in turn reflecting erosion of the

commanding lead in science and technology the United States once

enjoyed. Others variously sought explanations in trade-
distorting practices abroad, export disincentives at home, and
poor management practices of U.S. companies. Likewise, Japan's
ever-increasing surpluses were interpreted either as evidence of

Japanese bad faith in complying with agreements to open its
markets to foreign goods or as confirmation of the wisdom of

Japanese private and public economic management.
     Each explanation spawned a detailed agenda of private and
public action designed to arrest the decline. As with any broad
policy initiative, both wise and foolish proposals have been

advanced in the name of increased competitiveness. But for
reasons discussed below, most of these proposals would do nothing

to reduce the aggregate imbalance.7


2.1. The U.S. budget deficit
     While the competitiveness frenzy continued unabated, an

        McCulloch (1985) and McCulloch and Richardson (1986)
examine in detail the types of policies usually recommended to
restore U.S. competitiveness and evaluate their likely effects
(or lack of effects) on the nation's overall trade balance or
current account.
                                       17

 alternative analysis offered a very different assessment of the

 forces underlying rapid escalation of the U.S. trade deficit.
 According to this view, promoted as early as 1982 by the Council
 of Economic Advisors, the growth of the trade deficit was the

 largely predictable result of a single important macroeconomic
 development in the United States: a major increase in the size
 of the federal budget deficit.        The corresponding prescription
 for restoration of U.S. competitiveness: cut the budget deficit.

         The Council's macroeconomic
                                        explanation, initially met by
 disbelief and even ridicule,
                                 gained broad acceptance as the
 continued tandem rise of the "twin deficits" offered further
circumstantial evidence in support of a linkage. The basic
insight was, at least after the fact,
                                            a rather simple one. The
large increase in the federal deficit translated into a

comparable drop in the nation's total
                                            saving, pushing up U.S.
interest rates. Drawn in by higher rates, foreign funds filled
the gap. But the foreign demand for U.S. assets also drove
                                                                  up
the value of the dollar,
                         pricing U.S. goods out of many markets
at home and abroad. Thus, rather
                                  than crowding out domestic
capital formation as some had initially feared, the larger
federal deficit crowded out domestic production of tradable
goods.

     Like most simple explanations, this one was too simple. The
analysis focused on the U.S. demand for foreign funds but

slighted important factors that influenced the supply of those
funds to the U.S. market.  While the enlarged federal deficit
                                 18

alone would have put upward pressure on domestic interest rates
and promoted U.S. capital inflows, the actual size of those
inflows was also the result of important "supply" factors in

international capital markets.


2.2. Capital inflows and exchange rates
     In addition to its neglect of factors influencing the supply

of funds to U.S. borrowers, the conventional wisdom implied that
the appreciation of the dollar was a necessary consequence of the

inflow of foreign funds. In fact, the theoretical consequences
of a financial transfer for the exchange rate are ambiguous,
depending crucially on spending patterns at home and abroad. The

more similar those spending patterns and the larger the
proportion of total expenditure devoted to tradable goods, the
less the exchange rate would have to move to "effect" the

transfer of current purchasing power to the United States.
     Thinking in these terms helps to explain how the dollar

could fall so much with capital inflows still rising. The
prolonged period of a very strong dollar caused permanent changes
in consumer information and in producer costs of serving the U.S.

market. Specifically, at a given exchange rate, more U.S.
consumers would choose foreign products over their domestic
counterparts when priced comparably in dollars, while foreign
producers would be able to set lower dollar prices for goods

aimed at the U.S. market. Both types of changes are hysteresis
effects. They rest on once-and-for-all changes in demand and
                                     19

 supply conditions, rather than the short-term
                                                      sluggishness,
 especially of demand, that underlies the J-curve analysis.8


 2.3. The    supply   of foreign funds
      If growth in the federal budget deficit explains the
                                                           greatly
 increased U.S. appetite for foreign funds, it is only one of
                                                              many
 reason why foreign lenders stood ready to satisfy that appetite.
 Other factors influencing the supply of foreign funds to U.S.
 capital markets can be grouped into three
                                                 categories. Of these,
 two apply to lenders
                     generally (including U.S. lenders, who cut
back their own foreign loans in favor of domestic alternatives),
while the third is specific to the
                                          most important foreign lender,
Japan:

         (1) Increased attractiveness of U.S. investments,

             reflecting, among others, enhanced tax incentives for
             capital formation, financial and industrial
             deregulation, repeal of the withholding tax on earnings
             of U.S. assets held by foreigners, and successful anti-

             inflationary macroeconomic polic ies
     (2) Reduced attractiveness of lending abroad, due to

             economic stagnation in much of Europe and the debt
             problems and capital flight affecting many less-
             developed countries

     (3) Increased capital outflows from Japan, resulting from

     8
        On supply-side hysteresis effects arising from economies
of scale and sunk costs, see Baldwin (1986).
                               20

          liberalization of restrictions on capital outflows
          (accelerated at the request of the United States as

          part of the 1984 dollar-yen agreement9) and lower

          Japanese budget deficits.
Even without the large increase in U.S. federal deficits, these
factors would have tended to push the U.S. capital account toward
surplus, putting upward pressure on the international value of

the dollar and downward pressure on U.S. merchandise trade

performance.


2.4. Stock adjustments and continuing flows
     A further complication in the link between the U.S. budget
deficit and U.S. borrowing from abroad is that the rise in the

deficit created an ongoing demand for foreign capital, while the
inflows from abroad have reflected both one-time readjustments of
asset holdings in response to new market conditions and ongoing
supply effects. In the specific case of capital inflows from
Japan, the liberalization of capital outflows resulted in a

sizable shift of accumulated Japanese assets into U.S. securities
with higher yields. But the chronic surplus of Japanese private
savings over domestic absorption of those savings (by domestic
capital formation or government deficit spending) translates into
an ongoing supply influence that can be expected to push new

        See Frankel (1985) for a review of this agreement. The
agreement was promoted as a means to raise the value of the yen
by increasing its role as a reserve currency. However, the
predictable short-run result, borne out by subsequent events, was
just the opposite.
                                 21

 capital into world markets year after year.

      Over time, the resulting increases in foreign holdings of
 U.S. assets and in U.S. holdings of foreign assets have direct

 implications for the composition of the current account and for
 the relative value of the dollar. The rising net indebtedness of
 the United States should mean rising net outflows of interest and

profits, pushing the U.S. services account toward deficit. For a
given level of net capital inflow, rising debt service entails a

shrinking deficit on merchandise trade and less upward pressure
on the value of the dollar.'0 This compositional effect within

the balance of payments would tend to reinforce the influence of

hysteresis on equilibrium exchange rates.


2.5. Correcting the aggregate imbalance

     Given the full set of contributing macroeconomic conditions,
what can be said about the outcomes of alternative corrective

policies? The U.S. external imbalance reflects an excess of
total "absorption" - - spending
                                (public plus private) for both
consumption and investment purposes -- over production in the
United States, and a corresponding shortfall of absorption

relative to production abroad. Measures to reduce the imbalance
can seek to reduce the U.S. spending excess or to reduce the

     10
         The assumption that net capital inflows are independent
of current earnings on past investments is, however, suspect.
Tax law in the United States and some other nations tends to
favor reinvestment abroad of current earnings from foreign
investments. Other governmental policies toward international
capital transactions may also link the rate of new investment to
current interest and profits.
                                  22

foreign shortfall.


2.5.1. Reducing U.S. absorption
     The most obvious choices for direct U.S. action have become

the bread and butter of national policy debate: raise taxes, cut
government spending, or both. A third alternative for bringing
total U.S. spending into line is to reduce domestic capital

formation. This option, seldom explicitly considered, has
obvious negative implications for the future growth of U.S.

productive capacity. However, it may be chosen by default if
policymakers are unable to cut total public and private spending
for other purposes, or if new taxes enacted to reduce the deficit

also reduce incentives for domestic investment.
     Moreover, even a successful effort to reduce the budget
deficit need not produce a comparable reduction in the nation's

demand for capital imports. Although customarily described in
terms of the increased federal deficit, the root of the nation's

increased appetite for foreign funds (or, equivalently, of its
increased deficit on current account) is actually increased
spending --   specifically,   the increase in total domestic

absorption of goods and services. Because changes in the federal

government's plans for taxing and spending usually have important
effects on decisions of state and local governments and of the
private sector, merely reducing the federal deficit does not

necessarily have a comparable effect on total absorption; major
                                23

 offsets are possible.11



 2.5.2. Raising foreign absorption
      As a practical matter, progress on deficit reduction has
 been slow in coming, and conflicts between President Reagan and

 the Democratica11ycontrolled U.S. Congress are likely to make
 things even more difficult in 1987 and 1988.   Meanwhile, Treasury
 Secretary James Baker III has pushed U.S. trading partners,

especially West Germany and Japan, to assume more responsibility
for effecting the desired adjustment. In the case of Japan,
proposals have focused on means to reduce the Japanese savings

surplus by increasing domestic consumption and investment
spending. This could perhaps be accomplished by general economic
stimulation, but the prospects are most favorable for narrowly-
targeted policies intended to raise specific components of

Japanese spending.

     The two areas mentioned most often in this connection are

housing and public works. For housing, relatively modest changes
in Japanese tax laws and financial regulation could make

mortgage-financed owner-occupied housing far more attractive than
it is today, thereby presumably increasing total expenditures in


     11
         An ongoing debate concerns the relative effects of tax-
financed and bond-financed government expenditures. The issues
are complex, hinging on such imponderables as the public's
anticipation of future changes in tax rates. An extreme view is
that, because of public anticipation of future tax liability,
bond-financed spending has the same overall effect on today's
absorption as tax-financed spending.
                               24

that category and probably overall.12

     Increased government spending for highways, railroads, and
especially sewers is a second potential area of expanded domestic

absorption. By Western standards, Japanese spending in these
areas is surprisingly low. Fewer than three Japanese households
in five are connected to a central sewer system; incredibly, the
ratio is only about four out of five even in the Tokyo/Yokohama
area, one of the world's most densely populated urban centers.13
But second-guessing such domestic spending decisions seenis of

doubtful efficacy, and of even more doubtful appropriateness.

     One last area for a major increase in Japan's domestic
absorption is defense. Currently at a postwar high of just over

one percent of gross national product, Japan's defense
expenditures are, for example, only about half those of neutral
Switzerland and a third those of West Germany.14 Other major
U.S. allies spend still more. Should the United States urge
Japan to share more of the collective burden of global security?
Viewed strictly on its economic merits, this seems a more
appropriate area than housing or sewers for pressure from other

     12
         Saxonhouse (1985) characterizes the Japanese as
"notorious target savers," with future housing a main target.
This is a critical point, since increased spending in any one
category does not necessarily translate into higher overall
spending (lower saving). Saxonhouse also notes a possible bonus
from increased housing expenditures for other spending: more
living space may lift a major constraint on purchases of
consumer durables.
     13
          Japan 1986, p. 88.
     14
          Japan 1986, p. 86.
                               25

nations. However, proposals for a substantial increase in
Japanese defense spending have so far encountered formidable
political resistance both in Japan and in the United States.

     While acknowledging that Japan's capital account surplus
mirrors the nation's imbalance between saving and domestic
spending, some analysts believe that the underlying macroeconomic
imbalance is not appropriately viewed as exogenous. Rapp (1986)

and Balassa (1986) link high Japanese savings to profits
generated by sectoral protection. If this effect were

quantitatively important, import liberalization would, in
addition to its expected effects on sectoral composition of trade
flows, raise Japanese domestic absorption and thus reduce the

aggregate trade surplus.


2.5.3. Redirecting foreign funds
     If the United States doesn't want Japan's capital surpluses,
perhaps other borrowers do. An important alternative to

increasing Japanese domestic absorption is redirecting Japan's
foreign lending toward other nations, especially less-developed
nations. Debt problems have led many developing nations to

restrict imports of capital equipment supplied by the United
States and other industrial nations. With more purchasing power
at their disposal, these nations would be able to resume such

imports; U.S. exporters would benefit accordingly.
     In the past decade Japan has increased by nearly 50 percent
its share of CNP devoted to official development assistance,
                                26

while the U.S. share, initially the same (0.24 percent), remained
unchanged. 3ut compared to other prosperous nations, Japan's
spending is still on the low side.
     Although the Japanese have in fact continued to step up
their spending for foreign aid, the increases have not always met
with cheers from other donor nations. The problem arises from
informal arrangements that link aid to expenditures for Japanese
goods and services. While little aid is explicitly tied, aid is

rarely committed without specific project plans; potential
borrowers rely on Japanese expert advice in formulating the
plans, which typically call for imports of Japanese capital
equipment and other products. Mixed-credit financing is a
related problem, although Japan has not been the major offender

in this area.
     Commercial lending and direct foreign investments in
developing countries are another means by which Japanese surplus
savings could be "recycled." Given the ongoing debt problems of
many developing nations, this route currently looks hazardous to

both potential lenders and potential borrowers. In the longer
term, however, it is likely that "normal" capital-flow relations
between rich and poor nations will be reestablished, with funds

from Japan playing an important role.


2.5.4. Taxing capital imports
     Only the net inflow of capital from abroad has kept the
greatly increased federal deficit from pushing U.S. interest
                               27

rates through the roof. Instead, the U.S. trade deficit has gone
through the roof. Until U.S. domestic absorption can be cut, the
nation will continue to face the same basic choice between high
interest rates and foreign borrowing. Over time, the exact terms
of the trade-off will depend on investors' preferences, but the
United States can tilt that choice by taxing capital imports.'5

     Controlling U.S. capital imports would shift a greater part
of the adjustment to higher deficits onto U.S. lenders and
borrowers, rather than allowing much of the "crowding out" to be
exported. From the U.S. perspective, the effect is similar to
what would be obtained via expansion abroad. However, there are

two potentially important differences. First, without specific
expansionary policies in place abroad, imposition of capital
controls by the United States could push the rest of the world

into a deflationary spiral. Second, and perhaps key for some
U.S. officials, capital controls would reverse recent U.S. gains

in penetrating foreign (especially Japanese) markets for
financial services.




     15
         This has been proposed in recent years by James Tobin
and Rudiger Dornbusch, among others. See Dornbusch and Frankel
(1987).
                               28

3.   Sectoral Issues

     Allegations about Japan's relatively closed markets for
industrial products reflect concerns of much longer standing than
the aggregate imbalances of recent years. The encroachment of
Japanese products into the U.S. market and their displacement of
U.S. exports in markets elsewhere is likewise an old story, not a
new one. However, emergence of a very large bilateral imbalance
has exacerbated those longtime concerns, since the impact of
competition with Japan is concentrated in a small number of U.S.

manufacturing industries.16
     Bilateral friction on agricultural trade is also an old

story. However, with U.S. global surpluses on agricultural trade
shrinking rapidly, one consequence has been renewed focus on the
import barriers of Japan, already the largest market for U.S.

agricultural exports. Changes in Japan's current policies in
support of domestic agriculture, and especially of rice farming,
could mean still larger imports of food from the United States.

But, like other industrialized nations, Japan has so far found

reductions in its expensive agricultural support policies
politically unpalatable. Indeed, were the United States to
reform its own costly and distortionary policies toward
agriculture as it has urged the Japanese to do, any increase in

     16
         Conversely, a return to a more "normal" pattern of
global capital flows should reduce sectoral frictions. Krugman
(1986) and Petri (1987) use this logic to anticipate some
reversal of recent competitive pressures on U.S. industry. Based
on simulation analysis, Petri concludes that output structures in
the United States and Japan could become quite similar by the
l990s.
                                29

Japanese imports of rice might well come from Thailand or China
rather than from the United States.



3.1. Are exports and imports separate issues?
     Are the issues raised by Japan's low imports and high
exports two separate concerns, or are they linked aspects of a

single developmental policy?   Some argue that market closure,

along with government assistance for generic research and
development projects, was an essential element of the Japanese

national policy responsible for subsequent export successes in
motor vehicles and electronics.17

     Moreover, as described in the previous section, Japan's
overall trade balance is determined largely by macroeconomic

influences. Any broad import-inhibiting factors, whether
national policy or industrial practice, ought therefore also to
inhibit exports. Conversely, any successful move to liberalize

imports will likewise promote exports - -   although   this is hardly

a result U.S. trade negotiators are likely to stress.18
     A third link between exports and imports arises from Japan's
poor endowment of natural resources. For any given trade balance

consistent with macroeconomic conditions, Japan's heavy


     17
         For example, Borrus, Tyson, and Zysman (1987) make this
argument for the case of the semiconductor industry.
     18
         If sectoral liberalization does reduce aggregate
Japanese savings, as suggested by Rapp (1986) and Balassa (1986),
the induced rise in Japanese exports would not fully offset the
rise in imports.
                                30

dependence on imported oil and food means a correspondingly
larger surplus on trade in manufactures (or in services --   but
Japan currently runs a deficit on services trade).19 Still, the

required surplus could be achieved through higher-than-average
manufactured exports, as in the case of West Germany, rather than

lower-than-average manufactured imports (Lawrence, 1987).
     Perhaps more important than the direct effect on the

composition of Japan's trade flows, perennial dependence on
imports of raw materials and food has shaped national attitudes,

public and private, toward importing. To many Japanese, their
economy's extreme vulnerability to changes in global market
conditions both for raw-material imports such as oil and for
manufactured exports casts an omnipresent shadow over today's

prosperity.


3.2. Japan's low import share
     In terms of conventional trade-distorting government

practices, Japan was formerly a major offender among industrial
nations but now must be counted as one of the most open.2°

     19
         Krugman (1986) links the "Japan problem" of rapidly
growth of manufactured exports to the United States to large
increases in world oil prices from 1973 until 1984. His analysis
suggests that lower oil prices will translate into a higher value
of the yen and slower growth of Japanese manufactured exports.
     20
         Komiya and Itoh (1986) provide a detailed accounted of
the gradual liberalization of Japanese imports. Saxonhouse
(1983, 1985) documents the minor importance currently of
conventional instruments of protection. Ahearn (1985) divides
current Japanese import barriers into four categories: formal,

that the most onerous remaining barriers to manufactured imports
                               31

Foreign products and services, from IBM to McDonald's, are to be

found everywhere. Yet the Japanese ratio of imports to gross
national product and especially of manufactured imports to total
imports remain strikingly low in comparison to other industrial

countries. Many of the "foreign" goods now so conspicuous in
Japanese daily life are in fact produced domestically by local
affiliates or licensees of foreign companies.
     Are the low import ratios evidence of subtle trade barriers

or simply a reflection of transport costs and an atypical factor
endowment? Much of the evidence on Japan's "hidden" barriers to

entry is anecdotal (e.g., Rapp, 1986; Balassa, 1986). While
attesting to real frustrations experienced by U.S. producers in
their attempts to serve a potentially lucrative market, such
anecdotes provide little indication of whether public or private
action in Japan differs significantly from that in, say, France.

Christopher (1986) goes further, suggesting that while
disappointed would-be exporters have clear motives for making
their grievances known, successful U.S. exporters and direct

investors wisely shun publicity. Kept from the public eye, their
successes -- and resulting profits -- are less likely to promote

further entry by competing U.S. producers. If so, anecdotal
evidence may be a seriously biased measure of import barriers.




are in the last category, where Japanese public policy has
relatively little direct impact.

3.3. Econometric evidence
     Several researchers have used econometric methods to
determine whether Japan's trade structure is basically a
reflection of relative costs or has been shaped significantly by
hidden but important barriers to imports. Starting from standard
models linking trade patterns to national factor endowments and
other determinants of relative cost, these researchers examine
the deviations of actual trade flows from those predicted by the

underlying model.
     While based on different specifications, data, and time

periods, studies by Saxonhouse (1983, 1985), Bergsten and Cline
(1985), and Noland (1987) all found Japanese trade to be
adequately explained by the same basic determinants as that of
other areas, thus rejecting a major role for import barriers in

Japan compared to its trading partners. In contrast, Zalassa
(1986) found significant shortfalls of Japanese imports relative
to values predicted from a model very similar to Bergsten and
Cline's. Noland conjectures that the conflicting results reflect
differences in the samples and in the definitions of the
independent variables but emphasizes that neither set of
regressions is derived from a formal model. Deviations of actual
from predicted values, ascribed by Balassa to trade policies

applied, may simply indicate misspecification of the regression
equation.
     Noland 's own regression equations are derived from an

explicit two-sector model incorporating differentiated products
                               33

and scale economies, an approach motivated by recent developments
in the theory of international trade (e.g., Helpman and Krugman,
1985). Despite the different theoretical underpinnings, Noland
draws basically the same conclusion as Saxonhouse and Bergsten

and Cline, that Japanese exports, imports, and total trade "do
not appear to be out of the ordinary." But in interpreting his
own results as well as those of earlier researchers, Noland

emphasizes the need for caution in making any strong inference

from the size of residuals, given uncertainty as to specification

of the "true model."21
     Although intended to cast light on the extent of Japan's

sectoral barriers to imports, the studies by Bergsten and dine,
Balassa, and Noland all used aggregate trade data, while
Saxonhouse employed industry data but focused on net exports

rather than imports. To focus directly on sectoral anomalies,

Lawrence (1987) used import, export, and production data for 22
manufacturing industries. Like Noland, Lawrence adopted a
theoretical framework incorporating differentiated products and
scale economies. However, while Noland treated manufacturing as

a single sector, in the Lawrence model each manufacturing

industry produces a separate differentiated product.

     21  Leamer (1984) gives a more comprehensive discussion of
both specification issues and data problems associated with
empirically relating resource endowments to trade patterns, also
emphasizing the problem of sensitivity. While he acknowledges
the probable importance of scale economies, for practical reasons
his own specification is based on a model with constant returns.
Leamer does not focus on the existence of significant distortions
but concludes from his analysis that resource endowments provide
a "surprisingly good" explanation of the trade data.
                               34

     The critical step in Lawrence's analysis is the assumption
that tastes are similar across countries. With the additional
assumption of no transport costs or trade barriers, a country's
share in each market will then be proportional to its share in
world production and independent of the size of the aggregate
trade balance; larger countries will thus be more "closed" as
measured by trade flows as a share of GNP. The implied
relationship between a country's production and trade in each
industry is used by Lawrence to infer the existence of "unusual
barriers" to imports at the industry level.
     Lawrence's data show that the industrialized countries are
remarkably similar in patterns of domestic production and use

(consumption plus investment) by industry. Contrary to the
conventional wisdom, Japan is not unusual in its overall export

performance, although Japan's manufactured exports are highly
concentrated in a small number of industries. But Japan j
atypical in its low manufactured imports and the very minor
extent of intra-industry trade. From his regression analysis of
industry trade and production data, Lawrence concludes that
"unusual barriers reduce Japanese imports of manufactured goods
substantially -- by about forty percent." As Lawrence notes, his
results are not inconsistent with Noland's finding of no

significant anomaly in Japan's aggregate trade. Since
manufactured goods were less than a quarter of Japan's total
imports in 1980, substantial "underimporting" in some sectors
could be masked by the use of aggregate data.
                               35

    Despite his striking result, Lawrence casts doubt on
sectoral trade liberalization as a cure-all for aggregate
imbalances, suggesting that the increase in manufactured imports

thereby produced would be largely offset by an associated rise in
exports. Thus, the main effect would be an expansion of Japan's
intra-industry trade, rather than a dramatic reduction in the

nation's surplus on trade in manufactured goods.   A more basic

issue is, as with the earlier studies, the extent to which

Japan's import shortfalls from Lawrence's predicted values
reflect model misspecification or errors in variables (e.g.,
transport costs, for which Lawrence used mileage) rather than

import barriers.


3.4. Lack of intraindustrv trade
     A somewhat different argument made by Borrus and Zysman
(1985) also takes as its starting point Japan's atypically low
level of intra-industry trade. Borrus and Zysman point to the

virtual absence of two-way trade in specific manufactured
products: Japan tends not to import the manufactured goods that

 it exports.
      According to Borrus and Zysman, past protection from imports

 has allowed Japanese producers to achieve a decisive competitive
 advantage. Indeed, the resulting advantage is so great that even
 when import barriers are no longer in place, foreign firms are

 unable to penetrate the domestic market, while Japanese firms can

 quickly displace other suppliers in the United States and third-
                               36

country markets.22 But Borrus and Zysman supply no evidence that

Japan's intra-product and intra-industry trade are systematically
depressed in sectors previously protected by import barriers.
Although the cases of semiconductors and autos are suggestive,
generalization to manufacturing as a whole requires further

support.
     A more fundamental issue is, as with any ex post ergo
propter hoc argument, the lack of evidence establishing that past
protection of the Japanese domestic market from imports played a

key role in developing present technological superiority. If a
large and profitable market were the main necessary condition for

developing a decisive competitive advantage, U.S. automakers, not
Japanese, ought to dominate world markets today. That the
Japanese experience with import substitution actually ended with
internationally competitive production and termination of infant
industry protection makes it an exception to the global norm,
But if the Japanese experience is so different from what has been
observed with import substitution elsewhere, perhaps other
Japanese policies, not barriers to imports, were the essential

ingredient.




     22
         Although Lawrence's data support the contention that
Japanese intra-industry trade in manufactured goods is unusually
low, he attributes this finding to remaining current barriers to
imports, not technological advantages resulting from past
protection.

4.   The U.S. Technology Race with Japan
     A persistent technology gap between the United States and
other industrialized nations shaped the nation's trade in
manufactured goods for several decades after World War II. Over

this period, large public and private expenditures on research
and development created a continuing flow of new products and
processes. Early access to this superior technology allowed U.S.
firms to remain internationally competitive despite labor costs
far in excess of those abroad. As late as 1980, the U.S. trade
position in high-technology manufacturing was still rising almost
every year, while net trade in other manufacturing followed an

opposite trend.



4.1. Closing the technology gap
      The breakdown of trading relationships based on U.S.

technological superiority reflected several major changes in the
global economic environment. First, other industrial nations,

impressed by U.S. economic gains from technology-driven growth,
stepped up their own R&D expenditures. Some of the funds went
for basic research, but much was used to speed the acquisition
and adaptation of technology from abroad, especially from the
United States. At the same time, dramatic improvements in
communications and transportation helped to internationalize both
research and production activities.
      The growth of U.S. multinational corporations served as an
important vehicle for the international transfer of new
                                38

commercial technologies, providing not only access to proprietary
technological information but also to the know-how and financial
capital needed to implement the new technologies. The

technology-disseminating activities of multinationals, while
profit-motivated, were in many cases actively encouraged by host
countries' policies toward direct investments.

     The closing of the technology gap between the United States
and its commercial rivals meant increased competition on other

dimensions of cost. Labor productivity and earnings rose rapidly
abroad, while the growth of U.S. earnings slowed. Although the
catch-up abroad probably benefited the nation as a whole by
raising foreign demand for U.S. goods and services and by opening
the possibility of importing as well as exporting new

technologies, some U.S. workers clearly lost ground. In a number
of U.S. manufacturing industries, real earnings actually fell for
the first time in the postwar period as U.S. producers attempted
to remain internationally competitive.


4.2. Japan's technological development
     In contrast to most other industrial nations, Japan

virtually excluded foreign investments in industries targeted for
development during its period of technological catch-up.
Instead, it relied primarily on licensing to acquire critical

technologies from abroad. Imports of technology were controlled
by the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), which
prepared lists of desired technologies and reviewed most
                               39

licensing proposals.23 As a supplement to MITI's role as

"doorkeeper" to technology imports, the Ministry of Finance
insured access of innovating firms to financial capital.24
     Some developing countries have modeled their own policies

toward imported technologies on those of Japan, particularly
screening of licensing agreements and allocation of capital.
However, none are in a position to duplicate the commitment of
skilled workers that facilited Japan's success in adapting
imported technologies. In 1969, two decades into its catch-up
phase, Japan employed about 30 scientists and engineers per
10,000 workers in the labor force, less than half the comparable
figure for the United States but comparable to the major European
nations.25 Fifteen years later the Japanese proportion of
scientists and engineers in the workforce had more than doubled,
closely approaching the United States figure, while the European

nations had more modest increases. Japanese spending for
research and development (R&D) tells a similar story. Although

     23  Harris (1985) gives a comprehensive review of past and
current Japanese policies toward international technology
transfers.
     24  Yamamura (1986) suggests that the role of the Ministry
of Finance (MOF) was perhaps the most essential element of
Japan's pro-growth policy in this period. Given the under-
developed state of Japanese domestic capital markets, their
insulation from world financial markets, and regulated below-
market-clearing interest rates on loans, MOF exercised enormous
economic leverage over domestic firms as a consequence of its
ability to allocate loans in a situation of chronic excess
demand.

Japan is only average among industrial nations in its overall
proportion of gross national product devoted to R&D, it now
enjoys the world's highest ratio of nondefense R&D to GNP.
     As with trade in manufactured goods, Japan has in recent

years greatly liberalized its policies toward technology imports

while rapidly expanding its own technology exports. Japan's
"technological balance of payments," recording payments and
receipts of royalties and licensing fees for the use of
trademarks, copyrights, and patents, still shows a large deficit.
However, this is mainly a reflection of agreements made in

earlier years during Japan's catch-up phase. Japan's gross
receipts from technology exports have grown steadily. By 1984
Japan was the third, after the United States and the United
Kingdom, in earnings from foreign use of its technology.26

     Like other technologically advanced nations, Japan has also
increased its direct investments abroad, pairing financial

capital, superior technology, and managerial know-how with the
lower labor costs of developing countries. Current or
anticipated import barriers have provided the main motivation for
recent Japanese direct investments in the other industrialized
nations, but even these investments may entail substantial

transfers of technology.27 For Japanese investments in U.S.
high-technology industries, there is likely to be a two-way flow,

     27
         Bhagwati (1982) has pointed out that some direct foreign
investments may be used to head off new protection rather than in
anticipation of producing inside the restricted market.
                               41

with the Japanese gaining speedier access to state-of-the-art
technical information while themselves disseminating superior

methods of management and organization.


4.3. Japanese productivity and trade
     Bilateral comparisons of industry-level productivity and
trade performance confirm Japan's catch-up to the technological
level of the United States. In their comparison of productivity
levels for 28 industries, Jorgenson, Kuroda, and Nishimizu (1986)
found that by 1979 nine Japanese industries had already closed
the productivity gap with the United States; in the remaining
nineteen industries the difference narrowed over the period

studied. The analysis indicated that Japan's rising productivity
levels were strongly influenced by major increases in the
relative capital intensity of production as well as improved

technology.
     A recent study of U.S. -Japanese trade patterns in 1977

(Audrestch and Yamawaki, 1986) found bilateral U.S.-Japanese
trade structurally different from trade between the United States

and other countries. In contrast to the consistent empirical

result that U.S. export strength is greatest in the high-
technology industries with relatively large employment of skilled
workers, U.S. trade performance in its bilateral trade with Japan
was negatively related to the skill level of the U.S. labor

 force. A possible interpretation of this finding is that at
 least in trade with Japan, the U.S. technological lead is no
                                42

longer an important factor; an abundance of skilled workers and a

lower wage premium for technical skills can give Japan a cost
advantage over the United States in these industries.

     However, the experience of Japanese-owned auto plants in the
United States has shown that neither massive capital investments

nor state-of-the-art technologies are essential ingredients of

the Japanese cost advantage, In autos, Japanese producers
operating in the United States have achieved lower costs than

their indigenous counterparts while typically using less capital
per worker and no highly advanced production technology. This
raises the possibility that at least in the auto industry, a

significant aspect of the Japanese competitive advantage is
"technological" only in a very broad sense that includes
organizational and managerial know-how.

     But recent findings of Lipsey and Kravis (1986) suggest that
Japan's advantage in auto production may not be typical. In
terms of overall manufacturing exports, Lipsey and Kravis found
that U.S. multinational corporations have maintained a virtually
unchanged share of world totals since 1966; declining exports
from U.S. production have been offset by rising exports from

subsidiaries abroad. These results imply that loss of U.S.
international competitiveness in manufacturing as a whole cannot
be attributed to deficiencies in U.S. management skills or

technology. However, in the case of transport equipment, the
United States did lose substantial ground; by 1983, both the
                               43

United States as a country and U.S. multinationals had lost about

a quarter of their 1966 global market shares.28




     28  The atypical performance of the auto industry relative
to U.S. manufacturing as a whole points up the danger in
generalizing from the experience of a single sector, even a very
important one, as Halberstam (1986) does in his comparison of
Ford and Nissan.
                                44
5.   Looking Ahead

     Japan's rapid growth during much of the postwar period has
been based on technological catch-up. The slowing of that growth

in recent years reflects, among other things, the completion of
the catch-up phase. Can the Japanese policies and institutions
that facilitated successful importation and adaptation of
existing technologies work as well in producing new ones? Some
claim that the Japanese educational system, in comparison to its

American counterpart, ensures a uniformly high standard of
performance but systematically crushes individuality and
creativity. However, it is too early to judge whether these
differences have any implications for scientific innovation, and
in any case both systems are in the throes of significant change.

The increasing economic intimacy between the two nations has
itself served as one major impetus for change.

     I have argued that the rapidly growing bilateral imbalances
between the United States and Japan were produced by

macroeconomic conditions, not trade or industrial policies. In
this sense, the imbalances can be viewed as "temporary" factors

rather than long-term developments. But elimination of the
imbalances without serious damage to the U.S. economy and those

of its trading partners may be difficult to achieve.   If Japanese
investors turn away from U.S. financial markets before the United
States is able to reduce domestic absorption, U.S. interest rates
will be forced upward, with potentially disastrous consequences
for the economy.
                                 45

    In terms of sectoral adjustments, the U.S.-Japanese
relationship may well be entering a new phase. As the nations

grow more similar in terms of technology base, abundance of
capital and skilled labor, and per capita income, intra-industry
trade is likely to grow. In particular, two-way trade in
technology and in technology-based services should become

increasingly important as Japan moves from adaptation into
innovation. In the mature industries and even some that are now

considered "high-technology" sectors, both Japan and the United
States will be faced with increasing competition from a new tier
of competitors in Asia and elsewhere.

     For both nations, problems of sectoral adjustment will
continue to generate strong pressures for import protection and
other forms of assistance to industries losing ground to
newcomers. Sectoral trade conflict between the United States and
Japan will be concentrated on the two ends of the industrial

spectrum in terms of technological sophistication, with issues

raised both by contrasting approaches to the phasing out of
industries losing their comparative advantage and by contrasting
approaches to the nurturing of new industries.
     Could the United States return to its one-time position of

unquestioned technological preeminence? Even with vastly
increased resources allocated to research and development, this

kind of advantage probably can no longer be sustained - -    by   the

United States or any country -   - in   a world that has become highly

interdependent. The commercial advantage of being first in
                                46

innovation has been undermined by the greatly increased speed
with which new technical knowledge becomes available to potential
competitors all over the globe. This does not mean that research
and development has become less important. On the contrary,
technological improvements will continue to provide the basis for
a rising standard of living both in the United States and abroad.
However, the benefits of R&D efforts can no longer be counted
mainly in terms of the advantages conferred to one nation's
industries over competitors elsewhere.
