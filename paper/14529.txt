                                             ABSTRACT

This paper shows that the EMU has not affected historical characteristics of member countries’ business
cycles and their cross-correlations. Member countries which had similar levels of GDP per-capita
in the seventies have also experienced similar business cycles since then and no significant change
associated with the EMU can be detected. For the other countries, volatility has been historically higher
and this has not changed in the last ten years. We also find that the aggregate euro area per-capita GDP
growth since 1999 has been lower than what could have been predicted on the basis of historical experience
and US observed developments. The gap between US and euro area GDP per capita level has been
30% on average since 1970 and there is no sign of catching up or of further widening.

1    Introduction

When asked in the 1960s about what, in his opinion, had been the impact of the French revolution, the

Chinese premiere Zhou Enlai famously said: “it’s too early to tell”.

This might be what will be said about the effects of the European Monetary Union (EMU) on euro
area business cycles in two hundred and fifty years. Indeed, some of these effects may take a long time
to manifest themselves since they result from changes in trade and specialization patterns across the
euro area (see, for example, Krugman, 1993; Frankel and Rose, 1998).

However, other effects, such as the loss of flexibility in macroeconomic policies, emphasized, for example,
by Feldstein (1998), have more immediate consequences on business cycles and it should already be
possible to identify them at the occasion of the tenth anniversary of the union.

A lot has been written on business cycle synchronization within the euro area and few papers are
trying to address how it has been affected by the EMU. The literature, however, is far from being
consensual (in the next Section we review the findings). Moreover, very little is known about the
historical characteristics of national and aggregate business cycles in the euro area. One of our objectives
is to describe the basic characteristics of real economic activity in the area as a whole and in member
countries as well as the dynamic relations between national cycles over the last forty years. Having
formed a view on these features for a sufficiently long historical period (our sample starts in 1970), we
then address the question of changes related to the EMU.

We adopt a very conservative and narrow approach. Since we are looking for robust results on a
topic where there is little consensus about descriptive statistics, we analyze annual data, which are
less affected by measurement error than quarterly statistics and are available for all countries for a
relatively long time period. Moreover, we look at real data only, since the well documented changes in
nominal variables and the convergence of inflation and interest rates that have taken place since the
early nineties, if of significance, should be reflected in visible changes in the output structure over time.
In a way, the establishment of the EMU helps identify broader economic relations without having to

define a complex model. Finally, amongst real variables, we focus on GDP per capita only, disregarding
other real indicators, such as, for example, labor market or consumption data. This choice is partly
motivated by lack of reliable comparative statistics, but also because, unless the omitted real variables



                                                     2
have a predictive power for output, output dynamics should reflect changes in different sectors of the
real economy.

We first analyze asymmetries in levels of economic activity and then look at growth rates to try to
identify patterns across countries and over time in the evolution of gaps between each member’s growth
rate and the euro wide average.

Then we study the dynamic relationship between growth rates. We base our analysis on two simple
models, one which characterizes the joint output dynamics of the euro area countries and one which

studies the euro area aggregate cycle in relation to that of the US, the other large common currency
area in the world.

We first look at the relation between countries’ output dynamics and average euro area growth. Pre-
cisely, we ask whether, based on the economic structure prevailing before 1999 and conditioning on the
observed path of euro area growth before and after 1999, we would have observed, in each country,
the realized growth observed during the EMU years. We then focus on the euro area aggregate cycle
and ask the question of whether the observed growth path in the EMU years could have been expected
on the basis of the past distribution and conditioning on external developments. To capture external
development we use, as a conditioning variable, the observed path of US GDP growth. The choice
of US output as a conditioning variable is motivated by the findings in Giannone and Reichlin (2005,
2006) and some additional results reported here which show that the dynamic correlation between US
and euro area growth is robust and has been stable over time.

Overall, the results of the paper should reassure the early critics of the EMU. The level of heterogeneity
that we have observed over the last ten years are in line with historical experience. Differences between
countries are small and the transmission of common shocks rather homogeneous.

On a more pessimistic tone, one of our findings is that the average growth experienced by the euro area
as a whole from 1999 to 2006 has been slightly lower than what we would have expected based on its
historical relation with the US. However, the causes of slow growth do not appear to be related to the
asymmetric adjustment to shocks emphasized in the discussion that took place ten years ago.

2        What do we know about the euro area business cycles?

There is a large empirical literature which describes the characteristics of business cycles and their

evolution in OECD countries. Most papers, however, don’t analyze the total sample of euro area
member countries and focus either on large European countries (including also non euro area nations),
the G7 or a larger number of OECD economies. What we have learned about the euro area business
cycles comes from this literature. Below we summarize the results.

Papers have addressed different questions.

At the beginning of the EMU, there was an effort to collect data on the aggregate euro area economy
(Fagan, Henry, and Mestre, 2001). With these data, some studies, in the first years of the EMU,
have tried to characterize the euro area aggregate business cycle, both for what concerns the dating of
recessions and expansions of levels of economic activity (the so-called classical cycle) and the growth
cycle.

Other studies have focused on countries’ heterogeneity and look at synchronization of recessions or use
growth rates and filtered data to identify the cross-country pattern of co-movements between some
components of output or industrial production data. A popular approach has been to identify the
relative importance of a common world component in major OECD countries, a European (and/or euro
area) component and, in some papers, a regional component. Few of these studies, however, are recent
enough to be sufficiently informative on the EMU regime’s “facts”.

Many papers have focused on the issue of structural change. Here authors have asked whether the degree
of synchronization has changed in relation to the ERM, the Maastricht Treaty and the EMU. Some
studies, have looked backward and estimated the degree of heterogeneity of the response to common
euro area, European or world shocks before the inception of the EMU, to infer, on that basis, what
would have happened as a consequence of the single currency and evaluate its potential costs.

Finally, some studies have used a variety of methods to characterize the synchronization of turning
points of classical cycles focusing on growth rather than on recession episodes.

Since the set of countries, the time period and the variables used are different across these studies, it is
quite difficult to report results in a synthetic way. Below is a review of the findings.




                                                     4
2.1    Characteristics of the euro area aggregate business cycle: recessions
       and expansions

The first attempt to look at the euro area as a single economy and date the turning points of its
“classical” cycle has been pursued by the CEPR dating committee on the basis of judgemental criteria
(www.CEPR.org) and with data from 1970 to 2003. Artis, Marcellino, and Proietti (2005) reproduce
these data using more formal techniques. The result of these studies is that the timing of euro area
recessions is similar to that of US recessions as classified by the NBER (see wwww.nber.org), although
euro area turning points lag US ones (see Giannone and Reichlin, 2005, for a documentation of this
point). None of these studies, however, analyze recent data and in the euro area sample no classical
recession has so far been identified.

Turning points have also been established on the basis of a cyclical component extracted from many
economic activity indicators. This component, the EUROCOIN index of the euro area business cycle,

corresponds to a growth cycle concept and is regularly updated by the CEPR (see www.CEPR.org and
Altissimo, Bassanetti, Cristadoro, Forni, Hallin, Lippi, and Reichlin, 2001).


2.2    Characteristics of the national business cycles

The literature seems to agree that the timing of classical recessions is very synchronized across euro
area countries (Artis, Marcellino, and Proietti, 2005; Harding and Pagan, 2006), although there is no
comprehensive analysis of all euro area economies including recent years.

In general, evidence on growth rates points to the importance of the world component in the European
business cycle (Canova, Ciccarelli, and Ortega, 2005; Kose, Otrok, and Whiteman, 2003; Monfort,
Renne, Rueffer, and Vitale, 2004). Others have emphasized the strong link between the US and the
euro area business cycle (Agresti and Mojon, 2001; Canova, Ciccarelli, and Ortega, 2005; Del Negro
and Otrok, 2008; Giannone and Reichlin, 2005, 2006).

Papers are less consensual on the identification of a specific euro area or European business cycle over
a longer sample. Some studies identify the emergence of a European cycle in the nineties, some date it
back to the seventies, while other don’t find it at all (see the review below).

A different approach has been to look at the relative importance of regional, national and euro wide



                                                    5
cycles. Forni and Reichlin (2001) and Croux, Forni, and Reichlin (2001) have shown, on the basis of
data including only a couple of years of the EMU sample, that a regional component, orthogonal to the
national one, explains a large component of national European cycles (around 30 %).

Finally, recently, the European Central Bank, has published a report on output growth differentials since
1990 in euro area countries and found that they are small (and comparable with those of US states),
but persistent (ECB, 2007). The same message comes from a more analytical study by Giannone and
Reichlin (2006).


2.3    Changes since the ERM, Maastricht and the EMU

Evidence on changes of the characteristics of euro area cycles is less consensual. Clearly with many
institutional changes clustered around the early nineties and a short sample covering the EMU regime, it
is hard to come up with robust findings. Artis and Zhang (1997), analyzing cycles before and after 1979
(the beginning of the first ERM) find increased synchronicity since the ERM for countries belonging
to the ERM. However Artis (2003) revisits these findings using data up to 2001 and concludes, on a
sample of twenty-three countries, that there is no evidence of a European cycle. This again contrasts
with the results of Lumsdaine and Prasad (2003), based on seventeen OECD countries (of which ten
belong to the euro area and 13 to Europe) between 1963 and 1994. They find that, especially after
1973, there is a clear European business cycle. Helbling and Bayoumi (2003), on the other hand, find
little synchronization between G7 growth cycles from 1973 to 2001 and estimate that Germany was
more synchronized with anglo-saxon countries than with France in that period, although they also find
instability over time of cross-country correlations. Focusing on slowdown episodes, however, they point
to strong cross-country correlations during recessions.

Two papers use more recent data. On the basis of data up to 2007, seven euro area and three European
non euro area countries, Canova, Ciccarelli, and Ortega (2008) find that a European Union (EU) cycle
emerges in the 1990s, but this is common to EMU and non EMU countries. The same authors find
that a European cycle was absent until the mid-eighties. Del Negro and Otrok (2008), with data from
1970 to 2005, find no change in average cross-country correlation of euro area business cycles and for
the larger set of European countries while they detect a decline in G7 average correlations.




                                                   6
2.4    Shocks and propagations

Few studies have tried to assess the propagation of US, German or world shocks across countries on the
basis of semi-structural or structural models.

Before the establishment of the EMU, Bayoumi and Eichengreen (1992), with a sample of twelve mem-
bers of the EU from 1960 to 1988, identify demand and supply shocks on the basis of countries’s VARs
on output growth and inflation. They identify a core group (Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands
and Denmark) whose supply shocks are both smaller and more correlated across neighboring countries
and a periphery (the UK, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece) with large and weakly correlated
shocks.

Giannone and Reichlin (2006) study the response of output growth of euro area countries to a euro area
wide shock, on the basis of the 1970-2005 sample. They find that a large part of countries’ business
cycle is due to common (area wide) shocks while idiosyncratic fluctuations are limited, but persistent.

Different results, on the other hand, are found by Canova, Ciccarelli, and Ortega (2008). With quarterly
data from 1970 to 1993, these authors find no positive spillovers of German shocks to other EMU coun-
tries while, with information up to the ECB creation at the end of 1998, they find a lot of commonalities
in the response of EMU countries to German shocks. The same result, according to the authors, holds

for the longer term sample, including the first four years of the EMU.


This review shows that, although there is a broad consensus on synchronization of recessions and

expansions on the basis of data on the level of economic activity, the literature is not at all in agreement
on the “facts” on growth cycles, that is the facts based on either growth rates or filtered data capturing
some longer moving average of growth rates. Results differ depending on the sample, the method, the
data or the data transformation. These differences in opinions about what are essentially descriptive
statistics are surprising. They are partly explained by poor data quality, short samples for the policy
regimes of interest and lack of robustness with respect to data filtering and statistical methods.

The attempt of our paper is to re-evaluate some of the “facts”, trying to emphasize robustness. We
aim to characterize the features of the euro area cycle for member countries and for the aggregate since
1970 and to compare these characteristics with those of the US cycle. Although our analysis is limited
because it mainly focuses on GDP per capita, it covers all euro area countries and a relatively long time



                                                     7
span. In the next Section we describe our data set and discuss measurement issues.



3      Data

Business cycle analysis is typically performed with quarterly data. However, to avoid measurement
issues and since our aim is to cover all euro area countries for a period of time including few full
business cycles, we have made the choice of using annual data. Although we may lose information on
short term dynamics, we consider that annual data are more reliable for the purpose of establishing
robust facts on real economic activity.

The quality of quarterly historical data for the euro area is still poor. Moreover, quarterly data are
not available for all countries for a sufficiently long sample (they are harmonized only since 1991). For
some countries, even if available, quarterly data are constructed artificially from annual data.

A way to assess the importance of measurement error is to look at the spectral density of quarterly
GDP growth at different frequencies. A series for which measurement error explains a large component
of the total volatility, should have the bulk of variance concentrated at high frequencies. For the US,

where quarterly data are of relative good quality, quarterly GDP growth exhibits a peak at business
cycle frequencies and the bulk of the variance at low frequencies. It is interesting to look at Germany
for comparison.

Figure 1 below plots the spectral density for Germany and the US quarterly GDP, for the sample
1970-1989.


INSERT FIGURE 1 OVER HERE


Clearly, German and US quarterly GDP show a very different frequency decomposition of the variance
which indicates large measurement error in the case of Germany. Large concentration of volatility is at
frequencies higher than the year which suggest that by using yearly data the problem of measurement
might be mitigated.

We consider real GDP per capita PPP adjusted because this facilitates international comparisons on
the levels of economic activity. Data are PPP adjusted using 2000 weights. The sample is 1970-20061.
    1 The   source is OECD, National Accounts. Data are constructed using national series for GDP in volume at the

We consider the twelve countries that composed the euro area until December 2006, before the inclusion
of Malta, Cyprus and Slovenia.



4     Euro area economic activity: 1970-2006

We begin from descriptive statistics on the level of economic activity. We start from 1970 to form a view
on the level of heterogeneity as it was almost forty years ago, well before the introduction of common
EU policies throughout the nineties and the establishment of the euro in 1999.

Define yi,t , 1 = 1, ..., 12 as the log of real GDP per head (times 100) for country i.

Table (1) reports the percentage difference between the real GDP of each country and the euro area
aggregate in different years and sub-periods.

This corresponds to the last term of the expression:



                                             yi,t = yea,t + (yi,t − yea,t )

where yea,t refers to the euro area.

The last column reports the population weights.

Clearly, the size of the gaps are sensitive to the time period and depends on the level of aggregate
economic activity which, in turn, depends on the phase of the cycle.

Looking at starting conditions in the seventies, we can heuristically identify two groups of countries.

A core group with level of output per capita close to the average. The core is composed of Italy (IT),
Germany (GE), France (FR), Belgium (BE), Austria (AT), the Netherlands (NE) and Finland (FI). In
the periphery we have Portugal (PT), Luxembourg (LU), Greece (GR), Ireland (IE) and Spain (SP).
In this group only Luxembourg started above the average while the other countries started below the
average level of output per capita before the start of the euro.

Note that in comparing levels of economic activity one should be aware of measurement issues. In
prices of a common base year (2000) and then deflating them by PPP for a fixed year (2000). We follow the OECD
recommendation of deflating the GDP per head series by the PPP of a fixed year instead of using the “current” PPP
series. This implies a lack of homogeneity over time, but has the advantage of using a price structure that is constantly
updated and of protecting against the variance from one year to another of PPP calculations which is quite large (see
Lequiller and Blades, 2006).

    The table reports the percentage difference between the euro area and each country in specific periods
and on average before and after the inception of the euro. The countries are ordered accordingly to the
average population share over the entire period, as reported in the last column



particular, if lack of precision in the calculation of purchasing power parities is taken into account, a
difference in levels of less than 5% between the GDP per head of two different countries should not be
considered really significant (Lequiller and Blades, 2006). For example, for Greece, recent changes in
the construction of the official statistics have produced a series which does not seem to be reliable2 .

The differences between GDP per capita of countries of the core and periphery, however, is economically
significant since it exceeds 10%.

It is interesting to note that the countries in the core group have remained homogeneous throughout
the sample while countries with heterogeneous starting conditions have no general tendency to become
closer to the euro area. Differences in levels of economic activity are persistent. Some countries seem
to converge, like Spain, others do not seem to catch up, like Greece. Ireland, on the other hand, caught

up and over overshot. Overall, by superficial inspections of these numbers, nothing much seems to have
changed since the nineties. The same findings are in Giannone and Reichlin (2006).



5     Business cycles

Rather than filtering data, we consider annual growth rate. This is partly because business cycle facts
are not robust to different de-trending techniques (see, for example, Canova, 1998) and annual growth

rates are easily interpretable, partly because considering any smoother component of growth rates
implies extracting a moving average with the consequence of losing points at the end of the sample,
which, for the EMU regime, is already quite short.

Since each country’s growth depends on both euro area developments and its idiosyncratic dynamics it
is useful to consider the following decomposition:



                                            ∆yi,t = ∆yea,t + (∆yi,t − ∆yea,t )

where ∆ is the difference operator.

The variations in the gap (∆yi,t − ∆yea,t ), which is the growth differential with respect to the euro
area, represent country specific business cycle developments which may originate either in idiosyncratic
shocks or in heterogenous reactions to euro area shocks. This is a rough measure of business cycle

heterogeneity.

Table (2) reports estimates for average growth and its variance. Estimates are computed for different
sub-samples.

Results are also reported for a test on whether the numbers are significantly different across periods.
The test is constructed by comparing the measure computed using the observed post-EMU data and
the distribution of the measures we obtained by using block bootstrap over the pre-emu period. Stars
indicate that there have been significant changes in our measures after the EMU3 .

For most countries, the average rate of growth was lower during the EMU period. However, the
difference is not significant, except for Austria and Italy. The same is true for the variance which has
decreased everywhere, but significantly only for Greece (it should be recalled that numbers for Greece
are not very reliable).

Let us now analyze the pattern of heterogeneity. To this end we consider the quadratic mean of growth
differentials and look at its cross-sectional and time series pattern.

The choice of this statistic is motivated by the fact that it has a simple economic interpretation.

Following Kalemli-Ozcan, Sorensen, and Yosha (2001), we assume log utility and define utility in autarky

output is a random walk, we have:

is the permanent increase in output needed to compensate an average consumer in an autarkic country
for not being in a full risk sharing equilibrium and δ is the inter-temporal discount rate.

As noted by Kalemli-Ozcan, Sorensen, and Yosha (2001), under these simplifying assumptions, Gi can
be used as a measure of the gains from risk sharing. This is explained as follows. In the extreme case
in which the countries that are members of the monetary union are able to fully share risk, only area
wide fluctuations matter and asymmetries are painless. At the other extreme, if countries are autarkic,
they are forced to consume at each point in time what they produce and asymmetries are painful. How
economically important asymmetries are depends on how close we are to autarky4 .
   4 Of course a measure of the costs of business cycle asymmetries should be based on data on consumption as well as

output. Giannone and Reichlin (2006), for example, use output and consumption data and apply the method proposed
by Sorensen and Yosha (1998) to assess the changes in the degree of risk sharing within the euro area over time. They

Notice that the quadratic mean of the growth differential of country i with respect to the euro area,
apart from a scaling coefficient, is an estimate of Gi .

We first ask whether our measure of asymmetry is related to the initial (nineteen seventies) level of the
gaps.

In Figure (2) we plot the quadratic mean of the growth differential for each member country against
the differentials in starting conditions, measured by the gap in GDP per capita in 1970.


INSERT FIGURE 2 OVER HERE


Heterogeneity is smaller for those countries that were closer to each other in the seventies in terms of
levels of GDP (the exception is Finland, which experienced an idiosyncratic period of volatility in the
early nineties related to the banking crisis). For those countries the average quadratic growth differential
is also small with respect to the variance of GDP growth (see Table 2).

Since the ratio between the mean of the quadratic gap and the the variance of GDP growth is equal
to the variance explained by the euro area under the assumption of extreme symmetry (i.e. assuming
that the expected growth of each country GDP, given the euro area GDP is equal to the euro area GDP
growth itself), our results suggest that most of the business cycle fluctuations in countries with similar
starting conditions are driven by euro area wide shocks which propagate in an homogeneous way.

Let us now look at heterogeneity over time. Has it changed since the seventies?

To this end we compute the statistics:

Cross-sectional dispersion today is less than half of what it was at the beginning of the sample. Dis-
persion clearly declined in the early eighties, much earlier than the inception of the EMU, the fiscal
and nominal convergence started with the Maastricht treaty and the acceleration of financial and good
market integration witnessed since the late 80’s5 .

To sum up, asymmetries are very small for countries with similar level of development and larger for
countries with low GDP per capita relative to the euro area. Asymmetries have declined over time as an
effect of decline output volatility in the early eighties (“Great Moderation”). Since asymmetries have
changed very little as a consequence of the EMU, the costs of business cycle heterogeneity associated
with it have been small.



6     A model of dynamic interactions among member countries

To go beyond descriptive statistics, we must build a model to study cross-country dynamic interaction
in economic activity.

We have chosen to base our analysis on output data only. This is obviously a narrow approach, but it
is justified on two grounds.

First, as it is well documented, nominal variables have been converging since the early nineties to reach
similar levels at the end of the decade. This allows the design of a control experiment where real activity
   5 The reduction in cross-country dispersion in business cycle fluctuations coincides with a worldwide moderation of

business cycle fluctuations which took place since the mid-eighties. For an exhaustive documentation of the decline in
world-wide volatility, see Stock and Watson (2005).


                                                           14
in a period of nominal heterogeneity can be compared with real activity with nominal homogeneity and
it is an alternative way to estimate a model for the whole period, including also nominal variables.
Therefore it makes sense to study the dynamic relation amongst real variables only, provided that we
try to understand the changes induced by the EMU.

Second, although, in principle, other real information like consumption and external accounts is infor-
mative on the effect of the EMU (see Blanchard, 2006; Boivin, Giannoni, and Mojon, 2008; Lane, 2006,
among others), heterogeneity in these variables should be reflected in output dynamics, unless they

were leading indicators of output. There is no clear evidence, however, that consumption and current
account have predictive power for GDP.

Our controlled experiment consists of computing the expected path of a member country, conditioning
on the pre-EMU correlation structure and on the entire path of the euro area, and then asks whether
intra euro area relations have changed since the EMU.

The model is a VAR on output per capita of twelve countries of the euro area. A VAR is a very general
dynamic model suitable for describing dynamic correlations. Moreover, a VAR can be estimated with
level variables allowing common trends to be taken into account.

We collect all the time series in a vector Yt = (y1,t , ..., y12,t )′ . We consider the model

                                        Yt = c + A1 Yt−1 + ... + Ap Yt−p + et

where et ∼ WN(0, Σ).

Since, with twelve variables and twenty nine years of data, there are too many parameters to estimate,
we use Bayesian shrinkage and set the shrinkage parameter as in Banbura, Giannone, and Reichlin
(2008).6

Let us denote the vector of the estimated parameters for the pre-EMU years as θpre−emu.

The expectation of GDP per capita for each member country on the basis of pre-EMU data, conditional
on the aggregate outcome, that is the entire (pre and post EMU) path of area-wide aggregate GDP, is:



                             ∆ŷi,t|ea = Eθpre−emu [yi,t |yea,70 , yea,71 , ..., yea,05 , yea,06 ]
  6 We set the tightness parameter such that the in-sample fit for the euro area growth is the same found with a bivariate

VAR with euro area and US GDP.


                                                             15
for t=70,...,06 where yea,t denotes the euro area average output per capita. We also compute uncer-
tainty around the conditional expectations, which allows us to assess the statistical significance of the
differences between observed euro area and country growth rates and the conditional expectations of
the latter.7

Notice that yea,t is approximately equal to ω1,t y1,t + ... + ω12,t y12,t where ωi,t is the share of population
in country i relative to the euro area during the year t.

Figure 4 reports results for core countries. Figure 5 provides results for the other group, but also

includes Finland. The charts report 68% and 95% confidence intervals around the conditional forecast
and realized GDP growth in country i’s and in the euro area.

Let us first analyze the pre-EMU years, on the basis of which we have estimated the parameters.

What emerges from the Figures is that, for the countries of the core, uncertainty around the country’s
forecasts, conditional on observed area-wide developments, is rather limited. Moreover, for each country,
realized GDP growth is within the confidence bands around the conditional forecasts. These two facts
indicate that country specific fluctuations are rather limited and that the linkages among those countries
and the aggregate are strong.

In addition, for each country, GDP growth is very close to the growth rate of the euro area.

Finally, the individual country’s GDP growth forecasts, conditional on the euro area, are not significantly
different from the euro area GDP growth itself. This is not only a further indication that asymmetric,
idiosyncratic shocks are small, but also implies that asymmetries in the propagation of shocks are
limited.

Let us now look at the conditional forecast for the EMU period, derived under the pre-EMU structure.

In general, the realized values are not significantly different from what we would have expected on
the basis of euro area wide developments and the pre-EMU distribution. This suggests that there is
no evidence in the breakdown in the inter-relationship amongst euro area member countries, although
Austria, Italy and the Netherlands’s growth is at the edge of the 68% confidence bands in the most
recent period.
  7 The conditional mean is computed using the Kalman filter and the confidence bands are computed using the Carter

and Kohn algorithm. For details see Giannone and Lenza (2008).

INSERT FIGURE 5 OVER HERE


For the so-called periphery, the picture is more complex. For countries of this group, GDP growth
dynamics is less similar to that of the euro area. However, uncertainty around the conditional forecast
is large, indicating that the linkages between each of these countries and the rest of the euro area have
been rather weak. As a consequence of such uncertainty, realized GDP is, in general, not statistically

different from the forecast conditional on the average. This is the case not only in the pre-EMU period,
but also during the EMU years.

Spain and Portugal are interesting cases because uncertainty is more in line with that of the core
group. However, while in Spain there is a high degree of similarity with euro area aggregate dynamics
and realized GDP growth in the EMU period is exactly in line with the conditional expectation (in
the center of the confidence bands), in Portugal, the forecast conditional on the euro area is more
volatile than that of the euro area. Moreover, in Portugal, in the EMU period the realized GDP growth
has been systematically in the lower part of the distribution of the forecast conditional on area wide
developments.

Overall, these results tell us that some idiosyncracies are definitely present and, in general, they have
not decreased over time, but they remain confined to the experience of small countries, both before and
after the introduction of the common currency. Given the uncertainty, any statement on the real effect
of the EMU in these countries is likely to be ill founded.


7    The area wide business cycle

In Table 2 we have seen that, during the EMU years, all countries of the euro area experienced a
relatively low GDP growth. The average growth from 1971 to 1998 was approximately 2.2% while,
from 1999 to 2006 it was approximately 1.6%.

Seven years of data is very little to perform historical comparisons since the average length of a business
cycle is between six and nine years. However, we can perform a conditional exercise similar to the one
proposed in the previous Section. While in that exercise we forecast each country GDP per capita

                                                    17
conditional on the per-EMU structure and the observed path of euro area wide growth, here we forecast
euro area growth, conditionally on the pre EMU structure and on the observed path of US GDP growth.
The choice of the US as a conditioning variable, however, must be justified. To this end, we must show
that the relationship between US and euro area GDP growth is tight and stable.

This is a controversial fact. For example, Alesina and Giavazzi (2006) studying the relation between
GDP per capita in the US and in the largest euro area countries since 1945, have claimed that, after a
period of catch-up, the gap stabilized since the seventies, but widened again in the last decade. On the

other hand, Giannone and Reichlin (2005, 2006) show that since the 70s the euro area business cycle
has experienced a stable relation with the cycle of the US.

Let us report some descriptive statistics on the US and euro area business cycle drawn from Giannone
and Reichlin (2005, 2006).

In the Figures below we show the level of GDP per head in the two areas of the world and the gap
between the levels.


INSERT FIGURE 6 OVER HERE.



INSERT FIGURE 7 OVER HERE.


Clearly, the US and the euro area GDP per capita have moved along the same trend since 1970 with a
gap that is stationary around a constant. GDP per capita has been on average 30% lower than in the
US with no sign of catching up. Fluctuations in the gap reflect different duration and amplitude of the
two cycles (see Giannone and Reichlin, 2005, for details).

Another key characteristic, illustrated in Figure 8 and Figure 9, is that the euro area growth lags the
US. Figure 8 plots growth rates of GDP per-capita and Figure 9 its corresponding 5-years centered
average where the leading-lagging relation emerges very clearly.

                                                  18
To show that the US leading relation with respect to the euro area is robust, we must also show that US
GDP growth is a good predictor of euro area growth. The appendix shows this point by reporting both
Granger causality tests (in-sample predictability) and out-of-sample results. Results in the appendix
also show that the forecasting performances have not deteriorated with the EMU. This gives further
support to the hypothesis that the introduction of the euro has not significantly changed the historical
transatlantic linkages. In spite of the relevant changes in the macroeconomic environment (the Great
Moderation, German reunification, the euro area inception) the relationship between the US and euro

area real economic activity highlighted in Giannone and Reichlin (2005, 2006) has remained stable.

These results suggest that the euro area - US dynamics can be characterized as the euro area rate of
growth adjusting itself to the US growth while the US not responding to shocks specific to the euro
area8 .

All these results, and in particular the robustness of the out-of-sample forecast, indicate that US GDP
is a good candidate as a control variable for the counterfactual exercise on the euro area.

As we did for the countries of the euro area, here we characterize the joint dynamics of the US and
the euro area aggregate by mean of a VAR estimated until 1998. With the counterfactual we would
then ask if the latter has changed. Precisely, we ask whether, conditionally on the US cycle and the
structure of the euro area economy before the start of the EMU, we would have expected the growth
rate observed between 1999 and 2006.

The VAR is now bivariate with Yt = (yUS,t yEA,t ):

This exercise is complementary to the one performed in the previous sub-section. There we kept average
euro area as given and explored changes in heterogeneity. Here we explore changes in the average growth.
We ask whether the low growth of the euro area after 1998 should have been expected on the basis of
the pre-1999 economic structure in the area and conditional on the present, past and future realization
of the US growth.

Using the same notation as in previous section, we compute the conditional expectation:
   8 Giannone and Reichlin (2005) use the restriction implied by the Granger causality tests to simulate levels of output

and verify whether it is possible to reproduce the properties of the dating of business cycle identified from the data. They
find that the model reproduces them with a large degree of accuracy.

Figure 10 illustrates that we would have observed a large part of the slowdown, but not all. In fact, for
each year since the inception of EMU, euro area growth is not significantly different from what expected

on the basis of pre-EMU economic structure and the US business cycle. However, from 2001 till 2005
growth in the euro area is always on the lower side of the confidence bands.



8     Conclusions

Contrary to the conjecture of the pessimists and to that of the optimists, the feature of euro area
business cycles have hardly changed since the beginning of the EMU.

We have identified two groups of countries. The first is composed of EMUs members that had similar

levels of GDP per capita at the beginning of our sample, in the seventies. These countries have also
experienced similar business cycles throughout the sample period and the establishment of the EMU
has not changed this pattern. The second group is composed by member states whose level of economic
activity was more heterogeneous and that have been historically more volatile. Business cycles, for
these countries, have been less correlated with the rest of the euro area throughout the period and,
again, no change can be detected with the inception of the single currency.

This story has a remarkable implication. The loss of flexibility in exchange rate and monetary policy
had almost no effect on output co-movements across countries even if, as it has been emphasized by
many observers, EMU members states have differed from one another for what concerns degree of
competitiveness, real interest rates and other economic characteristics.

Finally, we have shown that part but not all of the relatively slow growth of the euro area in the first
years of the millennium can be attributed to the lagged response to the US cycle.

Appendix: predictive relation between the US and the Euro Area


In this section, we evaluate the forecasting performance of the bivariate US - euro area VAR we used
in Section 7.

Recall that the bivariate VAR was



                                         Yt = A(L)Yt−1 + But


with Yt = (yUS,t yEA,t ) and yUS,t and yEA,t indicating, respectively, the log-levels of the US and euro
area per capita GDP.

                                                                                  1
The variable we target is the annualized h-period change of per capita GDP:       h (yi,t+h   − yi,t ) where
i = EA, U S and h is the forecast horizon, which ranges from one to three years ahead. The full sample
is 1970 - 2006 and we evaluate the forecasting performance of the model in the two samples 1980 - 2006

and 1999 - 2006.

The evaluation exercise is out-of-sample. For each period t we estimate the bivariate VAR on the
available information up to that period and iterate the VAR h times forward to forecast US and euro
area GDP h periods ahead. We then update the database recursively until exhaustion of the sample.
The VAR model is estimated with one lag, the same specification we used for the exercises in the main
text.

We compare the performance of the bivariate VAR with a benchmark of non-forecastability, the random
walk model, whose forecast at time t for GDP growth per capita between time t and t+h is the estimated
average GDP growth rate until time t.

We also report the outcomes of an AR(1) forecast for both US and euro area per capita GDP for the
sake of assessing the contribution in terms of forecasting performance of the transatlantic linkages.

The table below can be split in two sections reporting the results for the evaluation samples 1980 - 2006
and 1999 - 2006. Results are cast in terms of the ratio of the Mean Squared Forecast error (MSFE) of
the bivariate VAR and the AR(1) models with respect to the MSFE of the random walk model.

Starting with the first section of the table which refers to the 1980 - 2006 evaluation sample, rows from
one to three refer to the three forecast horizons of one to three years ahead. Columns two and three

                                                   24
refer to the euro area while columns four and five are the analogous for the US. Notably, column two
(four) reports the ratio of the mean squared forecast error of the VAR relative to the random walk
model for the euro area (US) while column three (five) reports the ratio of the autoregressive forecast
relative to the random walk model. A number smaller than one in the ratios indicates that the VAR
or the autoregressive models outperform the random walk.

The second section of the table is the analogous of the first for the evaluation sample 1999 - 2006 and
does not need further explanation.
 Evaluation period                     1980 - 2006                                 1999 - 2006
 Countries             Euro area              US                     Euro area            US
 Ratio                 VAR/RW        AR/RW VAR/RW         AR/RW      VAR/RW      AR/RW VAR/RW              AR/RW
 h=1                     0.51         0.96      1.24       1.15        0.66       0.81      1.00            1.02
 h=2                     0.52         1.02      1.29       1.25        0.66       0.83      1.17            1.16
 h=3                     0.67         1.08      1.48       1.46        0.78       0.94      1.44            1.39


Focusing on the 1980 - 2006 sample, first, it can be seen that US GDP per capita helps to forecast GDP
per capita in the euro area. The MSFE error of the VAR model, in fact, is about half of the MSFE of
the random walk and the AR(1) model at the one and two years ahead horizon and about 70% three
years ahead. The euro area GDP per capita does not help to forecast US GDP, instead.

Results are qualitatively confirmed in the euro area sample 1999 - 2006 showing that, in particular, the
forecasting performance of the bivariate VAR is robust to the changes in the monetary policy regime
that came with the inception of the euro area.

In addition we report upper and lower bounds (dark red for the 68% and light red for the 95%
confidence bands) for the GDP in each country conditional to the observation of the euro area
GDP. The conditional expectations are computed using the parameters estimated using the sample
1970-1998. Data source: OECD, National Accounts.

    The figure reports GDP growth observed in each country and the euro area GDP growth.
In addition we report upper and lower bounds (dark red for the 68% and light red for the 95%
confidence bands) for the GDP in each country conditional to the observation of the euro area
GDP. The conditional distributions are computed using the parameters estimated using the sample
1970-1998. Data source: OECD, National Accounts.
