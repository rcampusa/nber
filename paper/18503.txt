                                           ABSTRACT

A number of authors have argued that a worker's occupation of employment is at least as important
as the worker's industry of employment in determining whether the worker will be hurt or helped by
international trade. We investigate the role of occupational mobility on the effects of trade shocks
on wage inequality in a dynamic, structural econometric model of worker adjustment. Each worker
in our specification can switch either industry, occupation, or both, paying a time-varying cost to do
so in a rational-expectations optimizing environment. We find that the costs of switching industry
and occupation are both high, and of similar magnitude, but in simulations we find that a worker's
industry of employment is much more important than either the worker's occupation or skill class in
determining whether or not she is harmed by a trade shock.

   Among the key questions trade economists need to be able to answer is: When a trade
shock strikes such as liberalization, trade agreement, or expansion of a foreign export power,
who benefits and who is hurt, and by how much? There are as many ways of approaching
these questions as there are ways of dividing people into economically meaningful subgroups.
The oldest literature divided people by what can be called ‘class’ lines, making a distinc-
tion between workers and the owners of physical or human capital – the Stolper-Samuelson
approach. More recent approaches have divided up workers based on their industry of
employment (Revenga (1992), Pavcnik, Attanasio and Goldberg (2004), Artuç, Chaudhuri
and McLaren (2010)); region of residence (Topalova (2007), Kovak (2010), Hakobyan and
McLaren (2010)); and age (Artuç (2012a)), in each case attempting to quantify how trade
shocks affect people in the different groups differently.
   More recently, several studies have focussed on a division of workers by occupations,
often making use of a data set explored by Autor, Levy, and Murnane (2003) that breaks
down the ‘task’ composition of a wide range of occupations in US labor data. Authors
who exploit these distinctions to look at the differential effects of trade shocks on workers
with different types of occupations include Peri and Sparber (2009), Ebenstein, Harrison,
McMillan, and Phillips (2009), and Liu and Trefler (2011). Some of the results in Ebenstein
et. al. (2009), in particular, suggest that occupational distinctions may be more important
than industry in identifying who loses from globalization, that it is workers in vulnerable
occupations (namely, those that are the most offshorable) in affected industries who lose.

                                               2
If this is right, it is important information for policymakers to have to be able to target
compensation programs effectively.
   We take the focus on occupations in a new direction. Building on earlier work (Artuç,
Chaudhuri and McLaren (2010)) (henceforth ACM) in which we estimated the costs to work-
ers of switching industries in a dynamic model in order to measure the welfare effects of trade
shocks on workers in different industries, we expand our framework to allow workers to change
both their industry and their occupations, estimating the costs of doing so in an integrated
dynamic structural econometric model. Our strategy is to specify a rational-expectations
model in which industry and occupational switching is a forward-looking investment decision
by long-lived workers; estimate the key structural parameters (particularly means and vari-
ances of moving costs) on worker data; and then simulate the effects of trade shocks using
these estimates to analyze welfare and the time-path of the labor market’s adjustment.
   This approach has a number of advantages. First, it allows us to incorporate a real
dynamic analysis into the effect on different occupations. Workers can and do change oc-
cupation, but it is costly to do so, and the degree of cost will affect the wage effects of a
trade shock as well as how those wage changes translate into welfare changes. Importantly,
a dynamic analysis allows us to identify the role of option value, which has been shown to
have a large effect on the welfare analysis of trade shocks (Artuç, Chaudhuri and McLaren
(2010)). If one’s wage in one’s own industry and occupation is reduced by a policy change,
but wages in other occupations and industries to which one might consider switching are
increased, then the positive option-value effect brought about by the latter may dominate
the negative direct effect of the former. One needs a dynamic model with option value built
in in order to find out what the net effect is.
   Second, we will argue that a full account of occupational choice can have a significant
effect on the whole pattern of gains and losses from trade shocks. Take a simple thought
experiment as an example. Consider an economy with two goods and two types of worker,
skilled and unskilled. Each good is produced by workers doing either of two tasks; output is
a function of how many hours of each task are done, and the two goods differ in their task
intensity. A worker’s ‘occupation’ is defined by which task he or she performs. Consider
three cases.
   Case 1. If skilled workers can all do task 1 but unskilled workers can do only task 2 and


                                                  3
it is easy for a worker of either occupation to switch between industries, then this model is
merely a thinly disguised Heckscher-Ohlin model, and standard Stolper-Samuleson results
will obtain. If the country involved is skilled-labor abundant compared to the rest of the
world, then trade opening will increase wage inequality. Further, to know whether a given
worker gains or loses, all one needs to know is that worker’s skill class. The occupation and
industry of employment are superfluous.
    Case 2. Now, suppose that a worker of either skill class can choose either occupation,
and the choice is partly determined by idiosyncratic preferences; but once that choice has
been made, it is very costly to switch to another occupation. At the same time, it is easy for
a worker of either occupation to switch industries. In that case, there will be both skilled
and unskilled workers in both occupations. Stolper-Samuelson logic will ensure that the
occupation that is intensive in the import-competing industry will be made worse off due to
trade opening, while the other occupation will benefit. In this case, to know whether a given
worker gains or loses, all one needs to know is that worker’s occupation. The worker’s skill
class and industry of employment are superfluous.
    Case 3. However, if either kind of worker can do either task with equal ease, and can
switch between them readily, then skilled and unskilled workers will have the same wage,
with or without trade, and so a trade shock will raise (or lower) all boats equally.
    Clearly, even if all we are interested in is the effect of trade on income inequality as
between skilled and unskilled workers, the degree of occupational mobility has an enormous
effect.
    To anticipate results, we find that both inter-sectoral and inter-occupational switching
costs are large, and that they are similar in magnitude. Nonetheless, idiosyncratic shocks to
the switching decision are also large, so that a non-negligible fraction of US workers switch
along both dimensions every year. We also find that these costs are sub-additive, in the sense
that the cost of switching both sector and occupation is much less than the cost of switching
only industry plus the cost of switching only occupation. In addition, these costs are quite
different in character for college-educated and non-college-educated workers. Finally, despite
the extremely high costs of switching occupation, the main determinant of whether a worker
benefits from trade liberalization or not is that worker’s industry. In our simulations, one’s
occupation of employment makes almost no difference to the direction of welfare effect once


                                              4
industry has been taken into account.
    Aside from our previous efforts in ACM, this equilibrium approach is related to some
other work on the relationship between occupational choice and income distribution. Liu
and Trefler (2011) use an equilibrium Roy-type model with endogenous matching of work-
ers to occupations to interpret patterns of occupational adjustment in tradeable services
occupations in response to international offshoring. They show that increased competition
with foreign workers tends to lead to increased switching to lower-wage occupations for some
workers and to higher-wage occupations for others. Crucially, if one allows for unobserved
heterogeneity in worker productivity the welfare losses to a worker from a trade-induced
downward occupational switch are greatly diminished. Kambourov and Manovskii (2009)
use a general-equilibrium model with optimal dynamic occupational choice to show that
rises in the volatility of occupation-specific productivity can help explain increases in income
inequality in the data.
    In addition, we are adding to the developing literature on dynamic general-equilibrium
adjustment to trade shocks. Cosar (2010) studies a model with costly adjustment due to
search frictions, calibrated to Brazilian data. Dix-Carneiro (2011) estimates a structural
model of dynamic labor-market response with costly adjustment and sector-specific human
capital, again using Brazilian data. Each of these studies pursues similar themes but em-
phasizes different aspects of adjustment. In particular, our focus on occupational choice is
complementary to the approaches of the other studies.
    The next section lays out our model and estimation method. The following section shows
the data and estimations, and the last section details the simulation results.


1     Model
We extend the model presented in ACM and Cameron Chaudhuri McLaren (2009) to include
occupations along with sectors. Each worker chooses her sector i and occupation k jointly
in each period in order to maximize her expected present discounted utility. Assume that
there are I industries (sectors) and K occupations. There are two skill groups, indexed by s:
College-educated workers, indicated by s = c, and non-college educated workers, indicated
by s = n. Assume that workers cannot change their skill status.


                                               5
       For the moment, we take wages as exogenously given, because it simplifies the discussion
of the empirics. However, in Section 3 we will endogenize wages in each sector by specifying a
spot market for labor in each sector that clears in each period (and of course the endogenous
effect of trade shocks on wages is a major focus of this inquiry). Each period t, the wage
wtiks for each sector i, occupation k and skill class s is realized and observed by all. Each
worker understands the distribution of future wages and optimizes accordingly.
       In order to accommodate the fact that workers who appear identical to the econometrician
often do different things, we introduce idiosyncratic shocks to workers’ preferences. If worker
n in skill class s spends period t working in occupation k in sector i, her instantaneous utility
is wtiks +ηtiks +nik        nik
                  t , where t   is a cell-specific iid utility shock with extreme value distribution
with variance parameter ν which are drawn separately by each worker in every period,1 and
ηtiks is an iid shock to the attractiveness of working in industry-occupation cell (i, k) that is
common to all workers of skill class s. We will henceforth refer to these two shocks as the
‘idiosyncratic shock’ and the ‘common shock,’ respectively. We adopt the timing assumption
that a worker in sector-occupation cell (i, k) at the beginning of period t enjoys wage wtiks
and non-pecuniary benefit ηtiks for sure, but will receive the idiosyncratic benefit nik
                                                                                      t   only if
she remains in that cell. If she switches to cell (j, l) during period t, then at the end of the
period she will receive idiosyncratic benefit njl
                                               t   instead.
                                                             nIK 0
       We assume that a worker learns nt = [n11  n12
                                              t , t , ..., t  ] , and then decides to move
or stay, with moving cost C(i, k, j, l, s), where i and k are the worker’s initial sector and
occupation, and j and l are her final sector and occupation. If a worker does not change
her sector or occupation then the moving cost is equal to zero, so C(i, k, i, k, s) = 0. In
principle, we could assume a different value for the moving cost for each value of (i, j, k, l, s)
and estimate each one, but this would make the model impossible to estimate. We will
therefore need to parameterize the moving cost function somehow, and we will show later
on how we do this.

    More precisely, we set the parameters for this two-parameter family of distributions equal to (−γν, ν),

1.1      Equilibrium relationships.
The optimization problem for worker z can be summarized by the following Bellman equa-
tion, in which Utiks (zt , ηtiks ) is the ex post payoff to the worker in period t conditional on
the realization of that period’s shocks, and Vtiks is the ex ante expected payoff to a worker,
where the expectation is taken with respect to that period’s shocks: the vector of idiosyn-
cratic shocks, zt , and the common preference shock ηtiks .



   Utiks (εzt , ηtiks ) = wtiks + ηtiks + max{εzjl                             jls
                                               t − Ct (i, k, j, l, s) + βEt [Vt+1 ]}
                                                        j,l

                       = wti + ηtiks + βEt [Vt+1

                                                           t − Ct (i, k, j, l, s) + βVt+1 − βVt+1 }.
                                                                            j,l


   Taking expectations with respect to all shocks, this yields:


                                                                                                                                            

where Ωiks
       t   is interpreted as an option-value term. In other words, the expected payoff to a
worker in a given cell at a given date is equal to the current wage plus common non-pecuniary
benefit, plus the continuation value if the worker stays in that cell next period, plus the value
of the option of moving to another sector and/or occupation.
   Due to the extreme value distribution of the t , it can be shown that workers’ optimal
choice of sector-occupation cell in each period will satisfy:

where mikjls
       t     denotes the fraction of workers of s type in sector-occupation cell (i, k) who
choose to move to cell (j, l) in period t, which we will call the gross flow from that origin cell
to that destination cell. This is the same as the functional form familiar from multinomial
logit problems (a full algebraic derivation can be found in the appendix of Artuç, Chaudhuri


                                                                        7
and McLaren (2007)). Essentially, (2) says that the more attractive (j, l) is expected to be
in the future relative to other cells, and the lower is the cost of switching to it from (i, k),
then the larger is the fraction of workers who will choose that location. Crucially, however,
this response of the gross flow to the future relative attractiveness or current switching cost
is determined by the parameter ν, which we may recall is proportional to the variance of the
idiosyncratic shocks nt . A large value of ν implies that idiosyncratic preference shocks tend
to be large; in the limit, those shocks are all workers care about, and so workers will disregard
relative future profitability in choosing their sectors and occupations. More generally, the
mikjls
 t     will respond more to future expected wage differentials the smaller is ν. This point
will be useful in identifying ν econometrically.


1.2    Econometric method.
The estimation method is described in detail with full derivations in Artuç (2012b). We need
to estimate the parameters of the moving costs, Ctikjls , as well as the idiosyncratic variance
ν. In addition, we need to estimate the means η̄ iks of the common preference shocks ηtiks .
We do this in two stages, using the two equations discussed above, the gross-flows equation
(2) and the Bellman equation (1).
   The first stage uses (2) with data on actual gross flows to estimate value differences
and the moving cost function normalized with ν. Equation (2) can be estimated using the
following Poisson Pseudo Maximum Likelihood regression equation

                      ytikjls = exp(λjls  iks                         ikjls
                                     t + αt − Ct (i, k.j, l, s)/ν) + ξt     ,                (3)

with destination fixed effect λjls                      iks
                               t , origin fixed effect αt   and bilateral resistance parameter
Ct (i, k.j, l, s)/ν, where y ikjst is the number of type s workers switching from cell (ik) to
cell (jl) and ξtikjls is an error term that arises from sampling error, since we compute ytikjls
from a finite sample. Asymptotically ytikjls = Liks

s workers in cell (ik) at time t. The econometric approach in the first stage is similar to
Santos Silva and Tenreyro’s (2006) method of “gravity” estimation where the moving cost
parameter corresponds to bilateral resistance term and the value differences correspond to
the destination fixed effects. The destination fixed effects are equal to

   This estimation can be done for each year of the data as a separate cross section.
   These parameters for the first-stage regression can be identified from gross flows alone.
Consider, for example, a model with many cells, and suppose that at time t a large fraction
of type-s workers in every other cell moves to cell (i, k) and a large fraction also move to
                                      0 0
cell i0 , k 0 (so that mjliks
                        t     and mjli

                                       ks
                                          are both fairly big for (j, l) 6= (i, k), (i0 , k 0 )). However,
only a low fraction of workers in (i, k) switch to other cells in period t, while a large fraction
                                                                                       0 0 0 0
of workers in (i0 , k 0 ) switch cells (in other words, mikiks
                                                         t     is large while mit k i k s is small).
Equation (2) then implies that λiks
                                t   is large relative to λjls
                                                          t   for (j, l) 6= (i, k) (so that the
numerator of mjliks
              t     is large and the denominator of mikiks
                                                     t     is small), while Ct (j, l, i0 , k 0 , s)/ν
                                                                                                       0 0
is small relative to switching costs for other destinations (so that the numerator of mtjli k s
                                                                0 0 0 0
can be large at the same time as the denominator of mit k i k s is large).
   Further, once these have been estimated, the option value terms ν1 Ωiks
                                                                       t   can be calculated

   The second stage uses the difference between (1) as written out for cell (i, k) and the
same equation as written out for cell (j, l), multiplied by βν :

                                                                     t+1 ) +    Ωt   − Ωjls

   In (5), all of the variables are either in the data (namely, the wages) or estimated from
Stage 1, except for the ηtiks ’s and the parameters β and ν. Recalling that ηtiks is equal to η̄ iks
                                                                                                  1
plus an iid disturbance, we can treat (5) as a linear regression to estimate η̄ iks and           ν
                                                                                                      with
the data from all years pooled. The disturbance term to the ηtiks acts as the error term for
the regression.
   Roughly, the idea is as follows. Stage 1 uses the observed gross flows of workers to infer
the (i) ‘pull’ λiks
                t   of each sector/occupation cell at each date, which is a combination of
                                                                                 β
the future relative profitability of each cell with the responsiveness           ν
                                                                                     of workers to that
  2
    A key to the derivation is the fact that with the extreme-value distribution for the εt matrix, Ωiks
                                                                                                     t   =
−ν log(mikik ).



                                                    9
future profitability; and (ii) the cost of switching. But that does not allow us to separate
out the future relative profitability from the responsiveness. Having, then, a panel of such
‘pull’ estimates and the costs, we can put them together in Stage 2 with wages to see how
much the ‘pull’ is affected by changes in wage differentials. This allows us to separate out
                               β
the ‘responsiveness’ factor    ν
                                   and complete the estimation. Essentially, if gross flows do not
                                                                        β
respond very much to future wage differentials, a low value of          ν
                                                                            will be indicated, otherwise
a high value.
        A qualification that should be noted is that in principle equation (5) can be used to
estimate β as well as ν, but in practice it turns out to be difficult to do so. The reason
is that significant changes in β induce only small changes in equilibrium aggregates. As a
result, we impose a value of β that seems reasonable based on the literature, and examine
how robust results are to changes in its value.


2         Data and Regression Analysis

2.1        Sector and Occupation Categories.
We use the March Current Population Surveys (CPS) from 1975 to 2000 of the US Census
to estimate the model. Dimensionality issues force us to aggregate sectors and occupations,
with the result that we consider 4 sectors and 5 occupations. The sectors are: 1. Agriculture
and Construction; 2. Manufacturing; 3. Non-traded Service; and 4. Traded Service.3
        Similarly, we need to aggregate occupations. We follow the Census categories to do this,
with one small exception. The occupations we use are:

    1. White collar (the Census category of “Managerial and Professional Specialty Occupa-
          tions,” occupation codes 3-199). Managers and accountants are examples.
    3
     “Agriculture and Construction” is composed of Census industries 1-3, respectively “Agriculture,” “Min-
ing” and “Construction.” “Manufacturing” is composed of Census industries 4-5, respectively durables and
non-durables manufacturing. “Non-tradable services” is composed of Census industries 8, 10, 14, and 16,
respectively “Utilities,” “Retail Trade,” “Entertainment and Recreational Services,” and “Public Admin-
istration.” “Tradable services” is composed of Census industries 6, 7, 9, 11, 12, 13, and 15, respectively
“Transportation, Communication, and Other Public Utilities,” “Communications,” “Wholesale Trade,” “Fi-
nance, Insurance, and Real Estate,” “Business and Repair Services,” and “Personal and Related Services,”
and “Professional Services.”



                                                    10
  2. Tech/Sales (the Census category of “Technical, Sales and Administrative Support Oc-
      cupations,” occupation codes 203-389). Dental hygienists (204) and computer pro-
      grammers (229) are examples.

  3. Service (combination of the two smallest Census categories: “Service occupations,”
      occupation codes 403-469, and “Farming, Forestry and Fishing Occupations,” occupa-
      tion codes 473-499). Childcare workers (406), firefighters (417), and waiters (435) are
      examples.

  4. Craft (the Census category of “Precision Production, Craft and Repair,” occupation
      codes 503-699). Automobile mechanics (505) and Drywall installers (573) are examples.

  5. Laborer (Census category “Operators, Fabricators, and Laborers,” occupation codes
      703-889.). Printing-press operators (734) and truck drivers (804) are examples.

   The only departure we make from the Census categories is to combine the last two
categories into the ‘laborer’ occupation, since these two are quite small. In addition to
sector and occupation, we group workers into two education groups, workers with no college
education, workers with some college education.


2.2    The Switching-Cost Function.
We can now show how we implement the switching-cost function Ct (i, k, j, l, s) empirically. In
principle, we could assume a different value for the moving cost for each value of (i, j, k, l, s)
and estimate each one, but this would create a vast number of parameters and make iden-
tification of those parameters impossible. Therefore, we need to parameterize the moving
cost function somehow. We have attempted to build a specification that is rich but at the
same time parsimonious, and have allowed for four types of effect on switching cost that
might or might not turn out to be important in the data. First, we allow for the possibility
that some industries or occupations are harder to get into than others. This leads us to
estimate an ‘entry cost’ for each sector and for each occupation. Second, we allow for the
possibility that the cost of switching both sector and occupation is different from the sum
of the cost of switching sector and the cost of switching occupations – that there may be
some non-linearity in the cost of joint switching. Finally, we allow for the possibility of a

                                               11
pecking order in occupations such that it may be more costly to switch to occupation j from
a lower-ranked occupation than from a higher-ranked occupation. To do this as simply as
possible, we note that occupational categories 1 and 2 above are mainly office-type work
while 3-5 are mainly not, and that the industries are ranked in inverse order of share of
college-educated workers. We will call a switch from occupation 2 to 1 a movement upward
within the office occupations; a movement from 5 to 3 or 4 or form 4 to 3 a movement upward
within non-office occupations; and a movement from 3, 4, or 5 to 1 or 2 a movement into
the office category. We will allow each of these three moves to generate an additional cost.
       More precisely, we specify the function as follows:

                  Ct (i, k, j, l, s) = 0 if i = j, k = l;                                                    (6)
                                    = Ct1,j,s if i 6= j, k = l;                                              (7)
                                    = Ct2,l,s + Ct3,k,l,s if i = j, k 6= l;                                  (8)
                                    = Ct1,j,s + Ct2,l,s + Ct3,k,l,s + Ct4,s if i 6= j, k 6= l,               (9)

where Ct1,j,s , Ct2,l,s , Ct3,k,l,s , and Ct4,s are parameters common to all workers. The interpre-
tation is as follows. First, the value Ct1,j,s is the ‘entry cost’ mentioned above for switching
sectors, and the cost indicated in line (7) applies when the worker switches sectors (i 6= j)
but not occupations (k = l). The value Ct2,l,s is the corresponding ‘entry cost’ for switching
occupations, and the cost indicated in line (8) applies when the worker switches occupation
(k 6= l) but not sector (i = j).
       Second, for each educational class s, the function Ct3,k,l,s captures the possible ‘pecking-
order’ effects discussed above, and can take one of three values: (i) The value Ctwithin office,s ,
if 2 ≥ k > l, so that the transition takes place from one office occupation to another higher
on the pecking order; (ii) The value Ctnon-office,s , if k > l ≤ 3, so that the transition takes
place from one non-office occupation to another that is higher on the pecking order; or (iii)
The value Ctto office,s , if k ≥ 3 > l, so the transition takes place from a non-office occupation
to an office occupation.4
   4
    In earlier drafts, the Ct4,s term was absent. We are grateful to many seminar participants who have
suggested richer cost structures than the simple one we started with; this specification is a fairly parsimonious
way of incorporating some of those ideas. It does not, in the end, change the results dramatically; results
with the Ct4,s term omitted are available on request.



                                                       12
    Third, we allow for the possibility that the cost of switching in one dimension is affected
by whether or not the worker is switching in the other dimension. For example, if a worker
is switching sectors, that may raise the cost of also switching occupations, since there is a
rising marginal cost of additional complexity in decision making; or it may lower the cost
of switching occupations, since switching sectors already creates as much disruption in the
worker’s life as it is possible to create. In other words, we allow for the possibility that these
switching costs are not simply additive. The parameter Ct4,s captures this in line (9) where
both sector and occupation are changing (i 6= j, k 6= l), and could be positive (as in the first
case just mentioned) or negative (as in the second). All of these parameters may differ by
skill class s.


2.3     Descriptive Statistics.
We normalize annual real wages so that the average annual real wage across all workers in
the sample is unity. Table 1 shows the distribution of normalized wages across occupations
and sectors along with the number of observations for each type. The highest average wages
are found in White-collar occupations, followed by the Tech/Sales category.


2.4     Rates of Mobility: Transition Matrices.
Tables 2 and 3 summarize occupational and sectoral mobility of the workers in our sample
respectively, showing transition from row to column. The main diagonal of Table 2 shows
the fraction of workers in each occupation who stay in that occupation each year, on average.
This varies from 95% for service occupations to 96.7% for craft occupations. Clearly, most
workers do not switch industry in a given year, which is hardly surprising, but the fraction
who do varies from 3.3% to 5% which is significant. In addition, note that the off-diagonal
elements are all positive, ranging from the 0.5% of laborers who move to white-collar jobs
each year (or white-collar to service) to the 2.1% of service workers who move to laborer
occupations.
    The distinction made above between office occupations and non-office occupations ap-
pears to be meaningful. All of the rates of flow between office categories (White collar and
Tech/Sales) and between non-office categories (Service, Craft and Laborer) are, with one

   The matrix for sectoral mobility is similar. The rate of switching varies from 2.8% for
manufacturing to 5.3% for agriculture and construction. The off-diagonal elements range
from the 0.7% of manufacturing workers who switch to agriculture and construction each
year to the 2.5% of non-traded services workers who switch to traded services each year.
The biggest inflows from any initial sector are into traded services.

   We are, of course, interested in joint mobility decisions, and so we need to think about
the possibility that a worker will move along both dimensions at once. Table 4 shows how
frequently this occurs compared to switching along only one dimension. For each of the
twenty sector-occupation cells, the third column of the table shows the average fraction
of workers who change sector but not occupation each year, the fourth column shows the
fraction who change occupation but not sector, and the fifth column shows the fraction
who change both. The fraction who change along both dimensions is consistently similar
in magnitude to the number who change in either dimension alone. Indeed, for some cells

                                             15
sectoral switches alone are more frequent than occupational switches alone; for other cells the
pattern is the reverse; but for most cells the frequency of switching along both dimensions
is either between the frequency of switching only sector and the frequency of switching only
occupation or – more often – higher than either. Put differently, the probability that a
worker switches sector is quite similar to the probability that a worker switches occupation,
and a worker who switches in one dimension is at least as likely also to switch in the other
dimension as not. This all suggests that the costs of switching along either dimension are
likely quite similar, and the cost of switching both is likely not significantly greater than the
cost of switching only one, which would imply a negative value of C 4,s . This is all borne out
in the estimates, as will be seen shortly.

   In Table 5, we present the ratio of industry-occupation cells for each industry and occu-

pation and the ratio of college graduates in each cell. The first column shows the share of
each occupation in the corresponding sector’s labor force. For example, 35% of manufactur-
ing employees are classed as Laborers, higher than any other sector. By contrast, 44% of
Traded Services workers are White-collar, making it the most white-collar intensive sector.
The second column shows the share of each occupation working in each sector. For example,
only 7 percent of “white collar” workers are in the “agriculture and construction” sector.
About half of office workers are in the traded services sector, and about half of laborers are
in manufacturing. The last column shows the ratio of college graduates in each industry-
occupation cell. For example, 72 percent of traded services sector white collar workers are
college graduates, while only 3% of manufacturing-sector laborers are.

3     Results.
The estimation results from the first stage are presented in Table 6, and the results from the
second stage are presented in Table 7. Recalling that estimation in Stage 2 depends on β,
and that we are not estimating β, the results in Table 7 are presented for an assumed value
of β = 0.97 and also for β = 0.9. These two values bracket the great majority of discount
factors used in the literature. For our purposes, the results are virtually identical (which
underscores the difficulty of estimating β). For simplicity, we will unless otherwise stated
refer to the β = 0.97 estimates.
    The estimated moving costs are all quite large. For example, the ratio C 2js /ν corre-
sponding to the cost of entering a white-collar occupation for a non-college educated worker
                                            1
is 5.24, which, given our estimate of       ν
                                                as 3.89 (from Table 7) and hence ν = 0.257 im-
          2js
plies C         = 1.35. In other words, given our normalization of wages, the cost of entering a
white-collar occupation for a non-college educated worker is something more than an aver-
age worker’s annual income (ignoring for the moment the additional cost of ‘pecking-order
effects’ captured by Ct3,k,l,s in (8) above. These will be discussed below.). This should not
be taken literally, but rather indicates that there are large frictions in the reallocation of
labor that are picked up by the estimation – gross flows of workers do respond to future
wage differentials, but only weakly. At the same time, as indicated by the mobility matrix
tables, a small but positive fraction of workers do switch both sector and occupation each
year. This is possible within the model because of a large value of ν. The implied value of
ν = 0.257, given the extreme-value distribution, amounts to a standard deviation for nik
                                                                                      t   of
0.33. In other words, the standard deviation of the idiosyncratic preference shock for non-
pecuniary enjoyment of a given sector-occupation cell is one third of average annual income,
indicating that occasionally, even with no differences in wages across cells at all, a worker
will be willing to incur a large cost in order to switch from the low-idiosyncratic-benefit cell
to the high-benefit cell.
    In interpreting results, it should be pointed out that the moving cost for any worker is
actually Ctikjls + iks  jls
                    t − t , the common moving cost plus the idiosyncratic part. As a result,
for workers who actually move, the cost incurred will generally be less than C ikjls , since it
is workers with low idiosyncratic costs who will chose to move.
    At the same time, note that the cost of entering white-collar occupations for a college-

                                                   18
educated worker is less than for a non-college educated worker, at (4.55)(0.257) = 1.17. As
one might have expected, it is easier for a college-educated worker to get a white-collar job
than for a non-college-educated worker. For non-college educated workers, there are two
groups of occupations: The easy occupations to enter are Tech/Sales and Laborer, with
entry-cost parameters around 4.8, while the difficult ones are all the others including White
collar, with parameters between 5.24 and 5.4. For college-educated workers, the costs range
from a low of 4.55 for White collar to a high of 5.57 for Crafts. The comparative advantage of
the two educational classes is clear: The cost of entering White collar jobs for a non-college
educated worker is substantially higher than the cost of entering a Laborer job, but the
reverse is true for college-educated workers.
   The costs of switching sectors are similar in magnitude to the costs of switching oc-
cupation, but unlike for occupations, the patterns of costs are quite similar for the two
educational groups. For both, it is much easier to move into the traded services sector than
the manufacturing sector, for example.
   Clearly, these estimates do not imply any tendency for wages to be equated across sectors
or occupations, either in the short run or in the long run. A worker chasing high wages would
need to see a very substantial wage difference, expected to persist quite a long time, in order
to justify incurring switching costs of the magnitude observed here. In addition, the high
variance of the idiosyncratic shocks, as measured by ν, suggests that workers behave as if
they take factors other than wages into account in their career decisions. This is true despite
the fact that workers are quite mobile in the sense that there are always workers switching
sector and occupation, as shown in Tables 2 to 4. This feature of this sort of model is
discussed at some length in Artuç, Chaudhuri and McLaren (2008).
   Importantly, note that the last row of Table 6 shows a value for C 4 that is always negative,
with a value around 4. This means that the cost of switching both sector and occupation
is roughly the same as switching either sector or occupation, which is consistent with the
patterns noted in Table 4.
   ‘Pecking-order effects’ are captured by the last three rows of each panel of Table 6. Clearly
the costs up moving up the occupation ladder within the office-job category and within the
non-office category are both essentially zero and statistically insignificant. There is weak
evidence for a cost of switching from the non-office category to the office category, but the


                                                19
magnitude of the coefficient is small and it is not statistically significant.
    Note that although the entry costs we have estimated are sizable, they are an order of
magnitude smaller than estimates obtained with a similar model in ACM. The main reason
is that here we have allowed for the sector-occupation aggregate preference shocks ηtiks , which
were absent in ACM. They are not of independent interest, but their estimated values are
presented in Table 7.


4     Simulations
We can now turn to simulation of a trade liberalization. For this, we need to complete the
general-equilibrium model and calibrate it. We specify production functions for each sector
below, and assume a spot market for labor in each sector that clears each period given the
number of workers in each cell as of the beginning of the period. We will also specify trade
policy that determines the prices of all tradeable goods for each date, and assume that all
workers know that sequence. In addition, for this exercise, we suppress the shocks (ηtiks ) to
preferences (see (1)), since they are a distraction from our interest in the effects of a trade
shock. We also take the mean value of the parameters (Ct1is )’s, (Ct2ls )’s, Ct3,k,l,s ’s, and (Ct4s )’s
and hold them constant for the simulation.
    Given this structure, an equilibrium can be described as follows. (i) Consider a sequence
V of matrices of cell payoffs Vt ≡ {Vtiks }i=1,...I,k=1,...K from t = 0 to ∞ and an initial allocation
of workers across the cells given by the matrix L0 ≡ {Liks
                                                       0 }i=1,...I,k=1,...K for s = c, n. (ii) Given
L0 and product prices at t = 0, marginal value products of labor for each type of labor in
each cell and hence period-0 wages can be computed, and given expected next-period values
V1 , the gross-flows matrix can be computed from (2). Therefore, the next-period allocation
of labor L1 and next-period wages can also be computed. Proceeding in this way, the whole
infinite sequence of labor allocations and wages can be computed, and from (1), the implied
sequence of cell payoffs can be computed, and can be denoted Ṽ . (iv) The value sequence
V is, then, an equilibrium with initial allocation L0 if and only if V = Ṽ . Existence and
uniqueness of equilibrium are proven for a very similar model in Cameron, Chaudhuri and
McLaren (2007), and a slight modification of the proof would ensure the same result here.
Computational details are discussed in Artuç, Chaudhuri and McLaren (2008).

       We assume Cobb-Douglas production functions for each sector i:

                                                      Y i,k ik
                                           qti = Ai    (Lt )α ,                                         (10)
                                                      k

where qti is the value of output, Li,k
                                   t is the effective human capital in sector i and occupation

k, which is the human-capital-adjusted sum of number of college graduates and non-college
graduates: Li,k
            t   = ψ ik Li,k,c
                        t     + Li,k,n
                                 t     .5 We do not require the αik weights in (10) to sum to
unity for any sector, in order to allow for sector-specific capital, which is absorbed by the Ai
factor, together with the price of sector-i output.
       The consumers have identical Cobb-Douglas preferences with shares θi . This matters
because all wages are real wages, meaning the marginal value product of the particular
kind of labor in the particular sector-occupation cell, divided by the consumer price index
(CPI) derived from the common utility function. For example, real wages in a non-import-
competing sector will tend to rise with liberalization because it tends to lower the prices of
other sectors’ output and therefore the CPI.
       We set the values Ai and αik to minimize a loss function; specifically, for any set of
parameter values, we can compute the predicted wage for each sector and that sector’s
predicted share of GDP using (10) and its derivatives together with empirical employment
levels for each sector. The loss function is then the sum across sectors and across years of
the square of each sector’s predicted wage minus mean wage in the data, plus the square of
the sector’s predicted minus its actual share of GDP. (The sector GDP figures are from the
BEA, but the wages are from our sample.) In addition, we assume that all workers have
identical Cobb-Douglas preferences, using consumption shares from the BLS consumer price
index calculations for the consumption weights. The values of ψ ik are given by the average
skill premium within each cell. The calibration results are presented in Table 8. Note that,
   5
     We examined a more flexible CES within-occupation aggregation of the two types of labor, but our
estimates of the elasticity of substitution between the two types of labor within occupations produced very
high values, 60 and above. Perfect substitutability within each industry-occupation cell seems like a good
approximation. Please note that this is different from the elasticity of substitution between high- and low-
skilled workers examined by other authors in models without occupations, such as Ottaviano and Peri (2012,
Table 5), for example. Their estimates of the elasticity of substitution between high- and low-skilled labor
take a value around 2, but since generally high- and low-skilled workers have different mixes of occupations,
this should be thought of as picking up substitutability across occupations as well as across educational
classes.

consistent with the patterns observed in Table 5, the Traded and Non-traded Services sectors
are the most White-collar intensive (as indicated by their high values of α1 in Table 8), and
Manufacturing is the most Laborer intensive (as indicated by its high value of α5 ).

    We treat manufacturing and traded services as goods whose prices are determined on
world markets, while the other two sectors produce non-traded output whose prices adjust
to clear the domestic market. Our simulation is not intended to reproduce the historical
data in detail, but to provide an example of a liberalization that produces changes in trade
volumes roughly of the same order of magnitude as what has been experienced in the period
of the data. With that in mind, the liberalization experiment is set up as follows. The world
prices of manufactures and traded services are 0.85 and 1 respectively. Initially, there is a 30%
tariff on manufactures, so the domestic price is 1.15, and this is expected by all to continue
permanently. From that initial steady state, suddenly at t = 0 the tariff is eliminated, and
is expected to stay at zero permanently.6 Our simulation, then, begins at date t = 0, with
   6
     Since the Ai factor includes the price, we operationalize this by reducing Ai , holding all other param-
eters constant. The non-traded sectors’ prices, thus Ai ’s, are re-calculated for each time period during the
transition.

initial allocation of labor given by the old steady state. We run the simulation under the
assumptions β = 0.9 and β = 0.97.
   The results from the simulation with β = 0.97 are shown in the figures. (The figures for
β = 0.9 are almost identical.) Figure 1 shows the evolution of the allocation of labor across
the four sectors in the data from 1975 to 2000, while Figure 2 shows the same evolution in our
simulation, starting 5 years before the liberalization. Although our simulation has not been
calibrated to match this time-path for labor allocations, the broad patterns in the data are
echoed in the simulation. The driving force in the simulation is a simple elimination of the
manufacturing tariff, while in the historical data the same effect – a dwindling manufacturing
labor force and relocation of workers especially to traded services – has been driven by
progressive reduction in trade barriers together with the rise of manufactured exports from
low-wage economies.
   Note that despite the liberalization as a sudden shock with immediate elimination of the
tariff, the simulation mimics the data with a gradual movement of labor out of manufacturing.
This is because of the idiosyncratic shocks in the model, and is reflected in the structure
of the gross flows equation (2) which shows the fraction of workers who move in any given
direction in each period. Immediately after the liberalization, wages in manufacturing are
much lower than wages in other sectors, but only a portion of workers leave. Those who leave
are the ones whose current idiosyncratic moving costs (the difference in the nik
                                                                              t   values across
sectors) are particularly low. Workers with higher idiosyncratic moving costs bide their time,
and wait for a better moment to move to another sector. As a result, no matter how large
the wage differential is between sectors, only a fraction of workers leave the disadvantaged
sector in any one year.
   Figure 3 shows the allocation of labor in the data from the point of view of occupations.
Despite the large-scale sectoral reallocation shown in Figure 1, there has not been much
change along the occupational dimension. White-collar occupations still are by far the
largest category, with Service occupations by far the smallest. That pattern and its overall
stability are reproduced in the simulation, as shown in Figure 4, with the exception that the
simulation shows a partial exodus from the Laborer occupations.
   Figures 5 through 7 show the effect of the trade liberalization on real wages in the
simulation. Figure 5 shows the average wage for each skill group, as well as the skill premium


                                              25
(which here means the percentage gap between the average college-educated wage and the
average non-college-educated wage). The real wage jumps up slightly for both groups due
to the liberalization, with barely any change in the skill premium, which remains between
60% and 70%. (Of course, by construction, the skill premium within a sector-occupation
cell does not change, but wages across cells can change and the allocation of each type of
worker across cells can change, so in principle the aggregate skill premium could change.)
Figure 6 shows the average wage for workers in each occupation class. The liberalization
causes a modest increase in average real wages for both office occupations and for service
occupations. Other non-office occupations see a slight drop in wages. In each case, gradual
adjustment following the initial jump in wages moves in the opposite direction of the initial
jump.
   All of these subtle movements in wages stand in contrast to the dramatic effects of Fig-
ure 7, which plots average wages by sector. At the date of the liberalization, manufacturing
wages drop abruptly. This drop is well-understood with the help of Figure 8, which plots the
changes in prices. The price of manufactured output falls from 1.15 to 0.85 when the tariff is
eliminated. This causes a direct drop in the consumer price index (CPI) because manufac-
tures are consumed, but it also causes an indirect drop in the CPI because consumer demand
shifts toward manufactures and away from the two non-traded sectors, forcing reductions in
those two sectors’ prices as well. Consequently, CPI falls by about 11%. The net effect on the
price of manufactures relative to CPI is therefore a drop of about 1 − 0.85
                                                                               1

                                                                                        ' 0.17.
Since at date t = 0 no labor reallocation has yet had a chance to occur, the marginal
products of labor are unchanged and so the percentage change in real wages is exactly the
percentage change in each sector’s relative price. Manufacturing wages fall by 17%, while
                                                                  1

real wages in tradeable service rise due to the drop in CPI, by 1−0.11   − 1 ' 12.3%. Since
the prices of output in agriculture and construction and in non-traded services have been
forced down, the wage increases in those sectors are much smaller. Figure 8 makes it clear
that, unlike wage changes by educational class or by occupation, wage changes by sector due
to the liberalization are not subtle. Once again, however, the large initial jumps in wage are
attenuated by subsequent gradual adjustment. As workers leave the manufacturing sector,
for example, the marginal product of labor in the various occupations rises, gradually raising
manufacturing wages.


                                              26
   Figure 9 shows the effect of the liberalization on the manufacturing sector’s share of GDP,
both in the simulation and in the data. The loss of tariff protection results in a progressive
reallocation of labor out of manufacturing and a consequent reduction of manufacture’s GDP
share by approximately 4 percentage points over fifteen years, a shift that is closely parallel
to the actual trend observed in the data.
   We present some key statistics from the simulation in Table 9 and Table 11 for the case
β = 0.97 and in Table 10 and Table 12 for the case β = 0.9. Tables 9 and 10 show the impact
effect of the liberalization on wages and welfare for each group at date 0, while Tables 11 and
12 show the long-run effect, meaning the comparison of the new steady state with the old
one. The three boxes of Table 9 and 10 show, respectively, the date-0 percentage change in
wage, percentage change in welfare for non-college-educated workers, and percentage change
in welfare for college-educated workers for each sector-occupation cell, for the two values
of β. Tables 11 and 12 follow the same format but for steady-state changes. The welfare
changes in Tables 9 and 10 are the most relevant for our purposes because they measure the
change in expected discounted lifetime utility starting from the moment of the policy change
into the infinite future, and thus take full account of the transition to the new steady state.
   Note that, for both values of β, wages for all occupations in manufacturing drop at date
0 (by exactly the drop in the relative price of manufacturing output, 17%), while real wages
for all occupations not in manufacturing rise at date 0 (benefitting from the reduction in
the consumer price of manufactured output). However, over time workers of all occupations
leave manufacturing and wages there rise, so that in the long run manufacturing wages for
all occupations are slightly higher than their original values (first box of Tables 11 and 12).
At the same time, workers enter the other sectors, especially traded services, pushing down
the marginal products of labor there, and also pushing down the prices of non-traded sector
output. Therefore, wages in sectors other than manufacturing fall gradually after date 0,
coming to rest just slightly above their old steady-state value (for both values of β, the
smallest steady-state wage increase found in manufacturing (0.89% for white-collar workers
with β = 0.97 and 0.75% for service workers with β = 0.9 respectively), and the largest
is for service workers in the traded-services sector (2.85% and 3.00% respectively)). Across
the board, the smallest long-run real wage increase is for workers in manufacturing, not
surprising since that is the industry hit by the liberalization and the industry that suffers


                                              27
large initial wage losses at the date of the policy change.
       The question that has animated this paper is the welfare question: Who benefits from
the trade liberalization? For manufacturing workers, the liberalization sharply reduces their
wages in the short run, very modestly increasing them in the long run. In addition, it
raises the wages of workers in all other sectors in both the short and the long run. This is
important for each manufacturing worker, because in each period there is a chance that she
will choose to switch to those sectors. As a result, the current wage for a manufacturing-
sector worker is reduced, but her option value is improved – recall the Ωiks
                                                                         t   term in equation
(1). Whether the manufacturing worker benefits from the liberalization or not depends on
the balance between these two effects. The last two boxes of Table 10 show that if workers
are relatively impatient (β = 0.9), the short-run manufacturing wage effect dominates, and
welfare is lowered for manufacturing workers, in all occupations, by something between 0%
and 2%. The last two boxes of Table 9 show that with more patient workers (β = 0.97) the
two effects roughly cancel each other out; the net welfare effect on workers is positive more
often than negative, but less than 1% in magnitude for each occupation and educational
class. For workers in all other sectors, the welfare effect of the liberalization is positive
and of significant magnitude for all occupations, ranging from approximately one percent to
approximately four percent.
       In other words, with a low discount factor, workers in the manufacturing sector suffer
harm from the liberalization, regardless of occupation; while with a high discount factor,
workers in the manufacturing sector enjoy a modest benefit from the liberalization, regardless
of occupation. For either discount factor, workers in all other sectors enjoy a significant
welfare improvement from the liberalization, regardless of occupation. This speaks to the
question raised in the introduction: Is a worker’s occupation more or less important than
the worker’s industry for determining whether or not she gains from a trade liberalization?
Despite the high costs of switching occupations, these results suggest that for the most part
it is still what industry the worker is in and not what occupation she works in that is key.7
       It should also be underlined that these results underscore the importance of a dynamic
approach. A reduced-form regression that identified the short-run effect on wages, such as
   7
    This overall message survives if we relax the Cobb-Douglas assumption in (10). We have experimented
with CES production functions with an elasticity of substitution of 0.5 and 2.0 and found that this point
emerged essentially intact. Details are available on request.

is recorded in the first box of Tables 9 and 10, would be a very misleading indicator of
welfare, as indicated in the bottom two boxes. The effects on welfare are much smaller, and
– depending on the discount factor – can also be in the opposite direction than the short-run
wage effect.
