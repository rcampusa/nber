       THE AGGREGATE IMPLICATIONS OF MACHINE REPLACEMENT:
                       THEORY AND EVIDENCE


                             ABSTRACT


     This paper studies an economy in which producers must incur

resource costs to replace depreciated machines.   The process of

costly replacement and depreciation creates endogenous

fluctuations in productivity, employment and output of a single

producer.   We also explore the spillover effects of machine

replacement by multiple, independent producers.   The implications

of our model are generally consistent with observed monthly

output and productivity fluctuations in automobile plants and

with monthly variations in employment and production in the

manufacturing sector.
