        Dimensions and Determinants of Early Childhood
          Health and. Mortality Among American Slaves


                           ABSTRACT



     This paper relies on birth and death lists from plantation

records to investigate the causes of low birth weight and poor

health of young slave children. The sources of deprivation can be

traced to the fetal period. The slave work routine was arduous

overall and particu.larily intense during planting, hoeing, and

harvesting. These demands combined with seasonal fluctuations in

disease and in the quality of the diet implied that few newborns

had escaped stress on intrauterine growth. Starchy food. supplements

given soon after birth and. poor sanitation surrounding feeding

provided a poor environment for growth during the first year of life.

                                    I NTRODUCTI ON



      The antebellum campaign against slavery was filled with emotional rheto-

ric. Although the competing claims and counter—claims of abolitionists and

pro-slavery writers tell us little about the actual nature of slavery, the

debate defined issues that are important to modern research on slavery. Prnong

these issues are the material conditions of slave life, the work or physical

exertion   required of slaves, and the care given to children and to pregnant
women.

      Traditional   sources such as plantation records, medical journals, census

materials, diaries, and interviews of ex-slaves have been brought to bear on

questions raised by the antebellum debate (Phillips, 1918; Stampp, 1956; Fogel

and Engerman, 1974; Genovese, 1974; Sutch, 1975, 1976; Owens, 1976; Kiple and

Kiple, 1977; Savitt, 1978; Crawford, 1980; Campbell, 1984). More recently

height data have been added as grist for the analytical mill that involves the

health and nutrition of populations (Steckel, 1979a; Sandberg and Steckel,

1980; Eltis, 1982; Fogel, Engerman, and Trussell, 1982; Floud and Wachter,

1982; Sokoloff and Villaflor, 1982; Friedman 1982; Margo and Steckel, 1982;

Steckel, 1983; Margo and Steckel, 1983; Fogel etal., 1983; Higman, 1984).

      Previous work utilizing height data in connection with the health of

American slaves has stressed patterns among adolescents and adults (Steckel,

1979a; Margo and Steckel, 1982). Yet it is clear from the literature on human

growth   that average heights of children are an excellent index of health
(Tanner, 1962, 1978; 1981; Eveleth and Tanner, 1976). This paper examines
the nutrition and mortality of young slave children using height data from

coastwise manifests and mortality data from plantation records.1 The height

and   mortality data suggest that the health of slave children was comparable
                                        2



to that among the poorest populations in developing countries of the mid-

twentieth century. The paper traces the origins of poor health to conditions

during pregnancy and during the child's first year of life.


                             HEIGHTS OF SLAVE CHILDREN


     Table 1 gives the average height, standard deviation, sample size, and

velocity of height attained by slave children aged 1-6. Age customarily

refers   to age at last birthday, and if the exact ages were evenly distributed
over the age interval then the average age of the group that was age n at last
birthday   would have been   n+1/2. Height velocity—-the change in height between
successive ages-—is calculated from average age n+1/2 to average age n+1+1/2
and therefore is centered at exact age n+1.

     The slave manifests are an extraordinary body of height data for the

early nineteenth century: the observations are abundant, collection occurred

over more than 5 decades, measurements are available for both sexes, and

children are included. The last two features distinguish these data from most

other eighteenth and early nineteenth century sources, and consequently the

direct comparisons that can be made with populations contemporary with slaves

are limited. For this reason and for the reason that much is known about the

growth and development of modern populations, it is desirable to compare slave

growth patterns with those of modern populations.2

     Table 2 compares slave with modern height standards. By scanning down
the second column for each sex one can readily see that the absolute differ-

ence in heights declined with age. The difference exceeded 8 inches at age 1

and within 2 years declined to 5 to 6 inches. The fourth column under each

sex gives the number of   standard deviations that the difference was below the
modern   standard, and the fifth column converts this information into the
                                     3



centile of the modern standard under the assumption that heights are normally

distributed.

     If the data are taken at face value, then young slave children were ex-

traordinarily small. At age one the slaves were nearly Lilliputians compared

to their modern counterparts. Catch—up growth, defined as upward movement

through the centiles, was rapid from age 1 to 2 and then more gradual for the

next several years. Slaves did not reach the first centile of modern stan-

dards until age 5 (females only).

     Any       nf th                hr;i1d inr1i,-l   r r-ic'inn nf nAc'ih1
biases.3   The data at ages 1 and 2 should be viewed skeptically. Most chil-

dren aged 1 and some of those aged 2 could not walk or could not stand very

long. Although little information about actual technique is available, the

measurements were probably done while the children were lying down. The real

difficulty in these measurements is getting children to stretch out properly--

they just don't like it. Modern techniques and modern equipment take this

into account. Consequently, the heights (or lengths) of these children were

probably biased downward relative to modern standards. The exceptional value

of measured velocity between ages 1 and 2 is consistent with this hypothesis.

The average increase in height (or length) for males and females from age 1 to

2 was about 5.58 inches, which exceeds the 97th centile of modern velocity

standards (Tanner etal., 1966, 615-616). Although conditions may have

improved such that slaves experienced catch—up growth, the poor health and

nutrition at these ages (discussed below) suggest that a portion of the mea-

sured velocity is an illusion attributable to the fact that a larger share of

the children aged 2 were measured while standing.

     According to modern height standards presented in Table 2, the standard

deviation of heights for young children is in the range of 1.69 to 2.20
                                     4



inches. The standard deviations given in Table 1 are more than twice as high

as the modern standards. While a portion of this phenomena may be attributa-

ble to age and height heaping, evidence discussed below suggests that there

may have been considerable heterogeneity within the population of slaves.

     Slave children were small compared to children among poor populations in

developing countries. Table 3 corrares a selection of the lowest average

heights observed in developing countries to modern height standards. At age 3

slave children on average did not exceed the 0.2 centile, and the other groups

in Table 3 range from 0.3 to 12.1. Populations as poor as slum dwellers in

Lagos, Nigeria and urban residents in Bangladesh provided an environment for

growth superior to that faced by slave children.



                               POSSIBLE CAUSES


     Modern studies of child growth and development may provide clues to the

small stature of slave children. Human growth occurrs in two ways (Hurley,

1980; Tanner, 1978). One is an increase in the number of cells and the other

is an increase in the size of cells. Initially organisms grow through prolif-

eration of cells, then during a second phase cell proliferation slows down and

cell size increases rapidly. In the third phase there is almost no cell pro-

liferation and cell size increases rapidly.   If conditions are poor during the

phase of rapid cell proliferation the number of cells is restricted and cannot

be increased even by supplementary feeding at a later time. However, reversal

of small cell size may be possible by later feeding.

     Although various organs of the body have different time sequences for the

various phases of growth, cell multiplication as opposed to growth in cell

size is largely responsible for the high growth rate of the fetus compared to
                                       5



the child.    It is thought that few, if any nerve cells and only a small pro-

portion of new muscle cells, for example, appear more than 28 weeks after fer-

tilization has occurred (Tanner, 1978, 39). Thus conditions in the fetal

period are critical to later development.

      Modern studies establish that general material malnutrition, infections,

dietary deficiencies, physical exertion relative to diet, and ingestion of

toxic substances during pregnancy may retard fetal and child growth (Keys et

al., 1950; Hytten and Leitch, 1971; Tanner, 1978; Hurley, 1980). Evidence

from war-related famines and from developing countries establish the impor-

tance   of maternal nutrition. Studies of the Dutch famine in the winter of
1944-1945 show that the outcome of pregnancy is particularly sensitive to con-
ditions in   the first and last trirnesters. The incidence of abortions and mis—

carriages, stillbirths, and malformed children rose among pregnancies exposed

to   famine during the first trimester only, whereas undernutrition during the
last trimester alone reduced birth weight (Hurley, 1980, 77-81; Stein etal.,
1975, chaps. 10   and 12). Length of gestation   was lowest among those exposed

to   famine during the first trimester only. However compared to those not
exposed to famine the difference was only 4 days and the result cannot be
attributed   to nutrition (Stein etal., 1975, 105-106).   The correlation
between weight gain during pregnancy and birth weight of the child is higher

(in absolute terms) among women who were underweight before pregnancy (Lechtig

etal., 1975). Thus chronic malnutrition compounds the effects of a given

environmental insult that occurs during pregnancy.

        Infections diminish nutritional status by reducing appetite and by lower-

ing nutrient absorption and utilization (Martorell, 1980). Fetal infections,

which are common in developing countries, are important causes of intrauterine
                                     6



malnutrition. Maternal illnesses, such as respiratory and gastrointestinal

infections and malaria, retard intrauterine growth (Jelliffe, 1968).

     Specific dietary deficiencies may contribute to diminished growth and

development (Hurley, 1980, 247—251). There is a clear need for additional

protein and iron during pregnancy and there may be benefits from augmented

amounts of calcium and folate. The desirable amounts of these nutrients

increase with the physical activity of the mother.

     The mother's physical activity in relation to diet influences growth of

the fetus. Ethiopian mothers who engaged in hard physical labor and who had

lower that recommended caloric intakes during pregnancy had lower body

weights, lower gestational weight gains, and lighter newborns than less active

mothers on similar diets (Tafari, Naeye, and Gobezie, 1980). Ganbian mothers

lost weight during the rainy season, when food was relatively short and agri-

cultural work was at its pre-harvest peak (Hytten and Leitch, 1971, 452—454).

American women who worked during the third trimester of pregnancy had newborns

who were 150 to 400 grams (0.33 to 0.88 pounds) less than newborns of mothers

who remained at home (Naeye and Peters, 1982). The growth retardation in-

creased when the work required standing.4 Low birth weights attributable to

demanding work is a familiar problem in many developing countries, and many

antenatal programs now stress the benefits of less work for pregnant women

(Ashworth, 1982, 20).

     It is well—established that ingestion of toxic substances, such as alco-

hol and tobacco, during pregnancy will retard fetal growth (Hurley, 1980, 228—

233). The effects of alcohol are mast apparent in alcoholic mothers, whose

consumption of alcohol gives rise to a condition called fetal alcohol syn-

drome. In addition to growth retardation that occurs both prenatally and
                                        7



postnatally, these children also suffer birth defects. Consumption of small

amounts of alcohol, particularly during the last trimester, also has measur-

able effects. After adjusting for several other factors that influence birth

weight, one study found that for each ounce of absolute alcohol consumed per

day during late pregnancy, birth weight declined by 160 grams or 0.35 pounds

(Abel, 1982, 427—428). Modern studies have not established a systematic rela-

tionship between alcohol consumption and stillbirths (Abel, 1982, 425—426).

Smoking in pregnancy causes an average reduction of 180 grams or 0.40 pounds

in fetal weight and a 30 percent increase in perinatal mortality (Tanner,

1978, 46—47). The reduction in size from smoking persists throughout child-

hood.

        There is ample evidence, especially from developing countries, that mal-

nutrition and infection retard growth and development during childhood (Mata

etal., 1971; Frisancho, 1978; Martorell, 1980; Hurley, 1980; Scrimshaw,

1983). Although all infections adversely affect nutritional status and

growth, infections have a profound effect on malnourished children because

they reduce food intake and increase the loss of nutrients which are already

in short supply. Perhaps the most critical period for young children in this

regard is weaning (Knodel and Kinter 1977; Wray, 1978). Breast milk is advan-

tageous for young infants because it is nutritionally ideal, provides some

imrwnity, and is clean. By the time the child is 4 to 6 months of age, breast

milk alone is ordinarily inadequate for growth and children are frequently

given food supplements. Supplementation, which may begin before age 4 to 6

months postpartum among working women, may result in a less favorable diet and

less sanitary conditions. Thus the transition may be responsible for reduced

growth and higher rates of illness and death.
                                     S


     The data are lacking to appraise all plausible influences that retarded

the growth of slave children. Nevertheless enough information is available

from height data, plantation records, and other sources to evaluate some

hypotheses. The next section emphasizes seasonal patterns of diet, disease,

and work among slave mothers and food supplements to infants.

     Nutrition and illness (or death) are opposite sides of the same coin.

Well-nourished children tend to be healthy and grow while malnourished chil-

dren have retarded growth and experience higher rates of illness and death.

In view of the fact that the height data at ages 1 and 2 probably understate

nutritional status before age 3, information on mortality can be studied for

insights into determinants of health and nutrition at these ages. Table 4

shows that deaths up to age 3 were concentrated in the first year and espe-

cially the first 8 months of life.5 The high mortality rates that prevailed

soon after birth suggest that the small stature observed at age 3 and beyond

had origins in infancy and possibly the fetal period. The discussion of pos-

sible causes therefore begins with conditions during pregnancy.

     It should be observed that maternal size influences the size of children

(Hytten and Leitch, 1971, 305-310). However, compared to modern height stand-

ards slave women were substantially larger than slave children. Slave women

attained roughly the 28th centile of modern height standards and adult slave

women were on average about 1.3 inches below the standard. Most of the climb

through the centiles occurred while the slaves were teenagers. At age 12, for

example, female slaves reached, on average, only centile 1.2, yet by age 17

they reached 20.6. This climb toward modern heights was achieved while slaves

engaged in heavy physical labor. Other things being equal, this physical

activity would have retarded growth. The point is that other things were not
                                     9



equal, and specifically the nutritional content of the diet improved when

slaves entered the adult labor force. Thus general malnutrition among slave

women was a relevant but probably a minor disadvantage to intrauterine and

early infant growth. The conditions of stress during childhood combined with

a relatively good environment for growth during adolescence distinguish slaves

from modern populations. The deprivation in developing countries that pro-

duces small children tends to prevail throughout the growing years, and adults

are small as a consequence. Referring to Table 3, for example, the

Bushnegroes of Surinam attained roughly the 6th centile at age 3 and adult

women in this population attained centile 5.5. Similarly, in India children

attained approximately centile 2.0 and adult women reached centile 4.0.


                             SEASONAL VARIATION


     Seasonal variation in diet, disease, and work routine by slave mothers is

a plausible determinant of fetal and infant growth. Prosperity or deprivation

endured seasonably could have had lasting effects on growth and development,

particularly if it occurred during a critical period. Seasonal aspects of

growth related to diet and work have been documented for agricultural popula-

tions in developing countries (Hytten and Leitch, 1971, 452—454).

     Unfortunately, height measurements for slaves are unavailable by month of

birth,6 and thus seasonal influences on growth cannot be measured directly.

However mortality data from plantation records furnish a substitute source of

information. The following discussion examines neonatal and postneonatal

infant mortality on plantations that operated between 1786 and 1865. Neonatal

mortality is particularly sensitive to hirthweight; the mortality rates rise

rapidly as newborn weight declines below 2500 grams or 5.5 pounds (Hytten and

Leitch, 1971, 324).
                                         10


         Although there are 11 planatations for which seasonal data could be

studied (details about the units are given in Steckel, 1979b, 90), it is

desirable to investigate as a unit farms in which seasonal patterns were

approximately the same. The cotton plantations (5 in number) provide the lar-

gest number of observations on these grounds. The recording practices on some

of these plantations are suspect because the share of neonatal deaths among

infant deaths is implausibly low.7 Selecting only those plantations that had

plausibly high shares, say above 30 percent (3 plantations), is one approach

to the problem.      It is possible, however, that some shares were simply low,

and removing these plantations from the sample may bias the results, and for

this reason a second group consisting of all five plantations is also stu—

di ed.

         Seasonal phenomena are investigated in connection with a logit regression

model (Maddala, 1977, 162-171). The dependent variable is dichotomous and

takes on the value of 1 if there was a death within one month of birth and is

0 otherwise.8 The first equation includes and the second equation excludes

stillbirths     in the dependent variable. The plausible determinants of neo-
natal death that are available are mother's age, plantation size as measured
by the average number of slaves, year of birth, and month of birth.9
         The influence of mother's age may operate primarily through birth order.

Birth weight increases roughly 0.2 pounds from the first to the second child

and there is possibly a smaller rise to the third child (Hytten and Leitch,

1971, 301—304). The effects of higher birth orders is ambiguous: some

studies show a small trend toward larger size, but with weight falling (for a

particular parity) with age of the mother, and others show little or no

further     change. Increased   capacity of the circulatory system to nourish the
                                        11


fetus may explain the rise of birth weight with birth order. Mother's age

rather than parity is used in the regression because these variables are

highly correlated and because mother's age is known reliably for more observa-

ti ons.

        Plantation size may have influenced neonatal mortality through the work

routine, the disease environment, and supplementation practices. The labor

demands on slaves were probably greater on large units (Fogel and Engerman,

1974, 203—206). The fact that owners of small units ordinarily worked along

with the slaves may have contributed to an easier pace. Overseers and driver

achieved an intensive work routine through the gang system that characterized

large farms. Thus claims on the diet may have been greater on large planta-

tions, but interviews with ex—slaves suggests that diets were about the same

on small and large plantations (Crawford 1980, 123). The numbers on large

plantations may have increased the chances that someone nearby harbored a com-

municable disease. Slaves on large plantations may have had greater access to

hospitals and medical care, but many early nineteenth century medical prac-

tices no doubt increased the probability of death. If the disease environment

deteriorated with plantation size, then the health of pregnant women and the

nourishment of the fetus may have declined with this variable. If slave women

were relatively more productive in field work on large units (Fogel and

Engerman, 1974, 192—194), this would have encouraged supplementation of the

infants' diet at an earlier age. Thus the disease environment on large plan-

tations could have compounded the problems arising from early supplementa-

tion.

        The probable effect of time on neonatal mortality rates is unclear

because many, possibly opposing, changes that are not in the regression could
                                         12



have occurred. The disease environment, for example, could have become more

or less severe. Similarly, changes in breastfeeding practices, the intensity

of work, or diets may have occurred over time. One can speculate about possi-

ble influences that were correlated with time, but it would be difficult to

identify the specific sources of change given that little is known about the

details of operation on these particular plantations.

      Table 5 shows the regression results. The first equation includes still-

births in the dependent     variable and pertains to cotton plantations for   which

the recorded share of infant deaths that occurred within 28 days of birth was

at least 30 percent. As a way to adjust for probable underreporting, the

regression for all cotton plantations also includes the share of infant deaths

that occurred within 28 days as an independent variable. On these grounds the

coefficient has the expected sign, but the t-value is only 1.35 and other

coefficients change little if the variable is omitted from the equation. The

statistic —2 log A has a chi-square distribution with as many degrees of free-

dom as there are regressors (except the constant) ,    and the values reported at
the bottom of the table show that the regressions are significant at approxi-
mately 0.17 and 0.07, respectively.
      As expected, deaths in early infancy were greatest among young mothers.
If   other   independent variables are evaluated at their sample means, the proba-
bility of    early infant death in the first equation was about 14.6 percent for

women under age 20 and about 4.1 percent for women aged 20-24. Although the

individual    coefficients are not statistically significant, the pattern of
coefficients in      both equations at higher ages suggests that probabilities of

early   death approached those for births to young women as age increased.
        Plantation   size had no systematic influence on early death in either

equation.      In assessing this result it is important to remember that the
                                       13


plantations in the sample were large by standards of the American South. The

smallest unit in the sample, for example, had about 65 slaves. Within the

range of observation size may have had no effect, hut it is perhaps worth

noting that regressions on height from Civil War military records show that

the heights of blacks declined as the median size of holding in the county of

residence increased (Margo and Steckel, 1982).

       The data for the first equation are not well-suited to examine the

influence of time because there are no observations for the late 1820s or the

early 1830s. The data for the second equation are only slightly better in

this regard. While keeping this feature of the data in mind, statistical

tests were conducted on the time coefficients, and one cannot reject the null

hypothesis (at a significance level in excess of 0.25) that time had no

influence on early death. This finding holds if time period dummies replace

the   polynomial in time.
      As a group the month of birth coefficients are statistically significant
at 0.05 in each equation. Limited observations in the first equation required
that births be combined in May and June and in July and August. The pattern
of   the coefficients establishes a peak in late winter and early spring cen-

tered in March and a second, smaller concentration of early deaths for births

from September through November. Table 6 converts these coefficients into

probabilities by evaluating other independent variables at their sample means.

The pattern of probabilities is similar in both equations, but the seasonal

extremes are dampened in the second equation; this contrast is consistent with

consistent with a higher rate of underenumeration in the second compared to

the first data source. The seasonal differences are enormous in both equa-

tions. In the first equation the average probability in the highest 6 months
                                         14


which is a ratio of 5.1 to 1.       In the second equation the figures are 10.0

percent, 3.7 percent, and a ratio of 2.7 to 1.

        Underlying factors that may have been responsible for this seasonal pat-

tern include diet, disease, work, and supplementation practices. Our know-

ledge of seasonal variations in these determinants is an important limitation

and so pieces of the puzzle are missing, but the available knowledge combined

with mortality data and information from modern studies of fetal and early

childhood growth suggest a rough sketch of what may have been the actual pro-

cess.

        The discussion of seasonal influences begins with the harvest because it

was   the longest period of intense labor. The harvest for the cotton planta-
tions in the mortality sample ordinarily extended from late August through mid

December (Covert, 1912, 96). The harvesting of other crops such as corn may

have    coincided with the end of the cotton harvest and extended into the next
year.     It is clear, however, that harvesting cotton was the most valuable of
these activities. Table 7 shows women's output in this activity in the weeks
before and after    childbirth.'0   Output fell gradually   as childbirth
approached, then plumeted from a week before to 3 weeks after birth, and rose
rapidly within 4 weeks after birth. The rapid rise in output suggests that

interruptions for breastfeeding may have been sufficiently few (or nonexis-

tent) that they were a factor in neonatal mortality.

        Modern studies suggest that seasonal patterns of diet and work effort may

have influenced perinatal (stillbirth and early neonatal) mortality rates. If

conditions are satisfactory during the early stages of pregnancy, the mother

accumulates reserves of fat that protect the fetus against short periods of

deprivation (Hytten and Leitch, 1971, 383-387). The greatest need for these
                                          15


reserves in promoting weight gain occurs in the last trimester of pregnancy,

particularly weeks 28-36 (full term is 40 weeks), when the weight gain of the

fetus is ordinarily greatest (Tanner, 1978, 42). Recall from section two of

the paper that the outcome of pregnancy is particularly sensitive to condi-

tions in the first and the last trimesters.

      Children born during the harvest were conceived early in the year, and

the course of diet, work, and disease in ensuing months could easily have

affected their fortunes. Nominally the diet was probably best from mid-summer

through early winter: by July fresh vegetables were available and the slaugh-

ter   of livestock began as early as late autumn. A poor diet during the spring
may have inhibited the accumulation of fat reserves, and though the hoeing
season of mid May through June lasted only a few weeks, its physical demands

were considerable. Diseases among adults of childbearing age were greatest

during the summer (Steckel, 1979b, 108), and malnutrition related to illness

could   have contributed to the process by retarding the accumulation or deplet-
ing   fat reserves.   If   summer diseases were relatively unimportant, July and
August may have been favorable months, particularly for children born in
September or October, because the diet was reasonably good and work loads were

relatively light.     If the requirements of physical activity were sufficiently

great, the depletion of fat reserves could have begun in late August. If and

when they may have been depleted is not clear, but mortality data discussed

below shed light on this question.

      The   consequences of first trimester deprivation, last trimester depriva-
tion, and early supplementation differ.        If   deprivation   during the first tri-
mester was primarily responsible for pregnancy losses then stillbirths would

have been frequent.        If deprivation during the last trimester was primarily

responsible then stillbirths would have been relatively frequent, birth
                                     16


weights would have been low, and deaths would have been concentrated almost

immediately after birth. If supplementation soon after birth was primarily

responsible then stillbirths would have been relatively infrequent, birth

weights would have been relatively high, and survival rates would have been

relatively high immediately after birth but low for the remainder of the first

month. Table 8 shows that the timing of deaths occurring within the first six

months varied considerably by month of birth. Row 3 of the table shows that

losses for births early in the harvest-—from August through October—-were con-

centrated after the first day and particularly after the first week. In con-

trast, losses late in the harvest--November-December--were concentrated among

stillbirths and deaths within the first day and were relatively low in the

remainder of the first month. Based on a chi-square test of homogeneity the

August-October and the November-December distributions are significantly dif-

ferent at 0.15.11 The picking records show that it took nearly one month

after birth to reach high productivity, and the low number of deaths from the

second day through the second month suggests that women who gave birth late in

the harvest may have delayed supplementation. The contrast between rows 3 and

4 of the table suggests that early supplementation was primarily responsible

for neonatal deaths early in the harvest, but low birth weights were primarily

responsible late in the harvest. Depletion of fat reserves during the harvest

may have reduced the weight of births that occurred late in the harvest, and

deprivation during the planting and hoeing seasons may have caused the large

share of stillbirths that occurred late in the harvest. The effects of first

trimester deprivation on the outcome of pregnancy is persuasive in view of

efforts by owners and overseers to prevent shirking. Pregnant women may not

have received lighter work loads until there was visible change in outward

appearance, probably during the fifth month (Campbell, 1984, 802).
                                        17


       The probability of death within one month of birth was also high from

February through April. These children were conceived from late spring

through early summer and thus the mothers diet was nominally good throughout

most   of the fetal period. The major strain on these pregnancies arising from
physical exertion must have occurred during the harvest. Yet the diet was
probably best from late fall through early winter when consumption of fresh
meat was greatest.

       Work loads diminished in December and they were probably lower in January

than at any other time of the year. The plowing season began in February, but

plowing was heavy work usually reserved for men. The planting season of March

and early April was the next major period of labor for women. The planting

season was relatively brief, however, and it occurred too late to have had

much   influence on birth weights in April.
       The distributions in rows 1 and 2 of Table 12 are significantly different

at 0.05. The above-average loss rate from stillbirths in February-April is

probably related to strains of the harvest during the first trimester, but

the    high mortality rate within one day of birth in this period suggests that
low birth weight or other complications of pregnancy also characterized these
children.     If food intake and work in the last trimester were not responsible,

then alcohol may have been. Although slaveowners generally discouraged liquor

consumption by slaves, exceptions were often made at Christmas, New Year1s,

and at other gatherings to celebrate the harvest (Olmstead, 1861, 76-77;

Stampp, 1956, 169-170, 370-371; Genevose, 1974, 556-584). Slaves may have had

the means to purchase liquor from cash bonuses earned during the harvest or

from the sale of hogs, chickens, eggs, and garden produce. Liquor cost about

25 cents per gallon (Cole, 1938) and slaves could purchase it from poor

whites, peddlers, and shopkeepers. Thus liquor consumption may have remained
                                        18


high, at least for some slaves, from the end of the harvest in mid December

through the winter.

       Although the actual amount of alcohol consumed and its effects on slaves

are unknown, the available information suggests that alcohol consumption

during the last trimester may have been an important factor in the high rate

of perinatal deaths in February—April.       It is clear, however, that other

factors such as stillbirths resulting from first—trimester exertion relative

to diet during the harvest may have been involved. If alcohol consumption

declined substantially by February, then physical exertion of the planting

season combined with a nutritionally diminishing diet may have contributed.

The    relatively high share of deaths from days 7-29 also suggests that early
supplementation, perhaps associated with labor demands for planting,      may have

been   relevant.

                                   OTHER FACTORS



       The previous section examined seasonal aspects of diet, disease, and work

that operated during critical periods of pregnancy and through food supple-

ments to young infants. This section emphasizes smoking and alcohol consump-

tion   during   pregnancy, determinants of post—neonatal infant mortality, and the

child's   diet during and after weaning. Although the effects of toxic sub-
stances such as alcohol and tobacco on pregnancy and its outcome are well-
known today, slaveowners and slaves had no systematic information on their

consequences for health. Slaveowners probably thought that the major cost of

alcohol was disruption of the work force, a cost that was particularly high

during seasonal peaks in the demand for labor. Smoking and chewing tobacco

did not have these costs. Tobacco was widely grown throughout the South (U.S.

Census Office, 1864, 184—185) and thus slaves may have been able to raise
                                        19


their own. Slaves may have spent a considerable portion of their money or

exchangeable goods for tobacco (Genevose, 1974, 644). While the information

necessary to measure the effects of alcohol and tobacco consumption during

pregnancy is unavailable, these products were probably not the primary cause

of small stature among slave children because they permanently stunt growth.

The fact that slave adults exceeded the 25th centile of modern height stand-

ards implies that other factors were important.

      While birthweight is a major determinant of early mortality, if a child

survives the first month of life the chances of survival for the remainder of

the   first year depend heavily on diet and disease. The approach taken to the
analysis of postneonatal infant mortality is similar to that employed for
neonatal mortality. The plausible explanatory variables that are available

for the logit regression model are sex, plantation size (number of slaves),

main crop, year of birth, and month of birth. To the extent that diet and

disease    as opposed to birth weight contributed to neonatal mortality, the
motivation of these variables is similar to that   discussed in the section on

neonatal   mortality. Differences in the motivation are highlighted in the
discussion   below of the results in Table 9.

      The net effect that gender might have had on postneonatal mortality is

not clear. Some societies emphasize male children and devote relatively more

resources to their survival, but whether this was encouraged or permitted and

whether it was effective if practiced among slaves is unknown. As early as

mid—way through the fetal period girls are more developed than boys and at

birth the difference corresponds to 4 to 6 weeks of maturation (Tanner, 1978,

58). The advantage of earlier maturation may have reduced mortality rates

among females after the first month of life. Since the relative advantage of
                                       20



females tends to diminish as the mortality level rises (United Nations, 1973,

115—118), it is perhaps not surprising that the coefficient of the gender vari-

able is small and positive but statistically significant.

       Many studies have noted that pen natal mortality rates rise with advancing

age of the mother, particularly after age 30 (United Nations, 1973, 127). One

might suppose that some of the disadvantages which mother's age conveyed to

losses before the first month would carry over to later periods of infancy, and

on these grounds the sharp decline in postneonatal mortality rates with

mother's age may seem surprising.    If other independent variables are evaluated

at their sample means, the probability of postneonatal death was 24.0 percent

for mothers under age 20 but only 10.1 percent for mothers aged 30 or more. If

the first month was so harsh that it   eliminated   marginal children who would

ordinarily   have perished in the postneonatal period, then postneonatal mortal-
ity   rates should have been high for mothers' ages at which neonatal mortality

rates were low. Yet rates were highest in both periods for young mothers. The

value of womens' time by age could have been a contributing factor. Annual net

earnings of slave women peaked in the late 20s (Fogel and Engerman, 1974, 76),

and older women may have devoted relatively more time to breastfeeding or other

aspects of child care. However, the fact that annual net earnings were uni-

formly higher in the 30s than they were before age 20 suggests that other fac-

tors   were involved. Postneonatal mortality may have declined with age simply
because experience was important in improving child care.
       Postneonatal mortality rates systematically increased with plantation size
as measured by the number of slaves. For example, the expected probability of

death was about 8.4 percent at size 75 hut 13.8 percent at size 200. Although

no systematic association was found between size and neonatal mortality, the
                                       21


neonatal   mortality, the motivation developed in that section is plausible
here. More speci fi cal ly, mortality rates may have risen because the disease
environment deteriorated or possibly because more extensive specialization and
division   of labor made field labor relatively more productive and child care

relatively more expensive.

     The   finding that postneonatal mortality rates were lower on sugar
plantations   suggests that the poor reputations of the crop and the areas in

which it was grown may be undeserved. The expected mortality rate was 14.9

percent on cotton plantations but only 6.6 percent if sugar was the main crop.

The mortality rates in rice and mixed farming were not systematically

different from that on cotton farms. Furthermore, if the entire sample and

the regression model of Table 9 are applied to neonatal mortality, the

coefficients of the crop variables as a group   are statistically significant at
greater than 0.25.    Before considerable energy is devoted to reconciling these

results with preconceptions, it should be recognized that there is only one

sugar plantation in the sample. This qualification aside,   the fact that sugar
plantations   tended to be very large may explain the high mortality rates often

associated with the crop and the region.    It is also possible that the work

routine, which often required heavy labor for ditching and plowing (Gray,

1933, 749-751), may have freed womens' time for postneonatal care.

Breastfeeding may have been abbreviated during the harvest, but labor demands

for women could have been relatively even and low during the rest of the year

such that breastfeeding was encouraged.

     Although the dates of seasonal work patterns differed by main crop, the

common pattern was that crops were planted in the spring and harvested in the

fall. The common seasonal fluctuations might have generated systematic

seasonal patterns of postneonatal   mortality that operated through the age at
                                       22


which infants received food supplements and possibly through seasonal patterns

in the quality of the diet or the severity of the disease environment.     No

systematic pattern appears in the month of birth coefficients. These coeffi-

cients   are jointly significant at greater than 0.25, and this result holds -if
the test is performed on data for cotton plantations only. One possible
interpretation of these findings is that supplementation   occurred uniformly

early——so   early that differences across periods of time as large as a month
are not readily discernible. Another is that other important factors, such as
the conditions of the mother and the child and the value of the mother's time
in    other activities dominated seasonal influences which may have been present.

A third interpretation is that seasonal patterns of supplementation, diet, and

disease existed but their consequences for mortality were so diffused over

weeks or months that they obscured the underlying seasonal phenomena.

       Food supplements to infants may have begun within a few weeks after birth

among children born during periods of intense labor requirements. Previous

discussion has emphasized the consequences of poor sanitation surrounding food

supplements. These problems aside, the longer term prospects for growth

depended upon the nutritional content of the diet during and after weaning.

The   diet was insufficient to promote catch-up growth probably because it lack-
ed protein and certain vitamins and minerals such as calcium and iron. Plan-
ters were apparently convinced that the child's intake should emphasize corn-
bread, hominy, and fat (Kiple and King 1981, 97). Medical writers of the era
did little or nothing to challenge this view. At the close of the eighteenth

century it was common to breastfeed young infants but pap was soon added to

the child's diet (Wickes, 1953, 336-338). By the mid-nineteenth century some

writers argued for the addition of diluted cows milk, but it is clear that the

recommended weaning diet emphasized starchy foods such as panada and gruel.

                                CONCLUDING REMARKS


        It is well established that stature or height is an excellent index of

health. Estimates of height imply that the average slave child was in poor

health. Slave children on average fell below the first centile of modern

height standards until age S and were approximately the same size as children

from    the poorest populations in developing countries. Sources of deprivation
can be traced to conditions during pregnancy and during the first year of
life. Mortality data discussed in the paper are consistent with the argument
that fluctuations in diet relative to the work routine and seasonal patterns
of disease and consumption of alcohol created stress during initial periods of
fetal   development. Seasonal peaks in the demand for labor may have esta-

blished patterns of food supplementation to infants that also contributed to

seasonal aspects of health. Post-neonatal death rates, and by implication

diseases that retarded growth, systematically increased with plantation size.

Tobacco was widely used throughout the South, and many slave women could have

smoked    during pregnancy.
        The collection of plausible determinants of health among slave children
is consistent with diversity in this population. Fortune or misfortune began
with the month of conception; those lucky enough to pass through critical
periods of intrauterine development    with little or no stress had a relatively

good    start in life. On average misfortune befelled those children whose
mothers were young, smoked, consumed alcohol, ar-i who resided on large planta-
tions.     Children who missed most of the pitfalls during the growing years on

average reached or approached modern heights.

        Additional insights into the diversity of the slave population may be

available through regional and temporal studies. Plantation records having
                                     24


mortality information are limited in this respect, but sufficient height data

are available for study by the major areas of supply to the coastal trade in

slaves. The absence of famines in the United States suggests that nutritional

conditions may have been approximately constant over time, but net nutrition

available for physical growth after claims made by disease and physical exer-

tion, could have fluctuated as a result of epidemics or changes in slave work

routines. Since the heights of children are sensitive to immediate condi-

tions, the slave manifests are potentially an important source for understand-

ing the temporal dimensions of health in the antebellum South.

                                  FOOTNOTES


1. The slave manifest data originated with efforts by Congress to prevent

    slave smuggling after the close of the Atlantic slave trade in 1807.

    Heights were used to identify slaves involved in the coastwise trade,

    which was legal after 1807. Steckel (1979a) describes aspects of these

    data. The data base for this paper consists of the data used in the 1979

    paper plus all manifests housed in the National Archives under the port of
    C,  , nn
    ,Ju VU     I,
           I lull.


    Owners maintained lists of slave births and deaths as a means of monitor-

    ing demographic performance. The plantation records employed in this

    paper are described in Steckel (1979b) and consist of 11 units that grew

   cotton, rice, or sugar in South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, and Louisiana

   between 1786 and 1865. See Steckel (1982, 1985c) for additional details

   about slave demographic records.



2. Comparisons across populations should be made cautiously because of the

   possible role of genetic differences. In this regard it is important to

   distinguish genetic influences on individuals from genetic influences on

   entire populations.   It is clear that genes are important determinants of

   the heights of individuals, but studies involving genetically similar and

   dissimilar populations under various environmental conditions suggest that

   differences in average height across most populations are largely attri-

   butable to environmental factors (Habicht etal., 1974: Malcolm, 1974).

   Comparisons of Far—Eastern adults with other populations are an exception

   that may have a substantial genetic basis; well—off Japanese, for example,

   reach, on average, the fifteenth centile of well-off Britains (Tanner et
                                          26

     al., 1982). With regard to possible genetic factors in comparisons

     involving U.S.   slaves,   Europeans, and U.S. whites, it   is   useful to note

     that well—nourished populations of Europeans, Americans of European des-

     cent, and Americans of African descent have approximately the same average

     heights today (Eveleth and Tanner, 1976, appendix).



3.    The reliability of the data can be investigated on two grounds: possible

      biases    in the manifests vis—a—vis the entire population of American
      slaves, and the accuracy of recording phenomena purported to have been
      measured. Steckel (1979a, 1985a) discusses these issues. While           recog-

      nizing that biases and errors may contaminate the data, the distortions

      were   probably sufficiently small that it is reasonable to accept the
      estimates at face value at ages 3 and above.


4. The effects of the mother's work on fetal growth may be the consequence
      of maladaptation by humans to an upright posture. See Briend (1979;
      1980) and Hytten (1981).


5. Plantation owners may have failed to record some deaths, especially those
      occurring soon after birth. Steckel (1979b) discusses this issue, and
      Steckel (1985b) estimates that neonatal mortality (deaths up to 28 days
      after birth) probably exceeded 15 percent.


6. Occasionally the manifests listed age in months for children under 1 year
      of age.


7. Based on births and deaths for which the month, day, and year of birth
      and death are known.
                                         27


 8. What is measured is called neonatal mortality although neonatal mortality

      actually    includes only deaths from 0 to 28 days. The dependent variable
      overestimates neonatal mortality because it     includes   deaths that occurred
      up to 1 calendar month after the calendar month of birth.



 9. One could argue that sex of the child should be included in the regres-

      sion on the grounds that neonatal mortality rates tend to be higher among

      male children. However, the sex was not reported for an imortant share

      of deaths that occurred soon after birth. If sex is included in a

      regression involving observations in which the sex is known, the coeffi-

      cient has a t—value of .26 in the first equation and .40 in the second

      equation.     If sex is included, the seasonal pattern of coefficients

      changes such that probabilities of death are relatively lower during

      September    and October.


10.   The data are based on weekly picking records of fifteen female slaves on

      the Leak plantation who gave birth a total of 28 times between 1841 and

      1860.     In a study of the Kollock plantations, Campbell (1984, 807) finds

      that    women returned to the fields, on average, 25.2 days after birth
      (N=60).


11. Ordinarily a significance level     of 0.15   would not be cited as evidence   of

      a   difference in behavior. However, given the potential for underenumera-
      tion    of early deaths (discussed and measured in Steckel (1985b)), the

      actual seasonal extremes must have been considerably greater than those

      evident in these data.

a.   The mean and standard deviation of height for modern standards was deter-

     mined at age n+1/2. For example, the height of 32.32 used for males at

     age 1 is the modern standard at exact age 1.5. This practice is consis-

     tent with the aggregation of exact ages 1.0 to 1.99 for the group that was

     age 1 at last birthday.     It is important to note that the standard devia-

     tion reported for modern standards at, say exact age 1.5,,        is   an uinstan_

     taneous" measure that must be augmented to compensate for the greater var-

     iance of heights that resuts from age aggregation within the age interval

     1.0 to 1;99 (see Healy, 1962). This adjustment is particularly important

     for ages in which growth is rapid.

b.   Average heights at these ages are probably biased downward and the results
     should be viewed skeptically. See the text for additional discussion.

Note: As used here month refers to calendar months after birth. For example,

July is the first month after birth for a child born in June. This approach

is taken because owners sometimes failed to record day of birth or day of death.
