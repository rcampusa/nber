                                         ABSTRACT

This paper finds that US employment changed differently relative to output in the Great
Recession and recovery than in most other advanced countries or in the US in earlier recessions.
Instead of hoarding labor, US firms reduced employment proportionately more than output in the
Great Recession, with establishments that survived the downturn contracting jobs massively.
Diverging from the aggregate pattern, US manufacturers reduced employment less than output
while the elasticity of employment to gross output varied widely among establishments. In the
recovery, growth of employment was dominated by job creation in new establishments. The
variegated responses of employment to output challenges extant models of how enterprises adjust
employment over the business cycle.

           How did the US labor market, widely viewed as the most market-driven and flexible

among advanced countries, weather the Great Recession and ensuing recovery? The preceding

decades' ballyhoo about the great American jobs machine notwithstanding, employment fell

sharply in the Great Recession and increased slowly in the recovery so that in 2015, six years

into the recovery, the employment-population rate was 3.6 points lower than in 2007. 1

           This paper combines establishment data sets from Census Research Data Centers – the

Longitudinal Business Database (LBD) 2, Annual Survey of Manufacturers (ASM) and the

Census of Manufacturers (CoM) -- with decennial Census long form data on the

characteristics of employees in establishments 3, and National Science Foundation data on the

research spending of firms to analyze the establishment level underpinnings of employment

changes in the Great Recession and recovery.

           The paper finds that: 1) In the Great Recession US firms reduced labor usage

proportionately more than GDP, producing counter-cyclic changes in productivity, in contrast

to labor hoarding in past US recessions and labor hoarding in other advanced countries in the

Great Recession; 2) Recession job loss was driven by contraction of jobs in establishments

that survived the downturn whereas recovery job gains came largely through entering

establishments adding more employees; 3) US manufacturing diverged from the bulk of the

economy by hoarding labor in the Great Recession; 4) Manufacturing establishments with

observably similar characteristics had widely varying responses of employment to output 4 in

the downturn and recovery. The findings show a substantial gap between models of

employment in a flexible labor market and actual employment determination.



1. Employment changes differed this time

       Figure 1 compares GDP and employment in the Great Recession/recovery and in the

three preceding cycles relative to their pre-recession values.

       Panel A displays the ratio of GDP to pre-recession peak GDP by the number of

quarters in each of the recessions. The decline in GDP relative to pre-recession GDP shows

that the Great Recession was deeper and longer than the previous three recessions. Befitting

its name, the Great Recession's loss of output was the largest since the Great Depression.

       Panel B displays the ratio of the number of jobs before the recession to the number

afterward by number of quarters in each recession, where we calculated the quarterly averages

from monthly payroll employment data. Given the big decline in output in the Great

Recession, it is no surprise that quarterly employment fell more than in the earlier recessions:

a near 6.0 percent loss of jobs from pre-recession quarterly employment to the quarter when

employment bottomed out compared to an average loss of below 3 percent in the other

recessions depicted in the figure. The finer grained monthly data shows a drop in

employment of 5.3% from December 2007, when NBER dated the beginning of the recession

to June 2009, when it dated the end of the recession. But employment fell for the first eight

months of the recovery, bottoming out in February 2010 at 6.3% below its pre-recession peak.

The number of months in which employment was below its previous peak exceeded that in

the other recessions.

       Comparing the two panels, the link between changes in employment and changes in

output as employment weakened, indicating that employment had moved from being a
4

coincident indicator of the cycle to a laggard indicator. In the 1981 recession, employment

recovery tracked GDP recovery closely. In the 2001 recession, the GDP decline was short but

employment kept shrinking after GDP recovered. In the Great Recession, employment fell

proportionately more than output and did not begin to recover until three quarters after output

increased. The 4.2% drop in real GDP from peak to trough and the 5.3% fall in employment

over the same period produces an implicit employment to GDP elasticity of 1.26 (= 5.3/4.2).

In the recovery, by contrast, GDP's 7.8% increase through Q1 of 2015 exceeded employment's

4.8% increase, with an implicit employment to GDP elasticity of 0.62 (= 4.8/7.8). The rapid

drop in labor usage and the slow recovery produced counter-cyclic labor productivity,

contrary to the pro-cyclic labor productivity in earlier recessions (Okun, 1970; Solow, 1964,

Biddle, 2014) 5 that led economists to develop labor hoarding models of firm employment

decisions.



Labor Productivity and Hoarding

        Studies of employment adjustments in the business cycle began with the prior that

productivity should vary counter-cyclically (Biddle (2014)). The reason is clear. Recession

reductions in employment should raise labor productivity due to the increase in the marginal

productivity of variable labor relative to fixed capital. In a recession workers who remain

employed have more capital with which to work and thus should have higher productivity.

Recovery increases in employment, by contrast, ought to reduce labor productivity as

additional employees lower the capital/employee ratio. In addition, selectivity in hiring or

firing (which macro models generally ignore) also suggests a counter-cyclical movement of

labor productivity as firms lay off the least productive workers in a recession and hire them


5 For the impact of pro-cyclic labor productivity in Solow's thinking, see Assous, 2013 and Biddle 2014.
5

back in recovery. To explain the surprising pro-cyclic movement of labor productivity in the

business cycles in the 1960s-1990s, analysts developed “labor hoarding” models in which the

costs of adjusting employment made workers a quasi-fixed rather than variable factor of

production. 6

         In the Great Recession, however, US productivity did not to show the drop predicted

by labor hoarding. This contrasted with almost all other advanced countries, where

productivity fell in the recession. Table 1 documents the Great Recession pattern of changes

in GDP per hour with data on GDP per hour worked for major countries from the Conference

Board's International Labor Comparisons (ILC) program. Columns 1 to 3 give the estimated

GDP per hour worked in 2007, 2009, and 2012. Column 4 records the annualized rate of

change of productivity in the recession (2007-2009) while column 5 gives the annualized rate

in the recovery (2009-2012). The last column records the difference between annualized

productivity growth in the recovery and recession. Positive differences imply pro-cyclic

productivity. Negative differences imply the opposite.

        All of the countries save the US and Japan, which was mired in its lost decade of

economic stagnation, had positive recovery–recession differences, implying pro-cyclic

movements of productivity. The decline in productivity in most countries came, however, not

only from the “normal” costs of adjustments at the heart of hoarding models but also from

explicit collective bargaining or government policies to save jobs in the Great Recession. In

Sweden unions and employers negotiated agreements that maintained many jobs during the

recession. In Germany the government introduced a short-term work program and work

allowance that subsidized part of labor cost in firms whose receipts decreased by 10 percent.

The Netherlands paid 70 percent of the wages for the non–work hours of employees that firms


6 Biddle (2014) stresses the important contributions of Holt, Modigliani, Muth, and Simon (1960).
6

kept “on the job.” And so on (Freeman 2013). Absent agreements and policies, European

firms would likely have terminated more workers in the recession and hired more in the

recovery, attenuating if not reversing the pro-cyclic movement of labor productivity.

        Employment adjustments relative to output in US manufacturing, however, looked

more like adjustments in non-US OECD countries than those in the aggregate US. Bureau of

Labor Statistics data show manufacturing employment declining proportionately less than

output in the downturn – a sign of labor hoarding absent substantial bargaining or government

policies pressuring or rewarding firms to maintain employment. As a result from Q1 2008 to

Q4 2009 real value added per hour in manufacturing fell by 24% while in the recovery real

value added per hour increased by 27% through Q4 2012. 7 However, Conference Board data

tells a different story for real gross output per hour worked, where gross output includes

intermediate goods/materials as well as value added. The gross output per hour data show

increased manufacturing productivity in the Great Recession. 8 The difference between the

ILC and BLS measures reflects a divergent movement of the price deflator for real gross

output and the price deflator for real value added 9 whose resolution lies beyond this study.

for a 16 point swing. The price index for Gross Output increased by 1% from 2007 to 2009 and by 16% while
the price index for Value Added increased by 4% in the recession and 8% in the recovery. Baily and Bosworth
(2014, table 2) show different growth of gross output and value added in the computer and electronic products
industry manufacturing due in part to differences in value added and gross output price deflators. Houseman, et
al (2011) analyze the problems that price indexes create in measuring economic activity in manufacturing.

        To better identify the role of the Great Recession and recovery on changes in

employment from the long term effects of technological change and capital-labor substitution

on employment requires a micro level analysis of employment, to which we turn next.



2. Changes in continuing, exiting and entering establishments

        To probe the micro-underpinnings of the US's Great Recession employment

experience, we decomposed changes in employment into the changes that occur in continuing

establishments – those that operated before the downturn and kept operating through the

recession – and changes that result from the exit and entry of establishments. Let E(t) be

employment in year t; Ec(t) be employment in t in establishments operating in t and t-1; Eb(t)

be employment in establishments that entered the market in year t (operated in t but not in t-

1); and Ed(t-1) be employment in establishments that exited the market in year t (operated in

t-1 but not in t). Then the change in employment from t-1 to t is:

        (1) E(t) – E(t-1) = [Ec(t) – Ec(t-1)] + [Eb(t) – Ed(t-1)],

where [Ec(t) – Ec(t-1)] is the change among continuers and [Eb(t) – Ed(t-1)] is the change due

to job creation in entering establishments minus job destruction in exiting establishments.

        Dividing both sides of the equation by E(t) – E(t-1) gives the relative contribution of

changes in continuers and of exit-and-entry to each part to the total change from (t -1 to t).

        Table 2 presents this decomposition for one digit sector private sector industries and

the entire private sector in the recession and ensuing recovery. 10 Taking the NBER dating of



10         Aggregate data on employment, job creation and job destruction are from the Census Bureau’s
Business Dynamics Statistics (BDS) website. We use the “Economy Wide” table for total counts and the Sector-
table for counts by 1-digit SIC sectors. The BDS reports yearly employment based on March data, along with the
total number of jobs created and destroyed each year based on the last 12-months. Job destruction/creation are
jobs lost via establishment deaths/gained via establishment births. The “Establishment Age by Sector” table
splits the data by establishment age. The BDS does not define birth in a unique way: an establishment is born
when it begins with age 0, but if employment goes to zero and later back to a positive number the establishment
8

the end of the recession as occurring in June 2009, we treat 2009 as the year when the

recession ended and the recovery began in the BDS annual data. The recession period “All”

line shows a net loss of jobs of 5.007 million and a larger loss of 5.748 million among

establishments that continued operating. The 0.741 million jobs difference implies that in the

Great Recession, entering establishments hired more employees than exiting establishments

terminated. The one digit industry data locate one third of the recession job loss in

manufacturing and almost 1/4th in construction for 58% of all job losses. In two other sectors

with large declines in employment, retail trade and services, the decline occurred despite large

net employment gains from exit and entry as continuing establishments contracted jobs

massively.

         The recovery “All” line shows a different pattern. Changes in employment are

dominated by exit and entry rather than by continuing establishments. Of the 2.187 million

net gain of jobs, 1.385 million (63%) was due new entrants creating more jobs than exiting

establishments destroyed. Manufacturing and construction shed jobs through the recovery,

with exit and entry accounting for 36% of the recovery job loss in manufacturing and 59% of

the recovery job loss in construction. The importance of exit-entry in the recovery does not

contravene the finding that the continuing establishments who make up the majority of

establishments dominate changes in employment at all phases of the cycle. Appendix A

shows that changes among continuers are the major component of job creation and destruction

in the recovery and recession in the LBD data. What is distinct about our exit-and-entry

analysis is that it organizes data around net changes in jobs, which depend on differences in

job gain and loss among continuers relative to differences in job creation in entering



is “born again” even if its age is greater than zero. BDS suppresses job counts in cells that fall under a certain
firm count.
9

establishments and job destruction in exiting establishments rather than on the contributions

of changes among these types of establishments to total job creation or destruction.

        To illuminate further the dominance of continuers in recession job changes compared

to exit and entry in recovery job changes, we decomposed employment changes into the

changed number of establishments in the continuers, entrants, and exiting groups, and the

average number of jobs gained/lost per establishment for each group. The “All” figures for

the recession in Table 3 show that continuing establishments dominated recession job loss

because continuing establishments made up about 80% of all establishments. 11 In the

recession more establishments exited than entered but entering establishments created 1.2

more jobs than exiting establishments eliminated so that exit and entry produced a modest net

gain in employment. In manufacturing, by contrast, nearly 40% more establishments exited

than entered the market with little difference in the average size of entering and exiting

establishments, so that exit and entry contributed to the job loss. Still continuers dominated

job loss in manufacturing because of their large 6.4 decline in average employment.

        The “All” changes in the recovery section of Table 3 tell a different story. The

dominance of entry-exit in the recovery is due primarily to the difference between the average

gain in employment in entering establishments and the average loss in employment among

exiting establishments. 12 Again, however, manufacturing is different. Even in the recovery



11       Using the 2007 to 2009 recession data, continuers made up 79% of establishments in 2007 (= 5.121
million continuers / (5.121 + 1.398 establishments in 2007 but gone by 2009)) and 80% of establishments in
2009 (= 5.121 / (5.121 + 1.291 establishments in 2009 but not in 2007)). Using the 2009 to 2012 recovery data
continuers made up 73% of establishments in 2009 (= 5.149 / (5.149 + 1.916)) and 73% in 2012 (= 5.149 /
(5.149 + 1.922)).


12        Let Ne = number of entering establishments, Ae = average employment in those establishments; Nd =
number of exiting establishments and Ad = average employment in those establishments. Then job change from
exit and entry is NeAe -Nd Ad, which decomposes algebraically into (Ne-Nd) Ad + (Ae-Ad) Nd + (Ne-Nd) (Ae-
Ad), where the first term is the different number of entering and exiting establishments, weighted by average
employment in exiting establishments; the second term is the difference in average employment in entering and
exiting establishments, weighted by the number of exiting establishments and the last term is the interaction of
10

more establishments exited than entered in manufacturing (and construction) while the

average employment in exiting establishments exceeded the average employment of entrants.

        To the extent that establishments that enter the market better fit existing economic

conditions than establishments that exit, differences in their characteristics provide insight

into the selectivity of technological and market forces. Figure 2 displays the mean 2007

physical and human capital characteristics of manufacturing establishments that entered or

exited in the recession or recovery. 13 A characteristic more (less) frequent among entering

than exiting establishments suggests that the characteristic's economic value has increased

(decreased) over time. The figure shows that entering establishments had larger capital-to-

employee ratios, college shares of the work force, and made greater investment in computer

per employee than exiting establishments but had similar ratios of non-production employees.

These differences are consistent with technological upgrading and capital-human capital

complementarity in the technology that affects employment.



3. Heterogeneity in Responses to Output Shocks

        Behind average changes in employment lie distributions in which some establishments

change employment more and others less than the average either because the market

conditions they face differ from the average and/or their technologies differ, or because they

respond differently than other establishments to the same conditions. Regardless of the cause,

heterogeneity of responses among establishments is potentially important in the micro-

underpinning of aggregate employment changes in the business cycle.




the two differences. The difference in average sizes times the exiting number of firms accounts for 97% of the
contribution of exit and entry to growth of jobs.
13 The characteristics are for 2007 for exiters to avoid reverse causality from the recession/recovery on the
    characteristics.
11

        We examine next changes in employment relative to output among continuing

establishments in manufacturing 14 . We limit our analysis to manufacturing because the

yearly production data in the Census Bureau's Annual Survey of Manufacturers allows us to

differentiate recession from recovery, whereas production data in the quinquennial Censuses

of Production for other sectors lacks the time detail to distinguish the two parts of the cycle.

We follow Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh (1996) and measure changes in employment

relative to average establishment employment in the starting and ending period, in order to

reduce the risk that large relative changes in employment for small establishments unduly

affects the estimates. 15

        Table 4 shows the average annual changes in employment and output for all

establishments and those in the 0-20th, 40-60th, and the 80-100th quintile of changes ranked by

rate of increase from lowest to highest. The natural measure of variation in these statistics is

the inter-quintile range, defined as the difference between the top quintile's mean change in

employment and the bottom quintile's mean change in employment. In the Great Recession,

manufacturing employment declined on average by 13% while output declined by 18.6%, for

an implicit employment to output elasticity of 0.70, per labor hoarding behavior. The quintile

changes reveal large increases in employment and output at the upper end of the distributions

and large decreases at the lower end: a top quintile employment increase of 42.1% compared

to a bottom quintile decrease of 90%, giving an inter-quintile range of 132 points; a top




14       Establishments are included in the calculations if they exist in the beginning and end of each period.
This calculation is possible with the ASM because the ASM 5-year panels can be linked to prior and subsequent
Census of Manufacturers to retain all ASM plants (i.e. not limited to the large plant certainty sample). For
example the 2009 ASM panel is linked to the 2007 CoM. Focusing on continuing establishments sidesteps the
discontinuity in changes related to exit and entry and potential differences between exit and entry decisions and
expansion/contraction decisions.
15 This problem can also be addressed by weighting observations by the number of employees.
12

quintile average increase in output of 33.8% and a bottom quintile average decrease in output

by 93%, giving an inter-quintile range of 127 points.

        In the recovery, manufacturing employment fell by 3.8 % while output increased by

13.1%, producing a 16.9% increase in productivity. But, as in the recession, the averages

masque huge variation: a 78% employment drop in the bottom quintile compared to a 57.7%

increase in the top quintile; a 63.2% output drop in the lowest quintile compared to a 72.1%

increase in the top quintile. The large recession gain in employment and output in the highest

quintile of establishments compared to the large recovery loss of employment and output for

the lowest quintile highlights the heterogeneous experience of establishments. Some

establishments expand even in a huge recession and some contract even in a recovery.

        To see whether the heterogeneity was exceptional to the Great Recession or normal for

recent recessions, we computed inter-quintile ranges of change in employment and output in

the 2000-2002, 1989-91, and the 1979-81 recessions. The bottom panel of Table 4 shows

smaller inter-quintile ranges of changes in those recessions than in the Great Recession and

smaller inter-quintile ranges in changes in the recovery phases than in the recovery from the

Great Recession. But, the ranges still evince huge heterogeneity. 16



Technological change and capital-labor substitution

        Changes in employment or output associated with the characteristics of continuing

establishments offer insight into the direction of economic and technological forces, just as do

comparisons of the characteristics of entering and exiting establishments. A characteristic that

raises growth of output or employment in a regression indicates that market forces favor that



16       Davis, Haltiwanger and Schuh (1996) and Haltiwanger (2012), among others, also note the
heterogeneity in changes in employment among enterprises.
13

characteristic. To see how the attributes of establishments affect employment and output, we

regressed changes in employment and output in the Great Recession and in the recovery

separately on: the share of college graduates; capital per employee 17; computer investment per

employee; and whether the firm that owns the establishment did R&D, among other factors. 18

The regressions include a vector of 3 digit NAICS level industry dummies interacted with the

state location of the establishment, so the estimates come from variation within industry-state

cells. To ease interpretation of the regressions, we normalized the variables to their average

2007 value so that the constants measure change for an establishment with average

characteristics.

           Column 1 of table 5 records the estimated coefficients from OLS regressions of

changes in output in the Great Recession on the characteristics. The estimated constant shows

that revenue in the average establishment declined 19.2 % from 2007 to 2009. Column 2

records the estimated coefficients for regressions of changes in employment in the recession

on the characteristics. The estimated constant shows that employment declined by 14.7%.

The smaller change of employment than of output to the recession reflects “labor hoarding”

for establishments with similar characteristics. The characteristics that differentiated entering

from exiting establishments in figure 2 affect output and employment in table 5 in a similar

manner: establishments with relatively more college graduates, capital per employee, and

computer investment per employee had higher growth than other establishments in the same

industry and state during the recession. By contrast, establishments in firms that do R&D
17
     Capital stocks were created by Foster, Grim and Haltiwanger (2016) using perpetual inventory methods.

18        The R&D status for the firm that owned an establishment is from the NSF Survey of Industrial R&D
(SIRD) and Business R&D and Innovation Survey (BRDIS). We find R&D spending to be persistent, where we
pool R&D years to determine if a firm ever performs R&D, in which case they are indicated as an R&D firm.
This procedure helps overcome coverage issues, given the R&D data are surveys, and thus captures R&D
activity of small firms. However, comparing our R&D indicator to patent data as well as to firm count estimates
by firm size using the R&D survey weights, some measurement error for the R&D performance of small firms
remains. Another factor in the regressions was the export status of the establishment measured in the share of
output sold overseas, which we treat as a covariate control.
14

averaged a 3.9 point greater increase in output than establishments in non-R&D firms but had

a 0.8 point smaller change in employment. This likely reflects the fact that R&D-based

technology creates process as well as product innovation. New/improved products add to

output and employment while new production processes are often labor saving and can reduce

employment.

        Columns 3 and 4 examine the relation between establishment characteristics and

changes in output and employment in the recovery. An establishment with average

characteristics had output growth of 16.9% but employment growth of just 3.4% that reflects

the “jobless recovery”. The estimated impacts of establishment characteristics on output and

employment in the recovery differ markedly from the columns 1 and 2 estimated impacts of

characteristics in the recession. The coefficients for the share of college employees and

computer investment per employee change from positive in the recession to negative in the

recovery. The estimated coefficients on R&D performing firms shift from positive to negative

on output and become more negative on employment. Only the estimated coefficients on

capital-labor ratios show similar patterns in both phases of the cycle, with capital-intensive

firms expanding more in output and employment. 19

         A plausible explanation for the general pattern of sign reversal is labor hoarding

behavior, with establishments that were more negatively impacted by the recession being

commensurately less positively impacted by the upturn; and conversely for those less

impacted by the recession. Since firms hoard labor in recessions to avoid recruiting labor in

recoveries, the hoarding firm will reduce employment less in the recession and increase


19       To see if the Great Recession downturn and recovery differed from downturns and recoveries in earlier
recessions, we estimated variants of the table 5 equations for the entire 2007-2012 period and for the downturn
and recovery in the three previous recessions. We found only modest differences in the relation between the
physical and human capital of establishments and the R&D attribute of the owning firm on output and
employment.

employment less in the recovery than the firm that does not hoard labor. Technological change

and capital-labor substitution aside, a firm that hoarded completely would lay off no one in a

recession and would not have to hire anyone in a recovery to bring output to its pre-recession

level. By contrast a firm that treated labor as completely variable would lay off 10% of its

work force when output fell by 10% and rehire all those workers when output regained the

pre-recession level.

        To assess the extent of job hoarding behavior at the establishment level, we estimate

equations linking ln changes in establishment employment to ln changes in establishment

output in the recession and recovery periods. Hoarding at the establishment level would show

up in an estimated coefficient of the change in employment on the change in output below

1.0. Column 1 of Table 6 gives an estimated coefficient on output of 0.389 in the recession

period, indicative of considerable hoarding. Column 2 of Table 6 gives an estimated

coefficient on output of 0.473 in the recovery period, far below the 1.0 that one would get if

labor was a completely variable input.

        Taking the analysis a step further, the establishment data allows us to make a direct

test of the proposition that labor hoarding in recession reduces growth of employment in the

recovery. Using the information on the changes in establishment employment and output in

the recession, we estimate a “recession hoarding” variable for each establishment and add that

measure to the regression of employment changes on output changes in the recovery. Our

recession hoarding measure is the residual from the column 1 estimate of the change in

employment on output in the recession. The larger is employment relative to its predicted

level from the regression, the larger is the estimated amount of hoarding 20. Column (3) shows



20 The residuals measure of hoarding can be improved in various ways, such as comparing changes in
   employment with changes in materials, which the firm is unlikely to hoard, or differentiating production from
   non-production workers, or distinguishing establishments with increases in sales in the recession and/or
16

that this measure obtains a large significant negative effect in the regression for the change in

employment in the recovery. Hoarding evinces itself in the adjustments of employment

throughout the distribution of employment and output changes as well as in the different

average changes in employment and output in recession and recovery.

          Finally, we examine the hoarding notion by contrasting the actual pattern of changes in

employment and output to a well-specified counterfactual that abstracts from the business

cycle. Assume that absent the recession output and employment would have changed

smoothly from 2007 to 2012. This identifies the impact of the cycle as the difference between

the actual changes and the counterfactual smooth change. Columns 1 and 2 in Table 7 give the

regression coefficients of the growth of output and employment on the characteristics of

establishments in the 2007-2012 smooth growth counterfactual. 21 These regressions show that

the college share of the work force had little relation to growth of output or employment over

the entire period; that R&D of the firm is associated with increased output but reduced

employment; while capital/employee ratios and computer investments per employee are

positively associated with output and employment. Column 3 gives the annual change in

output/employee associated with each characteristic obtained by dividing the difference

between the columns 1 and 2 coefficients by 5 for the 5 years covered.

          Columns 4 and 5 record the deviations of productivity measured by output per

employee in the recession and in the recovery from the smooth change. For an establishment

with average characteristics, productivity increased by 7.1 ln points more in the recession than

in the benchmark smooth adjustment. By contrast, the average establishment fell short of the


     decreases in sales in the recovery, but the table 6 analysis suffices to establish the establishment basis of
     hoarding.

21 As in other tables, the output and employment dependent variables were scaled with 2007 as 1.00 so the
   constants give the growth rates for establishments with the average characteristics.

smooth benchmark by 9.5 points in the recovery. Since changes in recession and recovery are

deviations from the smooth growth, the estimated effects for independent variables in

recession and recovery necessarily alternate in sign. The biggest differences in the coefficients

are for the share of college graduates. Establishments with high college shares stabilized

productivity over the cycle more than other establishments. 22



4. Conclusion

        Our analysis of aggregate, sectoral, and establishment level changes in employment

and productivity in the Great Recession and recovery document that employment responses

differed greatly to changes in output between the US and other advanced countries, between

US manufacturing and the bulk of the US private sector, and among US manufacturing

establishments. Taking the economy as a whole, US firms reduced employment

proportionately more than output in the Great Recession, in contrast to the labor hoarding

behavior in most advanced countries and in earlier US recessions. The main pathway for the

huge reduction in US employment was massive contractions of employment by existing

establishments. The pathway for job growth in the recovery, by contrast, was dominated by

the exit-and-entry of establishments, with new entrants to the market adding greatly to

employment. Manufacturing establishments, however, behaved differently, hoarding labor in

the recession while evincing widely varying elasticity of employment to gross output in

recession and in recovery.




22        To check the interrelation between employment adjustments in the recession and recovery, we
examined the pattern of change in employment relative to materials as well as to revenues. This compares the
two inputs that firms can potentially adjust in the short run to changes in demand for output. Over the entire
period the ratio of materials to output increased by 9.3 percent – a change that implies materials augmenting
technical change – while the cyclic pattern resembles the table 7 pattern of output/employees with slower growth
in the recession and faster growth in the recovery relative to the five year smooth alternative-- the signature of
input hoarding.
18

       These differences in employment responses challenge simple models of how

enterprises adjust employment in downturns and recoveries. Given that labor institutions are

generally stronger in the EU than in the US, it is natural to attribute US-EU differences in

employment responses to the different institutional settings, in particular to greater

employment protection legislation and higher density of collective bargaining in the EU than

in the US. 23 But, as noted earlier, many EU countries introduced explicit policies to preserve

jobs in the Great Recession and unions and employer federations negotiated new collective

bargaining agreements, suggesting two different institutional explanations for hoarding

behavior in Europe. The first explanation attributes most of the smaller employment response

to the “normal costs of adjustment” stressed in hoarding models. The second explanation

attributes most of the preservation of jobs to the emergency legislation and agreements. An

institutional explanation ought to provide estimates of these two routes of impact. It should

also explain the sizable differences in employment responses among countries beyond the US

in Table 1 – for instance why productivity fell in the recession in Britain, Germany, and

Denmark while increasing in Spain, Ireland, and Austria. Analyses that propose institutional

explanations for US-EU differences should be tested on the details of the proposed institutions

at country and more micro levels.

       The huge layoffs among continuing establishments and higher elasticity of job loss to

output in the US in the Great Recession than in previous recessions may also be partly

attributable to institutional changes within the country, such as the continued decline in

collective bargaining coverage and the shift in the US toward temporary contracts for more

and more workers. The growth of the “gig economy” in many non-manufacturing sectors

countries in collective bargaining and employment protection legislation
19

invariably makes labor a more variable input, which could explain part of the higher elasticity

of employment to output in the Great Recession. But with labor more variable, the elasticity

of employment to output in the recovery should also be high, which it was not. The timing of

the shift from permanent to more temporary labor contracts also does not fit well with job

shedding in the recession. Katz and Kreuger (2016) date the shift toward temporary, on-call

and related jobs as occurring largely from 2005 to 2015 24, the balance of which occurs after

the Great Recession. Perhaps the employment-at-will doctrine that dominates US labor

contracts 25 gives most firms sufficient flexibility to lay off workers in a crisis without

temporary contracts, on-call work, and the like. The Great Recession collapse of

construction, where almost all jobs are short term gigs, may also have contributed to the

absence of labor hoarding in the broad economy. 26

        Within the US, the finding of continued hoarding behavior in manufacturing poses the

question of why manufacturing responded so differently to the Great Recession than most

other sectors? One possibility is that globalization allowed US manufacturers to off-shore

much of the variable part of production work, so that a larger proportion of remaining workers

had skills and knowledge that made adjustment cost of layoffs more expensive than in the

past. Testing this proposition requires evidence on the extent to which firms and their

suppliers adjusted output and employment overseas in the recession. If US firms vary in their

24      Katz and Krueger (2016) show that most of the increase in alternative work arrangements measured by
independent contractors, on-call workers, temporary help agency workers, and those provided by contract firms
occurred after 2005. See also Abraham, Haltiwanger, Sandusky, and Spletzer, (2015) and Weil (2014).

ability to move employment adjustments downstream along their supply chain, globalization

may also help explain some of the heterogeneity of employment responses to output among

observationally similar establishments. Evidence on establishment level changes in other

advanced countries could also help determine the extent to which the manufacturing

experience of the US in the Great Recession was driven by the technology and global market

in the sector as opposed to institutional differences between the US and other advanced

economies.

        In sum, the evidence of heterogeneity in responses of employment to output among

countries and among observationally comparable manufacturing establishments and the shift

in the US from hoarding labor to shedding jobs more rapidly than output declined in the Great

Recession shows that we know less about how labor markets operate over the business cycle

than we thought. Will the next recession, in which a much larger proportion of the work force

will hold irregular jobs produce greater job losses than in 2007-2009? Could greater reliance

on labor institutions determining wage and employment outcomes dampen job losses, and, if

so, what would those institutions be? To answer these and related questions requires new

economic analyses of labor demand that focus on the factors behind the variability of

employment responses and that seek ways to influence those responses along the entire

distribution of responses so that our economies can adjust better to the next recession in the

business cycles that seem endemic to market economies.

Note: Left hand side variables measured as dY/Y, where Y is defined as the average of the last and the first year.
Right hand side variables measured as levels in pre-recession year (2007). All models include
ln(Employment/Output) in 2007 as well as industry x state dummies. The unit of observation is establishments.
The right hand side variables are normalized as deviations from 2007 level, and the constant term may thus be
interpreted as the relative change in output and employment for establishments with average characteristics in
2007. The models also include ln(E/S) and ln ratio of exports to output as well as fixed effects for each industry
state cell so statistics are generated by variation among establishments in the same state and industry.
* Output as measured by sales.

Appendix A: Job Destruction and Creation Dominated by Changes Among Continuers

        The job destruction graph records the thousands of jobs that were “destroyed” by plant
closing/death of an establishment and by reduction of employment among continuing
establishments, and their total. For every year the job destruction by continuers exceeds job
destruction by continuing establishments reducing employment.




        The job creation graph records the thousands of jobs that were creating by new
establishments entering the market (through birth) and by expansion of employment among
continuing establishments, and their total. For every year the job creation by continuers
exceeds job creation by continuing establishments that expand employment.
