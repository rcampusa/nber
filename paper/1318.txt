                The Heights of Europeans since 1750:
            A New Source for European Economic History



                           ABSTRACT



        Economic and social historians have traditionally been concerned

to measure changes in the income and welfare of populations in the

past.      Until recently, however, they have not recognized that

anthropometric data, such as evidence on the average height achieved

by a population at a particular age, provide sensitive indicators

of the average nutritional status of that population.       Records of

conscription into the armies of eleven European countries betweeen 1761

and 1975 provide 114 observations of mean height.        Using 614 obser-

vations, the paper explores the relationship between mean height and

other indicators of health and welfare, in particular the level of

GDP per capita and the level of infant mortality.        Western European

heights are shown to have responded systematically over the past hundred

years to changes in income and disease, just as heights in the modern

world respond to similar changes today.       Average height is powerful

evidence of the nature and extent of economic development.

 a new source for European Economic History




   European economic historians have been preoccupied,
since the foundation of their academic discipline,'with the

study of the profound economic changes which have taken

place in Europe during the past two hundred years. Recent
studies in many countries have established the main

outlines of those changes, the growth of manufacturing
industry, the decline of agriculture, the increasing
importance of foreign trade and the decline in the rates of

growth of population, which occurred at various times in all

European countries. Yet the effects which these changes have

had on the people of those countries has remained curiously
difficult to establish; the standard of    living   of the
peoples of Europe has changed enormously during the transition
from feudalism, but the exact delineation of that change has
remained elusive.
   In the past, the problem of measuring changes in the
standard of living tas -been- seen by historians -as - predominantly
a problem of data collection.     It was assumed t1at, once
sufficient data on prices and wages had been collected, the
measurement of real wages could follow; even if micro-

economic data had been lost, methods such as national income

analysis,   combined with more accurate measurement of
population changes, could provide a guide to movements in
real incomes per capita. it is true that   knowledge     of the
                                                                        2

distribution    of income is crucial to such analysis, but it

can often be assumed or inferred from tax data or similar

material. There are, in addition, many statistical
difficulties, such as those of the choice of weights, the
choice of base periods and the choice of the most appropriate

analytical method, but there have been improvements in our

knowledge of all these difficulties, so that they seem
now either solved or capable of solution, at least at the

levels of accuracy which are needed for studies of long-term

historical processes.
      It is probably inevitable that, at the time when so many
of the problems which preoccupied earlier academic studies

of the standard of living seem to be near to solution,

economic historians should       begin   to feel dissatisfied with
the measures which they have spent so long trying to make.
This dissatisfaction was     succinctly expressed some time
ago, in a debate on the British standard of living, when
Eric Hobsbawin wrote that "Man      does   not live by bread alone".

(Hobsbawm 1963: 131 ).     In   other words, the -traditional

measures of real wages are inadequate to capture the
enormous   changes which have takei place       in   patterns of work
and-life --during--the -past--two centuries .- -t
                                               the least,
measures of real wages need to be qualified by knowledge          of

changes   in work   intensity,- of the impact of urban living
and factory working and, perhaps most important, of the
effect of all these changes on health arid mortality. There

is little point in an improvement in real wages which is
bought at the expense of a miserable life and an early
death. If historians ignore the existence of this trade-off
during -the period of industrjaljsatjon, by concentrating
                                                                3

their attention only on the measurement of real wages, then

they miss a fundamental part of the history of the working

class. E.P.Thompson was right, therefore, to give equal
emphasis to "Experiences" and to "Standards" in his

discussion of this subject in The Making of the English

Working Class (Thompson 1968)
     As the mention of Hobsbawm and Thompson shows, (and

many others could be cited) historians have not usually
ignored the deficiencies of measures of real wages. Their

problem has been that, if they wish to consider other life

experiences as part of the standard of living, they have to

be able 1o weigh up ore experience against another, to judge
whether an increase in real wages was brought at too high

a price in misery, ill-health and increased mortality.
This is difficult to do; whatever the utility maximising
theorists of neo-classical economics may assume, few of us

are confident about such calculations in our own lives, and
it   is far more difficult to make such judgements about
millions of people in the past. Recent attempts to do so

by J.G. Williamson (Williamson 1981, 1982), though
innovative and imaginative, rest on evidence which is too
poor to be persuasive.

     What is needed, in fact, is a measure which will in some
way sum up all the facets of experience which make up our
standard of living, or will do so for substantially more of
them than are summed up in measures of real wages. This
article is devoted to a discussion, in the context of

European   economic history, of one possible measure, the
changes   in the heights of Europeans since the middle of the
eighteenth   century.

Auxology and history
   Historians are unfamiliar with the idea that
measurements of height and of other aspects of human
physique are of any relevance to the measurement of

standards of living.    Some early work of Emmanuel le Roy

Ladurie and others in this field was sceptically received
and was not followed up or emulated.   (Aron et al. 1972)

By contrast, human biologists and physical anthropologists
have long believed that growth in humans is responsive to
changes in the environment.   An early pioneer in the

measurement of human growth was Adolphe Quetelet (1796-
187Ll), a Belgian whose work was widely known throughout
Europe and who, at the same time as L.R. Villerme in France,
surveyed the growth of children and adolescents and sought to

describe and explain its principal features.   The work of
Quetelet and Villerme' stimulated Edwin Chadwick, in England,

to organise surveys of the heights of children in factory
districts in the 1830s. Since that time, the study of
human growth or 'auxology' has become a scientific

discipline in its own right and has given rise to numerous

surveys of growth throughout the world.    (Tanner 1981;
Eveleth and Tanner 1976).

   These studies are based on the belief, now well

established, that
   "A child's growth rate reflects, better than any

    other single index, his state of health and

    nutrition; and often indeed his psychological
    situation also.    Similarly, the average value of

    children's heights and weights reflect accurately
    the state of a nation's public health and the
                                                             5

         average nutritional status of its citizens,

         when appropriate allowance is made for

         differences, if any, in genetic potential.
         This is especially so in developing and

         disintegrating countries. Thus a well-designed
         growth study is a powerful tool with which to

         monitor the health of an opulation, or to -

         pinpoint   subgroups of s population whose share
         in economic and social benefits is less than it

         might be." (Eveleth and Tanner 1976:1)
It is for this reason that the World Health Organisation
arid other bodies make use of measurements of growth to

assess the efficacy of health and development programmes

in the world today.
                                              indicate
   Growth measures, as Eveleth and Tanner say/the 'average
nutritional status' of those measured. That is, h13Thfl

growth   reflects not only the input of nutrients in the form

of food and drink, but also the demands which the growing

child and adolescent places on his body. Nutrition is

required for body xnaintenace, for work or other physical

activity and for growth; if the nutrition is inadequate
to sustain the body in a healthy state, or if the demands

of work are excessive, growth will be retarded or, in the

extreme case, will cease al-together. In addition, disease

can place extra demands on the body for additional

nutrients; if these are not forthcoming, growth will again
be affected. 'Nutritional status' is thus a net rather

than a gross measure of nutrition; it measures not what

the human body takes in (as in studies of diet which are

familiar to many historians) but what the body makes of
                                                              6




those nutrients when combined with other pressures and
requirements.
   The pattern of growth in childhood and adolescence is
common to all human populations.   Growth is most rapid
in infancy, slows down during childhood and then increases
in speed during puberty or the 'adolescent growth spurt'
before slowing again until final height is achieved in the
late teenage years.   This growth pattern can be seen
clearly both in historical series such as those compiled
by Quetelet, in modern studies of the under-developed
world and in modern studies of the developed world; the
timing of particular events, such as the adolescent growth
spurt or the achievement of final heights, varies between
different genetic groups within the world population, but
the overall pattern is common to all.
   Within particular genetic groups, such as the white
European populations, variations in nutritional status
produce variations in the timing of growth, and the
extent and nature of such variations from the pattern and
timing found in a well-nourished population give a guide
to the nature and severity of mal-nutrition (in the widest
sense of an imbalance between nutrient intake and the needs
of the body).   Since a frequency distribution of heights
at a given age corresponds very closely to the normal or
Gaussian distribution, and since the standard deviation of
such a distribution is standard in adolescence and
adulthood at about 6.4 cm., it is conventional to describe
the mean heights of other populations as falling, for
example, between the 3rd and 5th centile of the current
British height distribution.   Such a description means
that the mean height of a given population is lower than
the heights of all but 95 per cent of the current British
population, but higher than that of 3 per cent of that
population.
                                                               7



   An episode of malnutrition, such as a famine, can delay
growth and therefore cause the curve of growth of a
malnourished population to deviate from that of a well-
nourished population.    If the malnutrition is short-lived,

however, it is likely that children and adolescents will

resume growth once the episode is passed; they may even
grow faster, in a phenomenon known to auxologists as

'catch-up' growth and thereby achieve final heights similar
to those which they would have achieved had the famine not

taken place. This phenomenon was observed, for example,
in the aftermath of the Dutch 'hunger winter' of 1944.
(Stein et al. 1975)     If the malnutrition is prolonged,

perhaps beginning at the foetal stage and affecting both
childhood and adolescence, then growth will typically be
slower than for a well-nourished population and the final
height which is achieved may well be consequently less.

   This emphasis on the environmental or nutritional causes
of variation in growth may seem to be at odds with the

common emphasis on genetic causes of variations in heights
and other bodily characteristics. There is no doubt that
the overall pattern of growth is genetically determined,
nor that a substantial part of an individual's growth is
inherited from parents, but there is also substantial
evidence that most of the variation of average heights of

populations within very large ethnic groups, and certainly
most of the variation of the average heights of sub-groups

within those populations, is determined by environmental
rather than genetic factors.    Two signs of this are that
"the mean heights of well-fed West Europeans, North American
                                                                  8


 whites arid North American blacks are nearly identical"

 (Fogel et al. 1982: iO5) and that in all western European
 societies (with the recent exception of Sweden) social

 class is closely correlated with average height. A further
indication of the importance of environmental influences on

average height is that in the world today there is a very

strong correlation between average height arid per c'apita
national income (Steckel 1983).

      At the same time, the importance of genetic factors and
the nature of their interaction with environmental and

socio—economjc factors should not be underestimated. As
Evele-th and Tanner put it:

           "Such interaction may be complex. Two genotypes
           which produce the same adult heights under
           optimal   environmental circumstances may produce
           different   heights under circumstances of privation.
           Thus two children who would be the same            a
                                                      height in
           well-off community may not only both be smaller 'under
           poor economic conditions, but one may be
           significantly smaller than the other . . ."
           (Eveleth and Tanner 1976:222)
Interactions of this kind are still not well        understood.
Nor   is   the relationship, between the tempo of growth and the
final height which      is   achieved. As Tanner puts it:.
        "...within     a given, well—nourished population, there
           is no correlation between tempo and final height:

           tall men are as likely to have been late as to have

           been early maturers. Even between populations at

           different levels of nutrition, the correlation is

           far from close. A population which is short at age
                                                                        9


            1k may be so either because its children are

            delayed in growth (in which case they may reach
            a considerable height as adults) or because they
            are simply short --   before,   then and later with
            average tempo. As for trends within a single
            population, in historical data increasing mature

            size usually is accompanied by increasing tempo
            of growth. But the two should certainly not be

            regarded as inseparable ....."      (Tanner   1982:575)
    This difficulty makes it important for auxologists to

    examine, so far as possible, the whole pattern of growth

    of a population, rather than simply the average height
    achieved at one particular age.

         Even though there remain many puzzles connected with
    human growth, the outlines of the process of growth and its

    connections with environmental influences are clear. Growth
    is a measure of nutritional status, of the synergistic

    relationship between nutritional intake, work effort, and
    health.      Malnourished and   unhealthy  populations are short
    populations,   well—fed and   healthy   populations are tall
    populations. This fact     is of   enormous importance to
    historians, because it     means that   growth statistics offer
    a   way of summing   up many of the different influences on
-
    human existence which we think of when we speak          of   the
    standard of living. Growth statistics       are   more
    comprehensive than measures of real wages for the discussion
    of the standard of living within individual societies and
    they are also a means of comparing standards of living

    between different societies within the same genetic group.
    In the light of this modern knowledge, it is interesting
                                                                     10


that Karl Marx, .presumably aware of the work of Quetelet,

Villerme' and Chadwick, used height statistics in his

discussion of the impact of indutrialisation. He referred
in Capita], to J. von Liebig's description of the declining

health of the French and German populations as shown by

the condition and height of their military recruits and

argued that this decline in England had made factory

legislation necessary:
         "The limiting of factory labour was dictated by
          the same necessity which spread guano over the

          Englishfields. The same blind eagerness for
          plunder that in the one case exhausted the soil,
          had, in the other, torn up by the roots the living
          force    of the   nation. Periodical, epidemics speak on
          this   point as clearly as the diminishing military
          standard in Germany arid France." (Marx, 1867;

           1961: vol 1, 239)


The Evidence

      Marx draws   our   attention to   the principal source of
evidence for the study of humn heights in Europe over the
past two centuries. Records-of mil-itary--recruitinent, which
survive in vast quantity, typically contain information on
the height of the recruit. This information appears -to have
been collected and recorded for two m2ifl reasons. First,
it was coimnonIroin the       eighteenth century onward to require
that a recruit should be taller than some defined standard
of height. As Tanner puts it:
      "Tall soldiers were preferable to short ones. Not
        only were they generally stronger; they could cover
                                                              11


        more ground on the march because of a greater

        length of stride, and in combat they could
        reach further with the bayonet and load itiore

        easily the long-barrelled muskets of the time,
        in which the charge had to be rammed down the

        muzzle. The custom of having troops march in

        step, introduced about 1700 in Prussia, seta
        limit to permissible differences in height; and

        the requirements of ceremonial .....demanded a

        sclised corps whose heights had a still smaller
        range." (Tanner 1981:98)

Potential recruits were, therefore, measured to make sure
 that they could pass the height standard. The second
reason for measurement, arid the reason why the measurement

was recorded along with other details of the recruit, was
to enable him to be identified, a particularly important

need in an age when desertion was frequent and when, as in

England, recruits were known to join and desert in order

to obtain the "King's shilling" several times over.
   For these reasons, heights of recruits were recorded as
early as the first half of the eighteenth century, in Norway

froni1741;-and soon afterwards in England from 1755 and in
Sweden from 1767. Other countries followed as conscription

aria the growth of standing armies increased the

bureaucratisation of military affairs. Conscription brought
with it, in addition, ..a new development., for -it was -common.

for conscription to be based on the inspection of very large

sections, if not the whole, of the young male population on

a regular basis, This practice gives rise to the survival,
to our own day, of records of heights and other physical
                                                                  12



and social characteristics, such as occupation arid place

of birth or residence, for entire populations of young men.

   The records of different European armed forces exist in

many different forms and information survives in them about

the heights of many millions of soldiers. Table 1 presents
in summary form the results of investigation of these

records by human biologists and historians, together with
some information from modern periods drawn from sample

surveys of the stated population. It is not possible,

unfortunately, to be entirely certain that the results are

ctrictly comparable one with another, since military
recruiting practices varied from time to time and frtm place

to place. In some countries, for example, conscription gave
rise to measuremerrts of the entire male population at a

particular age; in others, only those young males 'ñio were
actually selected for military service were recorded. In
some, volunteer armies were the norm .and the records of

heights stem, therefore, from a self-selected sample which
may not be representative of the male population. It is

unlikely, however, that these differences in the nature
of the statistics are large enough to vitiate comparisons

over time and between the countries listed in the table.

   Interpretation of Table 1 requires some attention to the
pattern      of   human growth which was discussed above. Since
both   the   speed of growth and the absolute height achieved

at a particular age can vary between populations and between
different time periods, it is necessary to adopt a common

standard against which to set measurements of height which

were conducted at different ages. In the 5th column of
table 1, therefore, the absolute average heights in cm. are
                                                                         13




    accompanied by a measure f their relationship to the modern
    English standard.     Each average height is expressed as an
    approximation to the quintiles of the English standardfor
     the age at which meaairements took place or, in the case of

    men measured older than 18, the quintiles of the modern

    British population of 18 year old males. (In a few cases,

    with very short population, the 3rd percentile is also useth)
    In the section for Belgium, for example, the figure '10'

    in column 5 against the measurements of Houze for 1880-82

    shows that Belgian males of 19-25 at that time had a mean

    height greater than   that of 5   per cent of modern British
    males aged 18 but less than that of 90 per cent. Later in

    that table, the measurement of Twiesselmann suggests that

    Belgians in 1969 had a mean height greater than that of

•   45 per cent, but less than that of 50 per cent, of modern

    British males; that is, by 1969 the Belgian and the British
    populations were very close in stature. The mean height of
    20-year old Italians in 1874—6 was l?ss than the height of
    all but 97 per cent of the modern British, while, at the

    other extreme, the mean height of 18-year old Dutch males
    in 1975-was greater-tha the ileight--of-ail--bu-t-20--per -cent- -
    of the modern British population.



    Analysis
       Table 1 and Figure 2 show the very large changes which
    have taken place during the past one hundred and      fifty

      Human biologists, from Villerm onwards, have consistently
emphasised the importance of the environment in promoting
or retarding human physical growth. They have devoted a

great deal of attention to the effects of malnutrition

and other forms of deprivation on individual health and

growth and, in their studies, have demonstrated how improved
nutrition and control of disease can produce immediate and

dramatic effects on the growth of children. (Nartorell and

Klein 1980). At the level of whole populations rather than

individuals, human biologists have also shown that in almost
all  countries in    the modern world - an exception is Sweden -
different social      classes have different average heights. In

Britain, for example, class differences in hghts can be
perceived in groups of infants as early as the age of two,
while    the   differences are even more pronounced in
adolescence.   (Smith et al. 1980). Within countries, therefore
height   is correlated with that complex of factors which goes
to make up social class while, between tountries, it isa
matter of casual observation — reinforced by a study of
Eveleth and Tanner's Worldwide Variation in Human Growth
(1976) — that the richer countries in the world tend to be
the   countries with the taller populations.

     Economists and historians have been slow to understand
the po±en±ial nf thisodyotscienti        fi Jowlcrigc fnr their
own disciplines. The clear implication of the study of human
biology is that human height responds to, and is a

sensitive measure of, differences in the standard of living

of human populations from one time to• another, froni one place

to another and from one social class to another. Changing

height   is, in other words, a function of economic and social
                                                                  15


change.    Since this is so, historians and economists should

seek to use measures of height in their description of the

economic and social development of nations and should also

try to understand more fully the exact relationship between

height and social and economic factors.

   A start has recently been made in the use and explanation

of evidence about changes in human height. A group of
economists and historians from Britain and the United States,

working under the leadership of Robert Fogel of the University
of Chicago, have studied data from Britain, from the British
Wezt Indies and from the Ajnericari   colonies   and the United

States. The first results of these studies have recently
appeared in a special issue of Social Science History and

provide a number of striking findings: there appears,          for
example, to have been very l.tttle difference between the

average adult height of white American-born males at the

time of the American Revolutionary War, during the American
Civil   War and at the time of the second World War, although

average heights probably both rose and fell between those
dates; rises and falls over time occurred in the heights
of poor children in London between 1770 and 1870, with a very
marked i-se--in   average -heights-at the end of-- the -Napoleonic
wars;     at the individual level, tall slaves in Trinidad
between   -1810 and 1820 had a significantly reduced chance of
death   compared to shorter slaves. (Sokoloff and Viflaflor
1982; Floud and Wach-ter 1982; Friedman       1982).   These
studies are continuing with the collection of very        large
amounts of data about the heights of military recruits in
Britain and the United States, which will make it possible

to describe changes in heights in those countries from the
middle of the eighteenth century until the present day.

   In an associated study, Steckel has sought to explore the

nature of the relationship between social and eoonomic

factors and height, by studying the range of height which
sobservable in the modem world. (Steckel 1983)          He has

drawn on the work of human    biologists   to provide 163
examples of average adolescent heights from different

societies in the modern world, together with 30 examples of

average adult heights, and has tried to explain the

variation in those heights by reference to the per capita
income of the countries from which the height data were

derived, and to a number of other measur*able factors which

may have a bearing on height differences. These include the

extent of income inequality, the racial composition of the
populations and the extent of urbanisation. Stecke]. found

that there   was a very strong correlation between the average
height of a population arid    logarithm of per capita
                              the
income of the economy from which the population was taken,
and that the addition of information on income inequality
within the society made the statistical relationship
between   height and these social or economic factors even

stronger.
   Steckel warns in his article tiat there is no reason to

believe that the relationship between height and its

socio—economic determinants should remain steady over long

periods of time:

     "Improved medical technology probably shifted the
      relationship between average height and per capita
      income. Knowledge of the germ theory of disease, for

      example, enabled individuals to improve health, arid

      therefore increase height, with no change in income."
                                                                         17


         (Steckel 1983:1_5)
Nevertheless, Steckel's results provide a stimulus to

investigate whether similar relationships between height and
socio—ecoliomic factors existed in the past, even if the

relative effect of different factors differed from those
which can be observed today.

   It is agreed by human biologists that income is a

primary determinant of height, while Steckel's work suggests
that the distribution of the national income can also affect
the average height of that nation. It is also agreed that
disease can have substantial effects on individual and

population average heights. This knowledge makes it sensible
to investigate whether the changes in European heights which
have occurred in the past, and       the   differences   between
European nations, can be explained by reference to the
incomes and disease patterns of those nations. Such an
investigation can only be carried out for the relatively
recent past, since adequate information on national income

per capita   and on   mortality - which must stand       in   place of
information   on health -   are   available only from about 1880
onwards in most western European countries. Nevertheless,
the information on heights in table 1 can be matched, in 64

cases, with jn.foi:inatjon on gross domestic product per

capit-a--e.nd on- --the l.vel-f- in! ant_mQrtality   in th c-ountry
and at the time concerned. No information on the level of
inequality of incomes is available for most countries, so
Steckel's analysis cannot be repeated in this respect with

historical data.
   The relationship between height and these socio—economic
factors   has therefore been investigated, for those 64 cases,
                                                                          i8

 by regression analysis. The results are given in table 2,
 and the notes to the table give greater information on the

 sources of the data which were used. The results show that

 both the level of infant mortality and the level of gross

 domestic product per capita have exerted a strong influence

 on European heights. Indeed, taken together with the other
 variables in the regression equation, these factors explain
 about 96 per cent of the observed variation in heights

 between and within western European populations since 1880.
If one takes ch variable separately, (assuming that the
 other variab1e are held constant) then the results show
that      an   increase of one U.S. dollar (at constant 1970
prices)        in   G.D.P. per capita has been accompanied by an
increase in the average height of' the population            by   0.003
cm; a decrease of one death per thousand live births has
been accompanjed by an increase in average height of 0.020
CIII.



        The results also show that there have been systematic

differences between different European populations. The

regression equation has been designed so that the base for
comparison between populations is           the   experience of Italy;
the intercept -in- the regression-resul reflects -the level

of height in the Italian population before World War I from
which factors such as GDP per capita would raise anlinfant

mortality levels would lower, Italian heights. So—called
'dummy variables'         are employed in   the regression analysis to
discover       whether the experience of other      countries differed
from     that of Italy. The results show that, for some reason,
Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark were

significantly (in a statistical sense) different from Italy;
                                                                    19


 they had taller populations at given levels of GDP per

 capita and infant mortality than did Italy, whereas Belgium,

 France, and Switzerland showed no significant difference
 from the Italian experience.

      Duiruny variables were also employed to discover whether

 the nature of the relationship between height and GDP per

 capita, infant mortality arid national factors changed over
 the course of time. The fact that dummy variables for the

 inter-war and post-war periods have no statistical

 significance demonstrates that there was no change between
periods in that relationship.

      The stability of the relationship between height and per
capita income can also be tested by comparing Steckel's
1esults with those in     table   2. The comparison cannot be
exact,     since the explanatory variables used are    different,
but   it   is possible to compare the effect of national income

or gross domestic product per capita on height, while holding
all the other influences on height constant. This is done in
table 3    which shows a very close correspondence between the
heights which would be predicted on the basis of different

levels of income, if Steckel's equation and that for the
European heights were each taken as a complete description
of the determninants of height. This close correspondence

suggests that there have been no major changes over time in

the relationship between height and income and that Steckel
was too cautious.

   This analysis of    the determinants or correlates of
European height raises many       questions of   interpretation.
As is almost always true, neither the :dependent variable
in the equation, height, nor the independent variables are
                                                                          20

measuring    quite what they are supposed to measure. The
difficulty with the measures of height is that a

 substantial number of them may not be of final adult

heights. In modern Britain, and probably in most western

European countries, the average height of the male

population aged 17.5 is approximately 98 per cent of the
average adult height. (Tanner 1978:19) This reflects the -

tempo of growth of modern, well-nourished children and implies
 that virtually all growth in the population average has ceased
 by the age of 19 or 20. Tanner has noted, however, that
        ".....   in   historical data increasing mature size

         usually is accompanied by increasing tempo--of -

         growth.   But the two should certainly not be

         regarded as    inseparable    ......".   (Tanner    1982:575)
Evidence from British sources shows that it is likely that

the lower heights in table 1,drawn from earlier periods or

from populations with lower incomes, were the product of a
slower grow-th than is normal today...(Floud and Wachter1982)

If that is so, then some of the measurements of the average

heIghts of 19 or 20 year olds in table 1 are somewhat lower
than   mature heights, since     significant growth      —   at   least
1 or2per-ceTrt--of      final—height-----migh-t--stii3.. occur----In
other words, the different average heights in table 1 may

no-t.be strictly comparable,as they shoild be in the

statistical analysis.

     This difficulty is. formally.irsuperab1e, since so many
of   the data relate to army     conscripts   where measurements

were taken at one age and where, therefore, very little if
any information is available for other ages. However, it may

not- be very serious in practice. First, modern studies of
                                                               2].

 malnourished    populations suggest that it is unlikely that
 the tempo of growth would have been delayed by more than two
 years; 98 per cent of final height would -therefore have

 been reached at the latest at the age of 19.5. This implies

 that, for almost all the cases in table 1, the measurement

 must be within two per cent of final height. While this is
 not an insignificant amount - two per cent of 165 6m, for

 example, is 3,3 cm. —     it is small in comparison with change
 in heights which has occurred in most countries. It is

therefore unlikely that the results of the regression

analysis would be seriously disturbed by correcting for
tempo, impossible as this would be in practice. Second,

as Tanner points out, tempo of growth and mature final size
are to a considerable extent independent of each other, even

for population data; both are thought to be responsive to

nutritional change, though which nütrjtjoJ. change affects
which outcome is still ucwn. Since they are largely
independent of each other and responsive, to nutrition, the

fact that some of the measurements in table 1 relate to

populations who had not yet reached mature height does not

matter, since delayed attainment of final height is an
indication of a nutritional state less good thanthatDf
modern Europe.

   The independent variables in the equation, income and
disease, are also less well measured by the data which are

available -than they should be. Stecke1s     results.suggest
very strongly that   per   capita gross domestic product i an
inadequate measure of income, since he found that

the distribution of income is important in explaining height
in the modern world. In addition, infant mortality is an
                                                                        22

inadequate   measure of the disease environment, since modern

 evidence shows that diseases of childhood and            adolescence
 affect growth     in   populations which have survived the period

 of infancy.

      The effect of omitted variables, such as income
 inequality, or of inadequately measured variables,, such as

 health or disease, may be reflected in the regression

 analysis, at least in part, by the dummy variables which

 represent systematic differences between countries. If, for

 example, Norway, Sweden, the Netherlands and Denmark had
 •-.ystematically lower levels of income ..inequality, or if

 1thue areas had a different disease environment, perhaps

 for climatic reasons, then that might explain their taller

 populations. Another possibility,which will be explored in

 future analyses      of   this   material, is   that these differences
 between countries reflect differences in the age at which
 recruits    were measured. However, table 1.        shows that only in
        Denmark       were recruits significantly older on
 average than in      Italy, so it is unlikely that this

 possibility will explain more than         a part of    the height
 differences between countries. The issue deserves more
 study and   the   collection of more relevant data.
      There remain two more technical points;First, Steckel

 suggests that there is a circularity in regarding adult
 height as being determined by average income, since if adult
 males are healthier and stronger they will produce more and
 thus increase income. This difficulty can be circumvented
 in   a statistical     sense by using   a different regression
 method, that of two—stage least squares, and            Steckel's
 results are based on that method. However, it is doubtful
                                                             23

 whether enough additional data on the determinants of

 income are availabie, in historical periods, to make this.

method work; Stecke]. also found that "The results for adults
are not sensitive to the method of estimation" (Steckel 1983:

7, n. 32) and it therefore seems unlikely that the results

for European heights would be significantly changed if a
different method were used.

   Second, there is a high correlation between gross domestic
prorduct   per capita and   the level of   infant mortality, for
obvious    reasons. This "multicollinearity in the independent
variables", as it is known     in   statistical parlance, should
not affect the level of the coefficients reported in table 2,

ior the strength of the overall correlation between height

arid its supposed determinants, but it      might affect the
accuracy   of predictions such as those shown in table 3.
Howcver, prediction of this kind outside the range of the
data -   for   example to earlier   periods - is   fraught with other
difficulties; the extent of multicollinearity is therefore

merely sri additional reason for care. Once again, it would be
desirable to see whether the addition of more data would
change the conclusions, as it might do if multicollinearity
wera.serjous problem.
   Despite     these difficulties   and cautions, the results of
the regression analysis are striking. Western European
heights have responded entirely systematically, over the past
hundred years, to changes in income and disease, just as
heights in the modern world respond to similar differences
between countries. Economic development and the control of
disease have altered the bodies of the people of Europe.

Conclusion

   The analysis inj2üs article has been conducted entirely

with data drawn from national populations. However, the

literature of humaibiology suggests very strongly that
similar methods of analysis could be employed to elucidate

differences in the rate of economic development within

nations, for example between one class and another or
between one area of the nation and another. In the

nineteenth century it was commonly thought that rural

populations were taller and stronger than urban populations,

while today the reverse is the case. Moreover, class
differentials in height have almost certainly narrowed over

the course of time. If it is possible for historians and
economists to collect, in many countries, evidence on

height changes specific to particular       classes,   occupations
and regions, then they have a powerful new method for the

description and analysis of the nature and extent of
economic development. Research of this kind is now being
conducted in Britain and   in   the United States; the analysis
of western European heights in this article is only         a
beginning which,   I hope, will   soon   be superseded by more
detailed   study of the history of European heights.

   Definition and source of variables

       Dependent variable: Height in centimetres. Statistics for
       average height were obtained from a large number of
       secondary sources. Details are in table 1.


   Independent variables: GDP per capita in constant 1970 US
       dollars.     Calculated from Tables Al, A7- and B2-II of
       A. Maddjson Phases of Capitalist Development (Oxford U.?.
       1982).

                     INFM: deathsof infants under one year old
       per 1000 live births, from Table B7 of B.R. Mitchell
       EuroDean Historical   Statistics 1750—1970 (Macmillan        1975)
   Note:             Both infant mortality arid GDP     per capita relate
       to   the year in which the height observations were made.

       Further investigation is required to establish the possible
       lags, since a regression of height on these variables

       measured 20 years before the height observation gave a
       slightly worse fit.

Notes

Column 2              From Steckel, Table 3.    The prediction is based on
                      a national study for a population with uropean

                      ancestors;     the Gini coefficient is evaluated at

                      the sample mean.    Based on the log (base e) of per
                      capita income.
Column 3              Calculated    from Table 1, assuming a national study
                      for a European     population (Italy);    INFM is
                      evaluated    at the sample mean.

Column                Calculated from a regression model similar to that

                      in table 1, but using the log (base e)of GDP per
                      capita as the predictor.      R2 =   .96. Assuming a
                      national, study for a European   population       (Italy),
                      IN is evaluated at the sample mean.
