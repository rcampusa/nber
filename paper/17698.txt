                                                 ABSTRACT

Since the advent of heteroskedasticity-robust standard errors, several papers have proposed adjustments
to the original White formulation. We replicate earlier findings that each of these adjusted estimators
performs quite poorly in finite samples. We propose a class of alternative heteroskedasticity-robust
tests of linear hypotheses based on an Edgeworth expansions of the test statistic distribution. Our preferred
test outperforms existing methods in both size and power for low, moderate, and severe levels of heteroskedasticity.

1     Introduction

The use of  White standard errors (White, 1980) is now prevalent in economics. However, it has long been
known that t-tests based on White standard errors over-reject when the null hypothesis is true and the
sample is not large. Indeed, it is not uncommon for the actual size of the test to be 0.15 when the nominal
size is the usual 0.05. Various xes to estimating the middle matrix     (X 0 ΣX) in equation (2) below have been
introduced. We consider the performance of some of these methods in this paper; see MacKinnon (2011) for
a more comprehensive discussion. The major nding seems to be that these attempted xes do not solve
the problem, as we demonstrate subsequently.
    The other major approach has been to bootstrap the t-test, which will get the correct size (on average).
We benchmark the performance of techniques in this paper with the Wild bootstrap (WB), which MacKinnon
(2011) nds to perform best in terms of power. Hall (1992) has demonstrated that with a pivotal test statistic,
as occurs here, the bootstrapped test will be accurate to the second order in      n   rather than to the rst order,
which underlies the asymptotic expansion used for the White approach.
    In this paper, we directly apply the second-order Edgeworth approximation approach to the test statistic
distribution using the results of Rothenberg (1988).         Hausman and Kursteiner (2008) used this approach
to estimate the covariance of the feasible generalized least squares estimator (FGLS) and found a marked
improvement. However, we nd that the second-order Edgeworth approach has signicant size distortions in
this setting. Instead, we nonparametrically bootstrap the covariance matrix of the parameter vector           β   and
then use the second-order Edgeworth expansion to modify the t-statistic critical value. Using MacKinnon's
(2011) Monte Carlo design, we nd this approach has excellent size properties and has power that is gener-
ally superior to the Wild bootstrap approach. We call this technique the  second-order bootstrap (SOB)
approach and recommend it for use in applied research, particularly when there are sample size concerns.

2        Traditional Robust Standard Error Estimators

For the model


                                                              y = Xβ + u                                                                             (1)

with     V ar(u) = Σ,       the variance of the parameter vector          β̂   estimated by OLS is

                                                V ar(β̂) = (X 0 X)−1 X 0 ΣX(X 0 X)−1 .                                                               (2)

Let   n   denote the sample size and            k   denote the dimension of                  β.    All of the heteroskedasticity-consistent
covariance matrix estimators in the literature (commonly denoted                                  HCj    for      j = 0, 1, 2,   etc.) have the same
sandwich estimator form with variations in the estimated sample matrix that is used for                                           Σ.
      We are interested in test statistics of the form

                                                                   c0 β̂ − c0 β0
                                                             T =     p                                                                               (3)
                                                                         c0 V̂ c
corresponding to a null hypothesis about a linear combination of the estimated parameters                                            H0 : c0 β = c0 β0 ,
                                                                                                                                                0
where     V̂   is an asymptotically valid estimate of        V ar(β̂).    The following are approaches to                        estimating (X ΣX)
that have appeared in the literature.
                                                1

    1.   HC0     (White, 1980) is the original formulation used in White standard errors. White's (1980) contri-

         bution was to recognize that           0 ΣX
                                               Xd       is a consistent estimator of                   X 0 ΣX     when using the sample matrix

                                                                                    û2i
                                                                                
                                                                 Σ = diag
         where    û2i   are the tted residuals from estimating (1) via OLS.

    2.   HC1     (MacKinnon and White, 1985) adjusts for degrees of freedom and is the most commonly used
         robust standard error estimator and is employed by Stata's                           robust      option.
                                                                 n       2
                                                             Σ=     diag ûi
                                                                n−k
    3.   HC2     (MacKinnon and White, 1985) adjusts for the leverage values                                 hi    where   h   is the diagonal of the
         projection matrix          PX = X(X 0 X)−1 X 0 .
                                                                                 û2i
                                                                                            
                                                             Σ = diag
                                                                               1 − hi
    4.   HCJ     (MacKinnon and White, 1985) is the jackknife covariance matrix estimator.
                                                                                                        
                                                             n−1                      1
                                                                                 ũi − ũũ0
                                                                                 2
                                                    Σ   =                diag
                                                              n                       n
                            ûi
         where    ũi =    1−hi .

    5.   HC3     (Davidson and MacKinnon, 1993) is an approximation to                                 HCJ        and is a slight modication of
         HC2                                                          (                     2 )
                                                                                 ûi
                                                          Σ = diag
                                                                               1 − hi

    6.   HC4     (Cribari-Neto, 2004) adjusts the residuals by a leverage factor that increases with the leverage.
                                                                          (                        )
                                                                                      û2i
                                                         Σ   =     diag
                                                                                              δi
                                                                               (1 − hi )
         where    δi = min {4, nhi /k}
We consider these approaches in terms of their size in Section 6 below. We nd using MacKinnon's (2011)
research design that each of the             HCj    estimators continues to have signicant size distortions when                               n   is of
moderate size.
    1 We omit HC (Cribari-Neto et al., 2007) from our analysis as it is nearly identical to HC .

                                                                     2
3      Bootstrap Estimators

Another class of heteroskedasticity robust estimators uses the Wild bootstrap to estimate the distribution
of a given test statistic, forming a rejection region based on the realized bootstrap distribution. The Wild
bootstrap involves forming              B   bootstrap samples using the data generating process

                                                                yi∗ = Xi β̃ + f (ũi )vi∗
where       ũi   are residuals from an estimate           β̃    of   β , f (·)   is one of several candidate transformations of the
estimated residuals, and              vi∗   is an independent random variable with mean 0 and variance 1.                             For each
bootstrap sample     {Xi , yi∗ }, we estimate β̂j∗ where j indexes the bootstrap sample, j = 1, . . . , B , and calculate
                                   ∗
the test statistic of interest Tj , as in (3), using a particular heteroskedasticity-robust estimator of the variance

of β̂ . Inference is then based on comparing the original test statistic to the α/2 and 1 − α/2 percentiles of
 ∗
 Tj .
    MacKinnon (2011) shows that using the Wild bootstrap to estimate the distribution of test statistics
based on          HC1 ,   using   vi∗ ∈ {−1, 1}   with equal probability, restricted residuals (i.e.                β̃ is estimated imposing
                                                                                                                                ũi
the null hypothesis), and a transformation of the residuals corresponding to                                  HC3 , f (ũi ) = 1− h̃
                                                                                                                                     (where h̃i
                                                                                                                                  i
an element of the diagonal of the restricted projection matrix                            PX̃ )   performs best in terms of size and power.
The bootstrap will have correct size on average by construction, so its power characteristics determine the
usefulness of the approach. We will benchmark our results with this particular variant of the Wild bootstrap
and show that our preferred estimator performs comparably in size and much better in power.



4      Second-Order Correction to Test Statistic Distribution

Rothenberg (1988) derives          n−1 Edgeworth approximations for the distribution functions of test statistics that
are linear functions          combinations of β such as (3), assuming that the errors are normally distributed. Hall
(1992) demonstrates that the second-order Edgeworth expansion approach and the bootstrap approach have
the same order of approximation in the case of pivotal test statistics. If the traditional, rst-order critical
values are ±zα/2 , then the second-order approximation                             critical values    t   for the test of the null hypothesis
H0 : c0 β = c0 β0 are a multiplicative adjustment to zα/2 :

the second-order (SO) approach. Applied researchers implementing a SO adjustment may nd it convenient
to calculate virtual standard errors by multiplying given standard errors by the adjustment factor                                   h   in (4)

While any estimate         V̂   of   V ar(β̂)   can be used in (3), simulation results show that for small samples, the
empirical covariance matrix of a vector of nonparametrically bootstrapped                                  β̂   estimates performs best. To
compute this estimated covariance matrix, for                      B = 400        bootstrap iterations we resample             (X, y) with re-
placement from the original data, forming a pairs bootstrap sample                              (X ∗ , y ∗ ).   For each iteration  j , we then
calculate   β̂j∗ = (X ∗0 X ∗ )−1 X ∗0 y ∗   , and take       V̂   to be

    We refer to inference based on using                V̂    from (5) in equation (3) compared to the regular asymptotic
critical values    ±zα/2   as the variance bootstrap (VB). When comparing the VB test statistic to the adjusted
critical values in (4), we call this the second-order bootstrap (SOB) approach.



5     Simulation Design

The data generating process for the simulations follows MacKinnon (2011) with a sample size of                                       n = 40

                                                                            5

                                                       yi     = β1 +              βk Xik + ui
                                                                            k=2
                                                     ui       = σi ε i
                                                     εi       ∼ N (0, 1)

                                                     σi       = z(γ) (Xi β)                                                                   (6)

                                                     β5       = 0

where     z(γ)   is a scaling factor that ensures that the average variance of                       ui is equal to 1. γ = 0 corresponds
to homoskedasticity, and the degree of heteroskedasticity increases with                              γ . For context, in this simulation
design when       γ = 1, HC1         robust standard errors are 44% larger than their homoskedastic counterparts, and
γ =2      corresponds to standard errors that are 70% larger than the corresponding homoskedastic standard
errors.



6     Size Results

We compare the performance of the various variance estimators in the test                              H0 : β5 = 0 with signicance level
α = 0.05    for 10,000 Monte Carlo simulations with varying degrees of heteroskedasticity using the research
design in (6).      Since the data was generated with                     β5 = 0,   this test should reject in approximately 5% of
simulations.      Table 1 below shows rejection frequencies for three levels of heteroskedasticity, where none,
moderate and severe correspond to               γ = 0, 1, 2,      respectively. The rejection frequencies of each of the              HCj     are
decreasing in the degree of the heteroskedasticity. Of the                        HCj   estimators,     HC3      and   HCJ   perform the best,
although they both over-reject for homoskedasticity and drastically under-reject for severe heteroskedasticity.
    The rejection frequencies when we use the Rothenberg second-order critical values with test statistics
based on the      HC0   variance estimates, denoted SO, show that the exact adjustment proposed by Rothenberg
(1988) performs quite poorly.              Indeed, the SO test size is approximately the same as the original White
estimator.
    The three bootstrap methods perform more consistently across the heteroskedasticity spectrum.                                         It is
worth noting that whereas the rejection frequencies of the                     HCj    estimators decline signicantly with the degree
of heteroskedasticity, the bootstrap tests perform quite well even under homoskedasticity.                                       The variance

bootstrap (VB) uses use the bootstrapped covariance matrix of         β̂   from (5) with   B = 400   to compute the
test statistic (3) and compares it to the regular critical value, i.e. 1.96. Applying the Edgeworth expansion
to the distribution of the test statistic to adjust the critical value for the VB test statistic as in (4) (the SOB
approach) improves the rejection frequencies considerably for high degrees of heteroskedasticity. Rejection
frequencies from the Wild bootstrap (WB) approach are consistently close to their nominal value. Identifying
the Wild bootstrap and second-order bootstrap tests as having the best size properties, we now compare the
power of these two approaches.



7    Power Results

Figures 1 and 2 examine the power of the Wild bootstrap and second-order bootstrap tests. In each graph,
we vary the true value of β5 and report rejection frequencies of the null hypothesis that β5 = 0, with α = 0.05.
Note that when the true    β5 = 0, the rejection frequency is the size of the test statistic. Accordingly, a test
statistic has good size the closer its rejection frequency is to 0.05 when β5 = 0 and has greater power the
higher its rejection frequency is for β5 6= 0.
    For both γ = 1 and γ = 2, the Wild bootstrap and second-order bootstrap tests have quite good size.
However, the SOB approach has better power performance than the Wild bootstrap (WB), which is the best
of the bootstrap approaches for this design. For any magnitude of the true          β5   greater than approximately
0.1 (where the power performance of the two tests is quite similar), the SOB rejection frequencies are often
much higher than the WB rejection frequencies.

8    Conclusion

White robust standard errors are universally used in econometrics. Their nite sample properties lead to
over-rejection under the null hypothesis, sometimes by a large amount. Over the past 25 years numerous
approaches have been suggested to x the problem.      In this paper, we suggest a second-order bootstrap
(SOB) approach that has approximately the correct size and superior power properties to the best of the
bootstrap approaches.
