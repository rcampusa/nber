What Would You Do With $500? Spending Responses to Gains, Losses, News and Loans

                                         ABSTRACT

We use survey questions about spending in hypothetical scenarios to investigate features of
propensities to consume that are useful for distinguishing between consumption theories. We find
that (i) responses to unanticipated gains are vastly heterogeneous (either zero or substantially
positive); (ii) responses to losses are much larger and more widespread than responses to gains;
and (iii) even those with large responses to gains do not respond to news about future gains.
These three findings suggest that limited access to disposable resources is an important
determinant of spending behavior. We also find that (iv) households do not respond to the offer of
a one-year interest-free loan, suggesting that this is not a consequence of short-term credit
constraints; and (v) people do cut spending in response to news about future losses, suggesting
that neither is this a consequence of myopia. A calibrated two-asset life-cycle precautionary
savings model can account for these features of propensities to consume, but cannot account for
(vi) a positive extensive-margin size-effect for spending responses to gains, which suggests that
non-convexities due to durability, salience or attention costs may also be important.

1       Introduction
     A large amount of research has been devoted to measuring marginal propensi-
ties to consume (MPCs). The majority of this work has focused on searching for
observable characteristics that correlate with the heterogeneity in MPCs out of in-
come shocks. However, this search has been largely fruitless: the only observable
characteristic that has been robustly shown to correlate with MPCs is holdings of
liquid wealth, and even then the explanatory power of wealth for MPC heterogeneity
is weak.1 In addition, most of the empirical work has focused on the consumption
response to small, unanticipated one-time gains. Other than the cross-sectional cor-
relation with liquid wealth, the limited variation in income changes has provided
little in the way of evidence that is useful for evaluating theoretical models of con-
sumption. In particular, it contains few findings that can help distinguish between
alternative theories for why some households hold very little liquid wealth, and why
some other households have large MPCs despite having moderate amounts of liq-
uid wealth. Among the possible explanations for holding little liquid wealth are
short-term credit constraints, low lifetime resources, access to illiquid investment
opportunities, myopia, and financial illiteracy. Among the possible explanations for
non-trivial MPCs among households with moderate liquid wealth are hand-to-mouth-
like behavior due to committed expenditures or expense risk, and mental accounting.
    In this paper, we use survey evidence on reported spending in various scenarios
to generate new evidence that is useful for testing and refining existing models of
consumption. Rather than focusing on correlates with observed heterogeneity as in
the existing literature, we use within-person variation in consumption responses to
different hypothetical treatments. In addition to MPCs out of unexpected gains of
different amounts, we also elicit MPCs out of unexpected losses, news about future
gains, news about future losses, and an interest-free loan. Thus, the advantage
of our approach is that we generate variation in shocks (in terms of size, timing,
and sign) that is otherwise very difficult to generate cleanly in natural settings.
Moreover, using within-person variation generates results that are free from other
confounds. For example, although it is possible to examine consumption responses
to positive and negative income shocks in observational data, individuals who receive
positive shocks are likely to differ along observable and unobservable dimensions from
those who receive negative shocks, which limits the inferences that one can draw.
    1
     Early work in this literature failed to find strong evidence for a correlation between liquid
wealth and MPCs (see e.g. Johnson et al., 2006), but more recent work that uses larger samples
and richer data routinely finds a significant correlation (see e.g. Fagereng et al., 2016; Baker, 2017;
Aydin, 2018). However the R-squared measures remain very low.

                                                  1
Comparing spending responses across these treatments yields several insights about
consumption behavior, which we demonstrate by implementing the treatments inside
both simple theoretical models and calibrated life-cycle precautionary savings models
with one or two assets.
    Our first three findings describe a pattern of MPC behavior that suggests indi-
viduals act as if access to disposable resources is limited. First, as in the existing
literature, we find a large amount of heterogeneity in consumption responses to small
unexpected gains. Most people do not change their spending when given a $500 gain,
but there is a set of people who spend a substantial fraction of the $500. Second, we
find evidence of sign asymmetry. Spending responses to losses are larger and more
widespread than spending responses to the same size gains.2 Third, we find that very
few respondents say that they would increase spending in response to news about a
future gain, even those respondents who indicate that they would increase spending
in response to an actual gain. These three findings are all consistent with a subset
of the population acting as if they do not have access to disposable resources.
    Our next two findings provide insights into the possible reasons why this group
might act in this way. Fourth, we find that respondents do not increase their spend-
ing when offered a one-year interest-free loan, suggesting that short-term credit con-
straints are not a key factor in explaining high MPCs. Fifth, whereas very few
respondents react to news about a future gain, the majority of respondents do react
to news about a future loss, including those who react strongly to an immediate
loss. This finding suggests that even low-wealth individuals are at least somewhat
forward-looking and is evidence against extreme forms of myopia.
    We then show that a calibrated two-asset life-cycle model, as in Kaplan and
Violante (2014), is broadly consistent with the magnitude and distribution of MPCs,
as well as with the five aforementioned findings from our hypothetical treatments.
But the model is not consistent with our sixth finding. We find that as we increase
the size of the windfall from $500 to $2,500 to $5,000, a larger fraction of respondents
say that they would increase their spending. We refer to this as a positive extensive-
margin size effect. Neither the two-asset model, nor any of the other baseline models,
are consistent with this finding because none deliver meaningful predictions on the
extensive margin, and all predict an intensive margin size effect in the opposite
direction. In order to generate a meaningful extensive margin of MPCs, we extend
the two-asset model by introducing a small “response cost” of modifying consumption
in response to the treatments. This cost is intended to capture, in a parsimonious
   2
     This asymmetric response to gains and losses is consistent with evidence from the the expiration
of the 2013 payroll tax cuts (see Zafar et al., 2013, Bracha and Cooper, 2014, and Sahm et al., 2015).

                                                  2
way, the effects of salience, inertia or cognitive costs of changing consumption plans.
We show that this modification improves the model vis-a-vis the MPC evidence, but
still cannot generate a positive extensive-margin size effect. We suggest behavioral
modifications that, when combined with the response cost, might improve the fit of
the model in this regard.
    One obvious explanation for why many households act as if their access to dis-
posable resources is limited, is that they in fact possess very little liquid wealth.
Indeed, this is the sole explanation in our calibrated models and almost all existing
models of consumption behavior.3 However, although we find a strong correlation
in our data between liquid wealth and MPCs out of losses, we do not find a signifi-
cant correlation between liquid wealth and MPCs out of gains. One possible reason
is that in reality, liquid wealth is an imperfect proxy for disposable resources. For
example, different households have different pre-committed expenditures, different
expense risk and different access to informal credit, and hence consider themselves
hand-to-mouth at different levels of liquid wealth. Another possible reason is that
some behavioral phenomenon, such as mental accounting, lead households to act as if
they are hand-to-mouth. In fact, Parker (2017) finds that spending responses to the
2008 stimulus payments are related with certain behavioral characteristics, such as
impatience (but not with measures of self-control or procrastination). However, we
are not aware of any existing single phenomenon that would lead high liquid wealth
households to respond in the ways that we observe: high MPCs out of current gains
and losses, low MPCs out of future gains, high MPCs out of future losses and low
MPCs out of an interest-free loan.
   The existing literature has followed one of two approaches to estimating MPCs.
One strand of the literature uses what Parker and Souleles (2017) label the “re-
vealed preference” approach, in which consumption is measured using data on actual
housing expenditures. These data come either from household surveys or financial
datasets—e.g. Consumer Expenditure Survey (Johnson et al., 2006), Kilts-Nielsen
Consumer Panel (Parker, 2017), or banks and other financial service providers (Gel-
man et al., 2014; Baker, 2017; Ganong and Noel, 2017; Aydin, 2018) —or by backing
out expenditures from administrative data on income and wealth (Fagereng et al.,
2016). The revealed preference approach uses these data to estimate MPCs either
by cleverly exploiting natural experiments that mimic unexpected changes in house-
hold budgets—e.g. fiscal stimulus payments (Parker et al., 2013), lottery winnings
(Fagereng et al., 2016), or mortgage modifications (Ganong and Noel, 2017)—or by
   3
    An important exception is Campbell and Hercowitz (2015) who propose a model in which some
households have liquid wealth that has been earmarked for a foreseen large future expenditure.

                                              3
extracting the transitory component of stochastic income fluctuations (Blundell et
al., 2008). Another set of studies uses what Parker and Souleles (2017) label the
“reported preference” approach, in which individuals are asked how their spending
would respond in hypothetical or actual scenarios. A large part of the reported pref-
erence literature elicits qualitative spending responses using survey questions that
follow Shapiro and Slemrod (2003). More recently, there has been a growing body of
work, including ours, that elicit quantitative spending responses (Jappelli and Pista-
ferri, 2014; Graziani et al., 2016; Christelis et al., 2017). Using strategically-designed
survey questions in conjunction with structural models has also been fruitfully ap-
plied to other questions related to household financial decisions (Ameriks et al., 2015,
2016).
    This paper sits firmly in the “reported preference” approach. Our data come
from a survey of 2,586 household heads from the NY Fed’s Survey of Consumer
Expectations, an online rotating panel of US household heads. We ask respondents
to report how they would adjust their spending over the next quarter in response to
receiving or losing dollar amounts ranging from $500 to $5,000, with the gain/loss
occurring either now or in the future, or coming from a loan. Each respondent
participates in two or more such treatments, allowing us to study within-person
differences in responses. Ideally, we would compare actual spending data under these
alternative scenarios rather than hypothetical spending data. The trade-off is that
by using reported preferences rather than a revealed preferences, we have flexibility
in designing treatments. We are not aware of any natural experiments that would
allow us to compare actual spending data across scenarios in a controlled way.
    Within the reported preference approach, our paper makes two main contribu-
tions. First, the variation that we generate across our scenarios is more extensive
than has been implemented to date. This is important since this enables our setup to
generate a much richer set of empirical results against which we can evaluate existing
theoretical models of consumption behavior. More specifically, while previous stud-
ies have considered the size and sign effect, we are not aware of any study that has
investigated response to news (about gains or losses) or loans. The closest paper to
ours, fielded contemporaneously, is Christelis et al. (2017) who also use hypothetical
scenarios (in a Dutch household survey) to study sign and size asymmetry. Our find-
ings on these points are qualitatively similar (which is reassuring, given differences in
the survey population, the design of the questions, and the size of the income shocks).
Second, we contribute to this literature by using a survey instrument that is more
precise, yet more flexible, than those that have been used in the existing literature.
We discuss the advantages of our survey in Section 2. These advantages include a

                                            4
relatively neutral wording of the question that does not prime respondents towards a
non-zero response, a two-stage set-up which allows respondents to first think about
whether they would change their spending at all and then by how much, an explicit
mention of the spending horizon, and the ability to report an MPC outside the range
of 0 to 1. We believe each of these features makes it easier for respondents to report
their true MPCs.
     An important underlying assumption when using reported preferences is that the
responses have information content for what households would actually do in response
to a (current or future) cash windfall or loan. Parker and Souleles (2017) provide a
comprehensive analysis of this issue. They compare reported responses to hypothet-
ical tax rebates with actual spending responses from past tax rebates and stimulus
payments, and broadly conclude that the two approaches yield similar estimates.4
In addition, Parker et al. (2013) added a similar question to Shapiro and Slemrod
(2003) to the 2008 Consumer Expenditure Survey and found that respondents who
said that they mostly spent their 2008 fiscal stimulus payment did in fact spend
more. Thus, the reported preference approach has fared quite well when compared
to the revealed approach, at least for current gains. Within the reported preference
approach, studies have found a close correspondence between the ex ante MPC (that
is, the MPC estimate based on how respondents say they will change their spending)
and the ex post MPC (that is, the estimate based on what respondents say about how
their spending changed) for one-time transfers (Shapiro and Slemrod, 2003; Sahm et
al., 2010). Bunn et al. (2017) compare responses to retrospective survey questions
(asking how spending adjusted in response to income being higher/lower than had
been expected) to those from a survey featuring hypothetical scenarios similar to
ours, and find that the sign asymmetry (which we also document) is present in both,
although average MPCs are slightly smaller in the hypothetical scenarios. Similarly,
for the payroll tax cut, Graziani et al. (2016) find that the ex-post reported MPC
tends to be somewhat higher than the ex-ante MPC. Beyond consumption responses
to income changes, other recent papers, mostly in the context of labor markets, have
shown that the reported approach yields preference estimates that are similar to

   4
     Parker and Souleles (2017) reach three main findings. First, reported spending is highly
informative about actual spending in the sense that those that say they would mostly spend,
do actually spend much more than those who say they would mostly save. Second, the average
MPC implied by the reported response is similar to the MPC from the actual response. Third,
for the reported responses, they find that MPCs are not correlated with liquid wealth, whereas
for the actual responses they are. Interestingly, we find that in the one treatment of our survey
that generates a large implied average MPC—the loss treatment—there is a strong correlation with
liquid wealth. Thus, survey questions are able to detect a liquid wealth effect for losses, but we also
do not find a correlation with liquid wealth for gains.

those from revealed choice (Mas and Pallais, 2017), and are predictive of real-world
choices (Wiswall and Zafar, 2018). There is a growing consensus that the reported
approach yields meaningful responses when the hypothetical scenarios presented to
respondents are realistic and relevant for them, as is the case for the scenarios that
we consider.
    A third important contribution of our paper, relative to the existing literature,
on reported preferences, is that we implement the hypothetical survey questions
inside calibrated consumption models. Most of our insights stem from comparing
the predictions of consumption theory with the elicited consumption responses, a
step which the existing literature has largely avoided.
    The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. Section 2 describes the
survey instrument and the various treatments. Section 3 presents the results from
the baseline gains treatment, and Section 4 analyzes the additional treatments (news,
losses, and loans). Implications for theory are discussed in Section 5, and the last
section concludes.


2        Data
2.1        NY Fed Survey of Consumer Expectations
   Our data come from four modules added to the Survey of Consumer Expectations
(SCE), which is a monthly survey fielded by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.
The SCE is an internet-based survey of a rotating panel of approximately 1,300 heads
of household from across the US. The goal of the survey is to elicit expectations
about a variety of economic variables, such as inflation and labor market conditions.
Respondents participate in the panel for up to twelve months, with a roughly equal
number rotating in and out of the panel each month. Respondents are invited to
participate in at least one survey each month.
    The survey is administered by the Demand Institute, a non-profit organization
jointly operated by The Conference Board and Nielsen. The sampling frame for the
SCE is based on that used for The Conference Board’s Consumer Confidence Survey
(CCS). Respondents to the CCS, itself based on a representative national sample
drawn from mailing addresses, are invited to join the SCE internet panel. Each
survey typically takes fifteen to twenty minutes to complete, and respondents receive
$15 for completing a survey. The response rate for first-time invitees hovers around
55 percent, and for repeat respondents is around 80 percent.5
    5
        See Armantier et al. (2016) for technical background information on the SCE, and www.

                                               6
    The four modules were added to the end of the monthly surveys in March 2016,
May 2016, January 2017 and March 2017. Repeat and active panelists (i.e., those
who were not participating in the SCE for the first time) were invited to participate
in the modules. Because of the panel nature of the SCE some respondents answered
multiple modules – those that were less than 12 months apart. In total we collected
9,061 responses to hypothetical spending questions from 2,586 panelists.6
    Demographic and financial characteristics of respondents in the sample align well
with corresponding characteristics of the US population. We report several of these
characteristics in Table 1, along with their population counterpart from the 2015
American Community Survey or the 2013 Survey of Consumer Finances. For exam-
ple, the average age of respondents in our sample is 50.4 years, of which 36% report
annual household income of less than $50,000. The corresponding numbers in the US
population are 51.1 years and 37%. 73% of respondents are homeowners, compared
to a homeownership rate of 59% in the ACS. 75% of our respondents are white and
non-Hispanic, compared to 69% of household heads in the ACS. One notable differ-
ence between our sample and the US population is in education. Households in our
sample are on average more highly educated than the overall US population—56% of
our respondents have at least a Bachelor’s degree, compared with 31% of household
heads in the ACS. We conjecture that this is partly due to differential internet access
and computer literacy across education groups.7

2.2     Survey Instrument
    Our baseline survey instrument asked respondents to report how they would
change their spending behavior in response to an unexpected gain in resources. Re-
spondents are first asked in what direction each of their spending, debt payments,
and savings would change in response to the windfall. Next, respondents who say
that they would change their (spending; debt payment; savings) are asked for the
magnitude of the change. For example, the survey instrument for the $500 gain is
as follows.
    Respondents are first asked:
      Now consider a hypothetical situation where you unexpectedly receive a one-time pay-
      ment of $500 today.

    6
      There were a total of 9,086 scenarios submitted to these panelists, with 25 non-responses
(corresponding to less than 0.3% of observations).
    7
      We conduct our analysis unweighted; however, weighting to make the sample representative
of the US population does not alter the qualitative patterns. This is illustrated in Appendix Table
A-1, which provides a weighted version of our summary Table 3.

       We would like to know whether this extra income would cause you to change your
       spending behavior in any way over the next 3 months.

       Please select only one
       • Over the next 3 months, I would spend/donate more than if I hadn’t received
       the $500
       • Over the next 3 months, I would spend/donate the same as if I hadn’t received
       the $500
       • Over the next 3 months, I would spend/donate less than if I hadn’t received the
       $500

       Please select only one
       • Over the next 3 months, I would pay off more debt (or borrow less) than if I
       hadn’t received the $500
       • Over the next 3 months, I would pay off the same amount of debt as if I hadn’t
       received the $500
       • Over the next 3 months, I would pay off less debt (or borrow more) than if I
       hadn’t received the $500

       Please select only one
       • Over the next 3 months, I would save more than if I hadn’t received the $500
       • Over the next 3 months, I would save the same as if I hadn’t received the $500
       • Over the next 3 months, I would save less than if I hadn’t received the $500



Respondents are then asked by how much they would change their behavior for each
category for which they do not select the middle option (spend/donate the same;
pay off the same amount of debt; save the same). For example, a respondent who
indicates that they would spend/donate more is asked the following question:

       You indicated that you would increase your spending/donations over the next 3
       months following the receipt of the $500 payment.
       How much more would you spend/donate than if you hadn’t received the $500?



The quantitative response to the increase or decrease in spending/donating forms
the basis of our estimates of the marginal propensity to consume (MPC).8 We refer
to this baseline treatment for eliciting MPCs as the GAIN treatment:

GAIN: MPC over 1 quarter out of a one-time unexpected receipt of $Y, with
   Y={500; 2,500; 5,000}

Our survey instrument differs from those used in the existing literature on hypothet-
ical consumption responses in several ways. The majority of this literature has based

   8
     Note that the survey question distinguishes between paying down debt and saving. While
paying down debt is a form of saving (and enters the same way in simple budget constraints),
consumers may think of paying down debt as distinct from saving. Therefore, consistent with the
approach used in the prior literature, we also make this distinction.

                                               9
their survey instrument on the categorical response wording of Shapiro and Slemrod
(2003), who focus on tax rebates. They ask respondents to choose between three uses
of their tax rebate: (i) mostly spend; (ii) mostly save; or (iii) mostly pay off debt.
Parker et al. (2013) added a Shapiro-Slemrod style question to the 2008 Consumer
Expenditure Survey and found that respondents who said that they mostly spent
their 2008 fiscal stimulus payment did in fact spend 75 cents more per dollar than
those who said they mostly saved their stimulus payment.
    More recently, the literature has started to employ survey questions that elicit di-
rect quantitative responses for spending changes. For example, Jappelli and Pistaferri
(2014), use the following question in the Survey of Household Income and Wealth
(SHIW): “Imagine you unexpectedly receive a reimbursement equal to the amount
your household earns in a month. How much of it would you save and how much
would you spend? Please give the percentage you would save and the percentage you
would spend.” 9 Whereas the Shapiro-Slemrod instrument asks a qualitative question
and hence requires additional assumptions to be informative about the level of MPCs,
the Japelli-Pistaferri (JP) instrument directly elicits a quantitative MPC. Similarly,
Graziani et al. (2016) use a quantitative instrument to elicit consumption responses
to the 2011 payroll tax cuts: “Please indicate what share of the extra income [from
the payroll tax cut] you are using or plan to use to save or invest, spend or donate,
and pay down debts.”
    Christelis et al. (2017) use the following question to measure quantitative re-
sponses to hypothetical gains in an online survey of Dutch households: “Imagine
you unexpectedly receive a one-time bonus from the government equal to the amount
of net income your household earns in (one-month / three months). In the next 12
months, how would you use this unexpected income transfer? ”, with the respondent
asked to allocate 100 points to saving; repaying debt; durable spending, and non-
durable spending. They employ a similar wording for hypothetical losses, which are
framed as one-time taxes. Finally, in a survey of British households, Bunn et al.
(2017) ask respondents about the retrospective quantitative change in spending in
response to unanticipated shocks to income over the past year. More specifically,
they first ask households whether their income differed from what they expected a
year ago, and if so, by how much. Next, they ask them how they adjusted their
spending over the previous year in response to this unexpected change in income.
   An advantage of eliciting a quantitative response is that it gives a direct mea-
sure of the individual MPC; this can then be aggregated up to yield the average
   9
    The SHIW is administered to a sample of Italian households. The translation of the survey
question from Italian to English is reproduced from Jappelli and Pistaferri (2014).

MPC, which is often the parameter of interest to policymakers. Although this elic-
itation approach may be more challenging for respondents to answer (as opposed
to qualitative questions), it provides a much richer set of evidence to compare with
theory.
     We believe that our survey instrument is more precise than those in the existing
literature. First, we explicitly state the size of the windfall, which we then vary,
allowing us to measure potential size effects. Second, we start by asking respondents
if they would change their spending at all, before asking the amount by which they
would change their spending. This allows a more precise estimate of zero MPCs
and does not prime respondents towards a non-zero response. We then ask only
those respondents who say that they would actually change their spending behavior
about how much they would spend. Third, our survey instrument is more explicit
than most in the existing literature about the time horizon over which we are asking
about spending responses (one quarter, in our case).10 This is important because
almost all economic models predict that any windfalls will ultimately be entirely
spent over the respondents’ remaining lifetime. So without explicitly stating a time
horizon, it is difficult to make any comparisons with theory. Fourth, our elicitation
strategy does not impose a household’s MPC to be between 0 and 1. We leave
open the possibility that an unexpected cash windfall may lead some respondents to
increase their consumption by a larger amount than the windfall. This could occur
if, for example, the respondent had been saving toward an expense and the windfall
leads them to be alter the timing of the expense, as would be predicted by the model
of Campbell and Hercowitz (2015).

2.3       Treatments
    Differences in the survey instrument aside, our study advances the literature by
also exposing respondents to a series of additional treatments beyond MPCs for
income windfalls. These treatments are designed to elicit aspects of consumption
behavior that are particularly useful for evaluating the predictions of theoretical
models of consumption. In addition to the GAIN treatment, we conducted the
following four treatments:

LOSS: MPC over 1 quarter out of a one-time unexpected loss of $500.

NEWS-GAIN: MPC over 1 quarter out of unexpected news about a one-time gain
   of $X, with X={500; 5,000}, 1 quarter from now.

  10
       Bunn et al. (2017) and Christelis et al. (2017) specify time horizons of one year.

Number of respondents given in square brackets. For Jan-17, half the sample got the $500 Gain
and $500 News-Loss blocks, and the other half got the $5,000 Gain and News-Gain blocks.



NEWS-LOSS: MPC over 1 quarter out of unexpected news about a one-time loss
   of $500 Z quarters, with Z={1, 8}, from now.

LOAN: MPC over 1 quarter out of an unexpected interest-free loan of $5,000 to be
   repaid 1 year from now.

In each module, we exposed respondents to two possible treatments. The months
in which the treatments were fielded are displayed in Table 2. For example, in
the May 2016 module, all respondents were exposed to the $5,000 GAIN treatment
and, in addition, were randomly assigned to either the $2,500 GAIN treatment or
the $5,000 LOAN treatment. The order of the treatments within each survey was
randomized. This design allows us to compare how the same respondent’s spending
behavior differs across alternative scenarios, thus providing a way to control for fixed
unobserved individual characteristics.

                                              12
    In addition, some treatments were fielded in multiple months. For example, as
shown in Table 2, the $5,000 GAIN treatment was fielded in March 2016, May 2016
and January 2017. This allows us to study whether the response distributions are
consistent over time. Moreover, the panel structure of the survey ensures that some
people appear in multiple surveys and, in some instances, in the same treatment in
different months. This allows us to investigate whether individual respondents report
stable spending responses. Finally, for some treatments we asked follow-up questions
regarding the timing of spending adjustments (within the one-quarter horizon) and
the composition of spending adjustments across different categories; these follow-up
questions are discussed further below. The full texts of the survey instruments for
each treatment are reproduced in Appendix A.
    Another important advantage of exogenously varying the treatments is that we
do not have to worry about (observable and unobservable) characteristics of the indi-
viduals confounding the effects across the different treatments. In observational data,
positive and negative shocks are not randomly distributed and are usually system-
atically related with individual characteristics. For example, Bunn et al. (2017) find
that households in their sample who experience positive shocks tend to be younger
and hold more liquid assets (than those who experience negative shocks). Then, the
extent to which a differential response to the positive and negative shocks is simply
due to differences in preferences and characteristics of the two subsamples is not
entirely clear. Likewise, the size of tax rebates usually tends to be a function of
household income or size, which makes it hard to disentangle the size effect from un-
derlying heterogeneity in characteristics and preferences of the different subsamples.
Our approach bypasses these issues.

2.4    Summary Findings
    Table 3 reports a summary of the MPCs implied by the responses to each treat-
ment. We include this summary here without discussion in order to provide the
reader with a concise overview of the findings. We will refer back to this table in the
following sections as we discuss each treatment in turn. For each treatment, the table
reports the total number of respondents (aggregated across multiple survey rounds
for treatments that were conducted in more than one survey), the average MPC,
the share of respondents with negative, zero and positive MPCs, and the average
and median MPC conditional on being positive. When reporting average MPCs, we
winsorize at the 2.5th and 97.5th percentiles.

2.5       Order Effects
    A potential concern with our survey design is that it may bias respondents toward
stating that they would not adjust their spending so they can avoid the follow-up
question of how much they would adjust their spending. If this were the case, we
would expect that for a given treatment, we should see more non-zero spending
responses if the treatment is shown to a respondent first rather than second. In
Table 4, we test for this formally. We regress indicators for whether a respondent
indicated they would change their spending (or increase their spending) in a given
treatment on treatment-date fixed effects and an indicator for whether the respondent
was exposed to this treatment first. We see that the estimated coefficients are close
to zero and not statistically significant.
    In addition, we can directly test for order effects by testing for the equality of
distributions of MPCs depending on whether respondents saw a treatment first or
second, for each treatment shown in Table 2. Out of the 14 treatments, there is 1
for which the null of equal distributions is rejected at p < 0.05, which is what one
would expect based on random chance.11

3     Baseline MPC Responses
    In this section we consider responses to the GAIN treatment, in which we elicit
the MPC out of a one time unexpected windfall of $500, $2500 or $5000. This
treatment has been examined in the existing literature, both through surveys and
choice data. In Section 4 we then compare the responses to the GAIN treatment
with the four additional treatments that have been less well-studied.

3.1     Responses to Gains
    The average reported quarterly MPC out of a $500 windfall is 8% (see Table 3).
This small average MPC masks a large degree of heterogeneity across respondents.
Three quarters of respondents say that they would not change their spending behav-
ior at all, and hence have an MPC of zero, and an additional 6% report that they
would reduce spending in response to the windfall. Only 19% of respondent say that
they would increase their spending, but these households plan to spend a substantial
fraction of the $500—the mean and median MPC conditional on a positive response
are 54% and 50%, respectively. A more detailed breakdown of the distribution of
MPCs is shown by the blue bars in Figure 1. For those respondents with a positive
MPC the distribution is fairly evenly dispersed, although there is some evidence of
bi-modality. Around 5% of households report that they would spend all of the $500
over the following quarter, while very few report spending more than 75% but less
than 100% of the payment.

treatment first and those who see it second are significantly different is the $5,000 GAIN treatment
in March 2016. The other treatment seen by these respondents was the $500 GAIN treatment.
The fact that in May 2016 we do not see similar order effects for the $5,000 GAIN treatment when
fielded together with the $2,500 GAIN treatment arguably makes it more likely that the difference
in March happened by chance.

                                                15
             Figure 1: Histogram of MPCs for different Gain scenarios

    Our average MPC is towards the lower end of the estimates found in the literature,
for both hypothetical and actual gains of around this size. However, existing studies,
like us, have found that majority of households respond little or not at all in response
to an income windfall, but that a small sub-group of households (in our case, around
one-fifth) spend a substantial fraction of the income windfall (see, for example, Bunn
et al., 2017, and Christelis et al., 2017).

3.2    Effect of Windfall Size
    As we increase the size of the windfall, a larger fraction of respondents say that
they would increase their spending, but on average say they would spend a smaller
fraction of the payment. For the $5,000 gain, 39% of respondents report a positive
MPC, compared with 27% for the $2,500 gain and 19% for the $500 gain. Conditional
on increasing spending, the median MPC is 30%, 40%, and 50% for the $5,000, $2,500
and $500 gains respectively. Overall the effect of the greater number of respondents
with positive MPC dominates so that the average MPC increases slightly, from 8%
to 11% to 14%, as the payment size increases.
    This size effect in reported MPCs can be seen in Figure 1 by comparing the blue
histogram ($500 windfall) with the green histogram ($2,500 windfall) and yellow
histogram ($5,000) windfall. As the size of the windfall increases, the smaller mass
of respondents with an MPC of zero is clearly evident, as is the larger mass of people
with small, positive MPCs. Table A-2 in the Appendix shows that the difference
in average MPCs (and the likelihood of reporting a positive MPC) across windfall

                                          16
amounts are statistically significant and remain so once we condition on respondent
fixed effects (for those that participate in more than one GAIN treatment) as well
as date-by-treatment-order fixed effects.
   In Section 5 we will show that this positive size effect, driven by the extensive
margin, is difficult to reconcile with most standard models of optimal consumption
behavior. Plausible explanations for why more people respond to larger windfalls in-
clude durables, salience, inattentiveness and cognitive costs of changing consumption
plans. We discuss these possibilities in more detail in Section 5.
    The size effect has not been studied much empirically, largely due to the fact
that such variations are usually not observed in natural settings. We are aware of
three other studies that investigate size effects, with little agreement. Bunn et al.
(2017) find that for positive realized income shocks, MPCs increase in the size of
the shock, in line with our results. Christelis et al. (2017) find similar overall MPC
distributions for hypothetical positive shocks corresponding to one month or three
months of income, though in line with our results, they find a smaller fraction of
respondents that say they would not change their spending when the shock is larger.
Fagereng et al. (2016), on the other hand, find that MPCs out of lottery winnings in
Norway decline in the size of the amount won, which is consistent with our findings
on the intensive margin (MPCs conditional on changing spending behavior), but not
on the extensive margin (fraction of respondents who indicate they would change
behavior).

3.3     Internal Consistency
    Since the $500 gain and $5,000 gain treatments were each fielded in multiple
survey waves, we can compare the distribution of responses across waves to examine
the stability of responses over time. This comparison is shown in Figure 2a for
the $500 windfall and Figure 2b for the $5,000 windfall. For both amounts, the
distributions are very similar across the different survey waves.12
   A subset of respondents were exposed to the same treatment in different survey
waves (between two and six months apart). This makes it possible to examine how
spending intentions in the same treatment vary within respondent over time. We
examine within-person persistence in the $500 GAIN and $5000 GAIN treatments.
Grouping respondents the into three MPC bins (≤ 0, (0, 1), ≥ 1) reveals that 70% are
  12
     For the two $500 gain MPC distributions (without binning values first as in the chart), a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test of equality of distributions gives a p-value of 0.95. Pairwise KS
tests for the $5000 gain MPC distributions yield p-values of 0.71, 0.43, and 0.15 (where the smallest
p-value is for the comparison between March 2016 and January 2017).

in the same bin across different waves. This fraction is similar across both treatments.
Since individual circumstances may change over time, we think that this degree of
persistence is not a cause for concern.

3.4       Composition and Timing of Spending
    We also asked respondents who indicated that they would adjust their spending
in response to the treatment about how much of that additional spending would come
from different spending categories.13 The exact wording of seven possible spending
categories can be found in Appendix A. We group the categories into non-durable
spending (“traveling/vacation/eating out/other leisure activities”; “donations/gifts”;
“general living expenses”), durables (“purchase of durables typically costing $1,000
or less”; “...typically costing more than $1,000”; “renovations or improvements to
my home’; “pay for college/education/training for members of my household”), and
“other”. Table 5 shows average shares of spending responses for individuals with non-
zero MPCs, in each of the three categories. For the three GAIN treatments, more of
the adjustment comes from non-durable spending. However, as the size of the gain
increases, the share that comes from durables increases (Christelis et al., 2017, find
a similar result). This suggests that adjustment costs or other non-convexities may
be important for understanding the positive size effect. We return to this possibility
in Section 5.4.
   In the May 2016 and January 2017 survey waves, we asked respondents who
indicated they would increase their spending about the timing of spending within
the following three month period. In May 2016, this was asked for all three treatments
($5000 GAIN, $2500 GAIN, $5000 LOAN) while in January 2017 it was asked for
  13
       Spending composition was asked in all waves except March 2017.

the $5000 GAIN treatment. The average shares of the spending increase happening
in different time intervals are shown in Table A-3 in Appendix B (pooling the two
$5000 gain waves). More than half of the increased spending (for those with MPC>0)
occurs in the first month.

3.5    Individual Characteristics
    Tables A-4 and A-5 in Appendix B show the average MPC and the share of re-
spondents with MPC>0 in each treatment for different subgroups of respondents,
defined by demographic characteristics (such as age or education), financial charac-
teristics (such as income or liquid wealth), or preference parameters (discount rates).
The definitions of the different groups are provided in Appendix A.2.
    Focusing on the gain treatments for now, we see little systematic heterogeneity
in spending responses. There is some evidence that those with lower discount factors
(as measured from an incentivized choice experiment) tend to spend more out of
their $5,000 windfall, although there are no significant differences for smaller gains.
Similarly individuals with inconsistent time preferences (that is, those who exhibit
a lower discount factor for choices that involve trade-offs today versus for choices
involving trade-offs in the future) have a higher average MPC out of a $5,000 windfall;

                                          19
for smaller gains, there are no differences. Also, those respondents who indicate in a
qualitative question that they tend to spend rather than save do indeed have higher
MPCs out of gains.14


4        Additional Treatments: News, Losses, Loans
   The distribution of spending responses to a small unanticipated income windfall
has been extensively studied in the existing literature. Relative to that literature, the
results discussed in the previous section add only a few small new insights (such as the
patterns of size asymmetry), while the main findings are consistent with prior studies.
Rather, the role of the findings from the GAIN treatment is to act as a point of
comparison for the more novel treatments that we discuss in this section. Unlike the
GAIN treatment, there are few, if any, examples of behavioral studies that explore the
NEWS, LOSS, NEWS-LOSS and LOAN treatments that we discuss in this section,
necessitating a survey approach for these alternative treatments. In Section 5 we
show that the responses to these additional treatments, and their comparison with
the GAIN treatment provide a much richer set of findings for alternative theoretical
models to confront.

4.1      News About Gains
    In the NEWS treatment, we ask respondents how they would change their spend-
ing behavior over the next three months if they were to learn about a one-time
windfall of either $500 or $5,000 that will be received in three months’ time (see
Appendix A for the exact wording of the survey instrument). In order to under-
take within-person comparisons, these questions were asked only of respondents who
also were exposed to the GAIN treatment of the same amount. A summary of our
findings is that respondents do not react to news about a future windfall—even
those respondents who say that they would react to the windfall if it were received
immediately.
    For the $500 news treatment, the average MPC is 0% and for the $5,000 treat-
ment, the average MPC is only 4% (Table 3).15 Moreover, 86% (81%) of respondents
in the $500 ($5,000) treatment explicitly state that they would not change their
    14
      The question is very similar to one in Parker (2017), who also finds that those who indicate
that they are the “type of people who spend and enjoy today” have higher MPCs out of lump-sum
payments.
   15
      The zero average MPC for the $500 gain arises because a small fraction of respondents report
small negative MPCs and small fraction report small positive MPCs, and these average to zero.
See Table 3.

Figure 3: Spending response to news about future gains vs. response to gains today


spending over the quarter leading up to the payment in any way at all. Only 6%
(14%) of respondents say they would increase spending in response to the news, com-
pared with 19% (39%) for the immediate payment. The differences in these MPC
distributions between the GAIN treatment (blue histograms) and NEWS treatment
(green histograms) is displayed in Figures 3a and 3b. In both figures the additional
mass of respondents with a MPC of zero, and the much smaller fraction with a pos-
itive MPC, in the green histograms compared with the blue histograms, is clearly
evident.
   We can find even stronger evidence for the absence of a spending response to the
news of a future windfall by examining the MPCs in the NEWS treatment for the
subset of households that say that they would indeed increase their spending in the
GAIN treatment. Focusing on the $5,000 windfall (where this subset is larger—195
out of 595 respondents), Figure 3d displays a histogram of the MPC for this subset.
The figure shows that the majority (nearly 70%) of respondents who would react to


                                            21
an instantaneous windfall, would not react to a windfall in three months’ time. And
for those who do react, their spending response is typically much smaller than for
the instantaneous windfall.
    These findings are consistent with existing studies looking at the actual response
to tax rebates, such as Johnson, Parker and Souleles (2006). The identification
strategy in Johnson et al. exploits randomness in the timing of when households
received their tax rebates, among a set of households who receive the rebate at
some point during the observation period. As explained in Kaplan and Violante
(2014), under reasonable assumptions about when households learned about their
tax rebates, the estimated coefficients in the regression of consumption growth on
the rebate received, should be interpreted as measuring the difference between the
MPC out of a surprise tax rebate and an MPC out of an anticipated rebate, similarly
to the difference between our GAIN and NEWS-GAIN treatments. The average
coefficients of 20%-30% reported by Johnson et al. are thus indicative of a large
difference between these two treatments. The analysis of consumption responses
to different mortgage modification programs by Ganong and Noel (2017) is also
consistent with the lack of a news effect on spending, although they study much
larger amounts over a much longer time period than in our treatment.

4.2       Losses
    We investigate the importance of sign asymmetry through a LOSS treatment, in
which respondents were asked how they would change their spending in the event
of an immediate unexpected loss of $500. We find that respondents are significantly
more likely to react to a $500 loss than to a $500 gain, with an average MPC of 30%
compared with with an average MPC of 8% for a $500 gain. The exact wording of
the survey instrument can be found in Appendix A.
    This sign asymmetry in the MPC is present on both the intensive and extensive
margins. Whereas only 19% of respondents said they would increase spending under
the GAIN treatment, 49% of respondents say they would decrease spending under
the LOSS treatment.16 Conditional on being positive, the median MPC is 60% for
the loss compared with 50% for the gain. Figure 4a shows how the distribution of
MPCs under the $500 LOSS treatment compares with the distribution under the
GAIN treatment. The MPC distribution for the LOSS treatment (green histogram)
is strongly suggestive of bi-modality—nearly 20% of respondents say that they would
fully absorb the loss of $500 by reducing current spending. This sign asymmetry has

  16
       In the LOSS treatment, a decrease in spending corresponds to a positive MPC.

also been documented by a relatively recent set of papers (Zafar et al., 2013; Sahm
et al., 2015; Bracha and Cooper, 2014; Bunn et al., 2017; Christelis et al., 2017).
    Because of the high average MPC and the bi-modality in responses, the LOSS
treatment is a useful setting to compare the observable characteristics of individuals
with high MPCs and low MPCs. As noted earlier, in Tables A-4 and A-5 in the
Appendix we report how average MPCs for each treatment differ by many individual
characteristics that one might a priori expect to be correlated with MPCs. Of these,
a number of variables that proxy for being financially constrained (income, liquid
assets, credit score) show a strong correlation with the MPC in the LOSS treatment.
Figure 4b shows how the fraction of respondents with a positive MPC, and the
average MPC, differ across liquid wealth categories (the cut-offs are chosen so that
there are roughly the same number of respondents in each bin: 32%, 24%, 28% and
16% respectively). Both the fraction who say they would respond and the average
MPC decline sharply with liquid wealth. Among respondents with less than $5,000
in liquid wealth, nearly 70% would reduce their spending, with an average MPC of
38%, whereas among respondents with more than $250,000 in liquid wealth, around
25% would reduce their spending, with an average MPC of around 17%.
   The sign asymmetry of the average MPC also masks important heterogeneity in
the extent and direction of sign asymmetry at the individual level. In Figure 5 we
report the distribution of the difference in MPCs between the LOSS treatment and
the GAIN treatment, separately for two groups of individuals – those who report
a zero (or negative) MPC in the GAIN treatment (blue histogram), and those who
report a positive MPC in the GAIN treatment. Of those respondents who do not
react to the $500 windfall, Figure 5 shows that around half also do not react to the
$500 loss. The remaining half do say that they would cut spending if faced with

                                         23
      Figure 5: Distribution of difference between MPCs out of losses and gains


a $500 loss, resulting in a larger average MPC for losses than gains. On the other
hand, for those respondents who do react to the $500 windfall, Figure 5 shows that
more than half of them react less to the loss than the gain; in fact, 39% would not
cut their spending at all in response to the loss (not shown in the figure). However,
since the latter group is much smaller than the former group (21% versus 79% of
the sample that responds to these two treatments), the average MPC in the LOSS
treatment is significantly larger than the MPC in the GAIN treatment.
   What might explain this pattern of sign asymmetry? Recall that whereas the
heterogeneity in MPCs in the LOSS treatment appears to be correlated with liquid
wealth, there is much less evidence for such a correlation in the GAIN treatment.
Since many of the households who react to the $500 gain do indeed have liquid
wealth, it might not be surprising that they are able to smooth out the effect of
the $500 loss. Why they then have a high MPC out of a windfall gain is an open
question, and one we return to in Section 5.

4.3     News About Losses
    The NEWS-LOSS treatment asks respondents how they would alter their spend-
ing behavior over the following three months if they were to immediately learn that
they will suffer a $500 loss at a specified future date. Respondents are randomly
assigned to two groups, one for which the loss is to occur in three months’ time,
the other for which the loss is to occur in two years’ time. To allow within-person
comparisons, all respondents exposed to the NEWS-LOSS treatment in March 2017
are also exposed to the LOSS treatment.
   Figure 6a shows the distribution of spending responses to a $500 loss at differ-
ent horizons. The response to the LOSS and 3 month NEWS-LOSS treatments are

almost identical—the MPC distribution for a loss occurring in 3 months time is essen-
tially the same as the distribution for an immediate loss. This lies in stark contrast
to the comparison of the GAIN and NEWS-GAIN treatments in Section 4.1, where
we found much smaller responses to news about a future windfall than to an imme-
diate windfall. The implication of this finding is that even though many respondents
say they would not smooth an immediate $500 loss (suggesting a high MPC), they
are willing to start preparing for a future loss of income by cutting spending today.
Figure 6b shows the spending response to the NEWS-LOSS treatment for the subset
of respondents who have a positive MPC in the LOSS treatment. The similarity of
the $500 NEWS-LOSS distribution with the MPC distribution for an immediate loss
is evidence against the idea that high MPCs are driven by myopia, or even that that
high MPCs are due to low liquid wealth which in turn is driven by myopia. Rather
these findings suggest an element of rational, forward-looking behavior among indi-
viduals with high propensities to consume—they are willing to cut contemporaneous
consumption in order to smooth out the effects of future anticipated losses.
    Figure 6a also shows the distribution of MPCs out of an anticipated loss 2 years
in the future. The MPC for a loss that far out is smaller than the MPC for a loss in
three months’ time, but even in this treatment almost one-third of people respond.
Moreover, Figure 6b shows that around half of the households who say that they
would cut consumption when faced with an immediate loss, also cut consumption
in response to a loss in 2 years’ time, albeit by a smaller amount. That so many
high MPC households react to an anticipated loss 2 years in advance also implies
that people are forward looking and that myopia alone cannot explain patterns of
spending responses. In fact, 60% (32%) of respondents who cut spending in the


                                              25
Figure 7: Response to Loan: all respondents and the subset who have MPC>0 for
$5000 Gain


LOSS treatment report that they would cut spending by the same amount or more
in the 3 months (2 year) NEWS-LOSS treatment.17

4.4    Loans
   Binding borrowing constraints are often cited as a possible explanation for why
some individuals have high MPCs out of small transitory gains and losses. To ex-
amine whether a loosening of borrowing constraints might have a large impact on
MPCs, we included a LOAN treatment in the survey. In this treatment, respondents
were asked how they would change their spending if offered an interest-free $5,000
loan to be repaid in one years’s time. The distribution of MPCs for this treatment are
displayed in Figure 7. The blue histogram shows that respondents react very little to
the offer of a loan. Around 80% of respondents say that they would not change their
spending at all, over 10% say that they would reduce spending (suggesting that they
did not fully understand the concept of an interest free loan, or are worried about
their ability to refrain from spending part of the loan in the time until repayment is
due) and only 8% of respondents say that they would increase spending.
    The green histogram in Figure 7 shows the MPC distribution for the LOAN
treatment for the 36% of respondents who had a positive MPC in the $5,000 GAIN
treatment (which was the other treatment these respondents were asked about).
Among these respondents, the average MPC for the $5,000 windfall was 0.42, yet
  17
   Among households that have an MPC≥ 1 in the LOSS treatment, 58% (34%) also have an
MPC≥ 1 when the loss occurs 3 months (2 years) in the future.

                                         26
when offered an interest-free loan for the same amount, nearly 80% of this group said
that they would not change their spending at all, and the average MPC was only
0.04. That individuals who are known to have a large MPC out of an unanticipated
windfall also have a zero MPC out of an interest free loan for the same amount is
strong evidence that short-term borrowing constraints (shorter than the duration of
the loan) are not a key reason for their high MPC. This does not rule out that longer-
term borrowing constraints are important, but it is suggestive that high MPCs are
associated with persistent low levels of disposable resources (i.e. longer than one
year) rather than temporarily low levels.18

4.5      Takeaways
    Before turning to theory, it is useful to summarize what we see as the broad qual-
itative takeaways from our survey treatments, with which we will confront existing
theories. We will focus on six general findings:

    1. Heterogeneity: Most people do not respond to gains, but there is a set of people
       who respond substantially.

    2. Size effect: For bigger amounts, more people respond, i.e. a bigger average
       response driven by the extensive margin.

    3. Sign asymmetry: More people respond, and by bigger amounts, to losses than
       to gains. Response to losses are correlated with liquid assets.

    4. No response to news: People do not respond to news about future gains, even
       those with large responses to actual gains.

    5. Response to news about losses: People do respond to news about future losses.
       Of those that respond to a loss, about half of them respond even when the loss
       is 2 years in the future.

    6. No response to loans: People do not respond to loans, even those who do
       respond to gains.


5        Implications for Theory
   What does economic theory predict for these treatments? In this section we
view the MPCs for each treatment through the lens of alternative models. We
    18
     In fact, in a trial at a large European retail bank where credit lines were randomly expanded,
Aydin (2018) finds a MPC out of credit of about 0.20 after three months. One way to reconcile this
with our findings is that the credit line expansions in his data had indefinite duration.

                                                27
start by formally describing each treatment in a way that is amenable to theoretical
and quantitative analysis. We then use the broad findings from Section 4.5 that
summarize the survey results to evaluate a series of models. We start with the
two simplest models of consumption behavior—the polar extremes of rule-of-thumb
and permanent income behavior. We then consider richer models that incorporate
precautionary savings, borrowing constraints, a life-cycle and assets with different
degrees of liquidity. We end with a discussion of how various behavioral phenomena
might further improve these models’ ability to match the survey response data.

5.1    Definition of the Treatments
   To organize ideas, it is useful to write an individual’s budget constraint as

                            cit + sit = xit
                               xi,t+1 = yi,t+1 + R (sit ) sit ,

where xit is cash on hand at the beginning of period t, cit is the amount spent during
period t and sit is the amount saved in period t. We assume that interest is paid
at the end of the period and that income yi,t+1 is received at the beginning of the
following period. Period t + 1 cash-on-hand is thus given by period t + 1 income plus
savings from period t with accumulated interest. We allow the gross interest rate
R to depend on the amount saved sit to reflect the possibility that individuals face
different interest rates on savings and borrowing. Consistent with the time horizon
in our survey questions, we think of each time period as representing one quarter.
  With this budget constraint, we can formally describe the five treatments. In the
GAIN and LOSS treatments, the budget constraint unexpectedly becomes

                            cit + sit = xit + ∆
                               xi,t+1 = yi,t+1 + R (sit ) sit ,

with ∆ > 0 in GAIN and ∆ < 0 in LOSS. In the NEWS-GAIN and NEWS-LOSS
treatments, the budget constraint unexpectedly becomes

                          cit + sit = xit
                            xi,t+1 = yi,t+1 + R (sit ) sit + ∆,

with ∆ > 0 in NEWS-GAIN and ∆ < 0 in NEWS-LOSS. In the LOAN treatment,



                                            28
the budget constraint at time t unexpectedly becomes

                                  cit + sit = xit + ∆

and the budget constraint at time t + 4 unexpectedly becomes

                         xi,t+4 = yi,t+4 + R (si,t+3 ) sit+3 − ∆.


   To ease notation, we label the treatments as follows: GAIN (G) , LOSS (L),
NEWS-GAIN (N G), NEWS-LOSS (N L), and LOAN (LN ). For each treatment
T ∈ {G, L, N G, N L, LN }, we then define the MPC for an amount ∆ as

                                               c∆
                                                it − cit
                                  M P CitT =             ,
                                                   ∆

where c∆it is consumption under the treatment and cit is consumption in the absence
of the treatment.

5.2    Simple Benchmark Models
   Before advancing to quantitatively plausible consumption-savings models, it is
useful to clarify the predictions of three simple benchmark models of consumption
behavior.

Rule-of-thumb consumers Rule-of-thumb consumers consume all of their dis-
posable income in every period. Hence they set cit = xit and sit = 0. This yields the
following MPCs

                          M P C G = M P C L = M P C LN = 1
                                   M P CNG = M P CNL = 0

Rule-of-thumb behavior is thus not consistent with the substantial fraction of re-
spondents who report not changing their consumption behavior in the GAIN and
LOAN treatments, nor does it generate a size effect or sign asymmetry. Moreover,
rule-of-thumb behavior is not consistent with the NEWS-LOSS responses, which sug-
gest that people are at least somewhat forward looking, in contrast with the extreme
myopia of rule–of-thumb consumers.

PIH consumers Strict permanent income consumers have quadratic utility, face
a fixed gross interest rate R = 1 + r that is equal to the inverse of the discount rate,
and face no constraints on borrowing other than a No-Ponzi condition that imposes

                                           29
that they cannot die in debt. For such a household the optimal consumption policy
is                                  "        ∞
                                                           #
                              R−1           X
                        cit =         xit +     R−j Et yt+j .
                               R            j=1

This gives the following MPCs
                                                r
                       M P CL = M P CG =            ≈0
                                              1+r
                                                  r
                    M P CNL = M P CNG       =          ≈0
                                              (1 + r)2
                                                r        r
                                 M P C LN   =       −        ≈ 0,
                                              1 + r (1 + r)5

where the approximations hold for low interest rates r ≈ 0, which is true for the types
of assets typically held for short-term consumption smoothing (e.g. cash, checking
accounts). The strict PIH thus implies that households will have small responses in
both the LOSS and GAIN treatments, and will not generate sign asymmetry nor a
size effect. One of the starkest predictions of the PIH model is that the MPC out
of gains should be essentially identical to the MPC out of news about future gains
(with the only difference being the negligible effect of discounting). This prediction is
not consistent with the finding from Section 4.1 that even among those respondents
who reported substantial MPCs in the GAIN treatment, most reported low or zero
MPCs in the NEWS-GAIN treatment.

Spender-saver model The spender-saver model is one in which the population is
comprised of two groups of individuals – one group of rule-of-thumb consumers (the
spenders), and another group of permanent income consumers (the savers) (Campbell
and Mankiw, 1989). Assuming that a fraction α of the population are spenders and
the remaining 1 − α are savers, and that the interest rate r ≈ 0 then the MPCs for
each of the five treatments are

                          M P C G = M P C L = M P C LN = α
                                   M P C N G = M P C N L = 0.

The spender-saver model is thus able to generate large average MPCs, that are
heterogeneous across individuals, as well as an average MPC out of news about
future gains that is smaller than the MPC out of the actual gain. However, the
model inherits from the rule-of-thumb and permanent income models the inability
to generate meaningful sign asymmetry or size effects. Moreover the spender-saver
model predicts no response to the NEWS-LOSS treatment, and predicts the same

                                            30
size response to the LOAN treatment as to the GAIN and LOSS treatments. Both
of these latter features are inconsistent with the survey responses.

5.3     Precautionary Savings Models
     Modern workhorse models for understanding consumption behavior feature pre-
cautionary motives, due to either an occasionally binding borrowing constraint or the
convexity of marginal utility. We start by examining an infinite-horizon precautionary-
savings model with IID income risk, in which it is possible to develop several sharp
theoretical predictions. We then examine the quantitative predictions of realistically
calibrated life-cycle precautionary-savings models. With the exception of the size
effect on the extensive margin of consumption responses, we find that a two-asset
life-cycle model as in Kaplan and Violante (2014) can account for the observed MPC
treatments. In Section 5.4, we then discuss how simple behavioral modifications to
this model, in the spirit of salience or cognitive costs of changing consumption plans,
can help reconcile the model with the evidence on the size effect.

5.3.1   Theoretical Predictions: Infinite-Horizon Model
   Consider the following consumption-savings problem, expressed in recursive form

                         V (x) = max u (c) + βE [V (x0 , y 0 )]
                                   c,s

                               subject to
                          c+s=x
                             x0 = Rs + y 0
                             s≥0

The budget constraints are the same as previously described, except for the addition
of the borrowing constraint s ≥ 0. We assume that income y follows an IID process
and that the individual has an increasing and convex utility function u (c) with
positive third derivative. The solution to this problem implies a value function V (x)
and an associated consumption policy function c (x).
    Under these conditions, both the value and policy functions are well-known to be
strictly concave (see e.g. Carroll and Kimball, 1996; Carroll, 1997). Strict concavity
of the consumption function implies that

                                 M P C L > M P C G,

meaning that the consumption response to a windfall of a given size is bigger for a

                                             31
loss than a gain, which is qualitatively consistent with the sign asymmetry reported
in Section 4.2. But concavity also implies a negative size effect: the MPC in the
GAIN treatment is smaller for larger windfalls. This is in contrast with the positive
size effect reported in Section 3.2.
   As the level of an individual’s wealth increases, both the sign and size asymme-
try in MPCs get weaker. In fact, one can show (see e.g. Benhabib et al., 2011)
that for Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) utility functions, as x → ∞, the
consumption function approaches the linear function,
                                        h        1
                                                      i
                                 c (x) = R (βR)− γ − 1 x,

where γ is the coefficient of relative risk aversion. Thus for individuals with suffi-
ciently high levels of wealth, there is neither any sign asymmetry nor a size effect.
Moreover, when either βR is close to 1 or γ is close to 1, the M P C is approximately
equal to β −1 − 1, as in the PIH. Thus both M P C L and M P C G are negligibly small.
   In practice, this high wealth approximation of the consumption function tends to
hold well except for individuals who are on, or very close to, the borrowing constraint
x = 0.19 For individuals who are borrowing constrained, the consumption function
takes the simple form c (y) = y. It follows that c (y − ∆) = y − ∆ because if the
borrowing constraint is binding at x = y then it will also bind at x = y − ∆.
Hence borrowing constrained individuals respond to the LOSS treatment by cutting
consumption by the amount of the loss, i.e. M P C L = 1. Whether M P C G is also
equal to 1 depends on whether the borrowing constraint is also binding at the slightly
higher level of wealth x = y + ∆, which is less likely the larger is the size of ∆. This
means that a borrowing constrained agent has M P C G = 1 for small windfalls and
M P C G < 1 for larger windfalls.
    The upshot of these results is that in terms of the simple GAIN and LOSS treat-
ment, the simplest infinite-horizon precautionary savings model delivers MPCs that
are qualitatively very similar to the even simpler spender-saver model. There is
one group of individuals who have M P C G = M P C L = 1 and another who have
M P C G = M P C L ≈ 0. The key difference between the models is that in the precau-
tionary savings model, the identity of the individuals in each group is endogenous
and time-varying, whereas in the spender-saver model it is fixed exogenously.
  19
     With sufficiently large transitory income risk, it is possible to generate consumption func-
tions with substantial concavity (and hence high MPCs) even at moderate levels of liquid wealth.
However, typically there are very few households at this part of the wealth domain in the ergodic
distribution, since optimal savings decisions imply that households desire to save themselves away
from the region where the consumption function is very concave.

                                               32
    We can also analyze the NEWS treatment separately for constrained and uncon-
strained agents. For unconstrained agents, the first-order condition for consumption
is
                      u0 (c) = βRE [V 0 (R (x − c) + ∆ + y 0 )] ,

where the ∆ on the right-hand side reflects the future windfall at time t + 1 that is
learned about at time t. For small ∆, it is straightforward to show that the MPC
out of news and the MPC out of an actual gains or losses are related by

                                  M P C N G = R−1 M P C G
                                  M P C N L = R−1 M P C L .

The MPC in the NEWS-GAIN treatment is less than the MPC in the GAIN treat-
ment by a factor R and thus, for high and medium wealth individuals the MPCs in
these two treatments are similar.20 For constrained individuals, whose consumption
function is c (x) = x, the MPC in the NEWS-GAIN treatment is 0, and thus for low
wealth individuals the MPCs in the GAIN and NEWS-GAIN treatments can be very
different.
    The gap M P C G − M P C N G is thus informative about whether an individual is
hand-to-mouth (i.e. has the consumption function c (x) = x), since in this frame-
work only hand-to-mouth agents exhibit a large difference between these two MPCs.
The survey responses in Section 4.1 suggest that there are a substantial number of
individuals for whom M P C G − M P C N G is far from zero and hence may be hand-to-
mouth. On the other hand, the informativeness of the corresponding gap for losses,
M P C L −M P C N L is more ambiguous. Constrained individuals have a large MPC out
of the immediate loss but may or may not have a large MPC out of the news about a
future loss, depending on the size of the multiplier on their borrowing constraint. We
thus return to the NEWS-LOSS treatment in the context of the calibrated life-cycle
model below.
    In the context of the precautionary savings model with borrowing constraints, the
LOAN treatment is informative about whether individuals are currently constrained
and, if so, for how long they expect to be constrained. For unconstrained individuals
with sufficient wealth that there is a low probability of still being constrained a year
later, the loan has a negligible effect on their inter-temporal budget constraint, and
  20
     Differentiating with respect to ∆ and evaluating at ∆ = 0 defines the MPC out of news
implicitly as u00 (c) ∂∆
                      ∂c
                           = βRE [V 00 (R (x − c) + y 0 )]. Differentiating with respect to x and
evaluating at ∆ = 0 defines the MPC out of an immediate gain implicitly as u00 (c) ∂∆       ∂c
                                                                                                =
   2      00             0
βR E [V (R (x − c) + y )]. Taking the ratio yields the result.

                                               33
hence M P C LN ≈ 0.21 For individuals who are currently borrowing constrained but
expect to be unconstrained in the near future, the MPC in the LOAN treatment is
similar to the MPC from the GAIN treatment, i.e. M P C LN ≈ M P C G . However,
for individuals who are constrained and expect to remain constrained for longer than
the duration of the loan, the MPC in the LOAN treatment is approximately zero.
In Section 4.4 we reported that almost no respondents indicated that they would
increase spending when offered a one-year interest free loan, even those respondents
who had large MPCs in the GAIN treatment and small MPCs in the NEWS-GAIN
treatment. Viewed through the lens of the precautionary savings model, these re-
sponses are consistent with the presence of hand-to-mouth individuals who expect
to remain in a low wealth state for a substantial period of time.

5.3.2    Quantitative Predictions: Life-cycle Model
    The simple precautionary savings model described above lacks most of the fea-
tures that existing work has shown are important for generating quantitatively real-
istic consumption behavior (see Kaplan and Violante (2010, 2014); henceforth KV10
and KV14). In this section we use a version of the life-cycle model of KV14 to assess
the predictions of one-asset and two-asset life-cycle precautionary savings models
for the five treatments. Appendix C contains a full description of both models and
provides further details on the calibration, including plots of mean life-cycle profiles
for income, consumption and wealth. We describe only the essential features in the
main text.
    In both models, the model period is one quarter and households live for T work +
T ret = 58 × 4 periods. During the first T work = 38 × 4 periods, households face
a stochastic income process that consists of a deterministic age profile and AR(1)
income shocks. During the last T ret = 20 × 4 periods households receive social
security payments. Our calibration of the income process, and social security system
are taken from KV14, and our calibration of the initial wealth distribution of new-
born households is taken from KV10.22 In the one-asset model households have
CRRA preferences with a risk aversion coefficient of 2 and can save, but not borrow,
  21
     The inter-temporal budget constraint is affected only to the extent that β < 1.
  22
     Kaplan and Violante (2014) have permanent shocks, whereas we have AR(1) shocks with an
autoregressive parameter of 0.97. We choose the size of the innovations to generate the same
profile of variance of log labor income over the life-cycle. Our model does not include transitory
shocks because there is no consensus on how to calibrate these in a quarterly model. We have
experimented with transitory shocks of different sizes and provided that they are not too big,
none of our substantive findings are affected. With very large, high-frequency, transitory shocks,
households have an incentive to hold substantial liquid assets for precautionary reasons, and the
model generates far fewer hand-to-mouth households than is suggested by US data. See Kaplan
and Violante (2014) for further discussion.

in a single risk-free asset.
    The average MPC for each of the five treatments in the one-asset model are
displayed in the columns (1) and (2) of Table 6. Column (1) shows a version of
the model with r = 0% p.a. (corresponding to the interest rate on liquid assets in
the two-asset model) and column (2) shows a version of the model with r = 5%
p.a., (corresponding to the interest rate on illiquid assets in the two-asset model).
The discount factor β is calibrated in each version so that mean assets are equal
to 3.5 times average annual labor income, which is approximately the level of mean
household net worth in the United States (see KV14). Both versions are qualitatively
consistent with many aspects of our survey results. They generate: the correct
pattern of sign asymmetry; larger MPCs out of immediate gains than news about
future gains; larger MPCs out of news about future losses than news about future
gains; and a negligible MPC out of the loan. However, the models predict size
effects in the wrong direction and, more importantly, the quantitative size of MPCs
is substantially smaller than is suggested by the survey responses (e.g., the average
MPC for a $500 loss is 0.1 in the model and 0.3 in our survey).
    The key reason why the one-asset model produces such small average MPCs is
that it generates very few hand-to-mouth households. Table 7 displays the average
level of wealth and the fraction of hand-to-mouth households in each model. In

the one-asset models calibrated to average net worth, less than 4% of households
are hand-to-mouth, whereas Kaplan et al. (2014) report that up to one-third of
households in United States can be characterized as hand-to-mouth.
    A simple and popular way to modify the one-asset model so that it produces more
low wealth households is to calibrate the discount factor β to match the average level
of liquid wealth in the data, rather than the average level of total wealth. Column
(3) of Table 6 displays the average MPCs in each of the five treatments when we
set r = 0% and choose β so that average wealth is 0.05 times average labor income,
which is the mean level of liquid wealth in the two-asset model described below.
The MPCs in this liquid wealth calibration are much larger than in the net worth
calibration and display similar patterns across treatments.
    However, there are several drawbacks to the one-asset model with low liquid
wealth. First, the MPCs are much larger than suggested by the survey responses
(e.g., the average MPC for a $500 loss is 0.9 in the model and 0.3 in our survey),
which is a consequence of the implausibly large fraction of hand-to-mouth households.
Second, the very low discount factor required to generate such a low level of savings
(β = 0.83 annual) causes the model to generate a substantial MPC in the LOAN
treatment. Third, many would consider it unsatisfactory to calibrate a theory of
consumption responses based on savings behavior by selectively ignoring the vast
majority of observed savings.

    To overcome these shortcomings, KV14 advocate the use of a two-asset precau-
tionary savings model in which households hold both liquid and illiquid assets. The
two-asset model that we consider is a simplified version of that in KV14. In the
model, households can save in a liquid asset b that pays an interest rate rb = 0% or
an illiquid asset a that pays an annual interest rate ra = 5%. The asset is illiquid
in the sense that in order to move funds between the liquid and illiquid accounts,
households must pay a fixed cost κ. Illiquid assets also generate a flow of housing
services, d = ζa which enters utility according to the function
                                                     1−γ
                                             cφ d1−φ      −1
                                  u (c, d) =                 ,
                                                  1−γ

with the weight on housing services in consumption set to 1 − φ = 0.15. As with the
one-asset model we choose the discount factor so that mean total assets are equal to
3.5 times average annual labor income.
    Relative to the one-asset model, the two-asset model then has two additional
parameters (κ, ζ). We choose these parameters to generate a fraction of poor hand-
to-mouth households (households with zero net worth) and wealthy hand-to-mouth
households (households with zero liquid assets but positive illiquid assets) that is
broadly consistent with the evidence reported in Kaplan et al. (2014). Setting the
fixed cost κ = $2, 000 and the service flow from housing ζ = 3% generates 15%
(13%) of all (working-age) households as poor hand-to-mouth and 38% (26%) of
all (working-age) households as wealthy hand-to-mouth. Mean liquid asset holdings
are $2, 100, which is equivalent to about 20% of mean quarterly labor income (see
Table 7).
    The average MPCs for each of the five treatments in the two-asset model are
displayed in column (4) of Table 6. The two-asset is broadly consistent with many
aspects of the survey response data. The two-asset model generates larger MPCs
in the GAIN and LOSS treatments than the one-asset model, because of the larger
fraction of hand-to-mouth households. Since many of these additional hand-to-mouth
households are wealthy hand-to-mouth, they desire to smooth consumption over
longer horizons and hence they respond to the 3 month NEWS-LOSS treatment, as
in the data.23 Unlike in the low-wealth calibration of the one-asset model, the large
fraction of hand-to-mouth households does not arise because of extreme impatience,
  23
     The model does not generate large MPCs out of anticipated losses two years out, while in
the survey a surprisingly large number of respondents express a desire to cut their spending now
rather than in the future. This finding may be related to other evidence showing that, in contrast
to standard models of discounting, people tend to prefer incurring losses now rather than later (see
e.g. Loewenstein and Prelec, 1991).

                                                37
which explains why the two-asset model generates a low MPC out of the LOAN
treatment whereas the low-wealth one asset model generates a substantial response
in the LOAN treatment.

5.4    Durables, Salience, and Behavioral Phenomena
    An important aspect of the survey responses that neither the one-asset nor two-
asset precautionary savings model is consistent with is the finding from Section 3.2
that MPCs increase with the size of the windfall. We found that the size effect is
driven entirely by the extensive margin: as the size of the windfall was increased from
$500 to $5000, the fraction of respondents saying that they would not change their
spending decreased from 75% to 55%. This failure of the precautionary savings model
is related to a more general failure of all of the models we have so far considered:
whereas much of the action in the survey responses is on the extensive margin, the
models only make predictions on the intensive margin because the MPC in these
models is always non-zero.
    One possible explanation for the extensive margin size effect is the presence of
non-convex adjustment costs associated with the purchase of durable goods. In the
presence of such goods, it is well known that consumption decisions have a threshold
property, which can lead larger changes in individuals’ budget sets to induce a larger
fraction of individuals to change their consumption (see e.g. Berger and Vavra,
2015). This feature of durable spending is also emphasized by Broda and Parker
(2014) as an interpretation of consumption responses to fiscal stimulus payments in
2008. Indeed, Table 5 showed that as the size of the windfall increases in the GAIN
treatment, a larger fraction of expenditure is reported to be directed towards durable
goods.
    Another possible explanation for both the positive size effect and the large number
of reported zero MPCs is salience or inertia. For many individuals, it may not be
worth the effort to change their consumption plans when their budget constraint
is changed by only a small amount. This may occur if there are cognitive costs
involved with deviating from a status-quo or in deciding how to allocate a windfall
across alternative spending possibilities. For small windfalls, the additional utility
from optimally allocating the windfall between spending and savings might be too
small to justify not saving the entire windfall.
   A simple way to introduce salience and inertia into the precautionary savings
model is to introduce a small “response cost”. We model this cost by assuming that
agents incur a fixed utility cost ψ in the period of the treatment if they choose a level

of consumption that differs from the level of consumption that was dictated by their
optimal policy function in the absence of the treatment. The presence of this cost
leads individuals with a small utility difference between responding to the treatment
and not responding to the treatment to have an MPC of zero. Moreover, since this
utility difference increases in the size of the windfall, this type of response cost has
the potential to generate a positive size effect on the extensive margin.24
    Figure 8a shows how the average MPC in the GAIN treatment in the two-asset
model declines with the size of response cost ψ, for different size gains. Figure
8b shows the corresponding decline in the fraction of individuals with a positive
MPC (extensive margin). These figures illustrate that addition of the response cost
introduces a meaningful extensive margin of MPCs into the model and lowers MPCs
to gains of all sizes. Importantly, the reduction in MPCs from the resource cost is
smallest for the $5,000 gain and, for large enough responses costs, can overturn the
negative size effect on the extensive margin. However, modeling salience in this way
is not enough on its own to generate a positive extensive-margin size effect like that
  24
      Formally, let V 0 (x) be the value for an individual with resources x in the absence of the
treatment and let c0 (x) be the associated consumption function. Let V 1 (x, ∆) be the value for
an individual with resources x in the GAIN treatment of size ∆ and ψ = 0, and let c1 (x, ∆) be
the associated consumption function. The value for an individual in the GAIN treatment who
does not pay the response cost is given by V 2 (x, ∆) = u (c0 (x)) + EV1 (R (x − c0 (x) + ∆) + y). If
V 1 (x, ∆) − V 2 (x, ∆) > ψ, the individual chooses to pay the response costs and sets c = c1 (x, ∆).
If not, the individual does not pay the response cost, and sets c = c0 (x).

observed in the survey responses. The reason is that the response cost lowers MPCs
of all sizes and does not raise responses to larger windfalls.
    A possible further modification that may be useful in this regard would be to
combine the response cost with an additional behavioral phenomenon that raises
MPCs to windfalls of all sizes. For example, the model of temptation and self-
control in Gul and Pesendorfer (2001) and Kovacs and Moran (2017), or the model
of quasi-hyperbolic discounting in Angeletos et al. (2001), typically generate higher
MPCs to gains of all sizes than models that abstract from these features. Such a
model combined with a response cost might be able to match the positive extensive
margin size effect. We leave the quantitative assessment of these hybrid models to
future work.


6    Conclusions
    We have shown how carefully constructed survey questions about hypothetical
treatments can be useful in distinguishing models of consumption behavior. Asking
survey respondents how their spending would change in multiple different scenarios
yielded six broad findings. First, there is a large amount of heterogeneity in con-
sumption responses to small unexpected gains: most people do not react but there
is a set of people who spend a substantial fraction of the windfall. Second, there is a
positive extensive margin size effect: for bigger gains, more people respond. Third,
we find evidence of sign asymmetry: spending responses to losses are larger and more
widespread that spending responses to the same size gains. These responses to losses
are correlated with holdings of liquid assets. Fourth, very few respondents increase
their spending in response to news about future gains, even those respondents who
indicate that they would increase spending in response to actual gains. Fifth, peo-
ple generally do react to news about future losses. Sixth, almost no respondents
indicated that they would increase spending when offered a one-year interest-free
loan.
   We then showed that many, but not all, of these aspects of consumption behavior
are consistent with a two-asset life-cycle precautionary savings model. Several of
the above findings are strongly suggestive of limited access to disposable resources
being an important determinant of MPCs: higher MPCs out of losses than gains,
the fact that MPCs out of losses are related to liquid wealth, and the very low MPCs
out of news about future gains. The survey findings are also informative about
the underlying reasons why many individuals act as if they have limited access to
disposable resources: the substantial MPC out of news about future losses is evidence

                                          40
against excessive impatience, myopia or extreme forms of present-bias; the lack of
a spending response to the loan suggests that it is unlikely that short-term credit
constraints play an important role.
    The models that we considered all equate limited access to disposable resources
with having little or no liquid wealth (i.e. being hand-to-mouth). A strict interpre-
tation of these models thus suggests that liquid wealth, which is in principle easy to
measure, should have strong explanatory power for cross-sectional heterogeneity in
MPCs. However, with the exception of the LOSS treatment, we failed to find a sig-
nificant correlation between MPCs and measures of hand-to-mouth behavior in terms
of liquid wealth. This is true more generally in the literature on estimating MPCs:
even in the more recent studies which have sufficient power to uncover a correlation
between liquid wealth and MPCs, measured liquid wealth explains very little of the
overall cross-sectional heterogeneity in MPCs (e.g. in terms of R-squared). One
reason for this, we think, is that the relevant notion of disposable liquid wealth for
determining MPCs, is actually very difficult to measure. It depends on the level, vari-
ation and timing of regular income; access to both informal and formal credit; and the
level and variation in pre-committed and/or unforeseen expenses. Pre-Committed
expenses are particularly difficult to measure and are likely to be correlated with
income and liquid wealth in complicated ways that make make liquid wealth a very
noisy proxy of disposable resources.
    At least two important avenues for future work immediately arise from our find-
ings. First, there is scope to develop theories of consumption which can explain
why many households act as if they expect to be hand-to-mouth for long periods of
time, and why many of these households have substantial measured liquid wealth.
An obvious avenue is to introduce consumption commitments or other dimensions
of heterogeneity in disposable resources into the model. Second, there is a need to
systematically investigate the scope for behavioral phenomena to quantitatively ac-
count for the aspects of these survey responses where the two-asset precautionary
savings model fails, most notably the increasing fraction of respondents who react
to an unanticipated gain as the size of the gain increases.
   Mental accounting, which is premised on the idea that resources are not fungible
across different uses and that resources received in different circumstances may be
used differently, is one such phenomenon. At this level of generality it is possible to
reverse engineer a mental accounting story that is consistent with all of our findings.
The downside of such an explanation, however, is that it is verging on tautological.
The theory in this case is essentially a re-statement of the empirical findings. That
being said, the basic ideas on which mental accounting are based, surely play a role

                                          41
in understanding consumption behavior. Constructing a quantifiable and testable
theory of mental accounting that can be confronted with the survey evidence along-
side the other models that we have considered is an important open area for future
research.
    On the methodological front, we have demonstrated the usefulness of alterna-
tive treatments – gains, losses, news and loans – in distinguishing between different
models of consumption behavior. Our hope is that future work will seek to identify
similar experiments based on actual choice data that can complement our findings
based on answers to hypothetical questions.

A      Further Details on Survey
In this Appendix, we provide the exact language and formatting (emphasis/underlining)
used in the survey questions analyzed in the paper.

A.1      MPC Questions
For our MPC elicitation, we rely on questions across five different types of scenarios:

    1. GAIN: windfall now ($500, $2,500, $5,000)

    2. GAIN-NEWS: windfall in 3 months ($500, $5,000)

    3. LOSS: occurring now ($500)

    4. LOSS-NEWS: occurring later (500; either in 3 months or in 2 years)

    5. LOAN ($5,000)

Parts in square brackets denote different variations depending on the gain amount
or the timing (these were not shown to respondents). For scenario categories 2-5, we
only provide the parts that differ from the GAIN scenarios. For the LOSS and LOSS-
NEWS scenarios, there were minor changes to the wording across survey waves, as
noted below. Example screenshots are provided at the end of this section.
1. GAIN
Now consider a hypothetical situation where you unexpectedly receive a one-time payment of $500
[or 2,500, or 5,000] today.

We would like to know whether this extra income would cause you to change your spending behavior
in any way over the next 3 months.


Please select only one
• Over the next 3 months, I would spend/donate more than if I hadn’t received the $500 [or
2,500, or 5,000]
• Over the next 3 months, I would spend/donate the same as if I hadn’t received the $500 [or
2,500, or 5,000]
• Over the next 3 months, I would spend/donate less than if I hadn’t received the $500 [or 2,500,
or 5,000]

Please select only one
• Over the next 3 months, I would pay off more debt (or borrow less) than if I hadn’t received
the $500 [or 2,500, or 5,000]
• Over the next 3 months, I would pay off the same amount of debt as if I hadn’t received the
$500 [or 2,500, or 5,000]

2. GAIN-NEWS
Now consider a hypothetical situation where you learn that you will receive a guaranteed one-time
payment of $500 [or $5,000] exactly three months from today.


We would like to know whether this extra income would cause you to change your spending behavior
in any way over the next 3 months (that is, before you receive the money).

$500 [or 5,000]
• Over the next 3 months, I would spend/donate less than if I did not expect the guaranteed
$500 [or 5,000] [questions on debt pay-down and saving]

3. LOSS
March 2016 wave:
Now consider a hypothetical situation in which you unexpectedly lose $500 today. Note that this
is a one-time loss – it does not in any way affect your income going forward. You have simply found
yourself suddenly to have $500 less than you previously had.


We would like to know whether this one-time $500 loss would cause you to change your spending
behavior in any way over the next 3 months.
[The rest is identical to the March 2017 wave below]

A.2     Respondent Characteristics
Here, we provide the questions on which the cuts in Tables A-4 and A-5 below are
based.
Age: the age of the respondent.
Bachelor’s degree+: equals one if the respondent indicates that their highest com-
pleted education is a bachelor’s degree, master’s degree, doctoral degree, or profes-
sional degree.
Income: based on the following question:

      Which category represents the total combined pre-tax income of all mem-
      bers of your household (including you) during the past 12 months?
      Please include money from all jobs, net income from business, farm or
      rent, pensions, interest on savings or bonds, dividends, social security
      income, unemployment benefits, Food Stamps, workers compensation
      or disability benefits, child support, alimony, scholarships, fellowships,
      grants, inheritances and gifts, and any other money income received by
      members of your household who are 15 years of age or older.

[Respondents select from: Less than $10,000 / $10,000 to $19,999 / $20,000 to $29,999
/ $30,000 to $39,999 / $40,000 to $49,999 / $50,000 to $59,999 / $60,000 to $74,999
/$75,000 to $99,999 / $100,000 to $149,999 / $150,000 to $199,999 / $200,000 or
more]
Liquid Assets: based on the following two-part question:

      Which of the following do you or anyone in your family living with you
      have any money invested in?
      Please do NOT include any investments in retirement accounts (401k,
      403b, 457, IRA, thrift savings plans etc.) or employer-sponsored pensions.

[Respondents select (possibly several) from: Checking accounts or cash / Savings ac-
counts / Money market funds / CDs (Certificates of Deposit) / Government/Municipal
Bonds or Treasury Bills / Stocks or bonds in publicly held corporations, stock or bond
mutual funds, or investment trusts / None of the above]
   [If did not select “None of the above”:]



                                          54
     If you added up all the money in these categories that you and your family
     members living with you have invested in, how much would it total?

[Respondents select from: Less than $500 / $500 to $999 / $1,000 to $1,999 / $2,000
to $4,999 / $5,000 to $9,999 / $10,000 to $19,999 / $20,000 to $29,999 / $30,000
to $49,999 / $50,000 to $99,999 / $100,000 to $249,999 / $250,000 to $499,999 /
$500,000 to $749,999 / $750,000 to $999,999 / $1,000,000 or more]


Credit score: based on the question:
   “What would you say is your credit score? [Respondents select from: Below 620
/ 620-679 / 680-719 / 720-760 / above 760 / Don’t know]
    “Below Median” includes respondents in the first three categories (and we do not
include in this cut the ones that answered “Don’t know”).
(Do not) have 2 months of funds: based on the response to the yes/no question
(asked in February 2016) “In case of an unexpected decline in income or increase
in expenses, do you [or your spouse/partner] have at least two months of covered
expenses available in cash, bank accounts, or easily accessible funds?”
Tend to spend now / in future: based on the response to the question (asked in
February 2016) “In general, are you the sort of person who would rather spend your
money and enjoy it today or save more for the future? Where would you place
yourself on the scale below?” [Respondents are asked to select on a scale from 1 to
5, where 1 is “Spend now” and 5 is “Save for the future”. We classify as “Tend to
spend now” those that select values 1-3.]
Time discounting questions: Respondents that were in the survey in February 2016
were asked the following:

     In this final part of the survey, 5 respondents will be randomly chosen to
     win a significant amount of money, as explained below.
     In completing this final part of the survey, you have to decide whether
     you want a smaller amount of money sooner, or a larger amount of money
     later. Specifically, in each of the following rows, please choose the option
     you prefer. For example, in row 1, you have a choice between $150 today
     versus $160 in a month from today.
     If you are selected as a winner, one of these rows will be randomly picked
     and you will receive the money on the date indicated. (Note that “today”
     means within one business day.)

                                         55
     You will know immediately after the end of this survey whether you were
     chosen as a winner or not. If you are chosen as one of the winners, you
     would also be informed about the row for which you will be paid.x

They were then asked to make choices across three blocks of question (following
Meier and Sprenger, 2010):
1. Money TODAY or IN A MONTH: they were presented with 6 rows, where in each
row they chose between “$X guaranteed today” or “$160 guaranteed in a month”,
where X took the following values: 150, 140, 130, 120, 100, 80.
2. Money TODAY or IN 6 MONTHS: they were presented with 7 rows, where in each
row they chose between “$X guaranteed today” or “$160 guaranteed in 6 months”,
where X took the following values: 150, 140, 130, 120, 100, 80, 60.
3. Money IN 6 MONTHS or IN 7 MONTHS: they were presented with 6 rows, where
in each row they chose between “$X guaranteed in 6 months” or “$160 guaranteed
in 7 months”, where X took the following values: 150, 140, 130, 120, 100, 80.
   We define a respondent to have a “Low 1-month Discount Factor” if in the first
block, they prefer any of the smaller amounts today to the $160 in a month.
    We define a respondent to exhibit “Inconsistent Time Discounting” if their implied
discount factor in the first block is lower than in the third block (e.g. they prefer
$150 today over $160 in a month, but prefer $160 in 7 months over $150 in 6 months).

C     Further Details on Model
   This Appendix provides further details on the calibrated life-cycle models from
Section 5.3. We first describe the two-asset model and then explain the parameter
configuration such that it collapses to the one-asset model. The state variables for
a working-age household of age t ∈ {1, . . . , T work } are its liquid assets l, its illiquid
assets a its labor productivity z. The value function in period t is given by

                      Vt (l, a, z) = max VtA (l, a, z) , VtN (l, a, z)
                                        


where VtA (l, a, z) is the value function if the household pays the adjustment cost
in period t and VtN (l, a, z) is the value function if the household does not pay the
adjustment cost in period t.
    The value function VtA (l, a, z) is given by


                                                φ 1−φ 1−γ

                    VtA (l, a, z) = max                      + βEz0 [Vt+1 (l0 , a0 , z 0 )|z]

       c + h + Rl−1 l0 + Ra−1 a0 =l + a + yt (z) − τ (yt (z)) − κ
                              l0 , a0 ≥ 0
                                  h ≥ −ζa

where total consumption of housing services d = h + ζa, where h is the amount
of purchased housing services (at price 1) and ζa is imputed housing services from
illiquid assets. The earnings function is given by yt (z) = eχt +z and the tax function
is given by τ (y). Productivity risk z follows the AR(1) process

                                        z 0 = ρz + ηt
                                       ηt ∼ N (0, ση,t )
                                       z0 ∼ N (0, σz,0 ).

The problem for a retired household of age t ∈ {T work + 1, . . . , T } is identical, except
that the household faces no productivity risk, receives no labor income and instead
receives a social security benefit p(zT work ), which is a function of productivity in the
last period of working life and is a function that returns social security benefits based
on earnings in the last working age period.

                                 c,h,l      1−γ
                                 subject to
            c + h + Rl−1 l0 =l + yt (z) − τ (yt (z))

                               h ≥ −ζa


    The parameter values in the two-asset model are as follows: T work = 38 × 4,
T ret = 20 × 4, γ = 2, ζ = 0.03, φ = 0.85, κ = $2, 000, ρ = 0.97, σz,0
                                                                     2
                                                                        = 0.18, Rl = 1,
Ra = 1.05 (annual). The social-security function, tax function, age profile χt and
               2
income risk ση,t are the same as in Kaplan and Violante (2014). The distribution of
initial wealth (a0 , l0 ) is taken from Kaplan and Violante (2010), with a illiquid share
of 81.4% as in Kaplan and Violante (2014). The discount factor β = 0.9651 to match
a ratio of total wealth to mean quarterly labor income of 14.
    The one-asset model is a special case of the two-asset model in which housing
services do not enter the utility function (φ = 1), there is an infinite cost of adjust-
ment (κ = ∞) and all households start off life with zero illiquid assets a0 = 0. We
consider versions with R ∈ {1, 1.05} annual. The discount factor is re-calibrated to
generate the same ratio of total wealth to mean quarterly labor income as in the
two-asset model.
   The life-cycle profiles of income and consumption are displayed in Figure 8a and
the life-cycle profiles of wealth are shown in Figure 8b. Note that the increasing mean
profile for consumption during retirement in the two-asset model and associated sharp
decline in mean illiquid wealth are a consequence of the lack of a bequest motive in
the model. Introducing a bequest motive would change this feature without having
any meaningful affect for the results on MPCs in the main text. The age profile of
the fraction of hand-to-mouth households in the model is displayed in Figure 8c.
