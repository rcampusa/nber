                                                 Abstract

          Specific quasi-rents build up in a wide variety of economic relationships, and are ex-
      posed to opportunism unless fully protected by contract. The recognition that such con-
      tracts are often incomplete has yielded major insights into the organization of macroe-
      conomic exchange.      Rent appropriation, we argue, also has important macroeconomic
      implications.    Resources are underutilized, factor markets are segmented, production
      stiers    from technological   “sclerosis, “ job destruction is out of balance with creation,
      recessions are excessively sharp, and expansions run into bottlenecks. While, depending
      on the nature of the shock, expansions may require reinforcement or stabilization, reces-
      sions should always be softened. In the long run, institutions, such as those governing
      capital-labor relations, may evolve to alleviate the problem by balancing appropriation.
      Technology choice will also be affected, with the appropriated factor partially “exclud-
      ing” the other from production       to reduce appropriation — as manifested in the role
      capital-labor substitution played in the rise of European unemployment.



1     Introduction

An asset is specific     to a relationship     to the extent      that its value is greater    within   the

relationship    than outside.   Economic     specificity   is a pervasive   phenomenon.   It arises when

a firm selects and invests in a worker; when the worker spends his learning years in a firm;

when capital     is invested in a unionized    firm or industry;     when a bank extends      credit to an

entrepreneur;     when an upstream       firm makes investments       to serve downstream      customers;

when foreign direct investment        flows into a country.

    Specificity     in a relationship         reduces the flexibility        of separation   decisions,       which induces

reluctance     in the investment            decision.      This is the basic insight of the irreversible               invest-

ment literature.        But specificity         acquires     a potentially      more troublesome         dimension      when

combined       with contracting          difficulties.     To the extent that it is irreversible,          entering into a

relationship      creates    specific     quasi-rents       that may not be divided          ex post according         to the

parties’    ez ante terms of trade.            Avoiding       this transformation       from an ex ante competitive

situation     to an ex post bilateral          monopoly       — known in the literature            m the “fundamental

transformation”        or the “holdup          problem”       — requires prior protection          through      comprehen-

sive and enforceable          long-term        contracts.      The problem        is that such contracts           are much

closer to a methodological               benchmark        than a description      of actual practices. 1

    Relationship       specificity,       together   with the recognition          of the difficulties     involved     in ac-

tual contrxting,        is a central building            block in the modern        economic      theory      of institutions

(Klein,     Crawford     and Alchian          1978; Williamson          1979 and 1985).         Specificity     as a central

dimension      of transaction       description          forms the basis of insightful       theories      of the firm and

internal    organization        (e.g.,    Grossman         and Hart 1986;        Hart and Moore          1990),     of finan-

cial structure      (e.g.,   Williamson         1988; Hart and Moore              1994; Shleifer     and Vishny        1995),

of public-choice       institutions       and credibility       (e.g., North      and Weingast       1989; Thomas         and

Worrall     1994), and a variety of other institutional                  arrangements.       The common            feature in

those theories is the idea that a main function                     of institutional    arrangements          is to allow the

transacting     parties to partly circumvent                the holdup problem,

    The institutional         literature      generally      acknowledges       that,   while institutions        often help

alleviate    appropriability,      they rarely resolve the problem               fully. From a macroeconomic             per-

spective,    the prevalence       of unprotected          specific rents makes it a potentially          central factor in

determining       the functioning         of the aggregate          economy.     Transactions     in the labor, capital,


   lThe problem of the ~PProPriability of relationship-specific                investment goes back earlY in the history
of economic thought.      Marx, in Das Capital, saw in it a channel for the capitalist exploitation of labor:
“The knowledge, the judgement, and the will, which, though in ever so small degree, are practiced by the
independent peasant or handicraftsman [...] — these faculties are now required only for the workshop as a
whole. Intelligence in production expands in one direction, because it vanishes in many others. What is lost
by the detail laborers, is concentrated in the capital that employs them [...]” (as cited by Rosenberg 1965).
    Simons (1944) took the opposite view, that it is labor that takes advantage of specificity to appropriate
capital: “Frankly, I can see no reason why strongly organized workers, in an industry where huge investment
is already sunk in highly durable assets, should ever permit a return on investment sufficient to attract
new capital or even to induce full maintenance of existing capital.” He provided an early analysis of the
resulting under-investment: “[t]he bias against new investment inherent in labor organization is important
[...]. Investors now face [...] the prospect that labor organizations will appropriate most or all of the earnings
[...]. Indeed, every new, long-term commitment of capital is now a matter of giving hostages to organized
seflers of complementary services .“



                                                                2
or goods markets are frequently             characterized        by some degree of specificity.        The creation      of

a job, for example,        typically    involves relationship-specific           investments     by the firm and the

worker (e.g., Becker 1964).            Beyond     its purely technological        wpect,     effective specificity   may

be increased     by such institutional       features as dismissal regulations              (which devalue the firm’s

option    of using its investment         outside the relationship)           or unionization     (which narrows the

firm’s outside option        to a sector outside the scope of the union).                 In partial equilibrium,       un-

resolved opportunism          results in reduced investment           incentives,    because the resulting specific

quasi-rents     may later be partly appropriated                by others (e.g., Simons 1944; Grout           1984).     In

general equilibrium,         as the problem       of creating and sharing quasi-rents             spreads throughout

the economy,       the market system will adjust to help compensate                        the appropriated     factors,

providing      a highly inefficient      macroeconomic           “solution”    to the unresolved       macroeconomic

contracting      problems.     This general-equilibrium            adjustment     can affect major aspects of the

aggregate      functioning     of the economy.

    In this paper we attempt             to characterize        the nature and implications          of the macroeco-

nomic “solution”        to the holdup problem. 2 Throughout               the paper we think of the problem              as

one where two factors of production               contemplate       either committing         to a partly irreversible

joint-production        relationship,    or remaining       in “autarky.”       Section     2 sets up this model        and

draws some basic macroeconomic                  implications.      The problem       of appropriability      implies,    in

general equilibrium,         that factors of production           are underemployed;         that the market for the

“appropriating”        factor is segmented        (i.e., it experiences       involuntary     unemployment       in joint

production);       that the productive          structure   is “sclerotic”      (i.e., too many low-productivity

units are kept in operation            compared      to an efficient economy);        and that, paradoxically,          the

economy     exhibits     excessive     destruction     of production      units given its depressed         level of cre-

ation.   The section       concludes     with a discussion        of the canonical        set of policies   that restore

macroeconomic          efficiency.

    Section     3 turns to cyclical       implications,     and focuses        more closely     on the labor/capital

interpretation      of the two factors — where we take those factors’                      distinguishing    features to

be that the supply of uncommitted                capital to form joint-production            units to be more elastic


    2A number of recent contributions have examined various implications of appropriable quasi-rents in
general equilibrium setting. Makowski and Ostroy (1995) highlight the key role that “appropriation” plays
in the efficiency of markets. Ramey and Watson (1996) analyze the interactions of the holdup problem and
effort incentivization in a matching model. More applied examples are MacLeod and Malcomson (1993), who
study the macroeconomic effects of employment contract forms that attempt to avert investment holdup;
Acemoglu (1996), who examines the effects of search-related incomplete contracting on human capital accu-
mulation; and Robinson (1995), who looks at the economics and politics of labor-market institutions when
employment contracts are incomplete.

than that of labor.        In this context,       we show that, at low levels of activity, labor is the factor

that experiences      market segment ation (i.e., there is involuntary                    labor unemployment),             while

at high levels of activity          it is the market for capital that is segmented                   (i.e., there are labor

shortages).     Moreover,      the cyclical     response of the economy             is excessively      elastic (compared

to an efficient     economy)        when the labor market is segmented,                   and excessively         rigid when

the capital      market     is segmented.          Put    differently,     recessions     bring      unnecessarily        severe

unemployment,        while expansions         run into bottlenecks          sooner than efficient.          This implies, in

particular,     that the economy        will have an asymmetric            response to a symmetric             shock process
.   with sharp recessionary            dips and recoveries          followed    by shallow expansions.             Moreover,

this asymmetry           implies    that an increwe         in the volatility       of macroeconomic              shocks    will

decrease      average employment          and output.         We conclude         that while — depending                on the

nature     of the shock — expansions               may require st abilizat ion or reinforcement,                   recessions

should     always be softened.

    Section     4 touches      on issues relating         to the longer-term            response      of institutions       and

technology      to the presence       of unprotected        specificity.     From a political         point of view, each

factor    will seek, as an ez ante united group,                institutional      developments         that increase        the

other factors’     specificity.      But this political      incentive      for rent appropriation             has its limits,

because     it inherently     results in ez post internal segmentation                    of the appropriating            factor

between       employed     winners     and unemployed          losers.      It is through       that channel         that the

macroeconomic        inefficiency      of opportunism          enters into the factor’s            political     calculation,

and, beyond      a point, starts dominating              any additional        distributional      gain.

    Over the long run, the economy                will also respond along its technological                 dimension      in an

attempt     to circumvent      the appropriability         problem.        A principal     dimension        of technological

adaptation      is in the relative factor proportions              used. We show how, in equilibrium,                technol-

ogy choice is essentially          determined     by the appropriated           factor,    That factor,        we argue, has

an incentive     to reduce        appropriation     by selecting       a technology       that partly        “excludes”      the

other factor from joint production.               The result is a distorted          capital-labor         ratio and further

under-employment           of the appropriating          factor.     This exclusion         phenomenon          is consistent

with the role that capital-labor            substitution      seems to have played in the rise of European

unemployment.

    Section     5 concludes        with a series of macroeconomic               questions    that can be illuminated

2.1       Factor      Specificity         in Joint         Production

In this section we lay out the model that we use to analyze the general-equilibrium                                    implica-

tions of specific     qu~i-rents        in the joint use of factors of production.                 Our basic model takes

as given the institutional            framework          and available     technology.         It is therefore    appropriate

for the study of short to medium                   term equilibrium,         but must be used more selectively                  in

the study of long-term          issues. Section 4 discusses the implications                     of endogenizing       long-run

institutional      and technological           evolution,

Productive      structure

Our model       economy      has one consumption               good    and two factors of production,              denoted      as

factor    1 and 2. The two factors                are identified       with optimizing         agents,      who derive linear

utility from the consumption              good,     which we use as the numeraire.

      Production      takes place in two modes,               identified    with separate         sectors    of the economy.

Factors 1 and 2 can either produce separately                    in their respective         Autarky     sectors, or combine

in the Joint Production              sector.     For each factor         i, we denote        by U1 total employment             in

Autarky      and by Ei total employment                   in Joint Production.

      Each factor’s     Autarky        sector     is perfectly       competitive     and characterized           by an aggre-

gate production        function       Fi(Ui).      In Joint Production,            factors     1 and 2 combine         in fixed

proportions        to form   “production         units.”     A production          unit combines         Z1 units of factor       1

with Z2 units of factor         2 to produce             ~ units of the consumption              good,      We denote     by E

the total number         of production          units.    Parameters       Z1, Z2 >0     and ~ are given by available

technologies.       The implications            of allowing      for short-run      substitutability         between   factors,

and for even greater substitutability                in the long run through           technological        development      will

be discussed       in section   4.

Creation     and destruction

We study a one-period           economy.         There is a mass E“ of preexisting                  production     units that

were formed before the start of the period.                    There is also a mass U; and U; of uncommitted

factors    of type 1 and 2, that are not part of a pre-existing                        unit.    For each factor z = 1, 2,

we fix total factor supply to one:

                                                         ziEO + U,” = 1.                                                      (1)


Production      units that are newly created this period have common                             revenue y“.     Pre-existing

production      units have heterogeneous                 revenues ~,     whose distribution         D(r)      is given by the


                                                                 5
history    of technology        adoption    and idiosyncratic          shocks.   Naturally,     D(+m)      = EO. If the

minimum       revenue required for survival (see below) is denoted                    by ~“, then the total number

of pre-existing       units destroyed       is D(~O).

    The timing         of production       is as follows.       In a first phwe,      pre-existing    production     units

decide whether to continue              operation     for this period,      or to separate and releme their factor

resources.    In a second phase, factors that were released from pre-existing                        units and uncom-

mitted    factors can choose to form new production                     units, or remain in Autarky.         In the final

phme,     factors in all sectors produce.

    A number          of identities     will be useful in what follows.            Denoting       by C the number        of

new units created,         and recalling       that D(yO)
                                                       — is the number of pre-existing                  units destroyed,

we have

                                                 E=     EO+c–          D(yO);                                          (2)


                                                         Ei = ziE;                                                     (3)


                                             Ui = u; – Zic          + ziD(yO),                                         (4)


where i = 1, 2. The first identity             equates the number E of production                 units to the number

of pre-existing       units plus net creation;          the second gives Joint Production               employment     for

each factor     as a function         of E; the last identity        gives Aut~ikj-      employment      for each factor

as a function        of the number of uncommitted               factors    and net creation.

Specificity    and incomplete          contracts

When      factors join to form a new production                 unit, they develop       a degree of specificity     with

respect to each other, and a share #z ● [0, 1] of factors i = 1,2 can no longer be used outside

the production         unit.    If the factors      separate,    only (1 – @i)zi      units of factor i can be used

elsewhere.     Specificity      can be a pure aspect of technology,              or, as discussed       in the examples

of section    2.2, can be due to institutional              factors.

    Specificity       creates    quasi-rents       whose value is the difference          between     the value of the

factors   within the production            unit and their value in their best outside                use. To guarantee

that specific quasi-rents         will be divided       according      to the factors’    ex-ante terms of trade, the

factors   must enter an ex-ante            contract      that governs       their participation      in the production

unit and the division           of its surplus.       Unfortunately,       such ideal contracts      are quite difficult

to achieve in practice.

    In general, the contract            must take into account            the full complexity     of the concrete    situ-

ation.    Specific    investments       are typically     made not once, but incrementally              throughout     the



                                                                6
life of a production       unit.      The contingent         plan for making such investments,                   the duration

of the relationship,       and the rent-division             mechanism       must be pre-specified             from the start

and made fully contingent               on the future profitability              of the production         unit, on factors

that determine        its evolving      prospects,      and on the various events,               both    aggregate     and id-

iosyncratic,      that govern       each factor’s     outside     opportunity         costs.     The contract       must also

specify    the many dimensions            that characterize          each factor’s        participation        in production,

again possibly      based on contingencies           outside the factors’          control.      A variety of problems          of

observability,     verifiability,     enforceability,     and sheer complexity,                make such ideal contracts

rarely possible.      In practice,      agents enter into arrangements                — what one might loosely             call

“incomplete       contracts”     — that leave plenty of room                 for ex-post        discretion.3      (For a clear

discussion     of incomplete        contracts    in the presence of specificity,           see chapter 4 of Hart 1995).

    When       pre-contracting        is not possible,       the division        of specific     quasi-rents     must be de-

termined       ex post.   It is well known that, in this case, the relation                      between    the two factors

undergoes,       in Williamson’s        (1985)    term, a “fundamental             transformation”         from an ex-ante

competitive       setting to an ex-post          bilateral    monopoly.          To analyze the effect of incomplete

contracting,      we distinguish        between     two extreme        cases: the “efficient”           equilibrium,    where

factors    are able to engage in full contractual                  precommitment,              and the “incomplete        con-

tracts”    equilibrium,    where no precommitment                 is possible.

Free entry and exit
We can now turn to the determination                    of factor rewards in different              sectors,    and the free-

entry and exit decision          rules for production           units. If we denote by pi factor i’s rental price

in Autarky,      we have

                                                        pa = F;(ui)                                                         (5)


in any equilibrium        with O < U2 < 1. Assuming                the functional         form


                            F2(Ui) = ,+;,qi             [1-(1      -ui)’+’’~’]        ,   ~~ >0


for the Autarky       production        function,    we get a constant           supply-elasticity       q~ for factor z into


   3A simple transaction that would overstep the need for contracting altogether is an exchange of factors
that allows a single agent to own both factors in a production unit. In the first two examples we develop
in section 2.2 below, this solution is made impossible by the fact that one side of the transaction involves
“inalienable” human capital. In the third example, it is limited by span-of-control and other limits to the
extent of vertical integration.
Joint Production:

                                             Ei=p~,                  2=1,2,                                                     (6)


taking (1) and (2)-(4)       into account.      Naturally,           Fi (Ui) is increasing        and concave         in Ui.4

    Turning     to Joint Production,       we let w? denote                    the unit-compensation         of factor     i in a

newly created     production     unit. To differentiate               between       variables when equilibrium            condi-

tions are different   for the efficient and incomplete-contracts                          equilibrium,    we use an asterisk

to denote     the former.      In the efficient          equilibrium,           factors    in new production           units are

compensated      according     to their ex-ante opportunity                     cost p!, i.e.


                                             W;* = P:           1
                                                                      i=l,z.                                                    (7)


In the incomplete-contracts         equilibrium,          factor       compensation           in new production          units is

governed      by their ex-post    opportunity            cost       (1 – ~i)pi.       The specific       quasi-rent     Sn from

such a production       unit is the difference            between          the unit’s       revenue      Yn and the ex-post

opportunity     costs of its factors:


                                 Sn = Yn – (1 – 41)Pl~l                 – (1 – @2)p2z2.                                         (8)


Following     the Nash bargaining       solution     for sharing the unit’s revenue, we assume that each

factor i gets its ex-post      opportunity      cost plus half of the unit’s bargaining                      surplus Sn:516



                                         w~xi    = (1 — ~i)piZi                + +Sn.                                           (9)


    In the efficient case, the entry condition                  for the creation          of new units is


                                                y“   2    pyxl + p;x2.                                                      (lo)


    4The strict concavity of the Aut arky production function implies the presence of a tbird “quasi” factor.
This becomes relevant in the distributional analysis of section 4.1, where it is briefly discussed (see footnote
20).
    5We implicitly assume that each type of factor in the production unit forms a coalition that bargains as
a single agent.
    6An alternative specification of the “disagreement point “ in bargaining yields the Shaked and Sutton
(1984) sharing rule that allocates ~y” to each factor as long as neither factor z = 1,2 receives less than
(1 – ~~)pizi. (See Binmore, Rubinstein, and Wolinsky 1986 for a discussion of the foundational differences
between the two approaches). The discrete change in the way the opportunity cost (1 – ~i)p,zi enters the
Shaked-Sutton rule makes it less attractive for an “aggregate” model. Otherwise, our main conclusions do
not depend on the specific sharing rule.
In the incomplete-contracts             case, the rule for factor i to participate                 in Joint Production          is


                                                  W? >pi,            2=1,2.                                               (11)


It is easy to show from (8)-(9)             that (11) is equivalent             to


                           gn > pixz + p-ix-i           + (~ipi~i     – @mip-i~=i)     ,     ~ = 1,27                     (12)


where =i denotes the factor other than z. The difference between the efficient entry condition

(10) and this condition           for factor z is the term


                                               Ai = @ipaxi –


Considering         that the expression        ~jpjzj     memures         the value of what factor j sinks into the

relationship,       Ai memures       the net eflective specificity of factor i. Ai is positive                    if z sinks in

a greater value than the other factor, and negative otherwise.                              Since A-i    = –Ai,     we denote

their absolute        value by A ~ IAa 1. Condition                 (12) for i requires that revenues ym cover the

two factors’        outside   opportunity      costs,     plus the net effective           specificity   Ai factor    z would

sink into the relationship.             It is obvious       that it is the entry condition               of the factor    with

positive     net specificity      that is binding,        so that, taken together             for z = 1,2, the two entry

conditions      (12) are equivalent       to


                                                y“ z plzl        +p2z2        + A.                                        (14)


    We now turn to the separation               decision of factors in pre-existing              units. To avoid clouding

the analysis with side-effects,           we do not assume that pre-existing                     units exhibit     any factor

specificity.    Otherwise,      because     factors would lose a fraction                  ~i if the unit separates,     total

factor     supply     would effectively     depend        endogenously          on destruction,      and would       therefore

not be fixed.         Measuring     the probability         that a unit of factor            z will be employed       in Joint

Production       by
                                                                    XaC
                                                  Aa =                                                                    (15)
                                                           u?+      xiD(y”)     ‘

the opportunity         cost of factors in a preexisting              unit is Aiw~ + (1 – Ai)pi. For a pre-existing

Eflcient    and incomplete-contracts              equilibrium

We are now ready to define equilibrium                     in both the efficient and the incomplete-contracts

case.     We make parameter             assumptions        that guarantee       an “interior”    equilibrium   in both

cases, so that free-entry          condition      (14) holds with equality           and all sectors     have positive

employment.

Assumption           1 (Interior        Equilibrium)          We assume that O < y“ < Zv and E“ < ZE (Yn) ,

where ZY is given by

                                                      X2    1+1/72

and .zE(yn) is defined implicitly            by




The upper-bound          ZY on yn guarantees           that Joint Production         revenues are not high enough

to drive Autarky         employment          to zero.      The upper-bound          ZE on the number        E* of pre-

existing    units guarantees       a need for positive         creations
     An (interior)      incomplete-contracts           equilibrium is a set of variables        (C, E, El, E2, PI, P2,

w~, w;,     Y“) that satisfies free-entry          condition        (14) with equality,     as well as equations    (2)-

(3), (6), (8)-(9),     (13), and (15)-(16).         An (intetior)        eficient   equilibrium is a set of variables

(C*, E“, Et, E;,        P;, P;,’w?*,W;*,y          ‘*) that satisfies the efficient free-entry          condition   (10)

and uniqueness           for both      types of equilibrium          (proofs      for all propositions      can be found in

the appendix).


Proposition            1 (Existence        and    Uniqueness)             An incomplete-contracts             equilibrium        ez-

ists,     is unique,     and satisjies      C, Ei, Ui > 0, i =             1,2.      An eficient      equilibrium      exists,    is

unique,      and satisfies C*, E:, U,* >0,           i = 1,2.


Assumption          1 guarantees       that equilibrium       is characterized         by positive     creation     and positive

employment          in Joint Production          and Autarky.

        Before    we turn to the basic           implications        of our model,         it is useful to look         at some

examples.


2.2        Examples

Specificity       and appropriable        quasi-rents characterize          a variety of transactions         that are preva-

lent throughout          the economy.        Our highly stylized            model      can be given a number            of inter-

pretations.        We discuss three main examples                 that touch on the labor,             financial,    and goods

markets.

Example          1: Labor and capital

The two factors can be interpreted               as labor and capital (now denoted                   as z = 1, k). This is the

prime example          in this paper, and will be used specifically                   to develop the analysis in sections

3 and 4. Joint Production               consists of worker employment                 and capital investment         within the

firm. Autarky          for workers corresponds          to “unemployment”                — voluntary      or involuntary         —

or employment          in sectors that are relatively           immune to contracting              problems       (and example

typical     of the developing           world is the “informal”            sector,     where constant       returns     and low

capital     requirements        allow for self-employment).               Autarky      for capital corresponds         either to

investment         abroad,    or consumption.       We think of labor = the relatively                  inelastic factor     (low

ql), while capital is relatively            elastic (high q~).

      Firm and worker typically             sink various forms of specific investments                   into their relation-

ship (see Becker          1964, for example).         #k > 0 arises when the firm finances                    organizational

or human capital             embodied     in the worker.       Why does not the worker make the investment

instead?      Possibly    because the investment             is firm-specific        as well as worker-specific,       and pos-

sibly because         the worker does not have sufficient                  wealth      (and cannot      obtain      competitive



                                                                11
outside     financing     for the same incomplet~contracts              remons      that render the firm’s invest-

ment appropriable).           #l > 0 arises when the worker dedicates                 part of his lifetime      learning

opportunities      to firm-specific      knowledge.      A special case of firm- and worker-specificity                that

has been studied          extensively     in the labor-market        literature     are search costs expended            by

firms and workers, which, by their very nature, cannot be protected                          by ex-ante contracting.

Generally,     one expects      each side to make, over time and in various ways, investments                       that
are specific    to the other, so that both @l and ~k will be positive.

    Specificity     can have an important            institutional     origin,    in addition      to its technological

dimension.        Consider,     for example,      the case of workers who are able to form a union to

negotiate      with their employer.          The power of the union may derive from firm investments

that are embodied          in workers     as a group — again, ultimately              a contracting     problem     — or

from legislation. 9 With unions, it is not only worker-specific                    investments       but the full set of

firm- or industry-specific         capital that can become           relationship-specific       and enter the scope

of the union.        Legislation     on dismissals       and severance        pay provides      another      example      of

institutionally-driven        specificity.     The imposition      of severance      pay, for example,       depending

on the form it takes, would effectively              increase ok or reduce ~1.

Example      2: Extewal       finance

A second       interpretation      is to think of the above           as modelling       the external      financing      of

firms.    The first factor       would       then represent      “managers,”       who possess       management        and

entrepreneurial         skills; the second      factor   would    represent      the capital    of outside    financiers

(shareholders      and lenders).        The delegation     of control    rights over the firm’s assets to man-

agement      makes those assets partly            management-specific          (e.g., Williamson       1988; Hart and

Moore     1994). If it withdraws         from the relationship,      management        can, in various ways, cause

serious   damage        to the firm’s value — by withdrawing                  their firm-specific      human    capital,

withholding       vital information       on the firm and its assets, or undertaking                 highly disruptive

acts of omission         or commission.         The different      ways in which financiers           can protect      the

value of their investment          from management            appropriation       is the subject     of the “corporate

governance”       approach      to finance      (see, e.g., Shleifer    and Vishny        1995).     Although     we do

not emphasize        this interpretation,        our results can help shed light on the macroeconomic

implications      of financial constraints        (see Caballero      and Hammour         1996c).


    ‘See, e.g., Lindbeck and Snower (1986). In this context, appropriability finds its clearest expression in
the phenomenon of “strikes.” The only reason strikes put any pressure on employers is that it is costly —
for technological or legal reasons — to substitute outsiders for striking insiders, i.e. capital has some degree
of specificity with respect to labor. That is precisely the leverage used by insiders to improve their deal.

Example       3: Vertical relationships

A third example          draws on the role of specificity                in the literature          on vertical     integration

(e.g., Klein, Crawford,           and Alchian        1978).   Our two factors would then represent the capital

of upstream       suppliers       and of downstream             customers,       respectively.      Buyer    and seller may

make mutually          specific     investments        (@i > O).       An electric      utility     may invest in a plant

that   is specific     to a supplier        (by locating         it near a coal mine,            for example)       or specific

to a customer         (by locating        near an industrial          complex).       A special       case of this example

are “customer         markets ,“ where the upstream                   supplier     is a final-goods      producer      and the

downstream       customer         is a consumer       (e.g., Phelps and Winter             1970).


2.3      Under-employment                    and      Rationing

A macroeconomic           situation       where      one factor       is open      to appropriability        by another,          if

widespread      throughout         the economy,          results in offsetting        macroeconomic          adjustments      to

guarantee      that    appropriated        factors     obtain     adequate       returns   in general       equilibrium     and

satisfy their free-entry          condition.       This general-equilibrium            response      affects major      aspects

of the macroeconomy,              which    appear      as symptoms        of an inefficient         macroeconomic         “solu-

tion” to the unresolved           appropriability        problems.      This section describes general-equilibrium

implications     for factor employment.

      The main benchmark             for an incomplete-contracts                 equilibrium      is an efficient     economy.

We start      by giving     parameter          conditions       for the incomplete-contract              equilibrium      to be

efficient.


Proposition          2 (Balanced          Specificity)          The incomplete-contracts            equilibrium     is eficient

ifl, in equilibrium,

                                                     @lPl~l     = @2P2~2,                                                   (18)


which will happen ifl the economy’s                  parameters       satisfy


                                                                                                                            (19)


Condition      (18) for efficiency        is equivalent       to requiring       zero net effective     specificity    A,1° In

other words, it requires that, even though factors may sink some degree of specificity y with


  loThroughout       we ~~~ume the two factors’ bargaining share parameter to be equal. If not, the ‘fficiency
condition    must me modified by dividing each side of (18) by the bargaining share of the corresponding
factor.



                                                                 13
respect     to each other, their interdependence              be “balanced. ”

     To interpret      this balanced-specificity          condition,        note that effective      specificity    ~ipaxi is

determined       not only by the specific share @iZi, but also by the factor’s                     Autarky     reward pi =

E1/qi.
 z     A factor with unattractive              outside opportunities            in Autarky        (low pi) has relatively

low effective      specificity,    because    the relative        value of what it sinks into the relationship

is low.     When     the factors      are completely       symmetric         — i.e.   @l = 42, ql = q2 and Z1 =

Z2 — condition         (19) for balanced        appropriation         holds.     Positive   net appropriation         comes

from asymmetries          in the parameters          that determine         factor specificity.     If everything     else is

symmetric,      the appropriating        factor will be (z) the factor with the lower specific share ~ixi;

and (ii) the factor with the lower elasticity               qi.

    What      is the effect of appropriability           if the efficient parameter         condition     does not hold?

The first effect of appropriability           is to reduce the employment               level in Joint Production:


Proposition        3 (Under-employment)                   ln an inefficient        incomplete-contracts          equilibrium

both factors     are under-employed:


                                                Ei<E~,             2=1,2.


Underemployment           results from the decreased             incentives     of the appropriated       factor to enter

Joint Production,         since it is that factor’s       entry rule that holds with equality.                Equalization

Pi = W? of the appropriated               factor’s      Autarky     and Joint-Production            returns    is achieved
partly     by depressing     its own opportunity          cost pi and partly by reducing              the appropriating

factor’s    opportunity      cost Pmi (to support         w?),     both of which involve           a reduction     in Joint-

Production      employment.

    The second       implication      of appropriability          is market segmentation           of the appropriating

factor:


Proposition        4 (Market          Segmentation)          In an inefficient         incomplete-contracts          equilib-

rium,      let i be the    ‘(appropriated”     factor     — i. e,    Ai > 0.       The market for factor           i clears,

while the market for the other factor                is segmented:


                                             w; = pa       and      W~i   > p~i.                                        (20)


Net appropriation          involves    one of the factors           capturing      rents, which      inherently     induces

market segment ation for that factor.                To see this, note that the market for factor j clears iff

~s” = @jPjxj       (see equation       9), i.e. its share of specific          qu~i-rents    exactly      compensates        it


                                                             14
for what it sinks into the relationship.                   Since ~ Smgoes to each of the factors,                    both markets

clear simultaneously           only      under    balanced          specificity,     i.e.     when    equilibrium        is efficient.

Otherwise,        let i be the appropriated                factor        (A2 > O).          Given   that we have an interior

equilibrium,       it is obvious      from (12) that it is factor z’s free-entry                    condition      that holds with

equality.      The other factor          market is segmented,               and its return differential            is obtained      by

replacing       1 n = @~p~z~in (9) for factor 12:
                ~s


                                                   (~!i     – p~i) z-i = A~.                                                      (21)


Thus, taking         A/z~~    per unit, net effective          specificity         measures the extent of the appropri-

ating factor’s       market segmentation.

      Net appropriation         gives rise to the “involuntary”                     unemployment             of the appropriating

factor      in Joint Production,         which persists because              that factor cannot          precommit        to a com-

pensation       lower than equilibrium            w~i. The number of “slots”                    open in Joint Production             is

determined        by the appropriated        factor’s       free-entry      condition,        and are rationed        among units

of the appropriating          factor.


2.4         Productive        Sclerosis          and      Unbalanced               Gross      Flows

Besides the level and structure             of factor employment,                  appropriability       affects the manner in

which production           units restructure           in response to evolving              profitability.

      The following        proposition     states that the inefficient               economy        exhibits     “productive     scle-

rosis,”     in the sense that pre-existing              units are kept in operation                  with lower levels of prof-

itability     than in an efficient economy.

Proposition          5 (Sclerosis)        An inefficient        incomplete-contracts                equilibrium     exhibits    ‘~ro-

ductive      sclerosis”:

                                                            ~“ <go”.

The scrapping         margin in an inefficient            equilibrium        is lower than in an efficient equilibrium.

To see why, rearrange           expression        (16) for ~“ taking the accounting                     identity    y“ = Wyzl +

w~xz into account:


                                                                                                                                 (22)


Since in an efficient         equilibrium         there is no market segmentation                      (w;*      = p;,    j =   1, 2),

the efficient scrapping         margin is y“
                                          — * = y“.            This is intuitive,            since pre-existing      units can be


                                                                    15
costlessly    replaced by new units that produce g“.                    On the other hand, if i is the appropriated

factor     in an inefficient      equilibrium,      the market for factor             mi will be segmented         (w;     = pi

and w~i > p-i)           and expression        (22) for the scrapping              margin    becomes      lo   = y“ – (1 –

~~i) (w~i – p~i) z-i         < Yn (since >~i <1           in an interior equilibrium).         In this cme, the outside
opportunity      cost of the factors in a pre-existing                 unit is less than yn because            released units

of factor     =i are not guaranteed            a slot in Joint Production              and, with probability         1 – A-i,

may end up in Autarky                earning     less.     Sclerosis     is thus tightly      related    to factor-market

segmentation.          Coupled     with under-employment,                it is likely to constitute       a powerful       drag

on economic        growth.

    The next proposition            characterizes        the efficiency        of the gross flows of production          units.

We define aggregate income             as


                 W(c,     y”) = ync
                          —              +
                                             /go
                                                 ‘~dD(~)+ ~                    Fi(U,– ZiC+ ZiD(~O)).                       (23)
                                                                       icl,z


where the argument           in function     Fi (Ui) is obtained          by replacing      (4) for Ui. The proposition

states that,     in an inefficient      economy,         creation      is generally    insufficient     and destruction       is

excessive.     This captures       an important          dimension      of ‘employment        crises” during macroeco-

nomic      adjustment     episodes     (see Caballero        and Hammour            1996a and 1996 b).


Proposition         6 (Creation        and     Destruction)             An inefficient      incomplete-contracts           equi-

librium exhibits insuflcient           creation:

                                                           aw
                                                           ->0;
                                                            8C

and excessive       destruction:

                                            aw
                                            —   <0         when        D’(y”) >0.
                                            ago


    Insufficient       creation    is due to the fact that the appropriated                   factor    i has reduced        in-

centives     to enter Joint Production             because    of positive        net appropriation.       When     there is a

positive     density    D’ (y”)
                            —      > 0 of pre-existing            units at the destruction       margin,       excessive    de-

struction     is due to the excessively        high compensation               of the appropriating      factor -i in Joint

Production,      given that it is involuntarily            unemployed.          From a social point of view, the out-

side opportunist y cost of a unit of factor -i                in a pre-existing       unit is its Aut arky reward p-i;

from a private point of view, it is higher and equal to p-i + A=i (w-i – p~i), which values



                                                                  16
the possibility     of capturing        specific rents in a new unit. This high private compensation                               is

what causes destruction           to be excessive.         An extreme case arises when Autarky                    corresponds

to unproductive          labor unemployment             (p~~ = O). The social opportunity                   cost of labor in

that case is zero, and any positive              wage is too high and results in excessive                     destruction.

      It may appear        paradoxical       that the economy            exhibits      both sclerosis     and excessive           de-

struction.      In fact, the former is a comparison                  with the efficient equilibrium;           and the latter

is a comparison         between    the social and private values of a pre-existing                     unit in the inefficient

equilibrium.      The coexistence          of “sclerosis”    and “excessive           destruction”      uncovers the fallacy

of a “liquidationist”        approach       in our cent ext, that would see in a recession                     a healthy way

of cleansing     the productive         structure     from sclerosis         (see, e.g., De Long 1990).           There is no

sense in liquidating        sclerotic    production        units if the released factors will not be reabsorbed

in Joint Production         through       an adequate       creation        rate.


2.5      Dual     Optimal         Policy       Design

We now turn to the problem               of designing       a canonical       set of optimal      macroeconomic          policies

to address      the macroeconomic            ills of appropriability.               Those   policies   are not designed            to

address other inefficiencies            due to appropriability           that arise at the macroeconomic                 level.

      We define two types of canonical                policies:       creation      incentives    an, which are subsidies

added to the revenue of each new production                          unit; and protection          subsidies    U“, added to

the revenues of each pre-existing              unit. Equilibrium            in this case is determined          as before,        by

replacing     ym in entry condition          (14) by yn + on, and go in exit condition                     (16) by g“ + a“.


Proposition        7 (Dual        Optimal       Policy)       Eficiency        can be ~estored in an incomplete-contracts

equilibrium      with the following        combination       of a creation          incentive    and a protection        subsidy:




where li      denotes    the appropriating        factor     (i.e.    A?i    < 0),


      The reason we need a dual policy               approach         even though there is only one ill — namely

quasi-rent     appropriation      — is that this ill affects different types of agents differently.                        There

are two types of marginal           decisions       in this economy:           creation     and destruction.       The incen-

tives for creation        are depressed       by A, which must therefore                    be compensated        for.    At the

destruction      margin    for pre-existing         units, the prospect             of rent appropriation        also distorts

the opportunity         cost of the appropriating            factor.        But this distortion        is only equal to the


                                                               17
rents A times the probability            A: that they will be captured.         That distortion       would be even

lower if the factor had to scrap some specific component                   upon separation.        In any case, the

protection     subsidy      u“ * must therefore    be lower than Un *.

    What     the need for two policy         tools implies in practice         is that, alone, a policy     designed
to mend things on one margin will exacerbate                    things on the other.     A creation    incentive,    by

itself, would exacerbate         excessive   destruction     by increasing      rents as well as the probability

of capturing      those rents. A protection       subsidy, by itself, would reduce destruction             but make

the private factor costs of creation           even higher.       Only a combination       of the two can restore

eficiency.   11

    An application       of this approach      to the problem       of managing      macroeconomic       adjustment
can be found in Caballero          and Hammour        (1996 b). In that paper, we argue that adjustment

must be managed          through     a combination      of creation      incentives     and protection     measures

for the existing      structure.     A purely     gradualist       approach,    which can be thought          of as a

single policy-instrument         approach      to slowing down creation,         is deficient    in that it does not

address — and actually           exacerbates     — the need to accelerate           creation.



3     Business           Cycles:          Slack and Bottlenecks

In this section     we analyze      the effect of unprotected         specificity     on the economy’s      response

to aggregate      shocks.     Although    our simple setup does not allow a full dynamic                 analysis,     it

yields important      insights into the economy’s          cyclical features. 12 We consider the effect of an

exogenous      shock to gross revenues gn, which may either affect the economy’s                         “fundamen-

tals” or may be due to a distortion             of the “aggregate      demand”       or “aggregate     supply”     type

(e.g., a tax on gross output). 13 We focus more closely on the capital/labor                          interpretation

of our two factors.         For our purposes,     the main distinguishing           feature between      capital    and

labor is that the supply of (uncommitted)              capital is relatively        more elastic than labor.

Assumption          2 (Capital/Labor)             The two factors        are capital     (k)    and labor (1),       We


  llThere are many ways to implement the above “canonical” policies, taking into consideration the econ-
omy’s regulatory and institutional context in which they operate. For example, if new and pre-existing
units cannot be se~egated by policy, the above can be replaced by a production subsidy up and a creation
subsidyuc: UP* =Oo” anduc” =U”*–           OP*.
  12A dimension that our setup is ill designed for is the analysis of gross employment flows over the cycle,
which requires a full inter-temporal analysis. We examine this question in Caballero and Hammour (1994,
1996a).
  13The shock may or may not affect the revenues ~ of pre-existing units. This would be relevant for an
analysis of gross flows over the cycle, which our setup is not designed to address.

assume      that uncommitted         capital is more elastic than labor, and that both capital and labor

exhibit some specificity:

                                                          ?lk>~l;                                                        (24)


                                               #k>O         and       @l>O.                                              (25)


Unemployment        and shortages

How do factor       employment         patterns    evolve over the cycle?                First, it is easy to show that,

as expected,     higher levels of revenue are associated                    with higher levels of Joint-Production

employment:
                                                         dE
                                                         —>0.
                                                         dyn

More interestingly,        the following    proposition          states that, as revenue and employment                  rise,

the economy        turns    from     a situation        where      the labor         market   is segmented       and Joint-

Production       investment     is the limiting         factor     for expansion         to a situation       where   capital

is segmented      and labor shortages          are the limiting           factor.


Proposition        8 (Unemployment                and    Shortages)            There exists a level y“ b of revenues

yn that satisfies    balanced-specificity         condition       (19).    In an incomplete-contracts           equilibrium,

ify”    <ynb    the lGbGr market is segmented;              if yn > ynb the capital market is segmented.


Yn b corresponds     to the level of revenues implicitly                  defined in proposition        2, at which there

is zero net appropriation            and the incomplete-contracts                   economy   is efficient.    At levels of

activity    below yn b capital       is appropriated,       while at levels higher than yn b labor is appro-

priated.     As the economy          expands      and crosses the level of activity                 yn b, it turns from        a

situation    of involuntary     labor unemployment               and capital shortages          for job-creation,     to one

of labor-market      shortages       and segmentation            in capital markets.

       How should one interpret         the possibility       of segmented           capital markets?     It is a situation

where capital      could    obtain    a higher return if invested                   in Joint Production       but is unable

to find the requisite       labor. 14 In terms of the stock-market                      valuation    of Joint-Production

units, Tobin’s     q is 1 when yn < yn b and greater than 1 when y“ > yn b (even though                                there


   140ne expects contracting problems to be less severe when labor is appropriated than when capital is. The
reason is that labor is “inalienable, ” while capital is not. Thus, when labor is appropriated, some capital may
be transferred to the worker to convince him to commit to a production unit; when capital is appropriated,
the reverse transfer of labor to capital is infeasible. Although, in practice, this may not constitute a perfect
solution because of asymmetric information and other reasons, it gives reason to believe that capital-market
segment ation is more likely to be alleviated at the macroeconomic level than labor-market segment ation.



                                                              19
are no explicit     adjustment       costs).   Periods of labor-market              shortages     are times of expensive

stock-market      valuations.

    Although      the level of revenues yn b seems arbitrary,                    we argue in section        4 that, in the

long run, institutional       and technological         evolution        are likely to result in a situation           where

Yn b is within the range of revenues in which the economy                          fluctuates.    Institutions     are likely

to respond to correct        any imbalance         in appropriation          that cause macroeconomic            inefficiency

to rise beyond      a certain point;       and technologies        will also be developed            that allow efficient

production      with new factor        proportions      that reduce this imbalance.                On both       counts,    one

does not expect       yn b to be far removed          in the long run from the economy’s                  average level of

output .

    The     next proposition      characterizes        the economy’s            cyclical   responsiveness        at different

levels of activity.


Proposition        9 (Elastification/Rigidification)                     The economy’s        cyclical response      is “elas-

tified”   when the labor market           is segmented,         and      ‘(rigidijied”     when the capital market              is

segmented:

When      labor suffers from involuntary            unemployment,             the incomplete-contracts           economy      is

more responsive       to shocks than an efficient economy;                     when labor is the short factor,              the

economy’s      cyclical   response    is more rigid than in the efficient case,                   Thus,   appropriability

exacerbates     recessions      and brings about         unnecessarily          severe and involuntary           unemploy-

ment,     while it constrains        expansions      by creating        labor     shortages      that prevent      sufficient

investment     in new jobs.      The balanced-specificity             level of employment           Eb associated          with

Yn b is analogous     to the concept       of a “natural       rate.”        It is the level of employment          at which

the labor market functions            effectively    within    the economy           — it neither builds up the ex-

cessive slack of involuntary          unemployment         nor constitutes           a bottleneck    for the rest of the

economy.

    An intuition for why proposition               9 holds can be drawn from the under-employment                      result

(proposition     3). As illustrated      in figure 1, we know that when y“ = yn b employment                           in the

incomplete-contracts         economy      is equal to that in the efficient economy,                 while for yn # Yn b

employment       is lower than efficient on both              sides of y n b.15 Thus ~ revenues              expand         and

it) to the left of yn b, then expands slower (to fall short again) to the right of y“ b. On both

sides under-employment               is due to one of the factors constraining               employment        of the other.

At low revenue levels it is capital — the more elmtic                        of the two factors — whose binding

free-entry      condition      constrains    labor employment,            and induces       excessive      elasticity     in the

economy’s       response;     while at high revenue levels, it is labor — the less elastic factor — that

constrains      growth      and induces      a rigid response.

    Two interesting          implications     follow from proposition           9. The first is a simple application

of Jensen’s      inequality.     Because     of the asymmetry          in the economy’s         cyclical     responsiveness

at low and high levels of activity,           an increase in the volatility            of aggregate     shocks around yn b

inefficiently     lowers average Joint-Production               employment            and output.     This     “level”     effect

can lead to high costs of macroeconomic                    instability.

    Second,      the economy         will exhibit an asymmetric            cyclical    response to a symmetric             shock

process.     Figure 2 gives a stylized representation               of the model’s         implications      for symmetric

cycle     in revenues       around    y ~ b.16 The two curves represent                the sequence        of (static)      equi-

librium     employment         levels that correspond         to each revenue level over the cycle,                    with the

curves’     averages shown as a straight           line. The dashed curve represents                  the response         of an

efficient economy,          which is symmetric       around the average employment                    level Eb. The solid

curve represents         the response       of the incomplete-contracts           economy.      It is asymmetric,           with

excessive     elasticity     at low activity     levels and excessive          rigidity    at high activity       levels, and

exhibits     lower average log-employment                than the efficient economy.            The resulting            cyclical

pattern      is reminiscent      of asymmetries          documented        for the US business cycle,            such as the

apparent        asymmetry       in the economy’s         response     to negative        and positive      oil-price     shocks.

Sichel (1992),         for example,      characterizes     post-war       fluctuations     in US output        as consisting
of three phases:         contractions,      high-growth     recoveries      to pre-recession     levels, and moderate-

growth      periods.     The corresponding         pattern     in figure 2 are the relatively              sharp and short

recession-recovery          phases below average E, and the shallow                      and more prolonged             phase of

moderate        expansion      above it.

Stabilization      policy

There is a strong case for trimming              recessions in the presence of appropriability,                  irrespective

of whether       the adverse shock affects fundamentals                   or is due to an aggregate            distortion      —

i.e., whether       it affects the “central planner”                  problem     or not. When a shock to fundamentals

brings    employment           below      Eb, proposition             7 indicates     that the optimal          response    to labor

unemployment           and sclerosis is to apply creation                    and employment          intent ives. This is all the

more necessary          in the presence         of a distortionary             shock, since an efficient economy              should

not contract        at all in that case.

      The appropriate           policy     response     during expansions              is more ambiguous.          If the shock is

distortionary,       it should      be stabilized.         However,           if the favorable       shock is to fundamentals

and takes the economy               beyond       En b, proposition             7 again prescribes          a combination       of ex-

pansionary        incentives     that reduce the economy’s                   bottlenecks       and allow it to expand beyond

its “natural”        rate.    Thus, while recessions                  are always inefficiently          severe, expansions         may

well be “golden          opportunities”          that call for reinforcement                   rather    than stabilization.        In

this sense, recessions          should be systematically                   trimmed,     while much greater care should be

taken not to curtail real opportunities                    for expansion.17



4      Institutional                and Technological                             Evolution

In the short         term,     factors’     net specificity            Ai varies mostly           as a result     of the general-

equilibrium        response     of Autarky       prices to changes in macroeconomic                        conditions.     Over the

medium      and long term, however, institutional                          and technological       forces are likely to directly

affect net specificity          through       changes     in unitary           specificity     (the ~i ‘s) and through         factor

substitution        (z~/z~ ).     This      section    explores         the long-run          institutional     and technological

responses       to the problem           of appropriability.


4.1       An     Institutional            Balancing             Act

Institutions       arise as the rules that govern                     the transactions          between       agents or groups      of

agents.     At the level of individual                 transactions           between    workers        and firms, institutional

arrangements         often arise as ways to improve                     efficiency    by alleviating      appropriability      prob-

lems and “minimizing             transactions         costs.”     Institutions        also develop      to regulate interactions

between        “coalitions”     of labor and capital owners, be it at the level of corporate                             governance

(e.g., firm-union        bargaining         or corporatist        representation)            or at the political     level through

the legal and regulatory            environment           (e.g., right-to-strike             or severance-pay      legislation).    In


   I’See De Long and Summers (1988), e.g., for a related view of business cycles as “repeated transient
and potentially avoidable lapses from sustainable levels of output” and of good policy as aiming to “filling
troughs without shaving peaks” (p. 438).


                                                                      22
this function,      institutions     can play a distributional            as well as an efficiency         role, and embody

the entrenched        interests of different groups.la

      This section tries to account for the labor and capital interest-group                            incentives to develop

institutions     that affect their mutual “specificity.”                 Although     interest groups may be strongly

driven by distributional           concerns,     we argue that the institutional             outcome       is unlikely to drift

very far from balanced            specificity.

The politics      of capital and labor

Institutional      arrangements        can reinforce        the effective     specificity     of one factor with respect

to another      by allocating        rights (e.g., the right not to lose one’s job                      “without   cause”)     or

by making       otherwise     femible       contracts      unenforceable      (e.g., the unenforceability           of worker

commitment         to long-term       employment           contracts).       In order to capture           this institutional

dimension       of specificity,     we think of the ~i’s as having               an institutional         component     which

is, to a large extent,        a political        choice    variable.     We analyze         different    groups’   interest    in

changing    the ~i ‘s.

      Since institutions      typically        take time to evolve,          at this stage we think             of the single

period    in our model      as representing         the long nn.          We view this “long run” as an attractor

that pulls evolutionary           forces.    From this perspective,           initial conditions         matter less and we

may assume that there are no pre-existing                     units:lg

Assumption          3 (Long        Run)      There are no pre-ezisting            units: EO = O.

      In order to get to the incentives              of different      interest-groups,        we denote      by Wi the ag-

gregate    income     of each of the factors.             Under assumption          3, it is easy to see that


                                       Wi = W~Ei +pi(l              – Ei),     i = 1, k.                                     (27)


The    first term     is the income         of units of factor           i engaged     in Joint Production,           and the

second    term is the income          of units in Autarky. 20 The interest of factor i as a whole is to


   IsRecent analyses of the politics of institutional development include Robinson (1995, 1996), who analyzes
the politics of labor-market institutions; and Roe (1994), who gives a political interpretation to the origins
of US corporate governance arrangements.
   19ThW we view pr~e~sting ~nit~ as powerfd enough to affect the time and speed at which institutions
evolve and, perhaps, the precise limit to which institutions converge, but not powerful enough to change
the basic course of long-run institutional developments.
  ZO~l + Wk do not add up to aggregate income w as defined in (23). The difference corresponds to ‘he

income ~i=l,k Fi (Ui) – pi Ui that accrues the “shadow” factor implicit in our decreasing-returns assumption
on the Autarky production functions Fi(Ui).       We do not consider the political incentives of this third
“factor.”

maximize               Wi, but there are distributional               issues within each group in the presence of market

segmentation.               The argument            for maximizing        Wi in the “long run” is that it represents                the

factor’s         unconditional          expected      income. 21 We also analyze the ez post incentives                       of factor

owners in Joint Production                     and Autarky.


Proposition                10 (Interest         Groups)         For each factor           i =   1, k, consider      the problem       of

finding         the pairs (#1, #k) E [0, 1]2 that maximize                       the ex ante aggregate factor            income     W~

arising in the corresponding                    incomplete-contracts            equilibrium.

      (i) There is a line segment that crosses the parameter                                space (@l, ok) E [0, 1]2 and along

which any point maximizes                      Wa.     To all points         on that segment       there corresponds          a unique

measure               A = ~[il >0       oj net effective     specificity y in favor        of factor   i, and a unique level of

Joint-Production                  employment        E = 21il.

      (ii)      A unit of factor             i employed     ex post          in Autarky     receives   pi,    which is maximized

for   any pair (41, ~k) ● [0, 1]2 that yields an eficient                            equilibrium;      while a unit of factor             i

employed              ex post in Joint Production            receives w;,       which always increases           with ~~i and falls

with da.


      The first part of this proposition                   states that each factor i, as a whole, would choose                       an

institutional             arrangement         that creates      ir.   equilibrium
                                                                                net specificity              ~Iil z O in its favor.

The factor              has an incentive       to capture       rents at the cost of a socially              less efficient macroe-

conomic               outcome.      There    is, in fact, a whole line in (@l, ~k)-space               that yields any desired

level of net specificity                (recall that Ai = @ipixi – d~ip~ix~t ).                  The different       configurations

along this line may correspond                       to widely different degrees of institutional                “rigidity”     — i.e.,

different             abilities to accommodate          in the short run changes in the macroeconomic                         environ-

ment.        It is not difficult to conceive             of situations        where the historical       evolution     process does

not lead to the most                   “flexible”     configurate ion — i.e., the configuration                with the lowest ~1

and ~k.

      The political              incentive   for each factor to appropriate            rents has its limits.        The reason for

this is stated in the second part of the proposition.                            Inherently,     a factor’s    attempt   to capture

rents results in own-market                   segmentation,           and creates winners and losers within the interest

group.        The winners            are “insiders”      employed         in Joint Production,         whose     ez post incentive


  21we       ~~~ume        that interest ~roupS ~eco~nize the general- equzlibtiu~              impact (on ~i’s and ~~‘S) of ‘heir
political choices. Although “partial-equilibrium myopia” can undoubtedly play an important role in the
political process, our assumption captures the idea that interest groups will partly anticipate and partly
adjust to the general-equilibrium consequences of their choices.



                                                                        24
from rent appropriation              is unlimited;       the losers are “outsiders”        who remain in Autarky,               and

whose      ez post incentive         is to minimize         macroeconomic         inefficiency.     It is therefore        through

the internal segmentation              of the appropriating            factor that macroeconomic              efficiency     enters

its ez ante objective           function      and limits its incentive        for rent appropriation.

     The     degree      to which        institutions       can deviate     from     balanced       specificity    is therefore

bounded.        If in the long run political                power     lies with    ez ante interest          groups,      ~[~1 and
~1~1 represent upper bounds                  on capital’s     and labor’s long-run        net specificity.        Beyond      those

limits, both factors would attempt                   to reduce the degree of appropriation                  in the economy.zz

It is in this sense that we expect institutional                    forces to perform       a “balancing        act,”    and keep

the economy          from deviating          too far away from balanced            specificity.

Institutional       rigidity

Institutions        are slow to evolve and adapt, and they often react to crises rather than antic-

ipate them.         Even though        large and persistent           changes in the macroeconomic                environment

would      eventually      lead to institutional             adjustment,     in the meantime               it is proposition          8

(unemployment/shortages)                  that determines        the fortunes        of different    factors of production.

Suppose,      for example,         that the political       outcome     leads to a situation         of balanced        specificity

for a certain        expected      level of yn.      If realized yn is less than expected,                  the labor      market

will be segmented;             and if realized       yn is more than expected,              the capital        market      will be

segmented.

     This mismatch             between       the frequency      at which institutions             react    and that      at which

shocks     occur,      together      with our analysis of the incomplete-contracts                        economy’s      response

to shocks,      naturally         fits with accounts         of European      macroeconomic               performance       in the

postwar      period.     The European           experience     in the fifties and sixties was one where vigorous

growth     (high yn) allowed the development                   of welfare-state       institutions        that benefited      labor

in its relationship        with capital        (high ~~) without          much cost in terms of unemployment                      or

resistance     on the part of capital.            In fact Europe         exhibited     signs of labor shortages             during

that period,        which necessitated           a substantial        flow of immigrant       labor.       The seventies        and

eighties were a period of negative aggregate shocks, often contractionary                                 policy, and produc-

tivity   slowdown        (volatile    and low yn). The institutions               that evolved        after the war became

a burden      on the labor market and gave rise to a serious unemployment                                   problem      (proposi-

                                                                 25
tion 8). The institutional           framework       has responded,       but quite slowly as it faced resistance

from secure      “insiders.”       Unions,   for example,       are today much weaker than they used to be.

Technology       also seems to have adjusted with substantial                    capital-labor      substitution,    a point

we come to in the next section.                  In the meantime,        proposition      7 recommends        introducing

large job-creation        incentives,     while the requisite         “protection      subsidies”     are probably      more

than provided       for by existing job-protection              legislation     (which, unlike pure subsidies,          have

the unfortunate         effect of effectively      increasing      capital specificity)     .23


4.2      Technological             Development:             Factor      Exclusion         and     Withdrawal

Although       fixed in the short run, technology               is a major      dimension       along which production

units can adapt to the appropriability                   problem.     In this respect,       a central    mpect     of tech-

nology    is relative     factor    intensity,     Even though        available     technologies      may allow limited

factor substitution       in the short run, new technologies              can be developed          that allow a broader

menu of factor       intensities.       In this paper, we consider            an extreme        form of this dichotomy,

and assume fixed proportions              in the short run and infinite elasticity                of substitution     in the

long run. This section          asks the question,         how will technology         choice respond       to the appro-

priability     problem,    and how will that response               in turn affect macroeconomic             equilibrium?

Our analysis       can also be used to shed light on the consequences                         of allowing     some factor

substitution     in the short run.

Technological      possibilities

From a long-run         perspective,     we assume a technological              menu characterized         by a constant-

returns function        yn (Zk, xl ) that essentially        relates productivity         to relative factor intensity;

and a function       ~i (Zk, Zl), i = k, 1, that is homogeneous                 of degree zero and relates unitary

specificity    to relative     factor    intensity   (see below).        In the short run, Zk and Z[ are fixed,

so ~n and ~i are fixed; in the long run, those variables                        result from technology         choice    and

development.       We assume the following               functional    forms.

Assumption         4 (Technological              Menu)      The long-run        technological     menu is characterized

                  yn(z~, z[)        =    ~a(zk+ Zl),         a>O;


  23some ~ountrie~have opted for increased unemployment benefits, which amounts to subsidizing the ‘eg-
mented factor’s Autarky sector and exacerbates the approprial.rility problem. This mechanism, it is argued,
may have played an important role in the persistence of European unemployment (see, e.g., Blanchard and
Jimeno 1995 and Ball 1996).


                                                              26
     The      long-run             technological      menu ~n(~k, zl)            for production        is linear,     which     captures

maximum            possibilities        of long-run      factor substitution.           Because      of constant      returns the size

of production              units is immaterial,          so an appropriate            normalization        allows us to identify            a

technology          by its embodied           capital/labor        ratio.

     Unitary         specificity        ~i(~k, zr) also depends              on technology         and is a function      of the capi-

tal/labor         ratio.     If a unit of capital,           for example,         works with more labor, it is likely to be

more specialized               with respect         to the latter.        The presumption             is thus that the degree           to

which each unit of capital is specific to labor increases with the technology’s                                       labor intensity.

The strength              of this effect is captured            by the parameter             p.    As an example,        consider      the

possibility        of substituting          generic machines            for specifically      trained    workers.      Capital     speci-

ficity    arises if the firm finances                  workers’     relationship-specific            training.      As machines        are

substituted         for workers,          the share #~ of specific               training    in total capital       investment       falls.

An institutional              example       arises when capital              specificity    derives from legislated           severance

pay. If severance              pay is fixed in monetary            terms, it effectively           makes ~k proportional           to the

labor/capital          ratio.24

     Our presentation                 does not aim at full generality,                but focuses on selected          cases that are

indicative        of the mechanisms                likely to be at work more generally.                   With      this in mind,      we

replace     assumptions               1 and 2 with assumption                1‘/2’:

Assumption                 1’/2’      (Parameter         Configuration)               We ~estrict our analysis to the follow-

ing parameter              configurations:          (i) as    1; (ii) ~k = ql = q> O; and (iii) p ~ {O, 1}.

The upper-bound                    (i) on the productivity          parameter          a guarantees        that equilibrium          with

technology         choice is an intetior             equilibrium.        The elasticity-based           distinction     between      cap-

ital and labor             is not central          to the results in this section,                and ~sumption         (ii) simplifies

things by assuming that both factors have equal elmticity                                    q. Assumption          (iii) restricts the

parameter          p in the unitary-specificity                 function       ~~(Zk, z~) to two values,            1 or 0,     We t ake

the first value, for which unitary specificity                       does depend            on relative factor use, as our base

case.     Specifically,            the functional       form implies,           for example,       that total capital         specificity

+k(zk,    Zl)zk      is    proportional       to total labor use xl (i.e., ~k(~~, ~~)~k = j~z~),                       as would indi-
cate our training              and severance-pay             examples     above.      We contrast       this with the case p = O,


   24Another reason why efiectiue specificity may depend on factor proportions is that relative bargaining
strength may not be independent of the capital/labor ratio either.



                                                                        27
where unit ary specificity y does not depend                   on relative factor use.



       Equilibrium     with technology        choice

       How is equilibrium         determined      with technology            choice?     Suppose      temporarily     that any

point on the technology            menu were available.            Then each factor would select the technology

that maximizes          its factor      income    in Joint Production,             subject      to the other factor        being

willing to participate.          In other words, Zi units of factor z would choose


                                                                                                                             (28)


where ‘W~(Zk, Z~) and ~~~(~k, Z1) are given by (8)-(9).                          As we discuss below,            optimization

together       with equilibrium         free entry determine          the technology           that new production         units
.   if given the choice — would select from the technological                              menu.      The question      is, will

that    technology      be actually        developed?          We do not model            in any detail        the process      of

technological       development         and adoption.          Instead,     we rely on a simple long-run             principle:

if there is unanimity           in all new production            relationships         about     a single technology,      then

that technology         will be developed.           Since all new production                  relationships    in our model

are identical,       they would         select the same technology              and, according         to the “unanimity”

principle,      that technology         will be developed.

       With     this in mind, we define an (interior)                incomplete-contracts           equilibrium      with tech-
nology
     choiceas a set              of variables     (XI,   XZ,    C, E, El,       E2, PI, P21 w~~ w~~ ~ 0, that satisfy
tethnology-choice            problems     (28), the normalization             Z1 = 1, as well as the conditions               for

an (interior)      incomplete-contracts          equilibrium,        We define an (interior)           efficient equilibrium
with technology         choice in the same manner.

    As stated in proposition              13 below, there will still be some parameter                    configurations      for

which specificity       is balanced        in equilibrium        and other configurations             for which one of the

factors       appropriates     the other and experiences               market segmentation.              Section     6.5 of the

appendix        shows that, in the first case, technology                  is determined       in equilibrium      by the joint

jree-ent~       conditions     of the two factors        (the first-order       conditions       for (28) generally     serving

to identify      the constraints’       shadow price).         In the second case, technology              is determined      by

the first-order      condition     of the appropriated           factor:


Proposition          11 (Appropriate         ion and       Technology)            Suppose        that factor    i is appropri-

ated (i. e., Ai > O) in an incomplete-contracts                    equilibrium     with technology         choice.    Then the



                                                                28
equilibrium          choice    of technology       Xk/xl is determined             exclusively      by factor    i‘s unconstrained

optimization          problem      maxz.i~o{w~          (Zk, xl)z~ }, given equilibrium pk and P1.


The intuition           behind     proposition         11 is simple.        Since its free-entry             condition     holds     with

equality,      the appropriated             factor     i breaks      even with its optimal              technology         and would

suffer a loss with any other technology.                       The other factor               has therefore      no choice         but to

accept      factor     i’s preferred       technology. 25 Although                different    in that it is purely a market-

equilibrium          outcome,      this result is akin to the idea in the property-rights                           literature       that

control     rights are often             optimally      deposited        with the agent who must make the largest

specific    investment          (see, e.g., Grossman          and Hart 1986; Dow 1993).

    Before      characterizing            equilibrium      with technology              choice,    we address the question              of

existence      and uniqueness:

Proposition            1’ (Existence             and Uniqueness)            An incomplete-contracts               equilibrium with

technology       choice        exists,    is unique,       and satisfies          C, Ei, Ua >       0, z =      1,2. An          eficient

equilibrium      with technology            choice      exists, is unique,         and satisjies      C*, E,*, Uz~>0,            i = 1,2,


Exclusion      and withdrawal

The problem           of appropriability          can cause an inefficient technology                 to be chosen.        It is simple

to see that, because             we have assumed full symmetry                     between        the two factors,        the efficient

choice     of technology         h=      Zk/Xl    = 1. With incomplete               contracts,      this capital/labor           ratio is

generally     distorted:

Proposition            12 (Exclusion             and    Withdrawal)               Suppose     the economy         initially      has bal-

anced specificity             and the eficient          technology       xk/x[      =    1. An institutional             shifi    against
factor     i takes place,        causing ~i > $-i.         Define     the “short-run”             response     (superscript        “s.T.”)

as the incomplete-contracts                 equilibrium      outcome       with fixed technology             (Zk/X~ = 1); and the

‘(long-run”      response        (superscript          ‘1.r. ”) as the incomplete-contracts                  equilibrium         outcome

with technology          choice.

    Let factor      z (capital,     for concreteness)       experience     a detrimental        shift in specificity      pa-

rameters      — i.e., a increase in ~i or a decrease ~~i.                From proposition         3, we know that the

short-run      response     with fixed technology          is under-employment:           E~”T. and E~~~” are lower

than efficient      and the capital/labor         ratio ZjT /zU~        = 1 remains fixed.         In the long run, an

inefficient    technology      will be chosen.       In the base case p = 1, capital will be substituted                  for

labor leading to an inefficiently           high capital/labor         ratio Z~T /Z~.       The partial       “exclusion”

of labor from Joint Production              exacerbates          its under-employment       (E~~ < E~l~ ), and can

also be shown         to alleviate     the underemployment             of capital     (Ei~,r, > Ef.~.) .26 Excluding

labor helps reduce the net specificity               of each unit of capital,       and reduce appropriable            rents.

By contrast,       if unitary specificity      did not depend on relative factor use, as is the case when

p = O, then the opposite            would happen.        The capital/labor         ratio would be inefficiently          low,

as capital       “withdraws”       from Joint Production            in an attempt     to capture      a bigger piece of

quasi-rents      per own unit.

    The rationale       behind exclusion        and withdrawal         in proposition     12 can be made clearer if

we use the accounting           identity yn = ~~~k + w~z~ together with (21) to rewrite the objective

function      in (28) for appropriated         factor z as




where Ai (~k, Zl) is given by (13).              The first term expresses            i’s objective     function    from      a

social   point    of view (i.e., based on the other fact or’s social shadow                     cost p~i);    the second

term — net effective specificity           — captures       the private distortion       to that objective        function

due to rent appropriation.            How does the second term distort                the resulting      technology?        If

p = 1, it is easy to see that the effect of changing                    factor    proportions     on net specificity        is

given by dAi/dzTi         >0.      Excluding    the other factor helps reduce net effective               specificity.      If

p = O, the opposite         would hold.      In both cases rent appropriation              is reduced,       but replaced

by a problem        of distorted     capital/labor      ratio.

    This analysis of the technological               response to rent appropriation          can shed light on some

aspects of high unemployment              in Europe.       The rise of unemployment             in the 1970s is gener-

ally considered       a result of oil shocks and of the productivity                 slowdown        on economies       that

had developed        labor-market       institutions     better     adapted      to an era of rapid growth.          Wage


  z61n fact    with our ~~~umption of infinite elasticity of factor substitution,          technology choice will cause
capital to ~e over-employed compared to the efficient outcome.                But this result is not robust, and would
disappear for lower elasticities of substitution,

resistance      to adjustment         caused    an increase        in the labor share of national          incomes    and a

contraction       in employment.          In the 1980s the labor share reversed its course and declined

sharply,     but unemployment             kept rising (see, e.g., Blanchard              and Katz      1996).    The labor

share of value added in French manufacturing,                         for example,      rose from 61 to 68 percent           in

the 1970s, but then declined              to 58 percent        by the end of the 1980s. One plausible                driving

force behind       this phenomenon          is a technological            response   to appropriability      characterized

by labor exclusion:          As capital     is substituted          for labor,   the labor share declines        while un-

employment        rises.    Looking       again at the example             of France,    one finds evidence        of strong

capital/labor      substitution.       Between       1970 and 1990, the capital/labor             ratio in French man-

ufacturing      increased     by 122 percent versus 88 percent in the US. Normalized                        by the capital

labor ratio in the trade sector,               the increase was 25 percent              in France versus 8 percent           in

the US.27

Balanced-specificity         region

As does institutional         development,        the introduction         of technologies   with new factor-intensity

characteristics     may help balance specificity               and eliminate         market segmentation        in the long

run. The following          proposition     characterizes       the region in the space of specificity          parameters

(~~,?l)    in which effective specificity            is balanced      with technology        choice.


Proposition         13 (Balanced-Specificity                  Region)        For the incomplete-contracts            equilib-

rium with technology            choice,    define     the    “eficient”      set & ~    [0, 1)2 as the set of parame-

ters (~k, ~1) for which equilibrium                 is eflcient;      and define the      “balanced-specificity”       set B
~ [O, 1)2 as the set of parameters               (~k, 71) for which A = O in equilibrium.

    (i) The eficient         set&     is the line ~k = ~l;

    (ii) The balanced-specificity              set includes,       but is not generally      equal to, the eficient        set:

If q > 1, then & c B c              [0, 1)2; if q S 1, then & = BIP=I C f31p=0 C [0, 1)2 (where                            “c”

denotes    strict inclusion).


Statement       (i) of the proposition          identifies     the efficient set & with the line ~~ = @l, which

is intuitive     since we have assumed               everything       else to be symmetric         for the two factors.

From proposition           2, we know that with fixed technology                 the balanced-specificity        set would

also correspond      to a line. In the long run, technology                   choice can expand        the possibilities     of


  Z7Another piece of evidence on labor shares that is consistent with the exclusion effect is the strong negative
correlation observed between wage premia and the labor share of value added in US industry (see Krueger
and Summers 1988, and Katz and Summers 1989). If part of the wage premium reflects specific quasi-rents,
the associated low labor share may be the result of a labor exclusion response to rent appropriation,


                                                                31
balanced       specificity       and turn the line into a broader                         cone,      illustrated        in figure 3.28 As stated

in (ii),     the balanced-specificity                    set ~ with        technology            choice       can generally             cover        a region

broader       than     the efficient           line t.    The     reason        is that      A can be reduced                  to zero through               the

adoption       of technologies             with     suboptimal            relative        factor      intensities.            Technology            choice       is

therefore      another         reason why analyzing                    the economy            near a balanced-specificity                       point can

be reasonable.

        However,      there are limits to the degree to which factor substitution                                              allows specificity             to

be balanced          in equilibrium.             Going      back       to the objective              function         (29),    using     factor        substi-

tution      to reduce         rent appropriation             Ai is costly           for the efficiency                term yn (Zk, Zl ) – P-ix=i.

As factor       substitution            is relied on to offset appropriation,                             there may come                a point where

the resulting          marginal           inefficiency       is greater            than the marginal                  reduction          in appropria-

tion.      For this reason         the set f3 does              not generally           cover        the full parameter                space.         Market

segmentation           can arise even with                 an infinite         elasticity     of factor          substitution.

        There is a sense in which balancing                       specificity        is more difficult             with factor         exclusion         than

with      withdrawal.          This     is because         general-equilibrium                   forces      offset     the partial-equilibrium

rebalancing          effect    of exclusion          when         P =     1, while        they       reinforce        the effect        of withdrawal

when p = O. Taking                      into     account        the     general-equilibrium                  variables         that     determine            net

effective     specificity        Ai (Zk, Tl; Pk, pl)         in (13),         it is straightforward                   to see that 8Ai/8pi                    > 0

and dAi/dp~i            <0.       Thus, if z is the appropriated                        factor,       the general-equilibrium                        effect of

exclusion,       which        causes pi to rise and p-i                       to fall, is to increase                 Ai      and     partly        offset    its

partial      equilibrium         effect     when         P = 1. The           general       equilibrium            effect     of withdrawal              on Pi

and p=i is the opposite,                  and helps reduce Ai further when p = O. Thus the former results

in greater      distortions         in factor        intensity         than     the latter.

        A measure        of the       strength           of the       general      equilibrium            effect      of exclusion             on    relative

prices      is how    low the elasticity             q of factor          supplies        is. 29 Consider             the base case P = 1. As

the proposition           states, when q > 1, the balanced-specificity                                       region B is great er than the

efficient     line &; but when              q ~ 1, region B coincides                     with &. The strong general-equilibrium

effect eliminates             any possibility            of balancing           specificity          outside       the efficient          line.       In fact

one can show           that,    in the case q s 1,the exclusion                           effect actually             worsens         segmentation            of

the     appropriating          factor      =i outside        the efficient           line,    i.e.     u~-     – p~           > w~~ – PIJ              in the

notation      of proposition            12. This         is because,       by (20),         segmentation              is equal      to A/Z~i,           which

(i.e., reduction      ofz_~)to       decrease   A. Thus, exclusion          of theappropriating        factor    through

lead to greater factor segmentation.



5     Conclusion

The prevalence        of specificity     in economic    relationships        makes rent appropriation            a prime

suspect      for a wide range of economic          ills. In this paper we have tried to provide                 a simple,

synthetic     characterization       of the multidimensional           macroeconomic       problem     it gives rise to.

    Why       do economies       waste unemployed           resources    during     recessions?     Why    is there in-

voluntary      unemployment          and labor market segmentation                at all? Why do some economies

“over-heat”      at even modest levels of growth?            Why do countries build social institutions              that

are later perceived       as obstacles     to flexible adjustment?          Why do some countries           seem stuck

with a highly outdated           productive     structure?        Why is the massive destruction          of reforming

countries’     old productive     systems not matched by immediate                  and significant   creation?     Why

are methods      of production       (e.g., capital/labor      ratios) so different across economies            that are,

otherwise,     at a similar stage of development?                 Why do poor countries           with cheap labor so

often fail to attract      capital     and grow?

    It is certainly    not inconceivable        that part of the answer to those apparently               disconnected

questions     could be traced back to appropriable                 quasi-rents.     As this paper argues, each of

the phenomena         those questions      touch upon may reflect a different              aspect of the economy’s

general-equilibrium        response     to widespread        opportunism.

6.1       Construction              of Equilibrium          in Section             2

This     section     derives     a constructive      characterization          of incomplete-contracts                and efficient

equilibria    that will prove useful in what follows.                        An incomplete-contracts               equilibrium       is

constructed         in the following     manner.       First use equations             (3) and (6) to define functions


                                           p2(E) = (z2E)1/~’ ,               i = 1,2,                                          (30)


that     give pi = pa(E)          in equilibrium.       fii (E)    is continuous,         strictly      increasing,     and takes

values fii (0) = O and ~i (+m)            = +w.       Now free-entry           condition     (14), which is equivalent            to

(12), can be written           as




Given     that O S ~j          S 1, j =     1,2,     it is clear that the function                j(E)     inherits     the above

properties     of ~i(E):         it is continuous,     strictly        increasing,      and takes values f(0)             = O and

j(+m)      = +m.       Since Yn >0,       this implies that free-entry               condition     (31) taken with equality
yields a unique positive            value of E. It is easy to check that the other equilibrium                            variables

(C,E,,~z,PI,Pz,~?,~8,U                0, are determined           uniquely     as a function       of E from the remaining

equilibrium        conditions.

       Free-entry     condition      (14) can also be thought             of as relating employment                E = E(A)      to

net specificity       — a relation that will prove useful. The function                          E(A)     is implicitly    defined

by

                                           9“ = ~l(fi)zl          + P2(fi)z2     + A.

It is continuous        and strictly     decreasing,

      An eficient      equilibrium corresponds           to an incomplete-contracts                  equilibrium       with a con-

figuration    of (@l, 42) that yields A = O (which                      includes       the configuration        ~1 = 42 = O).

To see this, one can first easily check that the definition                            of an efficient equilibrium           corre-

sponds     to that of an incomplete-contracts               equilibrium         if A = O. In particular,              the function

E(A)      defined     above takes value E* when A = O. Conversely,                            A = O is necessary             for an




                                                                  34
incomplete-contracts            equilibrium       to be efficient because,         since E(A)      is strictly    decreasing,

E(A)      # E“ if A # O.


6.2       Proofs         of Propositions            in Section        2

Proof      of proposition            1:     The existence       and uniqueness         of an incomplete-contracts        equi-

librium        was shown       by construction         in section      6.1.     It was also shown        that     an efficient

equilibrium           corresponds        to an incomplete-contracts           equilibrium      with ~1 = ~z = O (among

other     possible       (@l, @z)-configurations),         which therefore         guarantees     existence      and unique-

ness. It remains to be shown that C, E~, U~, > 0, i = 1,2 (C*, E;, U: >0                                 follows by setting

~1 =+2         =0).
      First,    we show that C > 0, for which,                    by (2), it is sufficient       to show that E > E“.

Define the function




One can easily show that g(E)                     > f(E)        (defined    in (31))     and g’(E),   j’(E)      > 0, for all

E.      Since    .ZE is defined      in assumption         1 as the solution           to y“   = g(~E)    and equilibrium

employment            is the solution        to yn =    f(E),      we must have ZE < E.               Thus       E“   < ZE in

assumption            1 implies E“ < E.

      Second,        Ei = ZiE >0           follows from E >0,         which was shown in section              6.1. Third,    to

show that Ui = 1 – Ei > 0, we show that Zg in assumption                                 1 is the minimum         value of y“

for which the eficient              equilibrium     exhibits     zero Autarky       employment        (Ei = 1) for one of

the factors.          To see this, note that, by substituting                 (30) in (10) (taken with equality),           the

minimum         y“ for which E: = 1 is




ZV is simply the minimum                  of the above expression          for i = 1,2. Thus yn < ZV in assumption

1 implies       E:     < 1. Since proposition          3 (proved       below)     states that Ei s        E;,    this implies

Ez<l.       n

Proof      of proposition           2:     The first part of the proposition           — that an incomplete-contracts

equilibrium          is efficient iff A = O — was proved in section                 6.1. What      we still need to show

is that this is equivalent           to parameter      condition      (19).    Solving    (10) and (18) simultaneously




                                                                 35
for (P1,P2),      we get
                                                                 47,      yn
                                                    pi =
                                                            +l+~z~i’               2=1,2”

If we replace this expression                for pi in (6) and use the fact that E1/zl                            = E2/zz     (see equation

(3)),    we obtain     condition         (19) in the proposition.                 ❑

Proof      of proposition             3:      Recall       from section          6.1 that E = E(A)                   in equilibrium,       and

that     ~(A)     <0       and E(O)          = E*.         This implies           that an inefficient               incomplete-contracts

equilibrium,       in which A >0              by proposition             2, must have E = S(A)                    < E(O) = E*. By (3),

this implies that Ei < E:,                  z = 1,2. ❑

                                                      ac




By      (14) taken with equality,                  the first expression            is equal to A, which                 is positive    in an

inefficient     equilibrium      (by proposition                  2).     By     (16),       the second          expression     is equal    to

–D’(~O)       [Al (w; – pl) + A2 (w; – p2)], which is negative                                  in an inefficient        equilibrium       (by

proposition       4 and Al, A2 > O). ❑

6.3       Proofs        of Propositions                in Section       3

Proof      of proposition           8:     From condition           (19) for efficiency,       we solve for ynb:




To determine         which      factor     is segmented,         rewrite    (13)   in terms      of functions       (30):     Ak   =

~kZk~k(E)       – ~lZl~l(E).        By differentiating           this expression      at a point      where     Ak = O, we get




which     is negative     given   that     qk > ql. Noting          that    E is an increasing        function     of yn (which

follows immediately            from equation yn = f(E)              in section 6.1), and that Ak = O at the unique

value for yn = yn b, we get Ak >0                       (i.e., the labor market is segmented                by proposition         4)

when yn < yn b; and Ak <0                  (i.e., the capital market is segmented)                  when ym > yn b. •l

Proof      of proposition           9:     Suppose       that yn # yn b and that i is the appropriated                      factor.
Then free-entry         condition        (12) holds with equality for factor i. Substituting                      functions     (30)

for the pj’s    and totally       differentiating         with respect to E and yn, we get


                           dyn                                                                      dE

                                                                               – d.i)p.iz.i

The corresponding          equation       for the efficient      equilibrium       is obtained     by setting     ~i = 4T; = O.

Comparing       those     two equations,           it is clear that

6.4       Proof         of the       Proposition               in Section         4.1

Proof      of proposition             10:           (z) Factor i’ aggregate income (27) can be written as a function

of the other factor’s              net specificity        Ai:


                              W.(A=i)          = max{A_~,O}z~~               (lA=il)    +fiz (~(lA-ii))            ,



taking     into account            (3),    (21),      and the definitions         of pi(.)       and ~ (.) in section            6.1.   Since

~     > 0 and 5          < 0, it is clear that Wi(0)                    > Wi(A~i)          for any A-i            < 0.     SO Wi(A=i)         is

maximized          for a non-negative                value ~~{ of A-i          — i.e., net effective             specificity     in favor of

        (ii) For a unit of factor               i employed          in Autarky,        ex-post    income         pi = pi (E(lA1il))           ‘s
maximized          at the efficient value of A-Z = O, again because                               fli > 0 and ~’ < 0. For a unit

employed       in Joint Production,                   we show that ez-post              income        w? is always increasing             with

A-i      (which,    it is easy to see from (33), is increasing                          with ~Ti and decreasing                with ~i).      If

A?a <0,       we know by proposition                    4 that W? = pi = ~i (~(lAil)),                   whichincreases            withAi

the accounting           identity         yn = w~xi       + w~ix~i,     we write        W; =

6.5        Mathematical                   Appendix             to   Section       4.2

This appendix           provides          a proof for propositions           11, 12, 13, and 1’, in that order.                Equilibrium

incomplete-contracts              equilibrium       with technology          choice;    B corresponds          to parameters        for

which equilibrium           is characterized         by balanced          specificity     (A = O).

Proof      of Proposition             11:      Suppose       (Tk, 71) ● Ai.        Proposition         4 shows that, with the
equilibrium      technology         Z/c/Xl, factor Z’S market clears and factor -Z ‘S market is segmented.

This means that the constraint                     w~i > p-i      to factor      i’s technology-choice           problem        (28) is

    Is this technology            consistent       with factor     -i’s     technology         choice problem?           Since factor

technology      can yield a positive value for w? –pi.                    Therefore     constraint      qualification       for factor

=i’s problem         does not hold, and the associated                    first-order     conditions     are not necessary.          ❑


    We can now determine                    equilibrium      quantities       (and prices)       in regions      dk,     dk,    and B.

in B, it is sufficient       by continuity        to check ~i >0         on that line. TO do SO, we use expression
(35) for ~(w~Zi)/dZTi            and a similarly         derived expression        for ~w~i/~x_i:




Since both       factors    are symmetric         when $k = $1, it is e~y              to see — using a/2         = Pi = P~i

The proof of the proposition              follows directly from comparing                  (40) with (37) if (~~, @l) ● Ai,

        We now characterize            the boundaries        that delimit            the different    regions    in parameter

space.      We start by determining            all the “smooth”              boundaries        — i.e., boundaries      at which

equilibrium       variables     are continuous       functions           of the parameters         (j~, ~1). Note first that

any point that smoothly                separates   Ak and Al must be included                    in B (otherwise      the flip in

factor-market       segmentation          would involve        a discontinuity).           We can therefore        restrict    our

attention      to smooth       boundaries     that separate region 23 from regions 4,                     z = k, 1.

    At any point            (~k, ~1) along such a boundary,                 equilibrium        must satisfy equations         (37)

and (39) simultaneously.               Equating    Ei/ETi          as determined        by each of those two equations,

a smooth       boundary       must satisfy




= long as ~i~=i # O and 1 + l/q – 2p # O (otherwise                          it must satisfy the continuous           extension

?a = ~~i = O). In the space of parameters                      (j~, jl)       ● [0, 1), such a boundary           starts at the
origin and must remain on the side of the 45 degree line where @i z ~Ti.                                     Points    between

the 45 degree       line and the boundary              are in 23, and points between                 the boundary       and the

~i-axis     are in ~.       (If this were not so, then a point such as (~i, ~~i) = (1, O) would not be

in Ai.)     It is easy to check that this configuration                     holds if p = O, or if p = 1 and q >0                (a

direct consequence           of the fact that hP (z) ● [0,1) iff O < z <1,                      in this case);   and does not

hold if p = 1 and q <0             (in this cme hi(z)          E [0,1) iff z > 1). By symmetry,                  the set d-i      is

a mirror image of di.

    Thus, if p = O, or p = 1 and q >0,                   the set B lies between                the two boundaries       (41) for

i = k, 1, and is flanked by the sets dk and Al on each side. If p = 1 and q ~ O, no smooth

boundaries       exist (other     than at the origin).              The set B corresponds            to the 45 degree line,

and the sets Ai to the space between                   that line and the ~i-axis.

Proof       of proposition         13:      Statement       (i):     Since the two factors           are symmetric,      a nec-

essary condition        for efficiency      is a symmetric              technology     Z~/Zl    = 1. Looking       at (39) and

(37),     it is clear that ~/c/~1        = 1 only if ~1 = ~~. But ~1 = ~k is also a sufficient                        condition
for efficiency,    because,      given the efficient technology,               proposition        2 shows that equilibrium

quantities     are efficient.     Thus the efficient set & corresponds                    to the line ~1 = ~k.

    Statement        (ii)    follows     immediately      from          the above      characterization      of the different



                                                                   41

Proof       of proposition          1’:    Existence   of an incomplete-contracts          equilibrium      with tech-

nology      choice    was shown       above by construction.          Uniqueness     follows from      (i) the unique

determination          of regions Ak, Al, and B (a point in region dk cannot                 also be in region Al

because      the two sets lie on opposite         sides of the 45 degree line; and cannot be in B because

the latter contains the 45 degree line, and smooth                   boundaries     (41) are unique if they exist);

and (ii) the unique determination               of equilibrium       variables    in each of those regions          (based

on (37) for region ~             and on (39) for region 23).

      We turn to the interior-equilibrium               properties     C, E~, U~ >     0, i =     k, 1.   Because       we

have assumed           that there are no pre-existing             units (assumption     3), C > 0 follows            from

Ei >0       by (2)-(3);    and E~ >0        follows from a >0        in equations    (37) (recalling      that ~i < 1)

and (39).         Ui = 1 – Ei > 0 follows          from a < 1 in equations            (37) and (39)       (noting     that

(1+     @-i)/(1      + @~~l/’)    cannot    be greater than 2).
      The above existence,          uniqueness,    and interior-equilibrium          properties    also apply to an

efficient    equilibrium     with technology       choice,   since it simply corresponds          to the special       pa-

rameter      configuration       ~~ = ok. ❑
