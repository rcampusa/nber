  THE ROLE OF WORLD WAR II IN THE RISE OF WOMEN'S WORK


                               ABSTRACT


   The 1940's were a turning point in married women's labor force
participation, leading many to credit World War II with spurring
economic and social change. This paper uses information from two
retrospective surveys, one in 1944 and another in 1951, to resolve the
role of World War II in the rise of women's paid work.
    More than 50% of all married women working in 1950 had been
employed in 1940, and more than half of the decade's new entrants
joined the labor force after the war. Of those women who entered the
labor force during the war, almost half exited before 1950. Employment
during World War Il did not enhance a woman's earnings in 1950 in a
manner consistent with most hypotheses about the war. Considerable
persistence in the labor force and in occupations during the turbulent
1940's is displayed for women working in 1950, similar to findings for
the periods both before and after. World War Il had several significant
indirect impacts on women's employment, but its direct influence
appears considerably more modest.

              Why married women leave their households and enter paid employment is central to

    the history of the labor force. The proportion of married women engaged in paid work in the

    United States increased more than tenfold during the past century, from less than 5% in 1890

    to more than 60%! Much of the increased employment occurred in the years after 1940, and

    the 1940's mark an apparent break with the past in terms of women's work. The participation

    rate in 1940 of white married women 35 to 44 years old was 13.8% but was 25,3% in 1950, and

    most age groups experienced unprecedented increases of 10 percentage points during the
    1940's.

              The 1940's, it would appear, were a watershed in married women's labor force

    participation. The timing of the initial advance in women's employment and the extensive

    propaganda used to attract women into the labor force during the war, have led many to credit

    World War II with spurring the modern increase in married women's paid employment. This

    paper uses information from two retrospective surveys, one in 1944 and another in 1951, to

    resolve the role of World War II in the rise of women's paid work.



    Long-Run Changes in Women's Employment

              Over the long run, married women joined the paid labor force because of a series of

    changes affecting the nature of work (Goldin 1983, 1990). Primary among these was the rise

    of the clerical and professional sectors and the increased education of women at the beginning

    of the twentieth century. Reinforcing this movement were secularly declining fertility rates, labor-

    saving advances in household production, declining hours of work, and rising real wages for

    all Americans. The end result stemmed, then, from two sets of variables: cohort factors and

    contemporaneous (or period) effects. Advances in education, altered fertility patterns, and



     'Although one can quibble with the accuracy of the data for the earliest date (Goldin 1986, 1990),
an extensive movement of adult women out of the home and into the paid labor force is undeniable.
Various adjustments affect primarily the paid labor of women within the home and on family farms, not
their paid employment in the modern sector.

                                                     I
changed socialization of young women are cohort factors, which affect particular birth cohorts

without necessarily influencing the entire society and economy. Changes in the sectorai

distribution of labor, the earnings of families, unemployment, hours of work, urbanization, and

the wages offered women workers are often contemporaneous factors, which affect all cohorts

at a particular date in history.

        Various pooled cross-section, time-series models have been estimated to separate these

various effects. Cohort-specific factors, in one such study, account for about one-third or more

of the total change over time (Goldin 1983, 1990; see also Smith and Ward 1984, 1985). If the

models used in these studies are correct representations of the complex forces that resulted

in the rise of paid women's work, the large increase in adult women's participation in the 1950's

had roots in an earlier era. To understand why women participated in the 1950's requires

knowledge of changes in the lives of these women some thirty years before. The observed

increase in the 1950's was, in some sense, the tip of an iceberg. Much of the large increase

was due to contemporaneous factors — the heightened post-war demand for labor, the increase

in real wages of women, and the decrease in unemployment. But many of the factors were

hidden from view.

        Several factors, however, delayed the increased labor force participation of women,

particularly older married women. The Depression was a major setback for married women.

"Marriage bars" -- the stated policies of firms, school districts, governments, and other
institutions not to hire married women and to fire single women upon marriage — were instituted

long before the I 930's but were expanded during the Depression as a means of rationing

employment in a "fair" manner. There is some evidence that the bars delayed the increase

in adult women's employment (see Goldin 1988). The bars vanished sometime after the early

1940's and by the 1950's were rarely encountered.




                                              2
   World War II and the Rise of Married Women's Work

            The various explanations offered for the rise of married women's paid employment still

   leave room for the impact of cataclysmic and unique events, such as World War II. Possible

   roles for World War II can be found on both the supply and demand sides of the market.

   Women were drawn into the war-time economy through a variety of mechanisms. For some,

   increased wages, in general and specifically for women, were the main factor.2 A husband's

   absence meant a wife had less to do in the home, and patriotic duty was reason enough for

   others to join the war effort. Once in the labor market, various factors led women to remain

   employed.

            On the supply side are various investments women made during the war, such as in

   job training and alternative housekeeping arrangements, that decreased the costs and increased

   the gains to post-war work. Other factors, still dimly understood, also operated to entice

   working women to remain in the labor force (see Goldin 1989, Smith and Ward 1984). Some

   might concern norms against a woman working by society or by her husband. As John Durand

    remarked when the impact of wartime employment was still uncertain, "It is not likely that the

   increase during the war period will be a complete exception to the rule . . . that a generation

   of women which once adopts a greater degree of participation in gainful employment tends to

    retain that characteristic throughout its potential working life" (Durand 1948, p. 168).

            On the demand side, the war may have demonstrated to employers that women

   workers could function well in jobs that had previously been male domains. In fact, the ratio

   of female to male hourly wages in manufacturing continued to rise to 1948, "suggesting that

   factories which had overcome traditional stereotypes about the unsuitability of women were

   trying to keep women just as they were leaving the labor force" (Campbell 1984, p. 136).



    2
              hourly earnings of female manufacturing workers across 25 industries rose relative to that
for male workers from 1943 to 1948 (U.S. Bureau of the Census 1975) and the earnings premium for
war-related over consumer-related manufacturing was between 25% and 45% in 1944/45, depending
on the war production area (U.S. Department of Labor 1946, p. 44).

                                                   3
        There is substantial evidence that a pervasive ideology inhibited work for married

women prior to 1950. And if the impediments to economic change were primarily ideological,

then only a major break with the past, such as that effected by war, could have redefined

economic roles. Many historians, including William Chafe, have concluded that World War II

was that "watershed event." To Chafe, World War II "radically transformed the economic

outlook of women" with an impact greater than even "the implementation of a well-developed

ideology" (Chafe 1972, pp. 195, 135).

        Until recently, Chafe's view was well accepted. It accorded with the timing of the

increase in women's work and with the sense of those who lived through the 1940's that

something fundamental changed in American society.          In the past decade, however, a
revisionist literature has emerged discounting the importance of World War II in inexorably

altering the lives of American women (Anderson 1981, Campbell 1984, Milkman 1987).

        American patriotism and inflated female wages during the war induced many women

to enter the labor force, but they were not, according to this new literature, tQ become

permanent participants. According to Campbell, "It is difficult to argue that World War II, in

itself, constituted a watershed in the experience of American women," (1984, p. 236). Many

of the jobs women were offered during the war — Rosie the Riveter's is the perfect illustration

-- were taken away from them at its conclusion and were not in sectors women had previously

shown a desire to enter. Women had not been craft workers before the war and had been

leaving the manufacturing sector for clerical, sales, and professional jobs ever since the early

twentieth century. The rhetoric of wartime mobilization led many to believe there was real

change, when in actuality, according to this new interpretation, there was none. Reinforcing

the revisionist view on the role of World War II are the findings, summarized above, on secular

changes in the evolution of the female labor force.

        The hypothesis that World War II was a significant factor in the rise of women's work

has been tested in a time-series and cross-section model, by the inclusion of a single dummy


                                              4
   variable for 1950 (Goldin 1990). The coefficient on the dummy variable was small and not

   significant in all estimations.3 The method used was dictated by the available data, which are

   decadal rather than annual. The difficult question of whether the war had a residual impact,

   apart from reducing the Depression's high unemployment and increasing the wages of
   Americans, may be impossible to answer with these data The strongest conclusion one can

   draw from past analyses, then, is that World War II, by itself, had a small, possibly negligible,

   positive impact. The large change in participation from 1940 to 1950 seems to have been due

   to the indirect effect of the war on the economy and to the aging of cohorts ripe for labor force

   participation.
            But even though the conclusion is fully consistent with an emerging historical literature,

   the data available may be insufficient to account for this far-reaching event. Had the data been

   annual, rather than decadal, the precise role of the war could have been assessed, and its

   impact on various cohorts could have been traced.4

            I have recently found a data set that contains retrospective work histories for 4,350

   women, working full-time for at least one month in 1950, and that has most of the information




     ' The model contains 37 observations, one for each cohort alive in each census year. When full-
time female wages are included in the model (as well as education, unemployment, the sectoral
distribution of the work force, and fertility, among other factors), the labor force participation rate
increased by 0.0261 percentage points due to the "war dummy" (around a mean of 0.22). When
female earnings are excluded, the war has no effect.

      See, for example, the econometric techniques used by Joshi, Layard, and Owen (1985) on British
data and Smith and Ward (1984, 1985) on U.S. data to deal with the problem of serial correlation in
a pooled cross-section, time-series analysis of annual data. Joshi at al. include a set of cohort
dummies in a first-stage regression to explain within-cohort effects, and then use the cohort dummies
in a second-stage regression to explain across-cohort differences. Smith and Ward estimate a similar
first-stage equation in first-difference form from which they calculate cohort fixed-effects. These are then
used in a second-stage regression to estimate across-cohort differences.
             In their second-stage equation, Joshi et al. (1985, table 9) test whether cohorts of British
women who were 20 to 29 years during World War II had changed labor force participation. "The
Second World War enormously increased women's participation in all kinds of work [in Britain].. . . The
experience of warwork led many women (especially in their twenties) to acquire skills they would not
otherwise have acquired. This," they hypothesize, "must have made many of them more willing to work
later" (p. S168). They find a small, positive impact of the war, but do not discuss the finding.

     complementary set of data, in tabular form only and contained in Women's Bureau Special

     Bulletin No. 20 (Department of Labor 1944), are from a special question asked in the March

     1944 Monthly Report on the Labor Force.8 The remainder of this paper will discuss what these

     data reveal.



     Retrospective Data on Work Histories, 1940 to 1951: The Palmer Survey and Women's Bureau
     Special Bulletin No. 20

             The individual-level data come from a study directed by Gladys Palmer (1954), with the

     assistance of the US. Bureau of the Census, that assessed labor turnover and geographic

     mobility in the 1940's.7 Coded versions of the original schedules, located at the University of

    Pennsylvania, have been put in machine-readable form. The data give information on the work

    histories of a probability-sample of urban women in the United States from 1940 to 1951.8

            The coded schedules summarize much of the data in the original surveys, and the

    information they contain can be grouped in two categories: retrospective and contemporaneous

    variables. Among the retrospective variables are: the occupation and industry of work (if the




      The original Palmer study also surveyed over 9,000 men, and the coded schedules for both men
and women will be archived at Temple University Urban Archives in the papers of Gladys Palmer. See
also Palmer (1954).

     • Women's Bureau Special Bulletin No. 20 did not list the official name of the census report but
it seems likely that it was the Monthly Report on the Labor Force, aprecursor of the Current Population
Survey.

     ' The Palmer Survey, funded in part by the U.S. Air Force, was intended to provide the Air Force
with information about geographic mobility across labor markets. Six cities were selected for study: two
in the East (New Haven, Philadelphia), two in the Mid West (Chicago, St. Paul), and two in the West
(Los Angeles, San Francisco). The title of the published study was Labor Mobility in Six Cities (Palmer
1954). Curiously, the final report did not investigate the role of World War II in the lives of American
women.

    8 The
          original schedules, not all of which have been located, contained detailed work histories.
Although many of the coded schedules include transcribed versions of these accounts, they are difficult
to read and transcribe, and only the coded portions have been used.

woman was in the labor force) as of January 1940, December 1944, December 1949, and

January 1951. Occupation and industry are also grven for the longest job in 1950, the longest

job over the work history, the longest job from 1940 to 1949, and the woman's first job.
Summary information is provided on months in the labor force from January 1940 to December

1949, the number of jobs during the same period, and the year in which work began prior to

1940. Variables pertaining to the individual in 1950, what might be called contemporaneous

variables, include earnings at the longest full-time job in 1950 (unless the woman were self-

employed), education, marital status, age, number of children less than 18 years, years living

in the current area, and father's occupation and industry. Some of the contemporaneous

variables probably did not change over the preceding decade (education, for example, for

women older than 34 years in 1950). But some probably did (marital status, for example). An

important, and somewhat limiting, aspect of the Palmer Survey is that all persons were working

full-time for at least one month during 1950. The March 1944 census data are used to infer

the work histories of women who were not in the labor force during 1950.

        The central issue to address with these data is whether women who entered the labor

force during World War II remained employed to 1950 and were, thereby, the main contributors

to the vastly increased labor force participation of married women in 1950. An alternative

scenario is that many women employed during the war left the labor force at its conclusion and

that much of the sustained increase in employment by 1950 came from a post-war movement

of women into the labor force. Part of this issue can be addressed with the Palmer Survey

data, that concerning the work histories of women employed as of 1950; the remaining issues

are answered with the 1944 census data I begin with the Palmer Survey.

        Consider, first, the work histories of white women, married by 1950 and between the

ages of 35 and 64 in 1950. They were, therefore, 25 to 54 years old in 1940, at the start of

the retrospective information. Recall that all these women were employed during 1950. The

issue, then, is the progressive increase in the labor force for those at work in 1950. How many


                                              7
 entered during World War II, how many were drawn in after, and how do the groups differ from

 each other?

           Although the entire Palmer Survey contains 4,350 women, just 1,198 were marned,

 white, and between 35 and 64 years old (and, of course, working) in 1950. Of those working

 in 1950, fully 52% were also in the 1940 labor force. That is, half of those working in 1950 had

 also worked prior to America's entry into World War II. From 1940 to 1944 7% of the eventual

 1950 participants left the labor force, but 22% of the 1950 workers joined during the war years.

Thus part of the decade's increased participation occurred from 1940 to 1944, the peak year

of women's involvement in the wartime economy, But an even greater increase occurred in the

six years from 1944 to 1950, which includes the demobilization period. Fully 26% of marned

women workers (35 to 64 years old) in 1950 were drawn into the labor force between 1944
and 1950.

           The retention rate of those in the labor force in 1944 (and, recall, also employed in

1950) was high; only 8% of those working in 1944 had exited by 1949. More importantly, the

entry rate was high. By 1944, 33% of those who would eventually be employed in 1950 were

still out of the labor force. Even between 1949 and 1950 there was an increase in the

employment of married, white women that accounts for 15% of their eventual employment as
of 1950.

           In sum, among married white women who were employed in 1950, fully half were

employed in 1940. The war was associated with a large increase in employment, but it was

smaller than that occurring from 1944 to 1950, which was 33% of the eventual 1950 labor force.

Fully 26% of the 1950 participants were never employed during 1940 to 1944. Table 1
summarizes the data for the 35 to 64 year old age group and for two subsets.

        Another important feature of these retrospective work histories is the remarkable

persistence of women in the work force. Summary data, from the coded forms for the Palmer

Survey, on total months worked from January 1940 to December 1949, are given in Table 2.

    More than 80% of the women employed during January 1940, December 1944, and December

    1949 had worked between 9 and 10 years during the 1940's decade. Fully 72% were employed

    every month of the decade, one-halt of whom stayed on the same job for all 10 years (not in

    table). Only 5% were employed fewer than 6 years.

            Also revealed in Table 2 is that 52% of those who entered the labor force by 1944

    accumulated 7 or more years of work experience over the decade. Only 12.5% had less than

    5 years of work experience. The only reasonable inference to be drawn is that the majority of

    these women were continual participants from the time they entered the work force until 1950.

    Also consistent with this view is that the majority of those not employed in 1940 and 1944, yet

    who were working in 1949, had been employed For rather short durations during the 1940's.

    Almost 94% of this group had worked less than 5 years.

            Because a large fraction of those working in 1950 were also employed in 1940, and had

    been continuously employed during the decade, the increase in the participation rate over the

    decade -- nearly a doubling among most of the age groups and cohorts — must have come

    about by the entrance of women who had not been in the labor force in recent years.9 The

    main inference from Table 2 is that married women who were 35 to 64 years old (and

    employed) in 1950 did not transit in and out of the labor force with much rapidity even during

    the 1940's. A slight qualification to this statement will be made concerning the participation of

    a young group of married women just after Pearl Harbor.

            Persistence has been recently discovered in data for employed women in the period

    prior to 1940 (001dm 1989, 1990) and after 1950 (Smith and Ward 1984). Married and adult

    women once in the labor market tend not to leave. Although the data in Table 2 demonstrate



       One possible problem is that the inference comes from the aggregate labor force participation
rate among white married women in the cohorts considered. The Palmer Survey data, however, do not
give the length of time a woman was married, just whether she was married in 1950. It is assumed,
therefore, that a very large fraction of women who were married by 1950 and 45 to 54 years old in 1950
were also married in 1940 when they were 35 to 44 years old. The same inference would be more

    persistence for women employed by 1950, the question is whether this was also true of all

    women in the 1940's.

            The data in Tables 1 and 2 do not reveal the number of women who entered the labor

    force during the 1940's yet who exited by 1950. One possibility is that increased wages and

    patriotic sentiment led women to enter the labor force during World War II, and that, once in

    the labor force, women did not leave. Even though a minority of employed women (22%) in

    1950 had entered the labor force from 1940 to 1944, they may have been a large fraction of

    the women who were employed at all during the war. Another possibility is that a large fraction

    of women who entered the labor force during the war left during demobilization.

           An analysis of turnover among women during World War II requires additional data

   concerning those not in the labor force in 1950. Such data are available from a special

   question asked in the March 1944 Monthly Report on the Labor Force. At the request of the

   Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor, the Bureau of the Census asked women in 1944

   what they were doing the week preceding Pearl Harbor, December 1-6, 1941.10 The census

   data yield labor force transitions from December 1941 (henceforth 1942) to March 1944, the first

   two sets of branches in Table 3. The Palmer Survey contains information on the distribution

   of those "in the labor force," that is "In," during 1950. By dMding the Palmer Survey numbers

   by the relevant labor force participation rate in 1950 and then inflating further for comparability

   with the census data, one can easily obtain the entire transition matrix. Two such transition

   trees are given in Table 3 -- one for married women 20 to 44 years old in 1944 and another

   for women of all marital statuses in this age group.

           The linkage of the census data with the Palmer Survey is not without possible biases,

   and the biases seem more severe for married women. The Palmer Survey listed a woman's




    10 The Bureau of the Census chose December 1-6, 1941, because they thought women would
remember what they were doing the week before Pearl Harbor better than any other week just prior to
America's entry into World War II.

C All numbers are in thousands and are the actual numbers of women in the age and marital status
group in or out of the labor force.

  The figures of 18.2 and 21.6 are from census data (U.S. Department of Labor, 1944). The increase
from 1940 to 1944 was greater. Among white, married women 18 to 44 years old in 1940, the labor
force participation rate was 15.3. The figure of 24.0 for 1950 is from U.S. Bureau of the Census (1953)
and is for women of all races.




Notes and Sources:

The data for December 1941 (1942) and 1944 are from U.S. Department of Labor (1944) and are
derived from census data. The data for 1950 are derived from the Palmer Survey (see text for a
description of the sample). The Palmer Survey gives only the number of women in the "In" branches
for 1950. The total number for all the branches in 1950 is derived by dividing by the aggregate labor
force participation rate (e.g., 32.5% for all women in 1950) and a blow-up factor is then computed for
consistency with the national data for 1942 and 1944. For example, the Palmer Survey number for the
In-In-In branch in 1950 for all women is 1,492. The aggregate number of women in the labor force in
this age group is 3,185 using the Palmer Survey and dividing by the aggregate labor force participation
rate of 0.325 gives 9,800 women, including those not in the labor force. But the entire population of
women (from the census data for 1944) is 26,776, which gives a blow-up factor of 2.73. The original
number 1,492 x 2.73 = 4,077.
    marital status in 1950 but not in any of the previous years. Young married women in 1950 were

    likely to have been unmarried in 1944. Because the census data are given only for women 20

    to 44 years old and those greater than 44 years in 1944, one cannot use older age groups to

    get around this problem. The only solution is to use the Palmer Survey data for women in a

    slightly older group, 30 to 50 years old, rather 26 to 50 years, in 1950.11

            The primary reason for constructing the tree diagrams in Table 3 is to compute the

    percentage of women drawn into the labor force during World War II who remained employed

    to 1950. The data for married women indicate that almost 90% of the women employed in 1942

    and 1944 were similarly engaged in 1950. (The persistence rate drops to 83% when only white

    women are considered.) The data, once again, reinforce the findings of other studies that show

    a tendency of women in the labor force to remain employed.

           There is, however, a substantial attrition of employed married women from 1942 to

    1944, when 35% of women employed just before the war exited. The decreased employment

    among this group deserves further comment. Because the census data include young women

    and give marital status in 1944, but not 1942, many of these women may have been married

   just after Pearl Harbor. Others, married before Pearl Harbor, may have become pregnant to

   enable their husbands to be deferred from the draft. The reasoning accords well with the

   finding, also in Table 3, that women of all marital statuses who were 20 to 44 years old in 1944,

   had a persistence rate of more than 80% from 1942 to 1944. The war years, however, do

   appear peculiar with regard to persistence of women workers.

           Of greater interest is how women working in 1944, but out of the labor force on the eve

   of World War II, responded at the war's conclusion. These may be called the "Rosies" of the

   war effort and are contained in the "Out-In" branch, from 1942 to 1944. In 1944, this group

   contained 45% of married women workers 20 to 44 years old (but 34% of all women workers




       Other possible biases may stem from the fact that the women in the Palmer Survey were all
residents of large cities, while the data in the census are a national sample.

                                                  11
  20 to 44 years old). Part of the reason the new entrants were such a large proportion of all

  working married women is that a large fraction left the labor force after Pearl Harbor, although

  it is also true that the entry rate among those "Out" in 1942 (12%) is higherthan in 1944 (8%).

          Of the war-time entrants, only 53% of the marned women remained employed to 1950

  (64% of women of all marital statuses did). The "Rosies" of 1944 composed 22% of the
  eventual 1950 employment among married women, but, at that time, they were barelyhalf their

  original number.12 Rosie and her compatriots did not remain in the post-war labor force to the

   degree entrants had in normal times.

           Aspects of the exodus are well known. Many women were forced out of high-paying

   jobs in traditionally male industries, such as aircraft and machinery, through seniority systems

   that favored returning servicemen (Milkman 1987). But the relative magnitude of those who

   remained in the labor force and those who exited had previously not been known. Women

   employed in wartime industries could have been pushed out at the war's conclusion but been

   reemployed in other sectors, and it is this possibility that has dominated one interpretation of

   the war's impact. Increased employment of women during the war, according to an extensive

   literature, greatly affected their employment after. But the data in Table 3 indicate that almost

   half the wartime entrants had exited the labor force by 1950. Their rate of exit is considerably

   higher than that experienced by women employed in both 1942 and 1944.




     12 The conclusion that about half of all the wartime entrants left the war before 1950 is duplicated
in an analysis of the Palmer Survey data supplemented with aggregate labor force information from the
Current Population Reports (U.S. Bureau of the Census n.d.). In that analysis, performed before I
discovered the data in Women's Bureau Special Bulletin No. 20. the trees of Table 3 are underidentified
by one branch. Information from the Palmer Survey on the survival in the labor force of women from
1950 to 1951 is used to identify all branches. The analysis can only be done for women of all marital
statuses.

 Occupations and Earnings of Women Workers, 1940 to 1950

         Occupation distributions for 1944 and the persistence women demonstrated in them are

 given in Table 4. In general, women remained employed in a particular occupational group

 from year to year even during the turbulent 1940's. More than 90% of women in operatrve

 positions in 1942 remained in them to 1944. Among the least persistent, not surprisingly, were

those in the operative group in 1944, who remained in that category to 1949 and were

employed in 1940, 1949, and 1950. The divergent findings regarding industrial jobs during

and after the war are to be expected. It is the persistence across the spectrum ofoccupations

that is surprising. Among all women employed in 1940, few, it seems, altered their occupations

during and after the war. Of those employed in both 1942 and 1944, only 14% changed their

major occupational group, and of those employed in 1944 and 1949, only 15% did.

        Also of interest in Table 4 is the occupational distribution of those who entered the

labor force during the war years. Rosie the Riveter and her fellow workers are apparent in the

37% who were operatives and craft workers in 1944 among those not in the labor force in 1942,

a figure that is 10 percentage points higher than among those in the labor force in 1940 and

1950 (column 7).

        In discussing occupational and labor force persistence during the 1940's, one should

not forget that there was a substantial shift of workers across industries and often across

sectors. Fully 1 in 6 women working in 1944 was in a war-related industry (e.g., fabricated

metals, airplane assembly), and even in the Palmer Survey, which includes only those in the

labor force in 1950, 1 in 6.26 or 16% were in these industries in 1944 (U.S. Department of Labor

1944, p. 26). One-third of the Palmer Survey women, however, were not operatives and craft

workers, but were in clerical positions. Among those in the Palmer Survey in war-related

industries in 1944, 45% (> 24 years in 1950) were not in the labor force in 1940 and 36% of

those more than 34 years old in 1950 were. There was greater persistence in the war-related

sector than has previously been thought. Of those in war-related Industries in 1944 and also

could have been in or out of the labor force in 1940.
in the labor force in 1950, 45% remained in war-related industries (e.g., metals, rubber,

chemicals) in 1950 and 66% were in the manufactunng sector in general.

        Large differences in the occupational distributions of female workers exist between those

who entered in 1944 and those who were employed in 1940 or 1942. New entrants (Table 4,

column 4) were far less likely to be in the professional and managerial groups, and more likely

to be in the operative and service groups, than those previously employed. The group of

wartime entrants who exited the labor force by 1950, as was just demonstrated, were a

substantial group. Although there are enough conditional distributions in Table 4 to prove that

this group was rather different from those who remained employed, the computation of the

precise distribution is complicated. It is likely that 67% of the Rosies who exited at the warps

conclusion were operatives and domestics in 1944, a figure substantially higher than that for

other groups. Among all new entrants the figure is 55% and among those who remained

employed to 1950 it is 47%.

        It is even clearer from the bottom portion of Table 5 that diffc'rences in the occupational

distributions among the new entrants and those previously employed had less to do with

changes in the economy than in difference among the individuals. Women who were not in

the labor force in 1940 had rather similar occupational distributions, when employed, in both

1944 and 1950, as did those who were in the labor force in 1940 and in various subsequent

years. But differences in the occupational distributions between the two groups are substantial.

        The reason for the large differences in occupations among those employed in 1940 and

those not, can be found in Table 5. The Palmer Survey clearly shows that women employed

in 1940 and during any other date in the survey, were considerably more educated and had

far fewer children than were those not in the labor force in 1940, but who entered at some

subsequent date. There is more than a one-half year difference in education between those

who were employed in 1940 and those who were not, twice as many had attended college, and

one-third more had graduated high school. Because many of these women's children were

Notes: The number of observations refers to the age variable and differs somewhat by variable. The
condition for inclusion in this table is whether the individual was employed, rather than in the labor
force at a particular date. individuals employed in 1940 and 1950, for example, were not necessarily
employed in 1944. The column for those employed in 1940 and during 1950 is virtually identical to that
for 1940 alone because all women were at work in 1950. The difference is in the occupational
distribution which is specific to the year.
 older than 18 years by 1950, and thus not included in the survey's question, it is useful to

 consider only the younger group in comparing the number of children. The differences here

 are much greater. Of those less than 45 years old in 1950, the mean number of children under

 18 years old was 1,78 for those in the labor force in 1950 but not working in 1940 and 1944;

 it was only 0.48 for those in the labor force in 1940 and 1944.

         Even though the increase in employment among those working in 1950 was greater

 after World War II than during the war, there is still the question of whether wartime
                                                                                          employment
 increased women's marketable skills. One way of testing this hypothesis, and also of evaluating

the determinants of earnings during the 1940's, is to estimate a standard earnings function that

includes variables to reflect a woman's participation during the war. Columns (1) and (2) of

Table 6 contain such regressions.

         The functions estimated are similar to those in other studies of earnings. The

dependent variable is the log of weekly earnings for the longest full-time job in 1950. The

sample for the column (1) estimates includes, therefore, all white, tiurried women in the Palmer

Survey who meet the age criterion. Work experience across the 1940's decade increased

earnings by 3.5% for each year and schooling increased earnings by 2.3%, again for each year.

High school graduation and college attendance added little extra (although see column 2

results). Continuity in a particular geographic area had benefits; moving away from a home of

25 years meant a woman forfeited 7% of her income.

        Of particular interest for this study is the variable indicating whether a woman had

entered the labor force between 1940 and 1944 and its interaction with age. Earnings for the

wartime entrants were higher (although not statistically significant) for those under 45 years

(.2601.00577), but lower for those over 45 years. According to these coefficients, a 29-year-

old woman (born in 1915) who began employment in 1944 earned a 9% premium for the rest

      of her working life in relation to a comparable individual who entered prior to 1940.

                But note that there is nothing unusual about the War. An even larger premium exists

     for a woman less than 43 years (.626/.0145) who entered the labor force between 1944 and

      1949. A 32-year-old woman (again born in 1915), who entered the labor force in 1947 earned

     a 16% premium in comparison with a woman who entered prior to 1940 and a 7% premium in

     comparison with the woman above who entered in j944l Even though one of these women

     has 3 more years of job experience, the difference in their earnings is only 3.6%. These results

     suggest a vintage effect in new hires and, perhaps, that women over age 45 were less able to

     adapt to new technologies or were discriminated against at the time of hire. I have not
     encountered a similar variable included in earnings functions using recent longitudinal data and

     therefore do not know if the result is a product of the timeperiod or is a more pervasive vintage

     effect.

               The regression of column (2) contains a variable indicating whetherthe woman was in

    the same occupation in 1940 and 1950. The sample,
                                                               therefore, ncludes only (white, marred)
    women employed in 1940. There was a 9% premium for remaining in the same occupational

    group in both years, which is evidence that continuity in an occupation, not just wartimework,

    enhanced a woman's earning ability.



    Concluding Remarks: World War II and Women's Economic Status

               Is there no truth, then, to the notion that World War II was a watershed in the lives of

    American women and altered the way in which women were perceived as workers? The

    primary conclusion from the Palmer Survey data is that more than 50% of the women working

    in 1950 had been employed in 1940, and that more than half of the decade's new entrants



      The woman would be 29 years old in 1944 but would be 35 years old in 1950.
    14 A 32-year-old woman in 1947 was 35 years old by 1950, and could be the same individual who
was 29 years old in 1944.

                                                     16
entered after the war. Just 20% of those working in 1950 had entered the labor force during

World War II and about half the wartime entrants left the labor force sometime after VJ Day.

        But the Palmer Survey does not enable a direct test of the hypothesis concerning a

changed ideology. The war could still have altered the norms that circumscribed the behavior

of married women. There is, however, mounting evidence that the wide-ranging shift in
women's economic role after World War II was primarily due to longer-run factors, such as the

rise of the clerical sector and increased education for all Americans. I mentioned earlier that

a pooled cross-section, time-series study of women's employment trends across the last century

allows just a small role for World War Il. Research on "marriage bars" suggests that the

rhetoric surrounding married women's work changed only when the supply of young, single

women was substantially reduced and when the supply of well-educated older, married women

 was increased. Demographic events culminated in the 1950's to bring about these changes.

 If the war had anything to do with these changes it was to rekindle family values in Americans,

 thus deplete the already reduced labor supply of younger married women, and to restore the

 full-employment economy, thus to create a demand for older married women.

         It has been difficult to isolate the impact of World War II from that of the ending of the

 Great Depression, but there is mounting evidence from a variety of sources that the war had

 far less of a direct influence on female labor supply than was believed. The Palmer Survey data

 have reinforced the conclusions of a growing historical literature that war-timework did not by

 itself greatly increase women's employment nor advance gender relations in the work place.
