                    Rewards To Continued Work:
         The Economic Incentives For Postponing Retirement



                             ABSTRACT



     Using a new data file on pay and pensions, this paper

presents and discusses new empirical evidence on how older

workers' income opportunities change as they age. It also de—

velops a detailed description of private pension structures and

the ways in which pensions reward deferred retirement. The data

imply that the present discounted value of total lifetime income

rises when people postpone retirement, but the size of the

income   increment varies with age. The data also show that some
pension plans encourage early retirement while others penalize it.

                     REWARDS TO CONTINUED WORK:

       ThE ECONOMIC INCENTIVES FOR POSTPONING RETIREMENT


               Olivia S. Mitchell and Gary S. Fields




     This paper develops empirical measures of the economic incentives

for deferred retirement among older workers. Using a new data file on

pay and pensions, we construct intertemporal budget sets reflecting the

income available to workers at alternative retirement ages. The analysis

explores how continued labor force attachment is rewarded in terms of net

earnings, Social Security benefits, and private pension income.

     Two   motivations   guide the research. First, it is important to

understand how workers' income opportunities change with age. Studies of

retirement patterns including our own' and others2 have demonstrated that

these economic rewards influence older workers' decisions to leave the

labor force. Savings decisions, consumption paths, and other economic

outcomes are also responsive to the budget set at older ages.

Unfortunately, data limitations have made it difficult for previous

authors to explore the range of income opportunities available to older

individuals. This paper presents and discusses new empirical evidence

on how older workers' income opportunities change as they age.

     It is also important to explore how companies differ in the corn—

pensation packages they offer to older workers. Some authors3 have

suggested that firms use their pension plans to encourage early

retirement, though data on this phenomenon are difficult to obtain.

The present paper develops a detailed description of private pension

structures and the ways in which they treat prolonged job attachment.

     Two main conclusions arise from the analysis. First, the data

show that total net income rises as people defer retirement, but the

size of the income increment varies with age. Second, the data show

that some pension plans encourage early retirement among older workers

but others penalize it. Thus differences in private pension structures

prove to be an important source of variation in income opportunities

across older workers. Our results have implications for researchers

interested in older workers' income patterns and for policymakers who

propose mandating actuarial neutrality in private pension plans.

     Section I of the paper views briefly the most important theoretical

features of older workers' income opportunities, and discusses some

general considerations when building an empirical counterpart of the

theoretical budget set, Section II presents our methodology and data,

and Section III presents the findings. Conclusions are collected in

Section IV.

I. Theoretical Considerations

     We consider the rewards to continued work in the context of older

persons' retirement decisions. Previous theoretical studies of

retirement behavior1 have identified the individual's problem as

selecting the optimal amount of work to do over the remaining lifetime,

subject to income and time constraints. "Optimal" is defined as the

labor supply path which maximizes intertemporal utility; accordingly,

the goal is to select that retirement age which provides a worker with

his most preferred combination of leisure time and income from among


'For a review see Mitchell and Fields (1982).
                                                                     3


available options. The worker's income constraints are determined by

net earnings available from market work, and net Social Security and

private pension benefits available during retirement. His time con-

straint consists of time remaining until death, which may be allocated

between work and leisure.1

       More formally, the worker is postulated to select that retirement

age (R) which maximizes intertemporal utility, the arguments of which

are lifetime consumption (C) and lifetime leisure (RET):

                U = U(C,RET); U concave

subject to intertemporal budget constraint with the following structure:

                C=PDVY(R)+W0 —B.
                               0
In   other words, planned consumption equals the present value of dis—

counted income over the remainder of the individual's life (PDVY),

plus wealth at the time of the retirement decision (W), minus planned

bequests (B0). Survival probabilities and pure time preference are

incorporated via a discount factor (r). Both the lifetime utility

function and the income constraint are viewed as stationary over time.

      The PDVY component of the older worker's budget constraint depends

on the retirement age chosen. This is because PDVY is composed of three

elements, each of which is a function of R. The present value of

earnings (PDVE) is computed from the age at which the worker begins

planning for retirement (normalized to 0) until R:

                PDVE       E e.dt
                       0

The other two    components   of PDVY,   the   discounted value of Social

Security and pension benefits, also depend on R since they are computed

'We abstract here from retirement options involving part—time work or
 gradual withdrawal from the labor force; Custman and Steinmeier (1981)
 and Burtless and Noffitt (1982) consider these alternatives in some
 detail. For the sample of older workers described below, retirement
 may be best described as accepting the pension and leaving the firm
 since only a tiny minority ever worked after becoming pensioners.

     Annual retirement benefits are fairly complex functions of

several factors including the worker's retirement age:


                SS =    f(R,t,F)
                    =   g(R,t,F).
Many firms raise annual pension benefits when the worker defers

retirement to acknowledge the shorter period over which benefits will

be paid; when benefits are just sufficiently larger to offset increased

mortality, the pension structure is termed actuarially neutral)

As with private pension formulas, Social Security rules also provide a

positive credit as R increases. Social Security and private pension

benefits also depend upon two other variables. The year itself, t,

enters the annual benefit computation because benefits often vary with

time. This would occur in the case of negotiated benefit improvements

in bargained plans, or legislated Social Security formula changes.

Finally, the pension factor (F) is included to allow for Interactions

between benefits and other variables; for example in some pension plans,

pre—retirement earnings are used in the benefit formula.

     In addition to the income constraint, an older worker also faces

a total time constraints. By definition, years of retirement leisure

(RET) are equal to the difference between expected lifetime (N) and the


11n the empirical analysis below, we focus on defined benefit plans, i.e.,
 those in which benefit amounts are functions of years of service and/or
 pay rather than pension contributions. Benefits in such plans need not
 be actuarially neutral.

age at which retirement occurs:

                  RET   =N   -   It.
     Understanding the income—leisure tradeoff facing older workers

Is facilitated by means of Figure 1. This graphs the present value of

income available to the older individual and -the expected retirement

period for all possible retirement ages; the diagram indicates that

for this hypothetical worker at least, income is lowest if he chose to

retire as early as possible, while income would rise substantially if he

remained additional years at his firm. The figure presumes that

deferring retirement is rewarded by ever more income; below we show
                                                                          -

empirically that the intertemporal budget set indeed has such a shape.

     Presenting the older worker's decision in this way highlights
the similarities between this model and the conventional labor economics

approach to the hours of work decision. Figure 1 also indicates that

the optimal retirement date (R*) is determined in a familiar way:

R* is the age at which the marginal utility of an additional increment

to lifetime income is just offset by the loss in utility from leisure

foregone. While we do not develop comparative dynamics for R* here,

they may be derived in much the same manner as in the cross—sectional

framework

     Some features of the intertemporal budget set should be underscored.

First, the older worker's budget set is defined over all possible

retiremetat dates rather than at just one moment in time. A complete

understanding of the rewards for continued work therefore investigate

not just one or two points on the budget surface, but all alternatives.

Second, to be able to compute PDVY at each age, it is necessary to

understand the private pension and Social Security benefit formulas

facing a given worker, since these institutional rules impart structure

to the intertemporal budget set. Third, the income leisure tradeoff

embodies expectations about future income streams and formulas,

inflation rates, mortality rates, and a host of other variables.

These must also be modeled in empirical work.

II. Building the Empirical Intertemporal Budt Set

     To construct an intertemporal budget set, we require complete

data on each worker's earnings, private pension benefits, and Social

Security benefits. The data set used in empirical analysis is a sub—

samp].e of the Benefit Amounts Survey (BAS) developed in 1978 by the

U.S. Department of Labor's Pension and Welfare Benefits Program.

The survey consists of a random stratified sample of private sector

pension plans filing reports with the Labor Department as required under

the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). The pension

plans selected for analysis were asked to provide a limited amount of

information on their beneficiaries; data collected at the firm included

birth year, year of retirement, and tenure with the firm for each

sample worker. Individual records were then merged with administrative

data from the Social Security Administration, so that each worker's

file also contained his earnings history from 1951 on.

     The sample of workers available for analysis consists of 8,733

men born in 1909 or 1910. This limited age cohort is selected because

by the survey date (1978) virtually all would have been retired, yet

relatively few would have died and therefore been excluded from the

sample.

     For the analysis at hand, we must know the rules determining

pension benefits. We constructed such information from union contracts
                                                           8


and/or summary plan descriptions on file with the U.S. Department of

Labor for 14 defined benefit plans. No larger data set with Information

on both pensions and their beneficiaries is now available; our pension

analysis is therefore an extension of our own previous efforts as well

as those of other analysts, who have generally been limited to an

examination of a single pension plan.1 On the other hand, the sample

of pension plans is still small, and therefore our findings must be

viewed as exploratory rather than representative of pension plans as

a whole.

      The plans represented here cannot be identified individually for

confidentiality reasons. We may say, though, that our sample includes

several blue collar plans negotiated with the United Auto Workers,

several other plans in the manufacturing sector, a craft union plan,

and one in the trade sector.

      An example of the benefit rules used in a United Auto Workers

plan is given in Table 1 for illustrative purposes. It is evident

that even this apparently simple "years of service" formula turns out

to be quite complex in practice.




1See, for instance, the work of Burkhauser (1979) and Fields and
 Mitchell (1982) on the United Auto Workers and Burtless and Hansman
 (1982) on Federal government workers.

                            TABLE 1.



           THE PRIVATE PENSION STRUCTURE IN COMPANY X


      The pension structure in Company X is negotiated every three
years and written into a contract with the United Automobile Workers
union (UAW). The plan is non—contributory. The benefit formula
negotiated in th early 1970s, when the workers in our sample were
about 60 years of age and were presumably deciding when to retire,
varied depending on age and/or years of service. To Illustrate,
the following rules applied to an individual who started work at
Company X at age 30:

      I. If he retires after age 60, but before age 62:
          his pension benefit is $4,800 per year until
         • age 62 and $5,400 per year from 62 to 64;
          thereafter, it is [$90 x yrs. of service less
           (.04 x the difference between the retirement age
          and 62)] + $63.60.

     ii. If he retires after age 62, but before age 65:
          his pension benefit is $5,400 per year until
          age 65; thereafter, it Is [$90 x yrs. of service)
          + $63.60.

    Iii. If he retires at age 65 or later: his pension
          benefit is [$90 x yrs. of service] + $63.60.

Benefits in I and ii are available only after completing 10 years
of service.
                                                            I0

      The formula given in Table 1 describes pension benefit rules in

effect around 1970, at which time our sample workers were about 60

years of age. But the rules in 1970 would not necessarily have been

appropriate for a worker who waited to retire until, say, l975

In this company, and in the other companies in our study, the pension

formula had been made more generous during the 1960s. In anticipating

what future retirement benefits might be, workers in that company might

reasonably have expected that benefits would be raised in the future as

much as they had been in the past. We look back at union contracts,

the Bureau of Labor Statistics Pension Digest, and other documents to

determine what had been happening. Empirical analysis of changes in

pension benefits over time, for newly retiring workers as well as for

previously retired individuals, reve.aled that pension plans typically

raised benefits in line with inflation for workers not yet retired, but

not for those already retired. Therefore, we-assume that the prospective

retiree would have figured on pre—retirement increases just short of the

inflation rate, but zero post—retirement increases.

      The specific pension formula outlined in Table 1 depends only on

age and years of service. To cQmpute pension benefits in other pension

plans, it is also necessary to know what the worker would have earned

had he remained on this job. Earnings information is, of course, needed

directly in considering the intertemporal budget set.

      Earnings until retirement are obtained from Social Security

earnings   history data. Earnings in excess of the Social Security taxable
maximum are imputed using a variant of a routine described in Fox (1976).

Earnings after retirement are imputed from previous years' earnings.

Gross earnings are then reduced by income taxes and payroll taxes to

obtain net earnings.
                                                             11


       The other element of the intertempora]. budget set is Social

 Security benefits. These are computed based on the Social Security

 rules in effect in 1972. We use 1972 benefit rules for. retirement

 decisions being made around 1970, because future changes had been

 legislated two years in advance. The algorithm incorporates what the

worker might have anticipated had he retired earlier and filed for

benefits when first eligible at age 62, and what he would have received

 if he had postponed retiring and filing for benefits until later ages.

As with the projection of future private pension benefits, this requires

an assumption about how benefits would have been expected to change over

time. The algorithm incorporates the real growth rate in Social Security

benefits experienced during the 1960s as the best estimate of how real

benefits might have been expected to change during the 1970s.

      One limitation of the Social Security computation. should be noted.

It is possible. to estimate only the male's Social Security benefits, not

the spouse's benefits, since marital status information is not available.

      In moving from the annual budget set components (all of which are

in nominal dollars) to present discounted values (which are much more

informative if expressed in real dollars), several additional assumptions

inust'.be made. Standard practice is followed by discounting each year's

benefits by the probability of mortality at each age, based on survival

rate information for the cohort in question. In addition, future benefits

are deflated by two factors: inflation, and a real discount rate.

Estimated future benefit streams assume continuation of the rate of price

increases prevailing in the early l970s; to discount benefits accruing

in the future, the same nominal rate is used. In addition, a 2% real

discount rate is used to reflect time preference. Confirmatory analysis

with other discount rates produces results virtually identical to those

reported below.
                                                           12


      The foregoing describes the construction of the budget set for

each individual in our BAS file. In the balance of this paper, we

summarize this information by calculating the overall budget set and

its components for a specific "illustrative worker." We do this for

purposes of comparison, since it is useful to derive benefits using

the same basic earnings and job tenure characteristics holding constant

other factors whjch might vary across plans. Nonetheless, this illus-

trative individual should also be relatively similar to actual workers

in the pension plan, since benefit structures are generally constructed

with a relevant salary range in mind. The "illustrative worker" used

below isassigned the mean net earnings and job tenure derived from the

underlying sample described above. The average tenure figure, 26 years,

is compatible with Hall's (1982) recent discussion of lifetime jobs among

males in the U.S. labor force. Others who have computed pension benefits

(e.g., Lazear, 1982, Kotlikoff and Smith, 1982) did not have such infor-

mation, and were thus required to use several different tenure and

salary options to cover most of the possibilities.

III. The Economic Rewards to Deferring Retirement

      It will be recalled that two empirical questions guide our

empirical explorations: (1) How do total income profiles change as

workers age?, and (2) How do pension plans reward continued work effort?

Each question is Investigated in turn in this section.



1Readers of our earlier papers should be alerted to the fact that those
 other papers use the actual workers In that company, not the illustrative
worker used here.
                                                             13

     A. The Shape of the Total Income Path

     Table 2 displays the elements of the illustrative worker's

intertemporal budget set, expressed in annual terms inthe top panel

and in present discounted value terms in the lower panel.1

     Of most interest for the present discussion are the last two

lines on Table 2 (lines II.D and E), which report total PDVY and

marginal changes as retirement is deferred. The following features

of the PDVY stream are noteworthy:

      (1) PDVY rises monotonically as retirementis deferred.

           This is because at each age earnings plus (or minus)

           pension and Social Security accruals exceed the pension

           and Social Security benefits foregone. In real terms,

           a worker postponing retirement from age 60 to 65 would

           roughly double his real income stream.

      (2) PDVY rises nonlinearly with age of retirement.

           The payoff to working one additional year is highest in

           both dollar and percentage terms between ages 60 and 61;

           if the same worker deferred retiring between 64 and 65,

           his dollar gain would be about $1,400 less, for a marginal

           percentage change of 9% instead of 18%.

Therefore the data show that the economic rewards for postponing

retirement are increasing but the gains vary across ages. Previous

studies have not discerned these patterns, because they used data

containing less detail on the components of PDVY.

      The fact that the intertemporal budget set for older workers

rewards deferred retirement implies that observed income for any

particular retiree is a function of when he chooses to 'retire, rather

than being exogenously given. If one wished to evaluate income oppor-

tunities actually available to an already retired worker, one would

have to develop an intertemporal budget set such as that in Table 2

indicating the magnitudes of contingent income flows available at

alternative retirement dates.

      The pattern of the budget set also implies that the value of

PDVY (or its component parts) at any one particular age will not be

very informative about the overall shape of the intertemporal income

path. Unfortunately, most data sets other than the BAS contain insuf—

ficient detail on earnings, Social Security, and private pension

benefits, making it difficult to develop the full PDVY path.'

      B. The Shape of Private Pension Income Paths

      Understanding how firms reward continued work at older ages is

facilitated by Investigating private pension structures. Pension benefits

constitute a fairly significant source of older workers' incomes.

The top panel of Table 2 shows that annual (first year) benefits from

private pensions are sizeable, equalling or exceeding Social Security

payments for all ages but 65 (and are not much less at age 65).

Net private pension income amounts to one—quarter to one—third of after—

tax— earnings for individuals in the sample.2



1Approximations are possible using the Longitudinal Retirement History
 Survey; see Fields and Mitchell (1983).
2Previous studies have not computed after—tax replacement rates for both
 private pensions and Social Security so these figures cannot be directly
 compared with others in the literature. We find that the overall
 replacement.rate including both pensions and Social Security is between
 SO and 60% on average, though in some cases individuals received as much
 as 95% of pre—retirement net earnings.
                                                                 16


         Still focusing on annual benefits, line I.C. indicétes large

differences ia benefits depending on when the worker retires. An age—60

retiree would on average receive private pension income of about $2,200

that year. If he deferred retirement by one year, the addition to

(nominal) benefits would be on the order of 7%. However, the marginal

pension payoff to an additional year's work is by no means uniform across

retirement ages: for example, benefits at age 62 are lower than for age 61.

This unexpected benefit decline is attributable to pension plan supplements

provided until a retiree attains age 62, the age of eligibility for

Social Security. A reduction is again evident between the ages of 64 and

65; the pension rules thus acknowledge that workers can file for full

Social Security retirement income at age 65, and provide a bridge for

individuals retiring earlier. In general, the marginal pension payoff

to retiring one year later varies quite a lot across retirement ages, a

fact not immediately evident from a cursory review of benefit rules.

         Line II.C of Table 2 converts the annual pension benefit figures

into present discounted values in real dollars. Again it is evident

that the reward structure built into private pensions varies for dif-

ferent retirement ages. The iljustrative workers would receive more

in lifetime benefits if he left the firm at age 60 than he would if he

postponed retirement to age 61, despite the fact that annual benefits

are higher at age 61 than at 60. In fact, the annual pension benefits

are incrçased at less than actuarially neutral rates at several ages,

as is evident from computed changes in the present values of lifetime

benefits:

                           Age 60—1   61—2   62—3   63—4   64—5

Clearly the structure of lifetime pension income flows very much

affects the economic rewards for continued work.

        Present values in Table 2 are averages across fourteen pension

plans, so they conceal potentially interesting differences in company

pension structures. Table 3 splits the sample into two groups: pattern

and conventional plans. Pattern plans are pensions where benefits are

based almost exclusively on years of service with the firm (or occu-

pation, if a craft union). Conventional plans, more common among

non—union firms, determine benefits based on both final salary and

tenure with the firm.

-
        It .is evident from Table 3 that the overall means obscure some
key differences between the two kinds of benefit structures. Pattern

plans tend to structure their first—year benefits so that they rise

more or less smoothly, reaching a peak at age 64; annual benefits

typicall.y fall for workers deferring benefits beyond that point.

First year benefits in conventional plans operate quite differently,

since   here benefits for the age—62 retiree are lower than for the worker
leaving one year earlier; it   is   this subgroup of plans which produces the
dip   in annual benefits found in the overall mean. However, after age 62,

conventional plans tend to provide ever—increasing benefit amounts for

workers postponing retirement up to age 65.

        An examination of discounted pension values in these two types of

plans suggests even sharper contrasts. Pattern plans (line IIB) actively

discourage work beyond age 60.1 An employee in a pattern plan who defers

retiring until age 65 will in fact receive lifetime benefits about 18%

lower than at age 60! On the other hand, present value streams in

conventional plans are structured so that a worker deferring retirement


'This is similar to the finding reported by Lazear (1982).
                                                                18


until age 65 receives about 17% higher benefits than if he retired at

60. Thus between ages 60 and 65, conventional pension plans appear to

improve benefits by about the same amount as pattern plans reduce them.

      Clearly, the overall incentives differ between the two types of

plans. To see whether marginal incentives are smooth or erratic, changes

in pension present values are computed for each additional year of work:


Change in PDVPP: Age        60—1   61—2   62—3   63—4   64—5

Pattern   Plans             —2%    —2%    —5%    —5%    —5%

Conventional Plans          +2%    +14% +0%      +0%    +0%


Evidently, pattern plans actively encourage early retirement, whereas
conventional      plans strongly encourage work up to age 62. After age 62,

conventional plans provide a rather flat payoff schedule for additional years'

work; in pattern plans, the slope becomes strongly negative; see Figure 2.

      Table 4 disaggregates to the level of the individual plan.

This breakdown of pension plan benefit strictures reveals even more

variability in economic rewards for continued work. These plan—specific

data permit the computation of benefit streams for ages beyond 65 in

cases where continued work was permitted; forms with mandatory retire-

ment are indicated with a dash (—).       The final column for each plan

summarizes findings graphically, which is helpful In determining how

benefits change between early and late retirement ages.

      This disaggregate investigation of pension plan rules suggests

two conclusions:

      (1) Pension plans reward deferred retirement differently from

            one company to the next. Pattern plans as a whole, and the

            UAW plans in particular, encouraged early retirement by

            structuring benefits so they attained a maximum between

          ages 60 and 62. Conventional plans are more complex, but

          as a rule structured their benefit flows so as to reward

          continued work well beyond age 60.

      (2) Marginal payoffs to deferred retirement are uneven;

          actuarial neutrality across retirement ages is rare.

          In our sample, a worker deferring retirement by one year

          could bave increased his lifetime pension income flow by

          as much as 14%, or reduced it by 5%, depending on the

          pension plan in which he worked.

In overview, then, some private pensions reward prolonged work and

others penalize it both in overall and in marginal terms. It is not

true that pensions always discourage work beyond age 60.

IV. Conclusion

      The notion of an intertemporal budget set facing older workers

flows from an economic model of choice of retirement age subject to

Income and time constraints. Measuring the budget set empirically

requires computing total discounted income for each available retirement

age. In so doing, it is important to model Social Security and private

pension rules defining benefits available at each age, and in addition

to determine how workers would have expected these rules to change in

the future.

      Using a unique new data set known as the Benefit Amounts Survey,

we develop empirical answers to questions: (1) How do workers' total

incomes change as they defer retirement?, and (2) Do private pension

structures reward or penalize continued work at older ages?

      The data suggest two important features of the discounted total

income streams (PDVY) facing older workers which have not been noted
                                                                23


in previous studies. First,PDVY rises monotonically as retirement is

deferred. Second, PDVY rises nonlinearly with age. In general, the

economic rewards for postponing retirement are ever—increasing but the

gains vary depending on the age in question.

         The data also point to two new conclusions about the incentive

structures of private pension plans. First, pension plans reward

deferred retirement differently across companies. Second marginal

payoffs to deferred retirement are uneven; actuarial neutrality across

retirement ages is uncommon. Some private pensions reward prolonged

work but others penalize it.

         The patterns just noted have implications for both researchers

and policymakers. Analysts interested in modeling and estimating the

determinants of retirement, savings and other economic behavior among

older workers must build and examine the intertemporal budget sets

confronting these individuals as they age. Similarly, Income distri-

bution studies should recognize that actual retirement income among

retirees is determined to a significant degree by workers' retirement

behavior. These considerations highlight the importance of developing

new data sets containing more complete 'information on workers, their

earnings histories, and their company records Including pension system

rules.

         The observed differences in pension patterns also have an

Interesting policy implication. One    proposal   that has received some

attention in policy circles of late is the idea that the federal govern—

inent should mandate pension benefit neutrality. This proposal is

motivated by the belief that pension structures currently encourage

early retirement. It is thought that mandatory pension neutrality
                                                          24



would result in higher benefits for those continuing to work beyond age

60, thereby encouraging longer workforce commitment. However, our

analysis shows that the actual result depends on the benefit structure

presently available to the covered employee. In pattern plans, the

effect of mandatory neutrality would probably be to cut early benefits

rather than to increase later ones. Though this would affect retirement

ages in the anticipated direction, retirement benefits would be lower

than at present, not higher.

     In conventional plans, on the other hand, mandatory neutrality

could conceivably remove the desired incentives currently in place to

defer retirement; such a result would not be consistent with federal

efforts to encourage later retirement. Altering pension reward structures

currently in place could produce other undesirable results as well.

If the current pension benefit patterns are structured in accordance with

firms' perceptions of the relative efficiency of older workers compared

to younger ones, imposing regulatory restrictions would be expected to

increase firms' costs, some part of which would probably be passed on to

workers in the form of lower wages and/or lower pension benefits.

Both the welfare and the efficiency costs of mandating pension neutrality

should be analyzed much more carefully before concluding that such a

policy is desirable.
