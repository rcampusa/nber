                        CAPITAL POSITIONS OF JAPANESE BANKS


                                     ABSTRACT


     This paper measures and analyzes two types of hidden capital at Japanese
banks: (1) the net undervaluation preaent in accounting measures of on-
balance-sheet assets and liabilities and (2) the net economic value of off-
balance-sheet items. A model is constructed that explains changes in both
types of capital as functions of holding that explains changes in both types of
capital as functions of holding-period returns earned in Japan on stocks,
bonds, yen, and real estate. The model is applied to annual data covering
1975-1989 and a four-class size/charter partition of the Japanese banking
system. For each type of hidden capital and each class of bank, the model
develops estimates of the stock-market, interest-rate, foreign-exchange, snd
real estate sensitivities of returns to bank stockholders.

     Only the stock-market sensitivities prove significant at five percent.
This finding leads us to investigate what happens when we analyze Japanese bsnk
stock returns by means of stationary and split-sample market models. Time-
series regressions show that very large Japanese banks have developed stock-
market betas in excess of two and that the value of a bank's beta has come to
increase with measures of its size and accounting leverage.

     Future research will investigate the sensibility of our results to
different ways of pooling data from individual banka and to more-sophisticated
methods for estimating various parameters. We also plan to extend the analysis
by imbedding it in a model of how variations in bank-customer contracting
arrangements in Japan affect the returns that can be earned by bank
stockholders.

                    CAPITAL POSITIONS OF JAPANESE RANKS

I.   Introduction
       In recent years, Japanese banks have become major playera in world

finance. Many apparently knowledgeable observers attribute thia development

to the maintenance of inappropriately low capital requirements by Japanese

authorities (Corrigan, 1987; Pettway, Kaneko, and Young, 1990). However,

Japanese banks are not undercapitalized. Their stocks show market

capitalizations that average several timea the value of the banks'

accounting net worths (Kane, 1987; Baer and Mote, 1989).

      Divergences between accounting and stock-market estimates may be

described as "hidden capital." Kane and Unal (1990) develop a method for

testing hypotheses about the determinants of two types of hidden capital:

the misvaluation of on-balance-sheet items (post-acquisition gains and

losses that, although they remain unbooked, are bookable upon the sale of

the item under Generally Accepted Accounting Principles, CA.AP) and

intangible values which CAAP currently designates to be unbookable off-

balance-aheet items.

      This paper shows that Japanese banks are highly capitalized on a

market-value basis and tests hypotheses about the determinants of hidden

capital at Japanese banks. We first develop estimates of a valuation ratio,

k, by which to adjust the book value of a firm's net worth and of the net

market value of unbookable equity elements, U. These parameters are

estimated by regressing crosssectionally the market value of the

institution's market capitalization on the book value of its accounting net

worth. This regression equation forms the heart of what Kane and Unal (1990)

call the Statistical Market Value Accounting Model, SMVAM.
                                       2




     A second block of the model endogenizes changes in k and U aa functions

of ex post holding period returns on stocks, bonds, yen, and Japanese real

estate. This formulation permits us not only to test hypotheses about the

determinants of both forms of hidden capital, but to use the model to

explain variation in the market, interest, foreign-exchange, end real-estate

sensitivities of an institution's stock.

     The analysis extracts market, interest-rate, foreign-exchange, and

real-estate sensitivities from a time series of cross-section regressions

that use accounting and rste-of-return information to explain the market

vslue of stockholder equity claims. The first block of the model is

estimated for each of the 15 years 1975-1989 for four categories of Japanese

banks. The four-class partition of the banking system represents a

conventional Japanese classification that uses the names city banks, long-

term credit banks, trust banks, end regional banks. This classification

closely approximates a size-based partition, with city banks having the

largest average asset size end regional banks the smallest average asset

size throughout the period we study.

II. Model and Diagnostic Checks

     The SMVAM is estimated separately at each date for members of each

class of institution:

          MV_U+kBV+e.                        (1)
                                           3




MV and BV denote the market and book value of firm       equity.   U is interpreted

aa the market value of unbookable equity, while k is the valuation ratio

that aerves to adjust the value of bookable items to market. These

coefficients measure the de facto deceptiveness of the Japanese accounting

system. Unless both U —    0   and k —   1, the accounting or book value of a
bank's capital represents a biased estimate of the market value of

stockholder equity. If the estimated intercept is significantly positive

(negative) ,   unbookable assets and liabilities serve as a net hidden source

of (drain on) institutional capital.

        Equation (1) assumes that a single mark-up or mark-down ratio, k

applies to all accounting values reported by the institution. In effect, a

single valuation ratio k is assumed to apply to every component of each

institution's book equity. We test this restriction by estimating different

coefficients for aggregate assets and aggregate liabilities for each class

of bank. However, except for regional banks, the hypothesis of a common k

proves impossible to reject. Even for regional banks, significant

differences between asset and liability valuation ratios emerge only after

1985.

        A second diagnostic check is to teat for nonlinear terms in SHVAM. In

particular, we investigate the effect of introducing a squared or quadratic

term in B1. The coefficient of the squared term proves insignificant at S

percent for city banks in all years. However, although we choose not to

pursue the issue here, the evidence suggests that a nonlinear specification

may be appropriate in some years and especially for smaller institutions.
                                       4




Long-term credit and trust banks show signifitant and positive coefficients

for      in years 1982-84 and 1988. For regional banks, the By2 coefficient

proves significantly negative in 1977 and 1981-83, but becomes positive and

significant in later years, 1985-88.

      The parameters of the linear SMVAM are U and k. When returns on

competitive assets change over time, these parameters should respond. Using

an annual observation period, we approximate this response by a linear

model of market returns, interest rates, dollar investments in yen, and

returns on Japanese teal estate:

                —
      Ut -           + $ Rmt +         +         + fi     +v            (2)




      k -    k1 — 4 +      R   +       +         +       + w.           (3)




      Rt Rg and RLt represent holding-period returns on a stock-market

index, a bond index, dollar investments in yen, and Japanese real estate,

respectively. We include       and         to test the often-heard conjecture that

Japanese bank stock has benefited greatly from appreciation in the yen and

in Japanese real estate. The v and w are stochastic error terms. The slope

coefficients measure the market, interest-rate, foreign-exchange, and real-

estate sensitivity of SMVAN's parameters.

      Equations (2) and (3) are offered as flexible functional forms that

parameterize in an interpretable and parsimonious way revaluations that
                                        5




asset markets make continually. Results to be developed in later sections of

this paper indicate that movements in Ut and k ere explained predominantly

by the first influence (stock returns), with the other variables having no

significant effects. The Japanese stock-market index proves significant for

every class of bank. This is consistent with a further finding that Japanese

banks have come to own over 40 percent of the universe of Japanese corporate

stocks. This makes investment in these banks' stock shares in large part a

leveraged investment in the Japanese stock market as a whole.

      To furnish a complementary perspective, we also estimate a traditional

multi-index market model. Using this model, stock-market betas for large

Japanese banks are shown to surge sharply upward after 1983.

III. Data and Sample Characteristics

      The data set includes market and book values for the capital and total

assets of every Japanese bank in existence during the 1975-1989 sample

period. For regional banks, the sample size varies over the sample period,

but   I)   city banks, 3 long-term credit banks and 6 trust banks exist

throughout. (A seventh trust bank exists, but its stock does not trade.)

The number of regional banks sampled expands from 44 to 91.

      Data are obtained from Nihon Keizai Shimbun America, Inc. Market values

are determined in accordance with Japanese corporate reporting practices as

of March 31st and calculated as the product of share price and number of

shares outstanding. The book value of equity capital totals accounting
                                     6




entries for stock subscription, legal reserves and earned surplus at the

same dates.

     Chsrt 1 reports ratios of the book value of stockholder equity to     total
assets. Although these ratios are much lower than those reported by

comparable U.S. banks, these banks cannot reasonably be characterized as

lacking in capital. Chart 2 clarifies that over the sample period a high and

rising ratio of mean market value to book value obtained for city banks,

long-term credit banks, trust banks and regional banks.

     These charts indicate that hidden capital expands greatly during the

late 1980s. The MV/SV ratio first exceeds 2 for city banks and long-term

credit banks in 1982 and for trust banks in 1984. The ratio continues to

increase until 1987, when it peaks for the first three classes, at 8.9,

10.6, and 11.8, respectively. From these respective peaks, MV/BV declines to

5.8, 7.5 and 4.9 by 1989.

     Compared to the other three classes, regional banks show a lower and

less-volatile MV/8V ratio. The ratio does not exceed two until 1986, peak's

at 3.28 two years later, and declines to 2.96 in 1989.

     The indices needed to estimate equations (2) and (3) have to be

approximated. Although data on dividend yields are lacking. Japanese

dividend rates are reputed to be low and relatively stable. This makes it

reasonable to approximate the holding-period return on a stock by its annual

rate of price appreciation.
                                      7




       Chart 3 tracks annual percentage changes to the dates shown in the

mean market capitalization of each class of bank. This price appreciation is

the major portion of the return realized by stockholders in Japanese banks.

       Chart 4 tracks percentage returns in four potential determinants of U

and k. The 225-stock Tokyo index constructed by Nikkei (R) is used as a

proxy for the stock market as a whole. The Nikkei bond index is used to

calculate a proxy holding-period return for bonds. The index reports a daily

average yield on public and private debt securities. We derive annual

holding-period returns from this index by treating the underlying bonds as

consols whose coupon equals Y- the yield observed at the end of the

previous year. Specifically,

Rt —   't-l (y
            -     -



       Returns on real estate come from Japan Real Estate Research Institute
(JRERI). JRERI surveys 140 major cities in Japan twice a year (in March and

September) and constructs a land price index. Again, lacking parallel data

on periodic rents, the annual   percentage   changes in the index are treated as

a proxy for real-estate returns in Japan. Data for the Nikkei stock-market

and bond indices and the JRERI land price index are obtained from Nihon

Keizai Shimbun.

       Finally, yen returns (Rft) are proxied by percentage change in the

value of the yen against U.S. dollar, using data compiled by the World Bank.

IV. SMVAM   Results

     SMVAN's accounting equation has two parameters. Charts 5 and 6 display

the pattern of annual cross-sectional estimates at each of the four bank

classes. With only three banks in the long-term credit bank class, separate

regressions for this class have only one degree of freedom and large

standard errors. Nevertheless, covariance or dummy-variable analysis shows

that these institutions differ so significantly from the other three classes

that it is inappropriate to pooi them with any other class.

     To teat the U — 0 and k — 1 hypotheaia of "fully informative accounting

values" for each class separately, we focus on the time series of

coefficient deviations from the hypothesized values. Table 1 reports test

reaultaThe combined U—0 and k—l condition which would make recorded equity

an unbiased estimate of market value ia rejected for city banka in all years

and is accepted for long-term credit banks only in 1980. Accounting

representations of truat banks prove deceptive in all but two years: 1980

and 1981. In contrast, accounting data for regional banks appear reliable

through 1984. But after that date, the regional banks' k proves

significantly greater than unity.

     For city banks, the deviations of U and k retain a single sign

throughout. U is negative and significant, indicating net unbookable items

as a drain on equity. As a percentage of mean MV, this drain begins at 6

percent in 1975, peaks in 1984 at 40 percent, and decreases to 23 percent in

1989. The valuation ratio for bookable items proves aignificantly in excess

of one and reaches very high levels in the late 1980a.
                                        9




     A high valuation ratio constitutes evidence of on-balance-sheet "hidden

capital." Securities and real estate that are carried on bank books at

historical cost become increasingly undervalued when market values trend

upward. Throughout the late l980s, unbooked but bookable capital gains

appear substantial. If a market-value accounting system were used, increases

(and decreases) in market values would be booked as earnings as they accrue

and reflected in the book value of equity. However, if used as a basis for

calculating taxable income, market-value tax accounting would simultaneously

create an immediate tax   liability   on accrued gains. Under the system of

cash-flow tax accounting that is in place, Japanese banks effect tax savings

by not immediately realizing (i.e., encashing) their capital gains.

     For large banks, off-balance-sheet equity proves large and negative in

many instances, especially in the later years of our sample. The pattern of

secular fall and 1988-89 recovery mirrors the rise and fall of the MV/SV

ratios   reported in Chart 2. This is consistent with the hypothesis that

observed negative off-balance-sheet positions can be conceived

predominantly as reserves for deferred taxes on unrealized gains in stock

and real-estate holdings. U must also capture the capitalized value of the

implicit net subsidy or tax associated with restrictions or advantages

conferred on banks by the Japanese Ministry of Finance (MOF). We hold that

movements in tax   reserves   dominate U because it is unlikely that the net

advantageousness of MOF restrictions could change as rapidly from year to

year as our estimates of U do.
                                    10




     We turn now to the revaluation equations (2) and (3), which are

estimated in Tables 2 and 3. For every bank class, results are qualitatively

the same. Off-balance-sheet equity decreases as stock returns increase

(significantly so for city and long-term credit banks). It also decreases

with bond and foreign-exchange returns and rises with land returns, but not

significantly. The valuation ratio k for on-balance-sheer items shows in

each case an opposite pattern, and again only the stock return ever achieves

significance. However, because error terms are apt to be correlated within

and across hank classes, ordinary-least-squares estimates of standard etrors

are biased upward. More-efficient estimation methods might well render real-

estate, foreign-exchange, or bond returns significant in at least some

cases.

     During the first quarter of 1990, while the Nikkei 225 index declined

by roughly 25 percent, the market capitalization of individual city banks

declined by as much as 33 percent. To the extent these banks represent a

leveraged investment in the stock market as a whole, a massive stock-market

decline could rapidly undermine the strength of large Japanese banks'

capital poaitiona.

V. Results for the Multi-Index Market Model

     Tables 2 and 3 assign Rm and the other index variables opposite effects

on U and k. The hypothesis that U may be interpreted principally as a

reserve for deferred taxes implies that these variables' effects through k

should strongly outweigh their effects through U.
                                     11




     Fitting a multi-index market model (MItO() provides a straightforward

way to check this. The version of MIMI'! that we fit expands the basic market

model by adding bond returns, real-estate returns, and returns on dollar

investments in yen. We include returns on yen and real-estate even though

they prove insignificant in Tables 2 and 3, because we want to allow for the

possibility that effects operating through U and k might cumulate to

significance. The MIMI'! stochastic return-generating process specifies that

the return R on portfolio p is:


          pt —      mp mt +    rp t + Pfp ft    +   Lp   Lt +   z.   (4)


In (4), amp' rp' fifp' and Lp measure the portfolio's systematic market,

interest-rate, foreign-exchange and real-estate risk.

     We construct Rt as an equal-weighted portfolio of returns for every

bank in each class. For each claaa, Table 4 reports pooled time-series,

cross-section estimates of equation (4).

     For each class, the net sensitivity of bank stock price appreciation to

market returns turns out to be positive and significant. For the largest

three size classes, stock-market betas all exceed two. Because Charts 3, 5,

and 6 suggest a mid-l980s shift in return-generating processes for banks, we

experiment with relsxing the assumption of stationarity by fitting the model

separately to 1975-83 and 1984-89 under the restriction 4fp and Lp equal
                                      12



                                                                               I
zero.1 In these runs, betas prove negative for the three largest size

classes in the early years and positive and large during the 1984-1989

period only.2

     The striking feature of the various runs is the sky-high level of

market risk toward which the average member of the first three bsnk size

classes evolved. These betas range from 2 to 3, which is two to three times

the magnitude of the estimates both for regional Japanese banks and of

parallel estimates for large U.S. banks obtained by Unal and Kane (1988)

with quarterly 1975-1985 data. These high betas confirm the hypothesis that,

when a leveraged institution has a large diversified position in the stock

market, its market capitalization moves by a multiple of the price movements

obaerved for the market as a whole.

     In the Japanese stock-market decline of the first quarter of 1990, the

prices of the high-beta bank stocks fell more rapidly than the overall

Japanese market index. This has important implications for policymakers. The




1Support for the timing of this sample partition may also be found in
regulatory events. Pectway, Tarpley, and Yamada (1988) associate a post-1983
expansion of bank risk-taking with a reduction in administrative guidance,
while Cargill and Royama (1988) note an acceleration in money-market
development.
2txperimenca not reported here allow each of Rf and       to be the second
index and confirm the usefulness of going on to allow for structural shifts
in (2) and (3) as well.
                                    13




capital position of banks that invest heavily in corporate stock is more

volatile than the stock market itself. The market capitalization of high-

beta bank stocks can decline suddenly and markedly. In a world where

governments insure de facto all of the debts of large domestic banks, this

volatility implies that, to protect Japanese taxpayers, risk-based market-

value capital requirements should be designed to increase with the size of

each bank's market beta.

Individual-Bank Runs. To investigate within-class variation in market betas,

Table 5 reports the results of estimating the one-index version of equation

(4) for the individual banks in each class for which we have data for all 15

years. Although we do not report results for the four-index model, R, RL

and Rf prove significant in time-series runs for only few of these banks.

     The market betas found for most members of each of the three largest

size classes prove to be of the same order of magnitude as in the pooled

run. The 24 regional, banks that show significant market betas appear to

follow portfolio strategies that are more similar to those followed by

larger institutions than to those pursued by fellow members of their charter

class.

     When we allow for a possible structural shift in individual market

betas after 1983, high market betas develop only during the later subsample.

A visual inspection of the data reveals that high betas are typically driven

by 1985, 1987 and 1988 observations. In these years, the market

capitalizations of institutions show extraordinary increases relative to the
                                           14




market. These beta estimates are much higher than those reported by Pettway,

Tapley and Ysmada (1988). Pettway, Tapley and Ysmad.a cover different sample

years (1982-1983 and 1984-1986) and use daily data. Neglecting data from

1987-89 would tend to lower our beta estimates substantially. To some

degree, these authors' lower betas may also reflect downward bias due to

employing daily data on stocks that fail to trade daily.

Tracking Variation in Market Betas at Individual Banks. Pettway, Sicherman,

and Yamada (1990) contrast an observed tendency for market betas of Japanese

torporations to increase with size against the stylized tendency for market

betas to decline with size for U.S. firma (Reinganum, 1981; Chang and

Prinegar, 1989). These authors attribute this differential behavior to

presumed differences in management objectives at U.S. and Japanese

corporations. While U.S. corporations' internal diversification is believed

to increase with size, in Japan agency costs associated lender influence on

decisions by corporate managers are held to rise with size. Agency costs in

Japanese banking relationships are studied by Hoshi, Kashyap, and

Scharfstein (1989).

     The following          hQ regression equation supports the hypothesis that

Japanese banks with high market betas are larger and more highly leveraged

than other banks:


     4        — -.81    -   32.1   (BV /TA )   + 0.22     (ln TA ),   R2   — 22.   (5)

betas from Table 5, while BV and TA denote the th bank's average book-

value and total assets over 1975-1989.

     When the market model and the ad hoc equation (5) are fitted separately

to 1975-83 and 1984-89, the magnitude and significance of the slope

coefficients may be traced entirely to the 1984-89 period. Before 1984,

leverage does not significantly affect a Japanese bank's market beta. As

with U.S. banks, betas significantly decline with size. Hence, this

divergence between U.S. and Japanese bank behavior is of     recent origin.

I. Opportunities for Future Research

     Although the ordinary-least-squares estimates reported in this paper

seem reliable enough to support qualitative inferences, more sophisticated

econometric procedures may be able to establish a role for bond, land, or

foreign-exchange returns. In future research, we plan to use seemingly

unrelated regression, crossed regression, nonlinear formulations,

simultaneous-equation models, and heteroskedasticity adjustments. We also

plan to use covariance analysis to disaggregate regional banks into high-

beta and low-beta groups and to test whether SMVAN equations for banks with

similar betas can be pooled across charter types.

     We further plan to analyze contracting arrangements inherent in

Japanese financial institutions and markets. The goal of this investigation

is to help us to sort out how contracting arrangements between and among

banks and related and unrelated corporations affect the size and

distribution of agency costs in Japan.
