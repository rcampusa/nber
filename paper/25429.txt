                                          ABSTRACT

We focus on a unique episode in the history of science, the elaboration of the theory of evolution
by Charles Darwin, to study the interplay between scientific progress and cultural change. We
perform text analysis on a corpus of hundreds of thousands of books, with the use of techniques
from machine learning. We examine, in particular, the diffusion of certain key ideas of the theory
of evolution in the broader cultural discourse and imaginary. We find that some concepts in
Darwin’s theory, such as Evolution, Survival, Natural Selection and Competition, diffused in the
cultural discourse immediately after the publication of On the Origins of Species. Other concepts
such as Selection and Adaptation were already present in the cultural dialogue. Moreover, we
document semantic changes for most of these concepts over time, and a more positive sentiment
toward these ideas, thus providing further insights about the channels through which Darwin’s
theory influenced the broader discourse. Our findings provide the first large-sample, systematic
quantitative evidence of the relation between two key factors of long-term economic growth
(science and culture), and suggest that machine learning and natural language processing offer
promising tools to explore this relation.

1. Introduction

"Economic change in all periods depends, more than most economists think, on what people
believe." (Mokyr, The Enlightened Economy, p.1, 2012)

Scientific and technological progress is a fundamental driver of economic growth and human
development; as such, it is crucial to understand what its determinants are, and the ways in which
it impacts economic outcomes. According to Acemoglu et al. (2001), for example, institutions
have a fundamental role in affecting a society’s capacity to produce new technologies. Other
scholars, such as McCloskey (2016) and Mokyr (2015), emphasize the role that culture played in
encouraging scientific discoveries, and, through them, technological advances. Guiso, Sapienza,
and Zingales (2003, 2004a) document a strong relationship between culture and macroeconomic
outcomes, and Williamson (2000) argues that culture could lead to permanent effects on economic
development, given its persistence in the long run.
    Despite the evidence on the impact of both scientific progress and cultural change on economic
variables, we know little about the relationship between these two broad phenomena. In this paper,
we propose the first large-sample empirical study of one aspect of this relationship, namely the
impact of scientific progress on cultural change. This exercise presents three main challenges.
First, one would need a long-time horizon to analyze the interplay between public discourse and
scientific and technological progress. Second, the plausible two-way relationship between science
and cultural change makes it difficult to identify causal links; if, on the one hand, scientific
progress can spur the diffusion and acceptance of certain ideas, on the other hand the presence and
diffusion of some ideas can facilitate the emergence and acceptance of scientific discoveries.
Third, the determination of what constitutes culture and cultural change, and how to measure them,
is problematic.
    We focus on one of the major advancements in the history of science: Charles Darwin’s theory
of evolution by natural selection, a milestone discovery with implications well beyond biological
sciences (Ayala 2009). That Darwin’s theory had a broad social and cultural impact is, on the one
hand, undisputed; on the other hand, evidence of how this influence occurred is scant. This limits
our ability to locate the theory of evolution in the broader social and economic history. With our
study, we begin to fill this gap.




                                                 2
   The publication of On the Origins of Species, in 1859, made Darwin’s theory known to a vast
public; the timing of the publication was largely unplanned, and we rely on this event as our main
source of natural variation. To measure cultural change and its diffusion, we perform text analysis
using natural language processing methods, based on machine learning, on a large corpus of
digitized books. Specifically, we investigate how certain scientific concepts that were central to
Darwin’s theory spread in the cultural discourse. By operationalizing concepts with specific words
and phrases, we are able to document which particular ideas were actually culturally novel in
Darwin’s contributions, which ones were already present in the public discourse, and which ones
were present but influenced different cultural spheres over time.
   The main text corpus on which we perform our analysis is Google Books, a digitized collection
of about eight million books. We define the publication year of On the Origin of Species (1859)
as our reference date and concentrate the analysis on the four decades before and after it. We
consider words and expressions that, according to many accounts, represent the key concepts in
Darwin’s theory (Desmond and Moore 1994, Mayr 1982): Evolution, Survival, Competition,
(Natural) Selection, and Adaptation. The frequencies of use of these words provide a measure of
the adoption and relevance of certain concepts in the public discourse. We compare, both
descriptively and in difference-in-differences econometric frameworks, the evolution of the
frequency of use of Darwinian concepts with the frequency of a large number of words not related
directly to Darwin’s theory but extensively present in On the Origins of Species.
   We complement the frequency analysis on the Google Books corpus with evidence from
Congressional Records, which include all the remarks and debates given on the floor of the House
and Senate of the United States, again for the period 1820-1899. With this additional corpus, we
assess whether certain concepts diffused not only in the cultural discourse, but also in the political
arena, thus potentially shaping the policy debate.
   We then explore the semantic change of these words as well as the changes in “sentiments”
towards them over time. To study semantic and sentiment evolution, we employ word-embedding
techniques from the Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning literature.
   We present two main sets of results. First, some key concepts in Darwin’s theory became
relevant in the broader cultural discourse in the years immediately after the publication of On the
Origins of Species: Evolution, Survival and, to a lesser extent, Competition. The patterns of
diffusion of these words were similar in the non-fiction and fiction literature. This indicates that



                                                  3
these concepts had a broad impact on culture as well as on the social imaginary as represented, for
example, by short stories and novels. Other key concepts such as Selection and Adaptation were
already present in the cultural discourse. Although the relative frequency of the term Selection per
se did not vary around the publication of On the Origins of Species, the expression Natural
Selection was virtually nonexistent before 1859 and diffused rapidly thereafter; this suggests a
potential change in the way the term Selection was used. We also document that some of the key
Darwinian ideas entered the policy debate, which we measure with U.S. Congress textual data,
after 1859 but with some delay with respect to the entry of these concepts in the broader public
discourse. The effects of On the Origin of the Species were not specific to the English-speaking
world; the Darwinian concepts diffused in non-English speaking countries right after the
translation of the book in the corresponding language. Moreover, the translation occurred earlier
in countries that industrialized earlier, such as Germany and France, than in “late comers” such as
Italy and Spain.
   The second set of results concerns changes in the semantics of these words as well as in the
types of reactions, or sentiments, that they generated over time. Of interest is the increase in
semantic association between certain words, such as Competition (or Struggle) and Life, as well
as between Life and Adaptation, immediately following the publication of On the Origins of
Species. This is consistent with Darwin’s theories affecting the perception of what existence means
and how it unfolds. Furthermore, the term Adaptation became, over the 19th Century, less related
to physical terms (such as Mechanism) and increasingly related to concept related to living beings
(such as Organism and Reproduction). The term Evolution, which came mostly from chemistry
and physics in the first half of the 1800s, later in the century related more to concepts from biology
as well as social and human subjects, indicating a broader reach of this idea in society.
Furthermore, Selection became more similar in meaning to other “Darwinian” words, such as
Survival, Variation, Fittest and Heredity. The key concepts of Darwin’s theory of evolution that
we consider also have higher semantic similarity with the word Darwin itself than with the names
of other scientists who elaborated theories of evolutions, such as Lamarck, Wallace and Chambers.
This suggests that such concepts as Evolution, Selection, Survival, Competition and Adaptation
were particularly associated, in the public discourse, with Darwin’s work and not just generically
with the progress in the biological sciences of the time. Finally, sentiment analysis shows a more




                                                  4
positive attitude toward certain Darwinian concept after the publication of On the Origins of
Species, in particular Evolution, and a positive attitude toward Darwin himself.
    Our results provide insights as to how Darwin’s theory of evolution led to the diffusion of
some concepts in the broader cultural discourse, and affected the use, meaning and public
perception of concepts that were already part of the public conversation. To the extent that a culture
that values scientific inquiry and evidence is more likely to promote economic development
(Mokyr 2016), a channel through which this appreciation may occur is precisely through scientific
progress; enhancing the knowledge of this channel is a meaningful exercise. The relationship
between scientific discoveries and the public discourse also helps understanding deep social and
political processes, such as the extent to which, to paraphrase Alexander Hamilton’s reflections in
the Federalist Papers, a society is based on a “culture of reason and evidence”, i.e. whether
scientific inquiry guides shared beliefs and choices.


Related literature. The stream of literature that is closest to our work includes studies of how
different cultures are more or less open to scientific and technological change, and how certain
scientists may introduce new sets of beliefs in a population with their “macro” discoveries.3 Mokyr
(2013, 2016) calls these scientists “cultural entrepreneurs”, and our paper attempts to quantify their
impact on societal beliefs.
    We also contribute to the growing use of “text as data” in the social sciences. In economics,
for example, the use of text corpora is developing especially in such fields as political economy,
the study of media, and innovation (Balsmeier et al. 2018; Bandiera et al. 2017; Catalini et al.
2015; Gentzkow et al. 2018, Iaria et al. 2018; Jelveh et al. 2014; Kelly et al. 2017). In business
studies, there are several applications to marketing and finance (see Kearney and Liu 2014 for a
review). Recent work in sociology addresses questions such as the common understanding of
social class using text analysis (Kozlowski et al. 2019). Scholars in linguistics and literary criticism
are increasingly employing computerized text analysis to answer questions about the evolution of
literary genres and styles, and semantic changes of words and concepts. Digital text analysis or
“distant reading” also allows for the inclusion in the analyses of the “great unread”, i.e. the large



3
 Mokyr (2013) distinguishes between “macro” and “micro” scientific discoveries, and argues that only the first ones
are able to create a discontinuous change in a society development. The latter are important to guarantee a continuous
improvement, but do not cause any breakthrough.

quantity of texts that normally scholars do not study, but that, as a whole, represent the broader
social and cultural climate at a given time (Cohen 1999, Heuser and Le-Khac 2011, Heuser 2016,
Moretti 2013, Wilkens, 2015). An area of study known as “cultural analytics” or “culturomics”
explores the evolution of culture through text analysis (Aiden and Michel 2014, Manovich 2009,
Michel et al. 2011), and in particular through the study of changes in the frequency and meaning
of certain words and expressions over time. To our knowledge, there are no applications to
studying the public perception of science.
   Finally, our work relates to the literature on the role of institutions in the diffusion of ideas and
innovation (Abramitzky and Sin 2014). Our paper looks at the impact of scientific advancements
on the perception of key ideas and concepts in society, and at how these ideas and concepts were
already permeating the public discourse.


Plan of the paper. In Section 2, we provide a brief account of Darwin’s elaboration of the theory
of evolution by natural selection. We also explain why the publication of On the Origin of Species
provides natural variation that allows studying the effect of Darwin’s theory on the broader public
discourse. In Section 3, we describe the text-based data that we use and the techniques and
empirical strategies that we adopt to extract information about cultural evolution. Section 4 reports
the findings, and, in Section 5, we provide a discussion and propose directions for future research.




2. Historical Background and Identification
     “It is doubtful if any single book, except the ‘Principia,’ ever worked so great and so
     rapid a revolution in science, or made so deep an impression on the general mind.”
     Obituary for Charles Darwin, Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, 1888.

2.1. The Development of Darwin’s Theory of Evolution
Charles Darwin’s interest in the evolution of living organisms largely developed during his voyage
on the HMS Beagle, a ship of the Royal Navy, from 1831 to 1836. Over those five years, Darwin
collected fossils from the places that he visited and observed their geographical distribution.
Although his early conjectures built on previous theories (such as Lamarck’s and Chambers’) and
considered the possibility of the transformation of one species into another (transmutation), he
then developed his own theory of evolution based on the natural selection of the most adaptive


                                                  6
(innate) characteristics of a species. Small, gradual variations within a species would emerge
randomly, and would lead to branching of new species. Competition for resources and adaptive
capacities would determine whether and where a particular species would be more likely to thrive.
The developments in genetic research in 20th century provided corroboration and foundations to
Darwin’s theory (Desmond and Moore 1994; Mayr 1982).4
    In addition to being one of the greatest scientific breakthroughs in history, there is a perception
that Darwin’s theory of evolution had a wider cultural reach (Desmond and Moore 1994; Fuller
2017; Mayr [1982, 2001]). For example, the ideas of competition for resources, common origins
of species, and random variation implied the absence of a teleology or (benevolent) design, that is,
a very different conception of nature and of God.5 The likely common origins of all species,
moreover, eliminated any idea of intrinsic superiority of humans over other living beings, and,
within humans, of a race over another. Fuller (2017) argues that Darwin’s theory had a major
influence on the debate over race, slavery and discrimination in the United States, thus hinting at
a major role of this scientific breakthrough in the evolution of the American society. Mokyr (2013,
2016) includes Darwin among a small set of “cultural entrepreneurs”, i.e. scientists whose
discoveries affected deeply held and broadly shared popular beliefs.
    These accounts, however, focus on a narrow set of literary contributions or debates mostly
restricted to scientific, political and economic elites; this makes it hard to advance inferences about
the broader cultural impact of this scientific advance, and about the cultural climate that preceded
that breakthrough. Our approach to answering these questions relies on a massive corpus of fiction
and non-fiction literary work, and therefore offers a methodological contribution that allows going
beyond the analysis of a small set of texts and authors as a way to extrapolate general cultural
views and trajectories.

 Research in literary criticism analyzed how the production of certain poets and novelists, began to reflect ideas of a
different role that nature had in its relationship with humans and the environment. Similarly, studies of the literary
production prior to the publication of On the Origin of Species point out how some of Darwin’s ideas connected to
images already developed by these writers. A frequently cited example is the work of Alfred Tennyson, and in
particular his poem In Memoriam, published in 1850. Scholars also investigated the connections between broader
worldviews, such as Enlightenment and Romanticism, on Darwin’s ideas (Cartwright and Baker 2005; Chapple 1986;
Gianquitto and Fisher 2014; Lansley 2016; Otis 2009; Richards 2013; Scholnick 2015).

2.2. Identification Strategy
Some features of how Darwin made his work public enable us to identify the impact of his work
on the broader cultural discourse. Although Darwin developed his theory over a long period, there
is a precise time at which Darwin’s theory reached the broader public, and this is 1859, the year
of publication of On the Origin of Species.6 This publication date was largely unplanned. Darwin
proceeded slowly initially and had to deal with sickness and deaths in his family that further
delayed him. However, eventually he “rushed” in order not to lose priority over Alfred R. Wallace,
who was researching on the same topics and had sent Darwin some of his writings that developed
similar concepts and reached similar conclusions about natural selection.
    The book and Darwin’s theory received almost immediate attention and diffusion, thanks to
presentations at scientific meetings such as the Linnaean Society (of a joint paper with Wallace in
1858) and the British Association for the Advancement of Science (in 1860), as well as reviews in
the popular press (see for example Gray 1860; Huxley 1859).
    The unplanned publication date of Darwin’s theory provides the main source of variation for
our empirical study. The rapid diffusion of the theory gives us an opportunity to observe the effect
on the diffusion of the main concepts, and to establish which ones were especially novel and had
an independent impact on the broader public discourse.
    To be sure, On the Origins of Species was not the first treatment of evolution. Darwin’s theory
was novel in several ways and more coherent than previous ones, but earlier in the 19th Century
some related ideas were already been elaborated and discussed; examples include the work of
Lamarck, the anonymous Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation (later attributed to the
Scottish journalist and publisher Robert Chambers), and of course the work of Alfred R. Wallace.
Our empirical strategy, however, allows assessing whether the publication of Darwin’s book
represented a discontinuous change in the cultural discourse. In the analyses reported below we
attempt to address the issue of whether the theory of evolution as Darwin presented it was already
“in the air” with a variety of empirical exercises.




6
  The year 1859 saw also the publication of other important works, John Stuart Mill’s On Liberty, Tennyson’s Idylls
of the King, Eliot’s Adam Bede and Dickens’ A Tale of Two Cities. These publications make it harder to identify a
connection between the publication of The Origins of Species and changes in the public discourse. However, in our
study, we focus on rather specific concepts that are central in Darwin’s work but not in the other works mentioned
above; we also consider the presence of those concepts in the public discourse before 1859.

         “The limits of my language mean the limits of my world.” Ludwig Wittgenstein,
         Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus (1922).

To examine the diffusion and the evolution of the meaning and interpretation of scientific concepts
over time, we exploit the increasing availability of digitized text corpora, as well as the tools of
natural language analysis. Our first step is to compute relative frequencies of some key words that
embody the main concepts in Darwin’s theory of evolution, and that Darwin used extensively in
his own work. These frequencies represent a basic measure of the adoption of certain ideas in the
broader cultural and social discourse. The second step of our investigation focuses on word
embeddings, which are widely used as an effective tool for the analysis of semantic and sentiment
change (Aiden and Michel 2014; Manovich 2009; Michel et al. 2011; Roth 2014).


Word Frequencies. We first rely on Google N-Grams7 (Lin et al. 2012) to assess how frequencies
of words changed over time in fiction and non-fiction literature. The Google N-Grams data is the
result of the Google Book project to build a vast collection of digitized books in partnership with
major libraries.8 First released in 2010, the data consist of a set of corpora of roughly eight million
books, an estimated 6% of all books ever published (Lin et al. 2012). The texts cover roughly a
500-year span and there is a continuous update. The database includes different languages (besides
English: Italian, French, German, Spanish, Russian, Hebrew, and Chinese). The English corpus
alone has half a trillion words in it. For the period that we consider (i.e., 1820 to 1899), there are
about 380,000 books containing more than 45 billion words in total. The data include both fiction
and non-fiction books, but not periodicals, and is aggregated depending on the number of terms
considered; for instance, the 1-ngram dataset includes single words and their frequency in a given
corpus, and n-grams are combinations of n words and their frequency. We compute frequencies
from 1-ngrams and 2-ngrams data for each year and express them in per-million-words terms.
      The ability to separate fiction and non-fiction literature is relevant to us for two main reasons.
First, one critique to the N-Grams (and Google Books) corpus is that it may over-represent
scientific texts (Pechenick et al. 2015). In our study, increases in the frequency of words related to
Darwin’s theory may just reflect a disproportionate increase over time of the corpus of scientific

books (included in the non-fiction category). Second, separating fiction and non-fiction literature
enables the analysis of different types of relationships between Darwinian science and broader
culture. The use of Darwin’s concepts in the non-fiction literature may better represent higher-
educated or more erudite conversations. Conversely, given the diffusion of the novel and the
relatively high literacy rates especially in England and the United States in the 19th century,
fictional literature may better measure the social imaginary (Armstrong 1987; Winans 1975).
    Whilst the Google Books data allow us to capture Darwin’s influence on the broader cultural
discourse, we also aim to assess whether his work had an impact on the political discourse. We
thus supplement our analyses using the digitized collection of the U.S. Congressional Records,
which includes reports of all discussions occurring on the floor of the House and Senate
(ProQuest’s Congressional Record Permanent Digital Collection) 9. The Congressional Records
offer the opportunity to gauge the importance and diffusion of a given topic in the political arena;
they and have been increasingly used by researchers in political science and economics (e.g.,
Gentzkow and Shapiro 2010).


Semantic Evolution and Sentiment Analysis: Word Embeddings
The analysis of word frequencies is informative, but does not provide insights about how a given
word was used and its perception in society. The semantic changes and the evolution of attitudes
toward a concept may be a more appropriate measure of cultural change if one interprets the
meaning of a word as the association of that word with other concept and ideas, and the attitudes
toward a concept as whether that concept had a positive or negative reception.
    Natural language processing relies on word embedding techniques to determine the meaning
of and sentiment toward words from large text corpora, and their evolution over time. The main
idea of word embedding is that we can evaluate semantic associations between words by analyzing
co-occurrence patterns in a text. Two words of similar meaning are unlikely to appear, say, in the
same sentence, but they are likely to be surrounded by similar words. For example, we would not
expect that within five words before and after the word “queen” (the “context words”) we read the



9
  These includes Congressional Record (1873-1997), the Congressional Globe (1833-1873), the Register of Debates
in Congress (1824-1837), and the Annals of Congress (1789-1824). It is worth noticing that before 1873 each House
was only required to keep an internal journal of its proceedings. Only from 1874 onwards were external reporters
allowed to witness debates and granted full permission to report them (McPherson 1942).


                                                       10
word “monarch”; however, there is plausibly high overlap between the words that appear before
and after “queen”, and those that appear close to “monarch”.
       The outcome of word embedding algorithms is a set of vectors that includes information about
co-occurring patterns among words. Consider for example a text corpus with V words w (w=1,
2,…, V). For each word, one can specify a subset of context words that appear within a window
of m words before and after w. The objective is to represent each word w as a Nx1 vector, with
N<V determined by the researcher, where each entry is a measure of how frequent is the occurrence
of w with each of the context words. Taken together, the N-dimensional V vectors form the VxN
embedding matrix.
       In order to create word embeddings vectors, we adopt a Word2Vec approach (SkipGram with
negative sampling; Mikolov et al. 2013), a technique that has been used extensively in literature
interested in measuring semantic change (e.g., Garg et al. 2017, Bolukbasi et al. 2016; Caliskan et
al. 2017). The Word2Vec model is based on a neural-network structure that we represented, in
simplified form, in Figure 1. The starting point is the definition of Vx1 one-hot vectors for each
focal word w, i.e. vectors of all 0’s except one value of 1 in correspondence of the word of interest.
Two matrices, called the embedding and context matrices, are initially filled with random weights
that the training process updates. For each word w, the algorithm multiplies a one-hot vector, or
input layer, by the embedding matrix of VxN dimension, to obtain a Nx1 vector, called the hidden
layer. This vector simply “copies” the input layer into the embedding matrix that corresponds to
the word w. In turn, multiplying the hidden layer by the NxV context matrix produces the Vx1
output layer. The V entries (or scores) in the output layers go through a soft-max activation
function, which maps the scores to a probability distribution. The probability vectors have values
that range from 0 to 1 and sum up to 1.10 These vectors can now be compared to the “target” one-
hot-encoding vector of a given context word c to obtain a vector of errors by subtracting the
probability vector from the “target” vector. Using this information, a backpropagation mechanism
(Rumelhart, Hinton and Williams 1986a) updates the weights in the embedded and context matrix.
The training process proceeds by considering all combinations of words w and context words c.



                                                                                                                   𝑒 𝑣𝑐 𝑣𝑤
10
     The aim of the softmax function is to map scores into probability distributions as follows: p(𝑐|𝑤; 𝜃) =              ′       ,
                                                                                                               ∑𝑐′ ∈ 𝐶 𝑒 𝑣 𝑐 𝑣𝑤
where 𝑣𝑐 and 𝑣𝑤 are vector representations of context word c and focal word w respectively, and C is the set of all
possible contexts. The estimation procedure thus consists of maximizing the probability that a given context word
occurs within a given window around each focal word of interest.


                                                            11
The final output consists of updated scores in the VxN embedding matrix. Each row in the matrix
is the embedded vector for each of the V words w, where each of the entries is a coordinate in an
N-dimensional space, and carries information about the context.
     These embedded vectors satisfy some “linearity” features in the relationship between, for
example, the singular and plural form of a word, or feminine and masculine versions. Using a
frequent example in the literature, we expect that, when the word vectors corresponding to king,
kings, queen, queens, man and woman, the following holds: (king – kings) ≈ (queen – queens) and
(king – man) ≈ (queen – woman).
     The closer two word vectors are in the N-dimensional space, the closer the semantic association
between the two words.11 The main metric of the association or proximity between vectors is the
cosine between them (Dubossarsky et al. 2015; Gulordava and Baroni 2011; Jatowt and Duh 2014;
Kim et al. 2014; Kulkarni et al. 2015). Call 𝛾 the angle between two N-dimensional vectors 𝑢 =

(𝑢1 , …. 𝑢𝑁 ) and 𝑣 = (𝑣1 , …. 𝑣𝑁 ). Then, 𝑢′ 𝑣 = √∑𝑁
                                                    𝑖=1 𝑢𝑖 ∗ √∑𝑖=1 𝑣𝑖 ∗ cos(𝛾) = ‖𝑢 ‖‖𝑣‖ cos(𝛾),
                                                         2     𝑁    2


                  𝑢 ′𝑣
or: cos(𝛾) = ‖𝑢‖‖𝑣‖ ∈ [−1,1]. The more similar the two vectors, the closer to one the cosine.

     We investigate whether the words that defined the main Darwinian concepts shared context
words with different terms before and after the publication of On the Origins of Species. We rely
on previously trained Word2Vec embeddings resulting from the n-grams distributed by Google
Books (Hamilton et al. 2016).12 Figures are available for every decade between 1800 and 1990 and
data are designed to enable comparisons across decades. The models use a context window of four
and parameters as suggested by Levy et al. (2015) to measure semantic changes in cultural shifts.13


Sentiment analysis
The measure of semantic similarity (cosine distance) includes all N dimensions. Each dimension
explains some of the variance that distinguishes association patterns among all the words in a text
corpus. Generally, however, it is hard to interpret each dimension. One might therefore consider
projecting these vectors on a limited subset of pre-specified dimensions and evaluate the position

11
   Embeddings can measure close semantic relationships between words as well as more global ones. For instance,
beyond successfully measuring shifts in word meanings over time (Hamilton et al. 2016), embedded vectors have also
been used to track demographic and occupational social shifts (e.g., Garg et al. 2017) and gender stereotypes (e.g.,
Bolukbasi et al. 2016; Caliskan et al. 2017).
12
   We set N=300 for all decades, whereas V is specific to each 10-year period.

   See Hamilton et al. (2016) also for a discussion on the pre-processing methods and parameters used.

of each vector on the new space, to measure the association of a given word within a set of well-
defined underlying concepts. Kozlowski et al. (2019), for instance, project vectors related to
different musical genres (e.g., jazz, rap, etc.) onto a plan that measures “affluence”, to determine
whether, say, jazz is more associated with wealthier strata of a population than rap, and how these
associations vary over time. Following this approach, we specified some dimensions that might be
relevant for gauging the sentiments surrounding key Darwinian concepts over time. We focus in
particular on “goodness”, “importance”, and “morality”. In order to build these dimensions, we
first identify pairs of antonym words that are closely related to what we aim to capture. We then

of a given pair belonging to the set of relevant pairs P. Our dimensions are based on the work of
Jenkins et al (1958), who specify a list of terms for a variety of cultural dimensions. Once we
identify our dimensions, we proceed by calculating the orthogonal projection of the vectors of key
Darwinian words on each dimension and track their position over time.


4. Frequency Analysis
In this section, we analyze the evolution of the relative frequency of key words in the Darwin’s
theory and two-word expressions as measures of the diffusion of key concepts in the public
discourse around the time of the publication of On the Origin of Species in 1859.


4.1 Darwinian and “Control” Concepts; Fiction and Non-fiction Books
Graphical Analysis. We consider terms (1-grams) that, from many accounts (Desmond and
Moore 1994, and Mayr 1995), as well as our own reading, represent the key concepts in Darwin’s
theory: Evolution, Selection, Adaptation, Competition, Survival, and the expression (2-gram)
Natural Selection. Figure 2 reports their frequency of use, per million words, in each year between
1820 and 1899, separately in fiction and non-fiction books.14 We scale the y-axes differently for
the two categories in each graph.
     The expression Natural Selection, perhaps the most defining of Darwin’s concepts, was
virtually non-existent in both the fiction and non-fiction literature before 1859 and experienced a


14
  We initially included also the word Mutation, but then opted to discard it its occurrence was too low throughout the
period of interest to allow for meaningful analyses


                                                         13
significant increase in use since then. On the one hand, this may not be surprising, precisely
because of the close association of Darwin with the idea of natural selection. On the other hand,
we may consider the significant increase in the diffusion of this concept immediately after the
publication of On the Origin of Species as a validation of our approach; this initial analysis of
frequencies appears to capture what we might have expected.
   Moving to other Darwinian concepts, also Evolution and Survival entered the public discourse
in the years immediately following the publication of On the Origin of Species. The ideas that
underlie these words and expressions, therefore, generated interest not only in specialized or more
educated circles, but plausibly also in the more general cultural context. Interestingly, the diffusion
of these concepts in the fiction literature lagged the diffusion in the non-fiction literature by a few
years. Competition was already present in the first part of the 19th Century, especially in the non-
fiction literature, and experienced an increase in frequency after about 1860. Selection and
Adaptation, in contrast, did not see a further increase in relative frequency around the publication
of On the Origins of Species; Adaptation reached a stable relative frequency in the 1840s, whereas
the frequency of Selection was constantly increasing since the early 19th Century. Note that
Selection was already increasing its presence in the cultural discourse before 1859, whereas
Natural Selection appeared after the publication of On the Origins of Species. This suggests the
possibility that, after 1859, the word Selection might have experienced a change of meaning,
perception and use in the public discourse. We will investigate this below.
   In Figure 3, we display the relative occurrence of some terms that were of frequent use in
general and in the sciences, are not specific to Darwin’s theory, and appear very frequently in On
the Origins of Species. In looking at these terms, our objective is to assess whether there were
general trends in the use or diffusion of scientific concepts. The words that we consider in the
figure are Number, Life, Animals, Flowers, Plants and Nature. For none of these words is there
any discernible change in diffusion in the decades immediately preceding and following the
publication of On the Origin of Species. These “generic” words are a subsample of the full set of
nouns whose frequency we use as “control” in the regression analyses that we describe below.


Regression Results: Word-by-Word Time Series. Table 1 reports estimates from spline
regressions of the yearly relative frequency of use (per million words) of each of the Darwinian
words and phrases, as well as of the subsample of six generic words that we represented in the



                                                  14
graphs above, on time t=20, 21, …, 99, with a knot at t=59 corresponding to year 1859. The
reported values are the estimated slopes of the diffusion curves in the two sub-periods. Table 2
displays the estimates from spline regressions where the outcome is the natural logarithm of the
frequency per million words (+0.01), and the knot is at the natural logarithm of t=59. In these log-
transformed models, the estimates thus represent elasticities, and it is therefore easier to make
comparisons across words. Table 3 reports estimates from the same spline regressions in natural
log terms, separately for fiction and non-fiction books, and limited to the Darwinian concepts.
Finally, Table 4 reports spline regressions for the Darwinian words, separately for fiction and non-
fiction books, with knots at each decade between 1820 and 1899 (20-29, 30-39, …, 90-99), in
natural logarithm.
     The estimates, both in absolute and relative terms, corroborate the visual evidence from Figure
2. For the Darwinian terms discussed above, the increase in slope after 1859 is statistically
significant and especially large for Natural Selection, Evolution, Survival and Competition. We
do not detect any specific pattern related to the publication of On the Origins of Species for the six
generic words. We ran the same spline regressions for the full set of the 99 most frequent nouns in
On the Origins of Species (one of the originally selected 100 words is Selection, which we exclude
from the controls; the list of words is in Appendix Table A1). Appendix Figure A1 reports the
estimates of the yearly frequency slopes in the 1820-59 and 1860-99 periods. The estimates are
split between negative and positive; Figure A2 shows that the estimates of the slopes in the two
sub-periods for a given word are very similar to each other.15


Regression Results: Differences in Differences. We use the full set of control words to perform
differences-in-differences analyses where we estimate the aggregate diffusion patterns of
Darwinian and generic words before and after 1859. We perform these analyses in two ways.
     First, in Table 5 we report the estimates from analyses where, for each year, we sum up the
frequencies of the six Darwinian concepts on the one hand and of the ninety-nine control nouns on
the other hand, and compare the trends in this aggregate diffusion before and after 1859. Because
the aggregate frequency of the generic words is much higher than the frequency of the Darwinian



15
   Appendix Table A3, where we report estimates with specific slopes and steps for each decade between 1820 and
1899 instead of only one “cut” in 1859, also confirms the delay in diffusion in the fiction literature that we observed
in the graphical representations above.


                                                          15
concepts pooled together, to make more immediate comparisons we transform these frequencies
into their natural logarithms and include the logarithm of the time trend in the regression analyses.
Therefore, we compare scale-free elasticities. In this analysis, we also pool together fiction and
non-fiction books. The regression model that we estimate is as follows:
 ln(𝑦𝑤𝑡 ) = 𝛼𝑤 + 𝛽𝑤 ln(𝑡) + 𝛾𝑤 (ln(t) − ln(59)) ∗ 𝟏(𝑡 > 59) + 𝛿𝑤 𝟏(𝐷𝑎𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑎𝑛) +
 𝜃𝑤 ln(𝑡) ∗ 𝟏(𝐷𝑎𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑎𝑛) + 𝜆𝑤 (ln(t) − ln(59)) ∗ 𝟏(𝑡 > 59) + 𝜇𝑤 (ln(t) − ln(59)) ∗                         (1)
 𝟏(𝐷𝑎𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑎𝑛 ) ∗ 𝟏(𝑡 > 59) + 𝜀𝑤𝑡 .

     The data thus include 160 observations, two for each year, with one reporting information
about the generic words (𝟏(𝐷𝑎𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑎𝑛 ) = 0), and the other about the six Darwinian concepts
(𝟏(𝐷𝑎𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑎𝑛) = 1). Columns 1 and 2 of Table 3 display estimates of a simplified version of
the model, were the left-hand-side variable is the natural logarithm of the sum of frequencies of
Darwinian and generic terms separately, regressed on a time trend and the interaction between the
indicator for years greater than 1859 and the difference between the current year and 1859.
Estimates of the parameters of the full model 3 are in column 3. The estimate on the coefficient on
the interaction between the indicator for Darwinian words, the indicator for the post-1859 period
and the difference between the current year and 1859 (𝜇𝑤 ) is positive, large and statistically
significant, indicating a much larger relative increase in the frequency of Darwinian concepts after
1859. The estimate of 𝜃𝑤 is significantly smaller than the estimate of 𝜇𝑤 , but it is positive and
statistically different from zero; this indicates that also before 1859, the frequency of Darwinian
concepts was increasing at a higher rate that the combined generic terms. This is likely due to the
trend and diffusion that some Darwinian terms, such as Selection and Adaptation, were
experiencing also in the first half of the 19th Century.16 The trend, however, clearly had an
additional, fast acceleration after the publication of On the Origins of Species.
     Second, we consider a model where the outcome variable is the annual frequency (from 1820
to 1899) of each of the six Darwinian concepts and ninety-nine control nouns separately, and we
estimate the average difference in frequency for the Darwinian words and the generic words per
each decade:




16
  If, for example, we exclude Adaptation and Selection from computing the aggregate frequency of the Darwinian
concept, the estimate of 𝜃𝑤 declines from 0.36 to 0.08, whereas the estimate of 𝜇𝑤 increases from 1.74 to 3.08.


                                                      16
 ln(𝑦𝑤𝑡 ) = 𝛼𝑤 + 𝛽𝑤 𝟏(𝐷𝑎𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑎𝑛) + ∑4𝑗=2 𝛾𝑖 𝟏( 𝑗0 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 𝑗9) +
 ∑9𝑗=6 𝛾𝑗 𝟏(𝑗0 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 𝑗9) + ∑4𝑖=2 𝛿𝑖 𝟏(𝑗0 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 𝑗9) ∗ 𝟏(𝐷𝑎𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑎𝑛 ) +                             (2)
 ∑9𝑗=6 𝛿𝑗 𝟏(𝑗0 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 𝑗9) ∗ 𝟏(𝐷𝑎𝑟𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑖𝑎𝑛 ) + 𝜀𝑤𝑡

   This analysis is therefore based on (6+99)*80=8,400 observations. Figure 4 displays the
estimates of the 𝛿𝑗 coefficients and their 95% confidence intervals. The omitted time category is
the decade 1850-59 (50 ≤ 𝑡 ≤ 59). This analysis provides further evidence of the different
patterns of diffusion of the Darwinian words immediately following 1859, compared to statistically
insignificant differences before the publication of On the Origins of Species.


4.2 Translation in Other Languages
Were the effects of On the Origin of Species specific to the context in which the book was written
and first published? Or did the treatise generate a similar impact in other countries upon its
translation? Moreover, did the diffusion of scientific concepts in the cultural environment depend
on the status of a country economic development? To answer these questions, we study whether
the translations of On the Origin of Species generated a similar the diffusion of its key concepts in
other languages.
   As shown in Figure 5, the phrase Natural Selection dramatically increased its diffusion upon
the translation of On the Origin of Species. The same holds for such words as Evolution, Survival,
and Competition (Figure A3 in the Appendix). Moreover, the diffusion of most words started
increasing right after 1859, indicating that, even in the absence of an official translation, Darwin’s
concepts diffused across borders. These results suggest that the cultural effects of The Origin of
the Species were not specific to the English-speaking context.
   An important caveat in interpreting these results is that we cannot claim the translation year
was exogenous. For example, the translation might have occurred first in countries were the
interest was higher, and this, in turn, might have affected its diffusion. The likely endogeneity of
the publication year, on the other hand, offers the opportunity for additional discussions on the
relationship between the broad cultural acceptance of scientific concepts and economic
development. For instance, in countries like Italy and Spain, both “late comers” during the
Industrial Revolution (Ciccarelli and Nuvolari, 2015), the translation of On the Origin of the
Species occurred latter than the translation into French and German, i.e., the languages of two



                                                 17
countries where industrialization occurred earlier. Similarly, Russia, which was mostly a feudal
country until World War I (Markevich and Zhuravskaya, 2018), had the first translation of
Darwin’s book even later. In fact, the diffusion of Darwinian words and phrases was extremely
limited in Russian books in the 19th Century. These terms, finally, were virtually nonexistent in
Chinese books. This is consistent with Mokyr’s (2008) idea of Chinese isolation in the scientific
debate, and in turn of its delayed industrial development.


4.3 Ideas in the Air and Multiple Attribution
The various findings that we just reported show that some concepts, as measured by the words that
embody them, were only marginally part of the public discourse before the publication of On the
Origin of Species. But even if some words entered the public discourse only after 1859, can we
attribute this only to the work of Darwin? In other words, would this diffusion have occurred
starting in the 1860s, irrespective of Darwin’s contribution? In Figure 6 we report the frequency
of occurrence of the names of four scientists who contributed, in different ways, to our
understanding of evolution. In addition to Darwin, we consider Alfred Russell Wallace, Robert
Chambers, and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck. Lamarck’s theory of the transmission of acquired traits is
frequently mentioned as an example of “failed” theory to compare to Darwin’s. Chambers’
Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation introduced, in the 1840s, the idea of an “evolution” of
living and non-living beings over time, more as a speculation than as a scientific treatment (note
that the author was anonymous until 1884). Alfred Russell Wallace’s work was much closer, in
time and content, to Darwin’s. Figure 6 shows that both Darwin and Wallace increased their
occurrence in the English book corpus in the second half of the 19 th Century, but Darwin’s
frequency increased substantially more. Chambers and Lamarck were already present before then,
but their frequency remained stable (and fairly low) after 1860.17
     In Figure 7 we report additional tests. Because Lamarck was (and originally wrote in) French,
we compare the diffusion of the words Darwin and Lamarck in the French corpus. After 1860, the
relative occurrence of the word Darwin in French books surpassed the frequency of Lamarck. We
also compare terms that related to the study of the emergence and development of new species:



17
  We add the following combinations of names, middle names and last names: Alfred Russel Wallace, Alfred Wallace,
Charles Darwin, Charles Robert Darwin, Robert Chambers, Jean-Baptiste Lamarck, Jean-Baptiste de Lamarck, Jean
Baptiste Lamarck, Jean Baptiste de Lamarck.


                                                       18
Evolution and Transmutation. Although Evolution, which we already analyzed above, is typically
associated with Darwin’s work, earlier works in biology (including some of Darwin’s) used the
term Transmutation to characterize (gradual or discrete) transformations of plants and animals. By
comparing these two words, we want to assess whether the broader literature and cultural discourse
also picked up the “newer” word to express these changes. For books in French, we consider the
word Transformism (Transformisme in French), which was used by Lamarck. The general pattern
is that Evolution became progressively more frequent than Transmutation, with a significant
change in frequency after the 1950s.
    Overall, this evidence suggests that Darwin, with his own work and especially his 1859 book,
caused a discontinuous change in the cultural discourse.


4.4 The Diffusion of Darwinian Concepts in the Political Debate
We perform frequency analyses on U.S. Congress data to assess whether Darwin’s theory spilled
over not only to the cultural discourse, but also to the political debate; arguably, this is a condition
for science-driven cultural change to affect outcome of social and economic relevance. The corpus
of Congressional Records includes the transcripts of all legislative debates occurring on the floor
of Congress. It also contains additional materials, such as communications from the president and
the executive branch agencies memorials, petitions, and supplementary information on the current
legislation. As such, it represents the official and most comprehensive daily account of the political
discussion happening in the House and the Senate.
    The findings, displayed in Figure 8, indicate an increase of the frequencies of such words and
concept as Evolution, Survival and Natural Selection in the Congress data after 1859. Spline
regression analyses confirm that the words more related to Darwin’s theory were more likely to
enter the political debate, compared to generic words. The increase becomes significant about two
decades after Darwin’s publication (estimates are in Appendix Table A4).
Overall, these results suggest that, after diffusing in the cultural environment, key Darwin’s
concepts also reached the political debate. The lag with which this happened, however, seems to
indicate that the cultural diffusion was faster than, and perhaps a pre-condition for political
diffusion. A limit of this analysis is that we cannot directly estimate the extent to which Darwin’s
theory affected policy decision making or economic impacts. However, that fact that the theory
reached the political is a necessary condition for it affecting policies as well.5. Semantic and

Word embedding techniques require very large sample sizes to produce reliable results and
insights. For this reason, in this section we limit the analysis to the Google Book database, and
aggregate the data at the decade level.


5.1 Semantic Analysis
Figure 9 introduces the second part of our study, where we move from the analysis of the
frequency of use of certain words and the concepts underlying them, to the analysis of the semantic
evolution of certain words and concepts, to see whether this evolution occurred in ways that we
can relate to Darwin’s theory. In the graphs, the horizontal axis reports decades (the time unit of
reference), and the vertical axis indicates the cosine between the two word vectors of interest.
   One aspect of Darwin’s theory is that life (or existence) includes adaptation, as well as
competition, among its defining aspects. We see an increase in the semantic association between
Life on the one hand, and Adaptation, Struggle and Competition on the other hand, especially after
1859. For Life and Struggle we see a trend since the early 19th Century. Several of the studies
mentioned above that relate Darwin’s work to the Romantic literary climate of the first half of the
19th Century, characterized by a more tumultuous view of nature, seem therefore to have captured
a more general trend. Greater cosine similarity between Survival and Competition started in the
1860s and increased since then. Finally, a controversial implication of Darwin’s theory is that
evolution applies to humans in the same way as it applies to other animals; although Darwin did
not explicitly treat the human species in his 1859 book, this was the topic of his 1871 The Descent
of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex. The semantic evolution of the word Human shows an
increase in its similarity with Animal especially in the late 1800s.
   In Figure 10 we assess the semantic association between the five key words in On the Origins
of Species that we took as expressing Darwin’ contribution (Evolution, Selection, Survival,
Competition and Adaptation), and the names of the four scientists (including Darwin) we
considered in Section 4.3 above. With this exercise, we aim to explore whether these key terms
that defined the theory of evolution by natural selection were, in fact, specifically associated with
Darwin or were part of a discourse that included also the contribution of other scientists. In general,
the similarity of these words with Darwin is systematically positive and greater than the similarity
with the other names. Lamarck generally shows higher similarity with the five key words than




                                                  20
Chambers and Wallace. This suggest that Darwin and Lamarck remained the two most prominent
figures, among students of evolution, in the cultural discourse.
    A second analysis of semantic changes focuses, again, on the key words and concepts that we
considered so far. However, instead of investigating the similarity of these words with a select
sample of other concepts, we “let the data speak” by determining, for each decade, the words with
the highest semantic connection (cosine similarity) to these key words. Figure 11 (A through E)
reports the findings. We excluded from the rankings of semantic similarity the words that had the
same root as the focal key word as well as the most obvious synonyms (e.g. Compete or Competitor
for Competition); we also defined a lower bound to the relevant cosine similarity to be equal to
0.05. The closer a word is to the horizontal (time) axis in the figures, the closer to one the cosine
similarity.
    The figures identify a few interesting facts. First, the term Adaptation became, over the 19th
Century, less related to physical or “mechanical” terms (such as Mechanism) and increasingly
similar to concepts that represented living beings (such as Organism and Reproduction).
    Second, substantial changes in meaning and association concern the word Evolution. In the
first half of the 19th Century, the terms that were closest to Evolution came mostly from chemistry
and physics. Later in the 1800s concepts from biology as well as related to human society were
semantically more similar to Evolution. Examples include Social and Progress. Note also how the
word Darwinian itself became closely associated with Evolution.
    Third, Selection was more closely related to the concept of Choice (and qualification for the
choice such as “careful” or judicious”) in the first half of 1800; the similarity in meaning with
Choice remained also later, but in the broader literature, Selection became more similar in meaning
to other specific “Darwinian” words, such as Survival, Variation, Fittest and Heredity.
    Fourth, very few words had a similarity in meaning with Survival, likely because the word
itself was only rarely used in the first half of the 19th Century. Later in the century, the word was
increasingly associated in the overall literature to other concepts related to evolutionary theory,
notably Fittest, Evolution, Struggle and Selection. The increasing relatedness with Fittest toward
the end of the 1880s is likely due also to the publication of the Principles of Biology by Herbert
Spencer in 1864, where this concept applies also to society and ethics and not only to the natural
sphere. Competition, in contrast, maintained an association with a stable set of words, mostly
related to production and markets, throughout the century.

5.2 Sentiment analysis
Figure 12 (A through C) displays the evolution over time of the perceptions or sentiments about
the key Darwinian concepts in English books, as well as about Darwin himself. We focus on the
proximity to three categories of antonyms: Unimportant vs. Important, Bad vs. Good, and Immoral
vs. Moral. These dichotomies help assessing whether Darwin’s concepts gained relevance and had
a positive or negative connotation in the public discourse.
   Although the evidence is not clear-cut, the term Evolution is, especially after 1859, perceived
as more important, moral, and good, and so is Competition. Therefore, these two key concepts in
Darwin’s theory not only experienced an increase in use and evolution of their meaning (especially
Evolution, as described in Section 5.1), but also were received positively. The term Darwin also
shows positive reception, with spikes around the publication of On the Origins of Species.


6. Conclusions
To the extent that both cultural and scientific change are major drivers of long-term economic
outcomes, the investigation of how these two phenomena interact with each other promises to offer
a deeper understanding of their role in enhancing growth.
   We focused on one of the major scientific breakthroughs, the theory of evolution via natural
selection of Charles Darwin, and explored its impact on the public discourse. Given the undoubted
importance of Darwin’s theory, there is a diffused perception that it affected culture in many
different ways, from changing the interpretation of nature to influencing ideas about race and
equality among humans. Existing accounts, however, largely rest on qualitative or narrative
evidence limited to scientists or cultural elites in society, whereas little is known about the wide
diffusion of Darwin’s ideas into society. Arguably, to affect cultural change (to be, in the
terminology of Mokyr [2013, 2016], a cultural entrepreneur), a scientist should have an impact on
the imaginary of a broader population. Moreover, it is difficult to identify, from existing accounts,
which Darwinian concepts were actually novel in the cultural discourse, and which ones were
already part of it. We address these challenges by analyzing the diffusion and the semantic
evolution of the key words and phrases that embody Darwin’s main concept in hundreds of
thousands of books, with the use of techniques from machine learning. We rely on the largely
unplanned publication date of On the Origin of Species as source of natural variation, and compare
the use of these words and phrases with more generic terms that Darwin used.


                                                 22
   Our analysis shows that the key concepts expressed by Evolution, Survival, Competition and
Natural Selection diffused in fiction and non-fiction literature immediately after the publication of
On the Origins of Species. Competition, a theme already present in the broader literature, diffused
significantly more rapidly after 1859. Other key concepts such as Selection and Adaptation were
already gaining relevance in the cultural discourse before 1859. The adoption of some of these
words and phrases in the broader cultural conversation led also to a change in the meaning of the
concepts, providing further evidence of the impact of Darwin’s theory in society at large; overall,
the attitude toward these concepts was positive rather than adversarial.
   Our approach has several inductive and descriptive aspects. The choice of the concepts on
which to focus may seem somewhat arbitrary; however, we based our selection on the main topics
that Darwin developed, as well as on the analysis of several interpretations of Darwin’s theory of
evolution. Moreover, it is generally hard to provide causal identification with this type of analysis.
The unplanned publication date of On the Origins of Species, the reliance on very large amount of
data, and the consistency in the patterns of different words, phrases and concepts, give us some
confidence about the nature of the patterns that we established.
   Finally, this is a single case study, and generalizations about the relationship between major
scientific discoveries and their cultural reception are difficult to make. Empirical approaches
enabled by machine learning techniques provide promising tools to explore this relationship
beyond the specific historical episode on which we focus. Examples of relevant scientific
breakthroughs include the theory of relativity or the indeterminacy principle in physics, the
discovery of the DNA, and the emergence of biotechnology and genetic engineering. In fact, one
could go beyond scientific discoveries and employ a similar approach to explore the cultural
antecedents and effects of new technologies as well as of new industries, such as computers and
the Internet (see for example Turner, 2010).

Figure 1: Word2Vec model




Notes: The diagram illustrates the structure of a Word2Vec model. Each word is encoded into binary vectors (one-
hot) of dimension Vx1. The embedding matrix (VxN) and the context matrix (NxV) are initialized with random weights
(note that N<V). The multiplication of the initial one-hot vector and the embedding matrix gives us the embedding
vector of the input word we are currently considering. This embedding vector forms a hidden layer of dimension Nx1.
The multiplication of the hidden layer and the context matrix forms the output vector, which becomes a probability
vector after a soft-max transformation. This vector can be readily compared to the one-hot vector that identifies the
considered context word (i.e., target vector). The difference between the probability and the target vector modifies the
scores of the embedding and context matrix through a backpropagation mechanism so that the weight can be adjusted
accordingly to real words co-occurrence.

Notes: Columns 1 and 2 report estimates from regressions where the outcome variable is the natural logarithm of the
aggregate frequency of the 99 most frequent nouns in On the Origins of Species (column 1) and of the aggregate
yearly frequencies of the six Darwinian word and concepts (column 2). The regression estimates in column 3 come
from combining the data used for the regressions in columns 1 and 2; therefore there are two observations per year
(N=160). Robust standard errors are in parenthesis. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.

Notes: Each dot represents the estimates of parameters 𝛾𝑤 and 𝛿𝑤 (top and bottom graph respectively) from
regression model 4, for the 99 high frequency generic nouns. Each word is represented by a number between 1 and
99 on the vertical axis (Table A1 reports the list of these words). The horizontal lines and bars are the 95% confidence
intervals of the estimates.

Notes: The table reports regressions of the natural logarithm of the relative annual frequency (per million words +
0.01) of use of a given word or phrase on the natural logarithm of a linear time trend, indicators for the years after
1829, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79 and 89, interactions of these indicators with the difference between the natural logarithm
of the current year and the natural logarithm of 29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79 and 89, respectively, and interactions of all
these previous terms with an indicator for whether an observation pertains to fiction books as opposed to non-
fiction books. There are two observations per year, one based on the corpus of non-fiction books, and the other on
the corpus of non-fiction books (N=160). Each regression is limited to one word or phrase as indicated in the
corresponding columns. The time trend is expressed as the last two digits of the corresponding year (e.g. 28 indicates
1828). Robust standard errors are in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.10.

Notes: The table reports regressions of the natural logarithm relative annual frequency of use (per million words
+0.01) of a given word or phrase on the natural logarithm of a linear time trend, indicators for the years after 1829,
39, 49, 59, 69, 79 and 89, and interactions of these indicators with the difference between the natural logarithm of
the current year and the natural logarithm of (18)29, 39, 49, 59, 69, 79 and 89, respectively. Each regression is limited
to one word or phrase as indicated in the corresponding column, and includes 80 observations, one for each year
from 1820 to 1899. The time trend is expressed as the last two digits of the corresponding year (e.g. 28 indicates
1828). Robust standard errors are in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1.
