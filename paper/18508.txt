Estimates of the Trade and Welfare Effects of NAFTA

                                              ABSTRACT

We build into a Ricardian model sectoral linkages, trade in intermediate goods, and sectoral heterogeneity
in production to quantify the trade and welfare effects from tariff changes. We also propose a new
method to estimate sectoral trade elasticities consistent with any trade model that delivers a multiplicative
gravity equation. We apply our model and use our estimated elasticities to identify the impact of NAFTA's
tariff reductions. We find that Mexico's welfare increases by 1.31%, U.S.'s welfare increases by 0.08%,
and Canada's welfare declines by 0.06%. We find that intra-bloc trade increases by 118% for Mexico,
11% for Canada and 41% for the U.S. We show that welfare effects from tariff reductions are reduced
when the structure of production does not take into account intermediate goods or input-output linkages.
Our results highlight the importance of sectoral heterogeneity, intermediate goods and sectoral linkages
for the quantification of the welfare gains from tariffs reductions.

  Sectors and countries are interrelated. When the U.S. reduces tari¤s applied to Mexico in a given sector,
it not only a¤ects prices in that industry but also in sectors that purchase materials from that industry.
Moreover, a tari¤ reduction a¤ects prices in non-tradable sectors that are using inputs from tradable sectors.
Of course, how important are these direct and indirect e¤ects from tari¤ changes will depend on the extent to
which sectors are interrelated. For instance, the larger is the share of tradable goods used in the production
of non-tradable goods the larger are the gains for producers of non-tradable goods from a reduction in the
price of tradables. Even more, if non-tradable goods are also used as inputs in the production of other goods,
or as …nal goods in consumption, then the bene…ts spread to the rest of the economy. In fact, most of the
…nal goods consumed are non-tradable goods.1 However, recent developments in international trade pay
little attention to understanding how the gains from tari¤ reductions spread across sectors.2
  In this paper, we build into a multi-country, multi-sector Ricardian model the interaction across tradable
and non-tradable sectors observed in the input-output tables. We use the model to identify the trade and
welfare e¤ects of tari¤ reductions from the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) between Mexico,
Canada and the U.S. NAFTA provides a unique example to quantify the trade and welfare e¤ects of tari¤
changes for three main reasons. First, it is among the largest free trade area in the world, both in terms of
population and GDP; second, it involves countries with very di¤erent structures of production, re‡ected by
their GDP per capita and di¤erent sectoral specialization of economic activity; and third, it is an archetypal
agreement that resulted in the creation of a cross-border production chain, as revealed by the large share
of intermediate goods and intra-industry trade across members.3 These features are the key characteristics
from NAFTA that help us understand more broadly the quantitative importance of sectoral heterogeneity,
trade in intermediate goods, and sectoral linkages.
  Adding more detail into a model comes at the cost of losing track of the mechanisms that deliver the main
results. In fact, this complexity has lead to criticism of computational general equilibrium (CGE) models
in the past.4 To address this issue we build on the seminal work of Eaton and Kortum (2002) to develop a
tractable and simple model for tari¤ policy evaluation that escapes the black box denigration of traditional
CGE models. As a result, we can decompose and quantify the di¤erential role that intermediate goods and
sectoral linkages have as ampli…ers of the gains from tari¤ reductions. We also show that regardless of the
number of sectors and how complicated the interactions across sectors are, the model can be reduced to a
system of one equation per country, and the solution depends on estimates of one set of parameters, the
dispersion of productivity across sectors (trade elasticities). Our solution method simpli…es considerably the
   1 Non-tradable  goods (services) accounted for more than 80% of the total …nal goods demanded in the year 1993 for the U.S.
   2 An  exception is the work of Arkolakis, Costinot, and Rodriguez-Clare (2012) where they evaluate the welfare gains from
trade openness implied by a variety of international trade models including multi-sector models.
   3 In Section 2 we document that sectoral trade in intermediate goods is particularly important for NAFTA members.
   4 These models have been criticized for their complexity, lack of transparency and analytical foundations, and the arbitrary

choice of the value of key parameters (Baldwin and Venables 1995 describe them as “black boxes”).

data requirements and estimated parameters needed for the evaluation of tari¤ changes.
  In our theory, production is at constant returns to scale and markets are perfectly competitive. Countries
import intermediate goods subject to trade costs from the lowest cost supplier in the world.5 Intermediate
goods in a given sector are used for the production of a sectoral good which is then used as …nal good for
consumption and as material in the production of tradable and non-tradable intermediate goods from all
sectors. Productivity di¤erences across individual producers in a sector is introduced in the same way as
in Eaton and Kortum (2002). The larger is the dispersion of productivities across producers, the larger
are the gains from trade integration. In our model, productivity, as well as the dispersion of productivity,
varies across sectors. This heterogeneity in the dispersion of productivities together with the share of
intermediate goods in production and sectoral interrelations are key in order to capture how a tari¤ reduction
has di¤erential impact across sectors.
  We express the model in relative changes and identify the trade and welfare e¤ects of NAFTA’s tari¤
reductions.6 Our simulations are performed with few data and parameter requirements. In particular, we
only use data on bilateral trade ‡ows, production, tari¤s and an estimate of sectoral trade elasticities. We
develop a new method to estimate sectoral trade elasticities. The estimations are performed using trade and
tari¤ data, without assuming bilaterally symmetric trade costs as is standard in the literature. Moreover,
the method is consistent with any trade model that delivers a gravity-type trade equation. We estimate
the parameters of the model at a sectoral level using data from 1993, the year before NAFTA went into
e¤ect. We calibrate a 31 countries 40 sector version of our model. Then, using the estimated parameters and
incorporating the change in tari¤s from 1993 to 2005, both between NAFTA members and with the rest of
the world, we use the model to evaluate the welfare e¤ects and quantify the changes in exports and imports
in aggregate and at the sectoral level.
  We …nd that NAFTA’s tari¤s reductions had a considerable impact on its member’s economies, in partic-
ular for Mexico. NAFTA augmented aggregate intra-bloc trade by 118% for Mexico, 11% for Canada and
41% for the U.S. We …nd that NAFTA increased the sectoral specialization of export activity in Mexico.
After NAFTA the most export oriented sector in Mexico (Electrical Machinery) represented one third of the
total export shares, while before it was only one …fth. For the case of Canada and U.S. the result is di¤erent;
sectoral concentration of export activity was reduced.
  We …nd that not all countries gained from NAFTA. Mexico and the U.S. gained 1.31% and 0.08% respec-
  5 The   importance of trade in intermediate goods has been documented by several studies. For instance, Feenstra and Hanson
(1996) …nd that the share of imported intermediates increased from 5.3% of total U.S. intermediate purchases to 11.6% between
1972 and 1990. Campa and Goldberg (1997) …nd similar evidence for Canada and the United Kingdom. Hummels, Ishii, and
Yi (2001), and Yeats (2001) show that international trade in intermediate inputs has increased more than that in …nal goods.
   6 We perform a model-based identi…cation of the trade e¤ects due to NAFTA’s tari¤ reductions by holding technology and

other trade costs …xed. By doing this, we are not saying that technology or other trade costs might not have changed as a
consequence of the change in tari¤s. We are agnostic about how they might have changed and focus instead on the direct e¤ect
of tari¤ changes over the allocation of resources. An alternative exercise could have been to quantify the implied changes in
technology and other trade costs in order for the model to deliver the observed change in trade ‡ows after NAFTA. But the
problem there is how to identify if these changes were due only to NAFTA. Unless a model of TFP or trade costs is written
there is no hope for identi…cation. In our case, we take as exogenous the observable change in tari¤ due to NAFTA to quantify
the trade e¤ects.



                                                             3
tively, while Canada su¤ered a welfare loss of 0.06%. Still, real wages increased for all NAFTA members
and Mexico had the largest gains. We decompose the welfare e¤ects into terms of trade and volume of trade
e¤ects and …nd that most of the gains from NAFTA are a result of an increase in the volume of trade. We
…nd that the trade created, mostly between NAFTA members, was larger than the trade diverted from other
economies. This was particularly so for Mexico and Canada. The welfare gains from trade creation with
NAFTA members are 1.80% and 0.08% while the welfare loss from trade diversion with the rest of the world
are 0.08%, and 0.04% for Mexico and Canada respectively. Only a handful of sectors were responsible for
the aggregate volume of trade e¤ects. These were sectors highly protected before NAFTA, like Textiles in
Mexico, with a large trade elasticity, like Petroleum, and with a large share of material use and sectoral
interdependence, like Electrical Machinery and Autos.
  The terms of trade e¤ects were mixed. We …nd that Mexico’s and Canada’s terms of trade deteriorated by
0.41% and 0.11%, respectively, mostly due to reductions in export prices, while for the U.S. terms of trade
increased by 0.04%; largely attributed to cheaper import prices from Mexico. We also decompose the terms
of trade e¤ects by sector and …nd that terms of trade e¤ects were primarily concentrated in a few sectors.
We show that certain sectors had a larger aggregate e¤ect compared to others depending on the magnitude
of sectoral reductions in import tari¤s, the share of materials used in production, and sectoral linkages.
  We also evaluate the welfare e¤ects from observed world tari¤ changes. We …nd that all countries in the
world gained. The welfare gains for NAFTA members were 1.36%, 0.10% and 0.22% for Mexico, Canada
and the U.S. Netting out the e¤ect of NAFTA, these …gures show that Canada was the largest winner from
world tari¤ reductions, followed by U.S. and then Mexico.
  Finally, we quantify the trade and welfare e¤ects from NAFTA’s tari¤ reductions across di¤erent class of
models. We …nd that welfare e¤ects are on average 71% lower in a one sector model, 62% lower in a model
without materials, and 50% lower in a model without sectoral linkages. Trade e¤ects are reduced on average
50%, 26%, and 18%, respectively. These results con…rm that sectoral heterogeneity, intermediate inputs,
and sectoral linkages are important mechanisms to quantify the trade and welfare e¤ects from tari¤ changes.
  Quantifying potential welfare gains and costs from trade policies has become increasingly important over
the years.7 Our paper relates to a large literature that evaluates trade policy and is mostly related to studies
that quantify the gains from trade from NAFTA.8 In particular, Anderson and van Wincoop (2002) who use
a one good gravity model to evaluate the gains from NAFTA. Relative to Anderson and van Wincoop (2002)
   7 The number of regional trade agreements (RTAs) signed in the world has increased dramatically in the last 20 years. In

1990 there were close to 25 RTAs signed, by 2010 more than 180. By the year 2002 more than one third of world trade was
covered by RTAs.
   8 Jacob Viner’s (1950) work was among the …rst to study the welfare analysis of trade policy. Bhagwati, Krishna, and

Panagariya (1999) put together many of the major theoretical contributions since Viner. More recents are Anderson and van
Wincoop (2004), Baier and Bergstrand (2009), Deardor¤ (1998), Redding and Venables (2004), Rose (2004), and Subramanian
and Wei (2007). Bagwell and Staiger (2010) survey recent economic research on trade agreements, with special focus on the
GATT/WTO. Several studies have focused on the case of NAFTA, for instance Krueger (1999) and the references therein,
Lederman, Maloney, and Serven (2005), Romalis (2007), and Tre‡er (2006). For results on CGE models in general see Brown,
Deardor¤, and Stern (1994), Brown and Stern (1989), Kehoe and Kehoe (1994), and for the case of NAFTA refer to Fox (1999),
Kehoe (2003), Rolleigh (2008) and Shikher (2010).

our model has multiple sectors, intermediate goods trade, a production economy, non-tradable sectors and
builds on Ricardian motives of trade instead of love from variety.9 Our results show that these features are
quantitatively important.
  Our paper is closely related to a recent and growing literature that extends the Eaton and Kortum (2002)
model to multiple-sectors. For instance Arkolakis, et al. (2012), Caliendo and Parro (2010), Chor (2010),
Costinot, Donaldson, and Komunjer (2012), Donaldson (2012), Dekle, Eaton and Kortum (2008), Eaton,
Kortum, Neiman, and Romalis (2011), Hsieh and Ossa (2011), and Shikher (2011).10 Our paper di¤ers
from these studies in several dimensions. First, we explicitly consider sectoral linkages between tradable
sectors and between tradable and non-tradable sectors unlike previous Ricardian trade models. In our
model, producers of non-tradable goods di¤er in productivity levels, demand tradable and non-tradable
intermediate goods for production and supply goods not only for consumption but also for production in
all sectors.11 This feedback in production turns out to be important in order to quantify the trade and
welfare e¤ects of tari¤ reductions. Second, we show how accounting for intermediate goods in production
and sectoral linkages does amplify the trade and welfare e¤ects of trade costs and tari¤ reductions.12 Third,
we extend the Ricardian model to perform a thoroughly quantitative evaluation of the trade and welfare
e¤ects from changes in trade policies. Finally, the way in which we take the model to the data is very
di¤erent compared to other studies. We solve the multi-country and multi-sector model in changes, relative
to a base year, allowing us to perform counterfactuals without relying on estimates of unobserved structural
parameters, like fundamental productivity. We show that this approach is simple and useful in order to
evaluate counterfactual changes in trade costs more broadly.
  Our paper is also related to studies that propose new methods to estimate trade elasticities.13 We propose a
new method that identi…es sectoral and aggregate trade elasticities by exploiting the cross sectional variation
in trade shares induced by the cross sectional variation in tari¤s. The method relies on the multiplicative
properties of the gravity equation consistent with a large variety of trade models (Krugman 1981, Eaton and
Kortum 2002, Anderson and Wincoop 2003, Melitz 2003, and Chaney 2008).
  The paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we motivate the importance of modeling trade in in-
termediates, multiple sectors, and sectoral linkages for tari¤ policy evaluation. In Section 3, we develop a
methodology to evaluate the trade and welfare e¤ects of tari¤ changes, we present the equilibrium conditions
    9 This last distinction is important since it generates changes at the extensive margin of trade while this is not the case on

an Armington type model as commonly used in CGE analysis.
  1 0 The Eaton and Kortum (2002) model has been extended in many other directions also. One of the earliest studies was Yi

(2003) who uses the model to understand if vertical specialization can explain the large growth in trade. More recent studies
are Burstein, Cravino, and Vogel (2013), Burstein and Vogel (2012), Caselli, Koren, Lisicky, and Tenreyro (2012), Fieler (2011),
Kerr (2009), Levchenko and Zhang (2011), Parro (2013), Ossa (2012), Ramondo and Rodriguez-Clare (2013), and Waugh
(2010). For a comprehensive survey of recent extensions of the Ricardian model of trade refer to Eaton and Kortum (2012).
  1 1 Non-tradable good sectors are often modeled as an outside sector that does not use intermediate goods for production. For

example see Alvarez and Lucas (2007).
  1 2 In Section 5.3 we compare the e¤ects of NAFTA across di¤erent models and show that sectoral heterogeneity, intermediate

goods, and sectoral linkages are quantitatively important.
  1 3 For instance, Feenstra (1994), Head and Ries (2001), Anderson and van Wincoop (2004) and references therein, Romalis

(2007), Simonovska and Waugh (2013) and Bergstrand, Egger, and Larch (2013).




                                                                5
of the model, and show how to solve and calibrate the model. In Section 4, we propose a new method and
estimate sectoral trade elasticities. In Section 5, we apply the model to evaluate the trade and welfare e¤ects
of NAFTA. In Section 6 we conclude.


             2. TARIFFS, INTERMEDIATE GOODS AND SECTORAL LINKAGES


  In this section we motivate the importance of modeling trade in intermediates, multiple sectors, and
sectoral linkages for tari¤ policy evaluation. The Appendix “Data Sources and Description”, at the end
of the document, describes in detail the data sources that we use in this paper. Throughout the paper,
whenever we make reference to a sector in the data, we refer to a 2-digit ISIC Rev. 3 industry. Table A.1 in
the Appendix “Data Sources and Description” provides a description of the sectoral categories.
  Tari¤ rates vary substantially across sectors. In 1993, the year before NAFTA went into e¤ect, sectoral
tari¤ rates applied by Mexico, Canada and the U.S. to NAFTA members were, on average, 12.5%, 4.2%,
and 2.7%, respectively, with a large heterogeneity across sectors (Figure A.1, in the appendix, presents the
e¤ective tari¤s rates across NAFTA members for the year 1993). By 2005 they dropped almost to zero
between NAFTA members, but tari¤s that Mexico, Canada and the U. S. applied to the rest of the world
were, on average, 7.1%, 2.2%, and 1.7%, respectively.14 The fact to take away is that by 2005 average tari¤s
had decreased considerably, but they still remained very dispersed across sectors. Trade and welfare e¤ects
of average changes in tari¤s can be analyzed using a one-sector trade model; however, the e¤ects of changes
in the dispersion of tari¤s can only be analyzed with a model that includes multiple sectors, sectoral linkages
and intermediate goods.
  Actually, most goods traded are intermediate goods.15 In 1993, 68% of Mexico’s imports from countries
not belonging to NAFTA were intermediate goods. The share for Canada is 61.5% and for the U.S. 64.6%.
Intermediate goods trade is even more important for NAFTA members. In fact, 82,1% of Mexico’s imports
from NAFTA are intermediate goods, while for Canada and the U.S. the values were 72.3% and 72.8%
respectively. Therefore, by 1993 most goods traded across NAFTA members were intermediate goods and
trade of these types of goods was more important across NAFTA members than with the rest of the world.
  Also, tradable and non-tradable sectors are interconnected. Using input-output (I-O) tables we can mea-
sure the proportion of spending from sectors on …nal and intermediate goods from other sectors. One salient
characteristic of any I-O matrix is that it presents a strong diagonal, namely that the share of own industry
material inputs purchased are important. However, this expenditure share is far from 100%. For example,
  1 4 The reason why tari¤s decreased is mostly that several free trade agreements entered into force during the period 1993-2005.
For instance, Mexico signed free trade agreements with Costa Rica in 1995, Nicaragua in 1998, Chile in 1999, the European
Union in 2000, El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras in 2001, and Japan in 2005; Canada signed agreements with Chile in
1997 and Costa Rica in 2002; and the United States signed agreements with Jordan in 2001, Chile, Costa Rica, the Dominican
Republic, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua and Singapore in 2004, and Australia in 2005.
  1 5 The descriptive statistics presented in this paragraph use data from COMTRADE via WITS. The product categories are the

HS Standard Product Groups, UNCTAD. We refer to intermediate goods to categories UNCTAD-SoP2 and UNCTAD-SoP4.
The intermediate goods traded in the model that we present below map to these two categories.




                                                                6
for the U.S., the mean diagonal share is 16% and has a standard deviation of 15%, while for Mexico, the
mean diagonal share is 13% and has a standard deviation of 14%.16 If we focus only on tradable sectors,
the mean share of the diagonal elements is 20%, and 19% while the mean share of the diagonal elements for
the non-tradable sectors are 11% and 7%, respectively for the U.S. and Mexico. This means that industries
purchase mostly intermediate inputs from other industries.17 Moreover, I-O tables re‡ect that tradable
and non-tradable sectors are interrelated. The average share of tradable sectors in the production of non-
tradable sectors is 23% for the U.S. and 32% for Mexico, while the average share of non-tradable sectors in
the production of tradable sectors is 34% for the U.S. and 26% for Mexico. This casual inspection of the I-O
tables shows that sectors are strongly interrelated and that non-tradable sectors are a relevant input in the
production of tradables and vice versa.
  We …nish this subsection concluding that an assessment of the economics e¤ects of NAFTA needs to
take into account that most goods traded are intermediate goods, that countries have di¤erent structure
of production and that there is substantial sectoral heterogeneity in tari¤s. We now proceed to describe a
model that takes all of these mechanisms into account.


              3. A QUANTITATIVE MODEL FOR TRADE POLICY EVALUATION


  We develop a quantitative general equilibrium model with trade in intermediate goods, sectoral hetero-
geneity and input-output linkages, that takes into consideration all the empirical facts described in the
previous section. The model builds on the Ricardian trade model of Eaton and Kortum (2002). There are
N countries and J sectors. We denote countries by i and n and sectors by j and k. Sectors are of two types,
either tradable or non-tradable and there is only one factor of production, labor. All markets are perfectly
competitive and labor is mobile across sectors and not mobile across countries.


3.1 The Model


  3.1.1 Households.—
  In each country there are a measure of Ln representative households that maximize utility by consuming
…nal goods Cnj . The preferences of the households are given by
                                                 YJ       j   j             XJ
                                                                                    j
                                     u (Cn ) =           Cn   n
                                                                  ; where           n   = 1:                                 (1)
                                                   j=1                        j=1


  We denote by In households’ income. Income is derived from two sources; households supply labor Ln
at a wage wn and receive transfers on a lump-sum basis (tari¤ revenues and transfers from the rest of the
world, as we will see in a moment).
  1 6 These …gures are computed using the I-O tables described in the Appendix “Data Sources and Description.”
  1 7 Jones(2007) presents a detailed description of the characteristics of I-O tables. He shows that, regardless of the level of
sectoral disaggregation, the largest share is always the share of own industry material inputs purchased. However, the higher
the level of disaggregation, the smaller the share is. For instance, the share of own industry material inputs purchased are, on
average, 3.3% of total material purchases for the case of the U.S. using a 6-digit I-O table.


                                                                  7
  3.1.2 Intermediate goods.—
  A continuum of intermediate goods ! j 2 [0; 1] is produced in each sector j. Two types of inputs, labor and
composite intermediate goods (also referred to as materials) from all sectors, are used for the production of
each ! j . Producers of intermediate goods across countries di¤er in the e¢ ciency of production. We denote

captures a key di¤erence compared to the one-sector model or the multi-sector model without interrelated
sectors, as the cost of the input bundle depends on wages and on the price of all the composite intermediate
goods in the economy, tradable and non-tradable. A change in policy that a¤ects the price in any single
sector will a¤ect indirectly all the sectors in the economy via the input bundle. We show later that this
interrelation plays an important role in evaluating the trade and welfare e¤ects from trade openness.

  1 8 The  main reason why we assume a unit elasticity of substitution across materials is because, at the level of aggregation at
which we conduct our empirical analysis, value added and I-O shares are fairly constant over time. Using I-O tables for the
years 1995 and 2005, at the two-digit ISIC rev 2, from 26 countries sourced from WIOD (http://www.wiod.org/), we evaluated
the stability of input shares by calculating the correlation coe¢ cient across all input shares over time. We …nd that for all
countries, the correlation was higher than 0.91. Still, Appendix “CES Model” presents a general version of our model where we
allow for any degree of substitutability across inputs.

   2 0 Allowing for producers of composite intermediate goods to search for the lowest cost supplier is a key distinction from

models with Armington-type assumptions. In those models, because of the love for variety, regardless of the price, goods are
always bought from all sources, since they are di¤erentiated by country of origin. In the Eaton and Kortum (2002) model, the
source from which goods are purchased is endogenously determined and can change as a consequence of tari¤ reductions. This
is crucial in order to understand why this model conceptually takes into account changes at the extensive new goods margin
and not only changes at the intensive old goods margin, as is the case in Armington-type models. However, both models deliver
similar aggregate moments for trade ‡ows. In fact, the gravity equation implied from the Eaton and Kortum (2002) model,
equation (6) below, is identical to the Armington model after mapping the dispersion of productivity, ; and the technology
parameter, ; to the elasticity of substitution and the home bias parameter in the Armington-type models.

  3.1.4 International trade costs and prices.—
  We assume that trade in goods is costly. In particular, there are two types of trade costs: iceberg trade
costs and an ad-valorem ‡at-rate tari¤s. Iceberg costs are de…ned in physical units as in Samuelson (1954),
where one unit of a tradable intermediate good in sector j shipped from country i to country n requires
producing djni        1 units in i, with djnn = 1. Goods imported by country n from country i have to pay an
                                    j
ad-valorem ‡at-rate tari¤           ni   applicable over unit prices. We combine both trade costs, represented by

                                                                      j
                                                                      ni   = ~jni djni ;                                                                                       (3)

where ~jni = (1 +       j
                        ni ):   We also assume that the triangular inequality holds;                                                      j  j

  We model non-tradable sectors in the same way as tradable sectors but impose that                                                                   in   = 1; thus, in some
sectors goods are not traded because it is always cheaper to buy goods from local suppliers. In non-tradable
sectors, pjn ! j = cjn =znj ! j and the demand of intermediate goods is given by rnj (! j ) = qnj (! j ):
  Ricardian motives to trade are introduced following Eaton and Kortum’s (2002) probabilistic representa-
tion of technologies allowing productivities to di¤er by country and also by sectors. In particular, we assume

     Total expenditure on sector j goods in country n is given by Xnj = Pnj Qjn : We denote by Xni to the
expenditure in country n of sector j goods from country i: It follows that country n0 s share of expenditure
                                     j       j
on goods from i are given by         ni   = Xni =Xnj . Using the properties of the Fréchet distribution we can derive
expenditure shares as a function of technologies, prices and trade costs

     As we can see, bilateral trade shares        ni      take the form of a multi-sector version of a gravity equation.
                                                                                          j
Changes in tari¤s have a direct e¤ect in trade shares via                                 ni ;   and from (2) note that changes in tari¤s also
have an indirect e¤ect through the input bundle cji since it incorporates all the information contained in the
I-O tables.


     3.1.6 Total expenditure and trade balance.—
     Total expenditure on goods j is the sum of the expenditure on composite intermediate goods by …rms and
  2 2 For a description of the properties of the Fréchet distribution, refer to Eaton and Kortum (2002). Donaldson (2012) relates

this assumption to other standard assumptions used in models of international trade with heterogeneous …rms, like those in
Melitz (2003), Chaney (2008), and others. Costinot et al. (2012) consider the case of more general distributions.
  2 3 Appendix “Distribution of Prices and Expenditure Shares” presents a detailed derivation of the distribution of prices and

how to solve for the price index (4) as well as the expenditure shares (6). The derivation follows Eaton and Kortum (2002)
applied to a multi-sector economy.

from policy to policy               ; what we de…ne as an equilibrium in relative changes.25 There are several advantages
of doing so. First, we can match exactly the model to the data in a base year; second, we can identify the
e¤ect on equilibrium outcomes from a pure change in tari¤s, which is what we are after in this paper; and
…nally we can solve for the general equilibrium of the model without needing to estimate parameters which
are di¢ cult to identify in the data, as productivities                            j

  From inspecting equilibrium conditions (10 through 13) we can observe that the focus on relative changes
allows us to perform policy experiments without relying on estimates of total factor productivity or transport

  3.1.7 Relative change in real wages.—
  We conclude this subsection by brie‡y discussing how important it is to account for multiple sectors and
sectoral linkages in order to quantify the e¤ects on real wages from counterfactual changes in trade costs.26
                                                                                  ^n =P^nj in each sector j
Using equation (10) and (12) we solve for the counterfactual change in real wages w
as a function of the share of expenditure on domestic goods and sectoral prices. We then aggregate across
sectors using consumption expenditure shares and obtain the following expression for the logarithm change
  2 6 Changes in real wages are not changes in welfare in a model where tari¤ revenue is lump sum transferred. The change

in welfare is a weighted average measure of the change in real wages and real tari¤ revenue, namely I^n =P^n = w        ^n =P^n +
(1     )R^ n =P^n ; where = wn Ln =In : We focus on real wages in this subsection only as a mode to relate our …ndings to studies
that evaluate welfare e¤ects of trade openness in models in which tari¤s are absent (for instance Arkolakis, et al. 2012).

From this expression it is evident that sectoral heterogeneity in trade elasticities matters for welfare.29

  Consider the model where                  n   6= 1 and     n     =1            n   for all j and n: In this case there are no sectoral
interrelations since intermediate goods are produced with labor and materials only from the same sector.
Reductions in trade cost reduce the price of tradable intermediate goods and in turn reduce the price of the
composite intermediate good. As a consequence, producers of intermediate goods gain from this reduction
in the cost of their inputs. This additional e¤ect on real wages compared to a model with no intermediates

for sectors in which prices decline more, the larger is the reduction in the cost of material inputs used in
production. In other words, it captures the importance of the input-output structure of the economy. The

  2 8 Arkolakis et al. (2012) show that within a variety of trade models there are two su¢ cient statistics to evaluate welfare

gains: the share of expenditure on domestic goods and trade elasticities. Donaldson (2012) makes the same observation for the
case of a multi-sector Eaton and Kortum (2002) model.
  2 9 In a recent study, Ossa (2012) evaluates the importance of sectoral variation in trade elasticities for welfare quanti…cation.

Note that this term will only be zero if prices change in the same proportion, and-or if the share of …nal good in demand and
the share of intermediate goods in production is the same across sectors together with a symmetric I-O table.

3.2 Welfare E¤ects From Tari¤ Changes


  In this subsection we decompose the welfare e¤ects from tari¤ changes into terms of trade and volume of
trade e¤ects. We use this decomposition in the quantitative section of the paper in order to evaluate the
welfare e¤ects of NAFTA’s tari¤ changes. More generally, this welfare decomposition allows us to understand
the e¤ects of tari¤s changes across di¤erent countries and sectors.
  We denote welfare of the representative consumer in country n by Wn = In =Pn ; where In is given by (8)
and Pn by (5) : Totally di¤erentiating Wn and after using the equilibrium conditions of the model the change
in welfare is given by

where the …rst term measures the multilateral and multisectoral terms of trade e¤ect and the second term
the multilateral and multisectoral volume of trade e¤ect from tari¤ changes.31
  The change in welfare due to the terms of trade e¤ects from tari¤ changes quanti…es the gains from an
increase in exporter prices relative to the change in importer prices, measured at world prices.32 In our
model, this measure of terms of trade is a multilateral weighted change in export and import prices at the
sectoral level, where the weights are given by bilateral exports and imports respectively. The contribution
of each sector to the aggregate change in terms of trade depends on sectoral trade de…cits (the di¤erence
         j       j
between Eni and Mni ) and sectoral changes in import and exporter prices. In general it is not possible
to sign the particular contribution of each sector to the aggregate e¤ect.33 Doing so requires performing a
quantitative assessment, as we do below for the case of NAFTA.
  The variation across sectors on the terms of trade e¤ects is a key distinction from a model with multiple
sectors and intermediate goods relative to a model with no intermediate goods. In fact, if there are no
intermediate goods in production the sectoral variation in trade ‡ows plays absolutely no role on in‡uencing
                                                                                         j
the aggregate terms of trade. To see this, consider the case where                       n   = 1 for all j and n; then interme-
diate goods are only produced with labor. Input costs do not vary by sector, since cjn = wn and then
                                                                           PJ PN         j
d ln cjn = d ln wn ; and the aggregate terms of trade e¤ects are given by j=1 i=1 Mni      (d ln wn d ln wi ) =
PN
   i=1 Mni (d ln wn     d ln wi ) ; where Mni are total imports by country n from country i: Hence, conditional
    3 1 Appendix “Welfare”presents a detailed derivation of equation (16). Other studies have also presented multilateral measures

of terms of trade. For instance, Bagwell and Staiger (1999) and Ossa (2011). We borrow the term “volume of trade e¤ect”
from Dixit and Norman (1980) which they de…ne in the context of a two-good two-country model.
    3 2 Conditional on exporting, the world price (net of tari¤s) of the intermediate good that country n exports to i is

cjn djni =zn
           j
              ! j : Changes in tari¤s impact only the input bundle, cjn and a¤ect all exporters of intermediate goods in sec-
tor j proportionally. Of course, changes in tari¤s can change the set of goods sourced from each country, but since prices change
proportionally to cjn ; the world price of the goods that country i is still sourcing from n change in the same way as the ones
that it stops sourcing from n. Therefore, changes in input costs measure the change in trade prices in this model.
    3 3 A su¢ cient condition for a sector to contribute positively to aggregate welfare is that the sector net export to the rest of

the world andPthat P    exporter prices increase relative to importer prices. To see this, note that d ln cjn can be aproximated by
                                                   PJ P

                                                                        (Eni   j

      j       j
then Eni > Mni  ; and if exporter prices improve relative to importer prices, c^jn > c^ji ; then the contribution of that sector to the
                                            j     j
aggregate terms of trade is positive since Eni =Mni    c^ji =^
                                                             cjn > 0:


                                                                  14
on a change in wages and aggregate trade ‡ows, a multi-sector model delivers the same aggregate terms of
trade e¤ects as a one sector model. Still, terms of trade are going to vary bilaterally.34
     The second term in (16) measures the welfare gains from changes in the volume of trade as a consequence
of the change in tari¤s. More trade is created the larger is the increase in the volume of trade, measured
as import values de‡ated by import prices, and contributes positively to welfare. Initial tari¤s and import
volumes weight how important this e¤ect is across sectors and countries.
     From (16) we can de…ne bilateral and sectoral measures of terms of trade and volume of trade that can
be used to decompose the welfare e¤ects across countries and sectors. The change in bilateral terms of trade
between countries n and i is given by
                                                              XJ       j              j

while the change in the bilateral volume of trade is given by
                                                              XJ     j   j          j
                                          d ln votni =               ni Mni   d ln Mni     d ln cji :                         (18)

Similarly, we measure the change in sectoral terms of trade by
                                                              XN      j               j

while the change in sectoral volume of trade is given by
                                                              XN     j   j          j
                                          d ln votjn =               ni Mni   d ln Mni    d ln cji :                          (20)
                                                               i=1


Of course, given these de…nitions, the change in welfare in country n can also be computed as d ln Wn =

3.3 Taking the Model to the Data


     A key advantage from solving the model in relative changes is that it minimizes the data requirements to
                                                                            j
calibrate the model. Concretely, the data needed are bilateral trade ‡ows (Mni                          imports of n from i); value
added        (Vnj ),   gross production   (Ynj );   and I-O tables. With these data we can calculate the data counterparts

of    ni ;     n;      n ;   and   n.

     To obtain the bilateral trade share               ni ;
                                          we …rst calculate domestic sales in each country, Mnn  as the dif-

ference between gross production and total exports; Mnn  = Ynj    i=1;i6=n Min . We then de…ne expenditure

by country n of sector j goods imported from country i as Xni : We calculate Xni by multiplying trade
                          j       j
‡ows by tari¤s, that is, Xni  = Mni (1 + jni ): We obtain jni for each sector j and pair of countries n; i as

e¤ect since world prices are proportional to wages in a model with no intermediate goods. We show that when there are
intermediate goods, world prices are not proportional only to wages.

                    4. A NEW METHOD TO ESTIMATE TRADE ELASTICITIES

                               j
  The trade elasticities            are the key parameters for quantitative trade policy evaluation. In our model,
these are the only parameters we need to estimate in order to identify the e¤ects of tari¤ reductions. In the
context of the Eaton and Kortum model, as well as ours, the trade elasticities are related to the dispersion
of productivity parameter and it determines how trade ‡ows react to changes in tari¤s. If productivity is
                                                                 j
less dispersed, as indicated by a larger value of                    ; then a change in tari¤s will not change the share of
traded goods in a substantial way. The reason is that goods are less substitutable. On the other hand, if
the productivities are very concentrated -if there is high dispersion- small changes in tari¤s can translate to
large adjustments in the share of goods traded. The reason is that producers of the composite aggregate
are more likely to change their suppliers, since goods are more substitutable. The change in the measure of
goods traded is the adjustment at the extensive margin in this model.35 To see these e¤ects more formally,
  3 5 In
       our model the elasticity of trade with respect to trade costs is the dispersion of productivity, and is not the elasticity of
substitution as in Armington models. If we restrict producers of the intermediate good aggregate to purchase goods from the
same source, regardless of the change in trade costs, then the trade elasticity will be given by the elasticity of substitution as
in Armington models. This is the sense in which the dispersion of productivity can be related to the elasticity of substitution
in an Armington model. Both models, the Ricardian and the Armington, deliver a similar gravity-type equation. However,
conceptually the models are very di¤erent. Adjustments from changes in tari¤s occur for di¤erent reasons in the two models.
Refer to footnotes 9 and 20. Also, in a Ricardian trade model like, Eaton and Kortum (2002), there are production-side gains


                                                                     16
                                                                                                              j
from (6) note how changes in trade costs impact trade shares according to                                         .
  We propose a new method to estimate the dispersion parameter that is consistent with any trade model
that delivers a gravity equation like (6).36 Consider three countries indexed by n; i; and h: Take the cross-
product of goods from sector j shipped in one direction between the three countries, from n to i, from i to
h; and from h to n; and then the cross-product of the same goods shipped in the other direction, from n to
h, from h to i; and from i to n: Using equation (6) we can calculate each expression and then take the ratio:
                                                                                        !       j
                                                 j   j   j               j    j    j
                                                Xni Xih Xhn              ni   ih   hn
                                                 j   j   j
                                                               =         j    j    j
                                                                                                    :                         (21)
                                                Xnh Xhi Xin              in   hi   nh

  All the terms involving prices and parameters are canceled out and we end up with a relation between
bilateral trade and trade costs.37              The advantage of using (21) is that unobservable trade costs cancel
    38                                                                                                                          j
out.     For example, consider the following model of asymmetric trade costs.39 From the de…nition of                           ni

in equation (3), trade costs are composed of tari¤s (non-symmetric) and iceberg (also non-symmetric) trade
                        j
costs, namely ln        ni   = ln ~jni + ln djni . Iceberg trade costs, ln djni ; can be modeled quite generally as linear
functions of cross-country characteristics. For instance,

                                        j
                                   ln   ni   = ln ~jni + ln djni = ln ~jni +       j
                                                                                   ni   +   j
                                                                                            n   +       j
                                                                                                        i   + "jni ;          (22)

where     ni   =   in   captures symmetric bilateral trade costs like distance, language, common border, and

belonging to an FTA or not. The parameter                      n   captures an importer sectoral …xed e¤ect, for example,
                                                                                                                                 j
non-tari¤ barriers, and it is assumed to be common to all trading partners of country n. The parameter                           i

is an exporter sectoral …xed e¤ect that can also capture non-tari¤ barriers, and it is assumed to be common
to all trading partners of country i. Finally, "jni is a random disturbance term that represents remoteness
deviation from symmetry and is assumed to be orthogonal to tari¤s. Substituting (22) into (21) we get:
                                            !                          !

from trade, while in a standard Armington model, like Anderson’s (1979), gains are from the consumption side only.
  3 6 The method relies on the multiplicative properties of the gravity equation derived from a variety of trade models, like

Krugman (1981), Eaton and Kortum (2002), Melitz (2003), Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) and all of the class of models
in Arkolakis, et. al (2012).
  3 7 The number of cross-product terms in our method is given by
                                                                    PN 2
                                                                       n=1 n (n + 1) =2; where N is the number of countries in
the sample. For instance, for a sample of 10 countries there will be a maximum of 120 observations.
  3 8 The method we propose is similar to the odds ratio method developed by Head and Ries (2001) and also presented in Head

and Mayer (2001). Our method is also similar to the one Head, Mayer, and Ries (2009) denote as “tetrads.” Other papers using
the “tetrad” are Martin, Mayer, and Thoenig (2008), Hallak (2006) and Romalis (2007) and Anderson and Marcouiller (2002).
These methods were constructed to estimate trade costs. We instead propose a method to estimate trade elasticities. Compared
to the odds ratio, our method does not need to assume symmetric trade costs and we do not need to rely on information of
domestic sales at the sectoral level. The key di¤erences with these methods are: 1) In order to identify the trade cost elasticity,
our method does not involve the estimation of unobservable trade barriers, as it is the case using the Head and Ries index, or
the methodology in Romalis (2007). Our triple di¤erentiation eliminates all the unobservable components of trade costs, thus
we only need to use trade and tari¤ data to identify the elasticity; 2) we do not need information on domestic sales at the
sectoral level (data on gross production and trade ‡ows combined) and this reduces the concern of measurement errors on total
expenditure; 3) our method combines fewer countries in the calculation (three instead of four), which increases the sample size
considerably; and …nally, 4) we do not need to use a reference country to identify the parameters.
  3 9 A standard assumption in the trade literature is to assume symmetric geographic trade costs; for instance, see Krugman

(1991). With our method, we do not need to assume symmetry in order to get identi…cation.

     It is important to notice that our methodology is consistent with a wide class of gravity-trade models
and therefore the estimated trade cost elasticity from using this method does not depend on the underlying
microstructure assumed in the model. We estimate the dispersion-of-productivity parameter sector by sector
using the proposed speci…cation (23) for 1993, the year before NAFTA was active.41 Table 1 presents the
(negative of the) estimates ( j ) and heteroskedastic-robust standard errors. As we can see, the coe¢ cients
have the correct sign and the magnitude of the estimates varies considerably across sectors. The estimates
  4 0 Of course, as any estimation of trade elasticities from bilateral trade and tari¤ data, our method is subject to the endogenous

trade policy concern (Tre‡er 1993, and Baier and Bergstrand 2007). Still, our triple di¤erencing might alleviate some of these
concerns given that the estimates we obtain are comparable to the range of previous elasticity estimates done with di¤erent
methods and di¤erent data.
  4 1 We estimate (23) by OLS, dropping the observations with zeros. Zeros in the bilateral trade matrix are very frequent and

several studies are focused on understanding how robust the estimates of trade elasticities are if zeros are taken into account.
For instance, Santos-Silva and Tenreyro (2010).



                                                                           18
range from 0.37 to 51.08. This heterogeneity was con…rmed by being able to reject the null hypothesis of
common estimates (we performed an F-test and the result is presented at the bottom of Table 1). Still, at
the bottom of the table, we also present the estimated aggregate elasticity.
  The estimation gives an equal weight to all countries; thus, as a robustness check we dropped observations
with small trade ‡ows. Table 1 shows the estimates for 99% of the sample and 97.5% of the sample. The 99%
and 97.5% samples were constructed in the following way: in each sector, we ranked the countries according
to the share of trade they contribute in that particular sector. We dropped the countries with the lowest
1% share and re-estimated the trade elasticity. Then we dropped the lowest 2.5%. As we compare across
estimates, we note that three sectors are not robust since they changed sign as we restricted the sample.42
These sectors are Basic metals, Machinery n.e.c., and Auto.43
  Our estimates are in the range of the trade elasticities estimated in the literature.44 Our benchmark
estimates are the estimates presented in Table 1 for the 99% sample, since they control for outliers. For the
sectors Basic metals, Machinery n.e.c., and Auto we replace them by the mean estimate for the manufacturing
sector. We also re-estimated the dispersion parameters including importer and exporters …xed e¤ects as an
additional robustness check. The results appear in Table A.1, Appendix “Additional Results.”


           5. QUANTIFYING THE TRADE AND WELFARE EFFECTS OF NAFTA


  In this section we evaluate the trade and welfare e¤ects from the change in the tari¤ structure caused by
NAFTA. Our base year is 1993, the year before the agreement came into force. We use data from di¤erent
sources in order to calibrate the model to the base year. The criterion was to maximize the number of
countries covered in our sample conditional on obtaining reliable tari¤, production and trade ‡ows data. We
end up with a sample of N = 31, 30 countries and a constructed rest of the world, and J = 40 sectors (20
tradable and 20 non-tradable). We now provide a short list with the data sources. Appendix “Data Sources
and Description” provides a detailed description of all the sectoral and aggregate data used in this paper.
  Bilateral trade ‡ows are sourced from the United Nations Statistical Division (UNSD) Commodity Trade
(COMTRADE) database. Gross output and value added come from three di¤erent sources. From OECD
STAN database for industrial analysis, the Industrial Statistics Database INDSTAT2, and the OECD Input-
  4 2 For the case of Chemicals China was an outlier. The estimates including China were 1.39 for the full sample, -0.64 for the

99% sample and -0.93 for the 97.5% sample. The numbers without China are presented in the table. China represented 5% of
the share of trade in that sector.
  4 3 Machinery n.e.c. corresponds to manufacture of electrical machinery and apparatus not elsewhere classi…ed.
  4 4 The magnitudes of the sectoral trade elasticities are within the range of the coe¢ cient estimated by Eaton and Kortum

(2002) for the manufacturing sector as a whole using data from 1990. Their estimate ranged between 3.60 and 12.86, and
their preferred estimate is 8.28. Other studies, for example: Anderson, Balistreri, Fox, and Hillberry (2005) document that
the average elasticity is 17. Broda and Weinstein (2006) …nd that the simple average of the elasticities is 17 at the seven-digit
(TSUSA), 7 at the three-digit (TSUSA), 12 at the ten-digit (HTS) and 4 at the three-digit (HTS) goods disaggregation. Clausing
(2001) and Head and Ries (2001) …nd values between 7 and 11.4, Romalis (2007) …nds values between 4 and 13. Bishop (2006)
estimates the trade elasticity for the steel industry and …nds values between 3 and 5. Yi (2003) compares several models and
…nds that in order to match the bilateral trade ‡ows in the data, the Armington type models need a value of elasticity of 15.
Imbs and Méjean (2011) make the point that the “true” elasticity of substitution is more than twice the elasticity implied by
the aggregate data. Hertel, Hummels, Ivanic, and Keeney (2003) estimate sectoral trade elasticities between 3 and 30.




                                                               19
Output database. Input-output tables are sourced from the World Input-Output Database (WIOD) and the
OECD Input-Output Database.45 Finally, ad-valorem tari¤s for the years 1993 and 2005 are obtained from
the United Nations Statistical Division, Trade Analysis and Information System (UNCTAD-TRAINS). We
calibrate the model following the calibration strategy described in Section 3.3, and use the trade elasticities,
 j
     sourced from the estimates presented in Table 1, column 5, to quantify the e¤ects of tari¤ changes.
     We quantify the economic e¤ects of NAFTA’s tari¤ changes performing two di¤erent but equally infor-
mative counterfactual exercises. In the …rst counterfactual exercise we introduce into the model the change
in the tari¤ structure from 1993 to the year 2005 between NAFTA members and …x the tari¤ structure
for the rest of the world to the levels in 1993. This counterfactual measures the e¤ect of NAFTA’s tari¤
reductions conditional on no other tari¤ changing. In the second counterfactual we measure the e¤ects of
NAFTA by quantifying the gains from NAFTA’s tari¤ reductions given observed world tari¤ reductions. We
do this in the following way. First we introduce into the model the observed change in world tari¤ structure
from 1993 to the year 2005. Of course, the world tari¤ structure in 2005 incorporates the change in tari¤s
applied by NAFTA and all other bilateral, and multilateral, tari¤ changes.46 With this exercise we measure
the economic e¤ects of observed world tari¤ changes. We then recalibrate the model to the year 1993 and
introduce the observed change in world tari¤ structure from 1993 to the year 2005 holding NAFTA tari¤s
…xed to the year 1993. With this exercise we measure the economic e¤ects of observed world tari¤ changes
excluding the change in tari¤s as a consequence of NAFTA. We then compare the gains between these two
exercises, namely the gains from world tari¤ reductions with and without NAFTA.
     Before we present the results it is important to note that with our calibration strategy the model matches
exactly the base year. This means that if countries have an aggregate trade de…cit the model is also going to
account for the trade de…cit in the base year. However, counterfactual changes to trade policy are not going
to adjust the aggregate trade de…cit given that they are exogenous to the model. We need to deal with this
and we do so in two di¤erent ways. First, we eliminate all aggregate de…cits by …rst calibrating the model
with trade de…cits and then solving the model imposing zero aggregate de…cit, Dn0 = 0: We then use the
implied no-de…cit world economy as our base year. Second, we calibrate the model with aggregate de…cits to
the year 1993 and then calculate all counterfactuals holding the countries aggregate trade de…cits constant, as
a share of world GDP. We compute all the counterfactual exercises using both solution strategies but present
in the main text only the results with no aggregate de…cit in the base year. The Appendix “Additional
Results” shows a variety of additional results including the case where aggregate trade de…cits remain …xed
  4 5 It is worth noticing that in general, input-output tables distribute imports to sectors using the assumption that the

distribution is the same as for domestic production in the sector. Future work might want to incorporate domestic and foreign
intermediate import shares into the analysis and evaluate how important is this distinction for the trade and welfare e¤ects of
tari¤ changes.
  4 6 The change in the tari¤ structure between NAFTA members is a consequence of signing NAFTA. However, the change in

tari¤s that NAFTA members applied to the rest of the world and the one the rest of the world applied to NAFTA has many
consequences. As we documented earlier, NAFTA members signed independently free trade agreements with other countries.
Moreover, given that we are using a model with 31 countries, many countries reduced tari¤s between each other over this period,
we account for this as well.




                                                              20
as a share of world GDP.


5.1 Trade and Welfare E¤ects from NAFTA’s Tari¤ Reductions


  We now quantify the trade and welfare e¤ects of NAFTA. Table 2 presents the welfare e¤ects from
NAFTA’s tari¤ reductions while …xing the tari¤ to and from the rest of the world to the year 1993. Welfare
e¤ects are calculated using (16) ; and changes in real wages using (15) : As we can see, Mexico’s welfare
increases by 1.31%. The e¤ects for Canada and the U.S. are smaller. Canada loses 0.06% while the U.S.
gains 0.08%. Still, we …nd that real wages increase for all NAFTA members and Mexico gains the most,
followed by Canada and the U.S.47

                           Table 2. Welfare e¤ects from NAFTA’s tari¤ reductions
                                                  Welfare
                      Country   Total    Terms of trade Volume of Trade Real wages
                      Mexico    1.31%        -0.41%          1.72%            1.72%
                      Canada -0.06%          -0.11%          0.04%            0.32%
                      U.S.      0.08%         0.04%          0.04%            0.11%


  Decomposing the welfare e¤ects into terms of trade and volume of trade underscores the sources of these
gains. The third column in Table 2 shows that the major source of gains are increases in volume of trade. The
welfare gains from trade creation for Mexico, Canada and the U.S. are 1.72%, 0.04% and 0.04% respectively.
We can look deeper and measure the extent to which the welfare e¤ects are a result of trade creation with
NAFTA members vis-a-vis the rest of the world. This is done by applying the bilateral volume of trade
measures (18) de…ned before.


                       Table 3. Bilateral welfare e¤ects from NAFTA’s tari¤ reductions
                                      Terms of trade               Volume of Trade
                     Country NAFTA Rest of the world NAFTA Rest of the world
                     Mexico     -0.39%          -0.02%         1.80%         -0.08%
                     Canada     -0.09%          -0.02%         0.08%         -0.04%
                     U.S.        0.03%           0.01%         0.04%          0.00%


  Column 3 in Table 3 shows that the trade created with NAFTA members is the single most important
contributor to the positive welfare e¤ects. The …gures are 1.80%, 0.08% and 0.04% for Mexico, Canada
and the U.S. respectively. This result unmasks an important channel by which NAFTA generated positive
welfare e¤ects to all of its members, by creating more trade within the bloc. On the other hand, column 4
from Table 3 shows that the reduction in volume of trade with the rest of the world has a negative welfare
e¤ect. This negative welfare e¤ect, which we discuss further below, arises from NAFTA diverting trade from
countries outside of the agreement.
 4 7 Thewelfare e¤ects results in the model with trade de…cits are very similar, 1.17%, -0.04% and 0.09% for Mexico, Canada
and the U.S. respectively. Appendix “Additional Results”, tables A.3 to A.6, includes the results with trade de…cits and it
shows that all the results in this section are robust to include trade de…cits or not.


                                                            21
  Another source of welfare e¤ects are changes in terms of trade. From column 2 of Table 2 we can see
that Mexico and Canada’s terms of trade deteriorate while the U.S. terms of trade improve. One way to
understand this di¤erential e¤ect is by looking at how export prices change in each country. From equation
(10) notice that the change in unit costs, or the change in export prices, are an increasing function of input
prices; namely wages and the price of materials. The last column of Table 2 shows that real wages increase
for all NAFTA members but relatively more for Mexico and Canada compared to the U.S. So, all else equal,
the increase in wages increase export prices. However, from equation (11) note that, all else equal, the price
of materials fall with reductions in import tari¤s. Therefore, export prices change according to how large
is the increase in wages relative to the fall in the price of materials. It turns out that the average export
prices across sectors fall by 2% and 0.6% for Mexico and Canada and increase by 0.1% for the U.S. If we
now factor in that most trade between NAFTA members is with other NAFTA members, then this explains
why terms of trade deteriorate for Mexico and Canada and increase for the U.S.
  Table 3, columns 2 and 3, present the bilateral terms of trade changes with respect to NAFTA members
and the rest of the world using (17). As we can see, Mexico and Canada’s terms of trade deteriorate against
both group of countries, but mostly with NAFTA countries. For the U.S. the story is di¤erent. Terms of
trade improve with respect to all countries. However, the terms of trade improve relatively more against
NAFTA members since the U.S. mostly sources intermediate goods from Mexico and Canada, countries that
experience a reduction in export prices.
   Table 4 presents the sectoral contribution to the aggregate terms of trade and volume of trade e¤ects
                                                                                             PJ
for each NAFTA member. These …gures are calculated for each sector j as d ln totjn = j d ln totjn and
            PJ
d ln votjn = j d ln votjn using the sectoral measures de…ned in (19) and (20) : As we can see, there is consid-
erable variation in the sectoral contribution to the aggregate e¤ects. Still, the aggregate change in terms of
trade in each country is explained by a handful of sectors. The three sectors that contribute the most to
Mexico’s terms of trade deterioration account for 76% of the reduction. These sectors are Electrical Machin-
ery, Communication Equipment, and Auto (Motor Vehicles). These same three sectors are also the sectors
that contribute the most to U.S.’s terms of trade change accounting for 51% of the increase. In the case of
Canada, the three sectors that contribute the most to the change in terms of trade account for 52.5% of the
reduction. These sectors are, Auto, Other Transport and Basic Metals. The main explanations why certain
sectors have a large aggregate e¤ect compared to others are the magnitude of the reduction in import tari¤s,
how large is the share of materials used in production, and how important are sectoral linkages.
  To see this, consider the case of Mexico and U.S. From the previous discussion we know that Mexico’s
terms of trade deteriorate mainly as a consequence of the reduction in export prices and that most trade
is with NAFTA, in particular with the U.S. Similarly, since the U.S. mostly imports goods from Mexico,
and Mexican export prices fall, this is the …rst order e¤ect why the U.S. aggregate terms of trade improve.
So in order to understand why certain sectors contribute more to the aggregate terms of trade changes in
Mexico and the U.S. we need to understand why export prices in these sectors fall so much as a consequence

of NAFTA.48 There are three reasons for this. First, the average tari¤s applied by Mexico to imports from
Canada and the U.S. on Electrical Machinery, Communication Equipment, and Autos in the year 1993 were
13.4%, 14.9% and 15.5% respectively. These sectors were not the sectors with the largest import tari¤s but
still larger than the average (12.4%), and the median (13.2%), import tari¤ applied across all sectors. Second,
the share of materials used in production is 82% for the case of Electrical Machinery and Communication
Equipment, and 73% for Autos. These …gures are considerably larger than the average (49%), and the median
(48.3%), share of material use in production for the rest of the sectors in the Mexican economy. Finally,
these sectors are very interrelated. The shares of Electrical Machinery and Communication Equipment used
for the production of Electrical Machinery are 37% and 3%, while for the production of Communication
Equipment the shares are 53% and 7%. Therefore, the reduction in import tari¤s in these sectors explain
part of the e¤ect on prices. The rest is explained by the fact that a reduction in the unit cost of production
in any of these sectors has a multiplicative e¤ect because of the strong input-output feedback that these
sectors present. Also, a large share of material use in production makes, other things equal, reductions in
import tari¤s across sectors to have a larger impact in export prices in these sectors compared to the rest.
  From Table 4 we can also learn how the sectoral contribution to the aggregate change in volume of trade
varies across NAFTA members. The …rst thing to note is that for the case of Mexico and the U.S., every sector
 4 8 Infact, trade weighted export prices of Electrical Machinery, Communication Equipment, and Autos fall by 6.6%, 3.5%
and 5.6% in Mexico; the largest reductions across all sectors.

has a positive contribution to the welfare increase from volume of trade. Three sectors account for more than
50% of the sectoral contribution of Mexico’s and U.S.’s volume of trade. These are Textiles, Petroleum and
Electrical Machinery. For the case of Canada, the sectors that contribute the most are Textiles, Petroleum
and Auto. In general, volume of trade e¤ects depend on the magnitude of the tari¤ reduction, the trade
elasticity, and the share of materials used in production and these factors weight di¤erently for each of these
sectors. Textiles was the most protected sector by Mexico in the year 1993. Applied import tari¤s were
on average 18%. So the large reduction in tari¤s facilitates trade between members of NAFTA and results
in a signi…cant contribution to the increase in volume of trade. Petroleum is a homogenous good sector.
As a consequence, small changes in import tari¤s can have large trade e¤ects since it is relatively easy to
substitute suppliers, as documented by its high import tari¤ trade elasticity (see Table 1). The average
import tari¤s in Petroleum in the year 1993 across NAFTA members was 7%. Finally, NAFTA’s tari¤s
reductions has important e¤ects over the price of intermediate goods traded in some sectors compared to
others. This is particularly important for the sectors Electrical Machinery and Autos for reasons we discussed
in the previous paragraph. The reduction in trade prices in these sectors explains the increase in the volume
of trade e¤ect.

                           Table 5. Trade e¤ects from NAFTA’s tari¤ reductions

  Table 5 presents aggregate trade e¤ects from NAFTA. As we can see, NAFTA generated large aggregate
trade e¤ects for all members. Mexico’s imports from NAFTA increased by more than 110% and equally so
across both partners. For the case of Canada, we …nd that the percentage increase in imports from Mexico
is …ve times larger than the percentage increase in imports from the U.S. This results re‡ect that Mexico’s
role as a supplier of intermediate goods to NAFTA members increased as a consequence of NAFTA. In fact,
this is even more evident when we look at the case of the U.S. imports. Imports from Mexico increase more
than 100% while from Canada only 6.57%. These …gures re‡ect how interdependent these economies become
after the tari¤ reductions imposed by the agreement. In short, NAFTA strengthened the trade dependence
that these countries had before the agreement, and as a consequence Canada and the U.S. source more goods
from Mexico, while Mexico sources more goods from Canada and the U.S.
  NAFTA also had an e¤ect on sectoral specialization. Table 6 presents export shares by industry before
and after reducing NAFTA’s tari¤s. First note that sectoral concentration varies considerably across sectors
and countries. Consider the case of Mexico before NAFTA, the year 1993. Three sectors account for 52.75%
of total exports. These sectors are Electrical Machinery, Autos and Mining. For the case of Canada, the
three sectors with the largest shares are Autos, Basic Metals and Mining, and account for 43.7% of total
exports. While for the U.S. the three largest sectors are Machinery, Chemicals, and Autos, and account for


                                                      24
28.57% of total exports. These …gures re‡ect that Mexico was the country with the highest degree of sectoral
specialization while the U.S. the most diversi…ed. In fact, the last row of the table presents the normalized
Her…ndahl index (henceforth, HHI) and we make use of it as a measure of sectoral specialization. As we can
see, the HHI for Mexico was the largest and twice as large as the U.S. HHI, the smallest among all NAFTA
members. After NAFTA’s tari¤s reductions we …nd that Mexico became more specialized while Canada and
the U.S. more diversi…ed. In fact, Mexico’s share of exports from Electrical Machinery increase to 34.07%
and the three largest sectors account for 54.95% of total exports after NAFTA. This sectoral concentration
is re‡ected in Mexico’s HHI which increases to 0.138. On the other hand, the HHI indices of Canada and
the U.S. decrease.49

  The rest of the world was hardly a¤ected by NAFTA’s tari¤ reductions. Table A.2 in Appendix “Additional
Results”, which we do not include in the main text for brevity, presents the change in welfare, terms of trade
and volume of trade e¤ects for the rest of the 28 countries in our sample. The e¤ects are small. The two
countries most impacted are China and Korea and in both cases welfare falls by 0.03%. This is mostly due
to a reduction in the volume of trade for the case of China, and an equal reduction in the terms of trade and
volume of trade for the case of Korea. Looking at other countries we …nd that volumes of trade decreased
  4 9 Many factors, besides NAFTA, could have in‡uenced the pattern of sectoral specialization in the data. Still, the pattern of
sectoral specialization implied by the model from NAFTA’s tari¤ reductions for NAFTA members is in line with the observed
pattern in the year 2005. In fact, the correlations are 0.59, 0.86, and 0.83 for Mexico, Canada, and the U.S. respectively.


                                                               25
for most cases. These results are suggestive of countries having a negative impact from NAFTA mainly due
to trade diversion towards NAFTA members. Still, the impact is small.
  We now turn to the analysis of the e¤ects of NAFTA given world tari¤ changes.


5.2 The E¤ects of NAFTA given World Tari¤ Changes


  From 1993 to 2005 more than 100 regional trade agreements entered into force.50 Of these agreements,
several involved NAFTA members. Since NAFTA was active during this process of trade liberalization we
can evaluate to what extent the economic e¤ects of NAFTA’s tari¤ reductions were in‡uenced by world tari¤
changes. To that end, we …rst use observable changes in tari¤s and quantify the global e¤ects from world
tari¤ reductions, including the change in NAFTA’s tari¤s.

  Table 7 presents the welfare e¤ects for the 31 countries in our sample. As we can see, every single country
gained from world tari¤ reductions. The largest winner was China, with a welfare gain of 13.9%.51 The
most important source of these gains for China are the increased volume of trade. This is also the case for
most countries in the sample. Focusing on NAFTA members, all countries gained more compared to the
case where only NAFTA tari¤ change. In the case of Canada, the gains are 0.10% and most of the gains
arise from an increase in trade volumes. For the case of Mexico, the gains are similar, 1.36% compared to
1.31%, but the source is slightly di¤erent. Terms of trade deteriorate less, -0.40% compared to -0.41%, and
  5 0 This …gure was computed using the list of agreements in force from 1993 to 2005 from the WTO-RTA Database,
(http://rtais.wto.org/).
  5 1 The welfare gains in Table 7 are calculated using (16) : We can use the model to understand more the source of the welfare

gains for each country. For the case of China, we …nd that the gains due to the reduction in import tari¤s that the rest of the
world applied to China, are 13.4%. The gains from the reduction of China’s import tari¤s are 0.08%. While if China’s import
and export tari¤s did not changed it would have lost -0.16%.


                                                              26
volume of trade increase more, 1.76% instead of 1.72%. For the case of the U.S., the gains are considerably
larger, 0.22% compared to 0.08%.
  We also decompose the welfare e¤ects into bilateral measures of terms of trade and volume of trade with
respect to NAFTA members and the rest of the world. Table 8 shows the results for Mexico, Canada and
the U.S. We …nd that volume of trade e¤ects with respect to the rest of the world increase. This is a key
di¤erence relative to the case where only NAFTA tari¤s changed; compare the last columns from Table 3
and Table 8. In fact, this re‡ects that trade was created with the rest of the world after NAFTA was in
force, due in part to the reduction of world tari¤s.


                         Table 8. Bilateral welfare e¤ects from world’s tari¤ reductions
                                       Terms of trade                Volume of Trade
                     Country NAFTA Rest of the world NAFTA Rest of the world
                     Mexico     -0.39%           -0.01%         1.64%            0.13%
                     Canada     -0.10%           0.02%          0.05%            0.12%
                     U.S.        0.03%           0.08%          0.04%            0.08%


  Focusing on other outcomes, Table 8 also shows that the terms of trade improvements for the U.S. are now
mostly with countries outside NAFTA. In the case of Canada the terms of trade e¤ects are still negative with
respect to NAFTA members, but now switched to positive with respect to other countries. These …gures
explain why Canada and the U.S. gained more from global tari¤ reductions relative to only NAFTA tari¤
reductions. The results on terms of trade e¤ects for Mexico are similar than before.
  We also measured the sectoral contribution to the aggregate terms of trade and volume of trade e¤ects
for NAFTA members.52 The salient di¤erence, compared to the case where only NAFTA tari¤s changed,
is for Canada the volume of trade e¤ects are positive in almost all sectors. Also, that Textiles is the
sector that contribute the most to welfare for Canada and the U.S. The main reason for this result is their
bilateral volume of trade e¤ect with respect to China. Regarding the sectoral specialization of export shares,
qualitatively we …nd similar results as before. Namely, that Mexico became more specialized, while Canada
and the U.S. more diversi…ed. However, quantitatively we …nd that Mexico’s HHI increased less, to 0.133,
while the HHI of Canada and U.S. decreased more, to 0.079 and 0.04 respectively. These results re‡ect once
again how sectoral variations in tari¤s can have important e¤ects for sectoral specialization.

  5 2 Table A.7 in Appendix “Additional Results”presents these results. Table A.8 reports the trade e¤ects for NAFTA members

from world tari¤ reductions. It shows that intra-bloc import growth are lower compared to the case when only NAFTA tari¤s
changed. We omit both tables from the main text for brevity.




                                                            27
  We now recalibrate the model to the year 1993 and introduce the observed change in world tari¤ structure
from 1993 to the year 2005 holding NAFTA tari¤s …xed. In this way we measure the economic e¤ects of all
observed world tari¤ changes excluding the reduction in NAFTA’s tari¤s. After this, we compare the gains
from world tari¤ reductions with and without NAFTA. In other words, the e¤ects of NAFTA given world
tari¤ changes. Table 9 presents the welfare e¤ects. As we can see, welfare and real wage changes for Canada
and the U.S. are almost identical to the ones we …nd in the previous subsection, Table 2. For the case of
Mexico, the welfare e¤ects and real wage e¤ects are somehow smaller. The main reason for this lower gains
is that volume of trade e¤ects are lower, 1.55% instead of 1.80%.


                   Table 10. Bilateral welfare e¤ects from NAFTA given world tari¤ changes
                                       Terms of trade              Volume of Trade
                    Country NAFTA Rest of the world NAFTA Rest of the world
                    Mexico       -0.37%          -0.01%        1.78%        -0.23%
                    Canada       -0.08%          -0.01%        0.08%        -0.05%
                    U.S.          0.03%           0.01%        0.04%         0.00%


  As we did before, we can make use of the bilateral measure of terms of trade to identify the reason why
Mexico’s volume of trade fall. We …nd that this is a consequence of the reduction in volume of trade e¤ects
with respect to the rest of the world, not with respect to NAFTA members. Table 10 presents these results.
As we can see, Mexico’s volume of trade e¤ects fall by 0.23% with the rest of the world. Therefore, we …nd
a larger negative e¤ect due to trade diversion compared to the case when only NAFTA’s tari¤ changed, last
column of Table 3. The logic of this result is as follows. When we evaluate the e¤ects of NAFTA holding
world tari¤s …xed, trade is diverted from the lowest cost supplier outside NAFTA to a new lower cost supplier
inside the bloc, because of the lower tari¤s. Now, as we allow tari¤s with respect to the rest of the world
also to change there is a larger pool of lowest cost suppliers in the world that Mexico is not getting access
to, because of low NAFTA tari¤s. In this sense, what the model is measuring is the implied trade diversion
from NAFTA. Said di¤erently, the change in world tari¤s has raised the opportunity cost, measured by the
volume of trade e¤ect, of belonging to NAFTA.53


5.3 The E¤ects of NAFTA Across Di¤erent Models


  We now quantify the role that di¤erent mechanisms in our model have at explaining the results. We
compare the results from our model (Benchmark) to a one sector model (One sector), a multi sector model
  5 3 TablesA.9 to A.12 in Appendix “Additional Results” presents additional welfare and trade e¤ects at the aggregate and
sectoral level. Overall, we …nd that the results are similar to the case when only NAFTA’s tari¤ change, Section 5.1. We also
performed an additional counterfactual exercise to quantify how the welfare gains from NAFTA compare to a unilateral tari¤
elimination by each member. We do this exercise calibrating the model to the year 1993 and then, for each NAFTA member
independently, we reduce their import tari¤s to zero with respect to every country in the world. As a result, we …nd a welfare
increase of 0.54% for Mexico and a welfare loss of 0.03% and 0.02% for Canada and the U.S. respectively. Real wage increase by
1.53%, 0.60% and 0.19%, for Mexico, Canada and the U.S. These welfare e¤ects are due to the standard optimal tari¤ reasons.




                                                             28
with no materials used in production (No materials), and with no I-O connections (No I-O).54 We calibrate
each of these models to the year 1993 and compute the welfare and trade responses from NAFTA’s tari¤
reductions. Table 11 presents the simulated trade and welfare e¤ects implied by the di¤erent models. The
…rst column shows the welfare e¤ect from the one sector model. The second column presents the welfare
result for the no materials model, and the third column presents the welfare result for the no I-O model.


                   Table 11. Trade and welfare e¤ects from NAFTA across di¤erent models
                             Welfare                         Imports growth from NAFTA members
                                  Multi sector                                  Multi sector
   Country      One sector No materials No I-O         One sector No materials No I-O Benchmark
   Mexico         0.41%          0.50%       0.66%       60.99%        88.09%      98.96%    118.28%
   Canada        -0.08%         -0.03%      -0.04%        5.98%         9.95%      10.14%     11.11%
   U.S.           0.05%          0.03%       0.04%       17.34%        26.91%      30.70%     40.52%


  We …nd that for all models the welfare e¤ects are smaller compared to the benchmark model. Still, in
all cases Mexico gains the most followed by the U.S. then Canada. The results from the one sector model
re‡ect the importance of accounting for sectoral heterogeneity. In fact, recent studies have emphasized
that the sectoral variation in trade elasticities is particularly important for the quanti…cation of the welfare
gains.55 The calculations also show that intermediate goods amplify the welfare e¤ects from tari¤ reductions.
Mexico’s …gure increase from 0.50% to 0.66%, Canada’s deteriorate more from -0.03% to -0.04% and the
U.S. increase from 0.03% to 0.04% as we move from a model with no materials to a model with materials.
We also …nd that the model with input-output linkages ampli…es the e¤ects as well. If we compare the third
column on Table 11 to the results from the benchmark model, Table 2, we can clearly see that the welfare
e¤ects are substantially larger for the countries that win and lower for the countries that loose.
  Trade e¤ects are also smaller across these models compared to the benchmark case. The last four columns of
Table 11 presents, for the case of Mexico, Canada and the U.S., the change in imports from NAFTA members
implied by the di¤erent models. As we can see, the trade e¤ects are reduced substantially compared to the
benchmark case. In the one sector model, the trade responses are almost reduced by half. The intuition for
this result relates to the result on welfare. By averaging out the e¤ects, a one sector model fails to capture
the large increase in trade ‡ows from certain sectors. In fact, we know from tables 4 and 6 that NAFTA
generated very heterogenous responses across sectors. If we compare the results from column …ve to column
six we can see that adding intermediate goods increases the trade e¤ects. The intuition for this result is
  5 4 The one sector model has one tradable sector and one non-tradable sector. Production uses materials from both sectors,

(I-O). We agregate all sectoral data to calibrate the parameters and use the median tari¤ across sectors. We use our speci…cation
(23) to estimate an aggregate elasticity, the value is = 4:5: In the multi-sector model “No materials” there are no materials
used in production, jn = 1; and as a result value added is equal to gross output. In the multi sector model “No I-O”, materials
are used in production, jn < 1; but we zero out the o¤-diagonal elements of the I-O matrix. Firms can only use materials
sourced from the same sector they operate, j;j  n = 1
                                                           j                                                    j;j
                                                           n : We use I-O tables for each country to calibrate n . For all cases,
we …rst calibrate the model and then eliminate the observed aggregate trade de…cits.
  5 5 In a recent study, Ossa (2012) shows that the heterogeneity in trade elasticities per se has an important e¤ect on the

quanti…cation of the welfare gains from trade. He shows this for the case of iceberg trade costs and by calculating welfare losses
from reverting to autarky.




                                                               29
as follows. In the model with no materials, goods are only traded to produce …nal goods for consumption
and not for the production of intermediate goods. However, in the no I-O model, materials are also used for
the production of intermediate goods. Therefore, a tari¤ reduction delivers a larger trade e¤ect due to the
increase in demand of tradable goods for the production of intermediates. Finally, we can also compare the
implied changes in trade ‡ows from a model with intermediate goods in production but no sectoral linkages,
the no I-O model, to the benchmark case. The trade e¤ects from tari¤ reductions are lower in the no I-O
model than in the model with sectoral interrelations (Benchmark). The reason is that since producers are
only using inputs from one sector they are not exploiting the bene…ts of having access to cheaper materials
from other sectors. This in turn delivers a smaller trade e¤ect from tari¤ changes. In short, the results
from this subsection unmask the importance of accounting for sectoral heterogeneity, intermediate goods in
production and I-O linkages to evaluate the welfare gains from tari¤ changes, in general, and in particular
for the case of NAFTA.


                                            6. CONCLUSION


  This study develops a general equilibrium model to quantify the trade and welfare e¤ects of tari¤ changes.
The model is able to perform complex trade policy evaluations for an arbitrary number of sectors and
countries in a parsimonious way with few data and parameter requirements. Using the model we decompose
the di¤erent channels by which a reduction in tari¤s can spread the gains across sectors in the economy.
We show that accounting for sectoral interrelations is quantitatively and economically meaningful. With the
model, one can quantify and decompose the e¤ects that a reduction or increase in a tari¤ in a particular
sector can have on the price of intermediate inputs in that sector and in the rest of the economy, the general
equilibrium price e¤ects of tari¤ reductions at home and abroad, the impact on factor allocations across
sectors, the change in factor payments and the extent to which the structure of production of a particular
economy can spread the gains from having access to cheaper intermediate goods and more e¢ cient technology.
  Evaluating the e¤ects of NAFTA has receive considerable attention in the economic literature. Therefore,
it is important to clarify how our results about NAFTA should be interpreted. We use the model to perform
a model-based identi…cation of the e¤ects of NAFTA’s tari¤ reductions. Unquestionably, NAFTA had more
provisions than only reducing tari¤ between members and by no means our results should be interpreted as
the trade and welfare e¤ects of the entire agreement. For instance, non-tari¤ barriers or unobservable trade
costs might also have changed as a consequence of NAFTA. Moreover, NAFTA might have even in‡uenced
the rate of technological change of each member. Certainly, we could have used the model to quantify
what is the implied change in fundamental TFP and trade costs such that the model matches the trade
patterns observed in the data. However, understanding how fundamental TFP changed as a consequence of
NAFTA is outside of the scope of this paper. In our model fundamental TFP is exogenous and by holding
it …xed during the period of analysis we are able to identify the pure direct e¤ect of tari¤ reductions. Our

study uses the case of NAFTA to show how the e¤ects of tari¤ reductions are ampli…ed as we take into
account the interrelation across sectors observed in the data. We …nd that the trade and welfare e¤ects from
tari¤ reductions are lower if intermediate goods in production and input-output linkages are ignored in the
analysis. With this results we hope to convey the message that modelling sectoral interrelations is not only
feasible but also important for quantitative analysis.

         APPENDIX: DISTRIBUTION OF PRICES AND EXPENDITURE SHARES

   The e¢ ciency of country n in producing an intermediate good ! j in sector j is the realization of a random
                                                                                                j    j
variable zij drawn for each ! j in each sector j from the distribution Fnj (z) = e n z : Therefore, the cost
of purchasing an intermediate good ! j from country i; where we abuse of notation and denote by pjni (zij ); is
the realization of the random variable pjni (zij ) = cji jni =zij : First note that pjni (zij ) has a Fréchet distribution,
in particular                                h          i                                         j       j
                                                     Pr pjni            p =1                 e   Tni p
                                                                                                                  ;                                              (24)
            j                 j
where Tni     = ji (cji jni ) . Given this, the lowest price of an intermediate good ! j in country n, namely
pjn (! j ); has also a Fréchet distribution,
                                                        YN        h       i
                                       Pr pjn p = 1            Pr pjni p ;                               (25)
                                                                                     i=1

and using (24) we obtain
                                                                                                     j    j

                                        (c     ) . The object jn plays a critical role in our model. It’s a
                  i=1 ni         i=1 i i ni
su¢ cient statistic of the states of technologies around the world, input costs, geographic barriers and tari¤
policies. In Eaton and Kortum (2002), this object is country speci…c, while in our model it is also sector
speci…c. Note that jn is correlated across sectors since sectors are interrelated and the input costs are
functions of prices from all sectors. The shares k;jn will determine the extent of the correlation. Note that
                                           j                       j
in a non-tradable goods sector, since in = 1; n = jn (cjn ) :

                                             j
   It is convenient to work with pjn (! j ) . Note that since pjn (! j ) is Fréchet with shape parameter j , then
         j                                                                                j
pn (! j ) has an exponential distribution. To see this, de…ne the function g (x) = x and suppose that x has
 j
                                                      j                           j
a Fréchet distribution with location parameter n and shape parameter : Let fx (x) denote the density
                                                 j          j       j
function of x; namely fx (x) = j jn x 1 e n x : It follows that the density function of y = g (x) is given
                             1                              1           1           1
by fy (y) = fx g 1 (y) j @g @y(y) j: Then since g 1 (y) = y j ; and @g @y(y) = 1j y j 1 , the density function of

y is fy (y) =   ne         ; which is an exponential distribution with parameter                                                     n:   Given this result, the price
index is                                             Z

which follows since we have just derived that y = pjn (! j ) has probability density function, jn e n y . Now

the new policy 0 ; captured by ^ jni or a change in Dn to Dn0 .

     Step 1: Guess a vector of wages w    b1 ; :::; w
                                     ^ = (w         bN )
     Step 2: Use equilibrium conditions (10) and (11) to solve for prices in each sector and each country,
     p^jn (w)
           ^ and input costs, c^jn (w)
                                    ^ consistent with the vector of wages w:
                                                                          ^
     Step 3: Use the information on jni and                            j
                                                                           together with the solutions to p^jn (w)

     2 and solve for j0
                      ni (w)
                          ^ using (12).

     where X is the vector of expenditures for each sector and country and (w)     ^ is a vector containing the
     shares of each sector and country in …nal demand, value added and aggregate trade de…cit by country.

Consider a double nested constant elasticity of substitution (CES) production function, with an outer nest
between labor and materials and an inner CES aggregator of materials from all sectors. Concretely, the
production function of intermediate goods ! j is given by

where materials and labor are combined with a CES function with elasticity of substitution equal to and
weights given to jn varying by sector and country. Mnj ! j is the total materials demanded in sector j by
producer ! j in country n: We also allowed for a varying degree of substitution where materials from sector
k used to produce intermediate goods in sector j are combined with a CES PJfunction with elasticity equal to

  In terms of the characterization of the equilibrium, two equations have to be modi…ed with a CES model.
First, the cost of the bundle of inputs now adopts a nested CES functional form given by
                                                 h                                                                        1
                                                                                                                                  i11
                                                                          1
                                     cjn =              j
                                                        n       [wn ]               + 1              j
                                                                                                     n     PnM;j                            ;                                     (33)

where PnM;j is the price index of materials used in production, given by
                                                                                                                          1
                                                                          XJ                               1          1
                                                                                              k;j
                                                  PnM;j =                                     n      Pnk                      :                                                   (34)
                                                                                  k=1


  Second, the input shares are not constant with a CES model, and therefore the equation for total expen-
diture is given by
                                      XJ         XN           k
                                             j;k              in
                                Xnj =        n         Xik         + jn In ;                         (35)
                                         k=1       i=1     1 + kin
  where j;k
        n is the share of inputs from sector j in sector k gross output.
  Mapping this shares to our previous notation, this implies that
                                                                           1                                1                                                             1

                 n        n     = 1               n                                     n                             ; and         n                   n                     :
                                                                cjn                               PnM;j                                                         cjn

                       APPENDIX: DATA SOURCES AND DESCRIPTION

  This appendix describes the data sources and data construction we use in the paper. The list of countries
included in our database are: Argentina, Australia, Austria, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Denmark, Finland,
France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Netherlands, New
Zealand, Norway, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, UK, USA, and a constructed rest of the
world. The list of sectors is reported in Table A.1.

  Bilateral Trade Flows We use bilateral trade ‡ows for the 20 tradable sectors described in Table
A.1 and our sample of 31 countries for the year 1993. Bilateral trade data come from the United Nations
Statistical Division (UNSD) Commodity Trade (COMTRADE) database. Values are reported in thousands
of U.S. dollars at current prices and include cost, insurance and freight (CIF). Commodities are de…ned
using the Harmonized Commodity Description and Coding System (HS)1988/1992 at the 6-digit level of
aggregation and were concorded to 2-digit ISIC Rev. 3 using the United Nations concordance table. To
construct imports from the rest of the world, we use data on imports of each country n in our sample from
the world and subtract total imports of that country n from the rest of the countries included in our sample.
Analogously, to construct exports to the rest of the world, we use data on exports of each country n in our
sample to the world and subtract total imports of the rest of the countries included in our sample from that
country n.

   Tari¤s Bilateral tari¤s data at the sectoral level for the years 1993 and 2005 are obtained from the
United Nations Statistical Division-Trade Analysis and Information System (UNCTAD-TRAINS). The tari¤
measures are tari¤ lines and are reported in two ways; simple and weighted average e¤ective applied rates at
2-digit ISIC Rev. 3 industries. E¤ective applied rates refers to the actual tari¤ applied, taking into account
whether there is any trade agreement between the countries. We also downloaded the most-favored-nation
(MFN) tari¤s for each country. Under the rules of the World Trade Organization (WTO), members cannot
discriminate between their trading partners; therefore, they need to grant all countries the same favorable
treatment as all other WTO members. The tari¤ that considers this rule is the MFN tari¤. If countries
sign bilateral and multilateral trade agreements, then they are exempt from this rule. We compared both
measures to see if they were consistent, that is, if the e¤ective applied rates are lower or equal than the
MFN tari¤s. We decided to use weighted average rates in the counterfactual exercises, although we checked
that the results are robust by also using the simple averages. When tari¤ data for the year 1993 was not
available, we input this value with the closest value available, searching for the four previous years. When
tari¤ data were not available in 2005, we input the value of 2006 or 2004. When the e¤ective applied
tari¤ was not available in all these years, which occurs in about 2% of all the observations, we input the
most-favored-nation (MFN) tari¤ rate for each country. Figure A.1 presents the e¤ective tari¤s rates across
NAFTA members for the year 1993.

  Value Added and Gross Production We obtained data on gross output and value added at the
sectoral level for the year 1993 from three di¤erent sources. First, we collected data from OECD STAN
database for industrial analysis that contains gross output and value added data for OECD countries at the
sectoral level based on ISIC Rev. 3 at current prices and in national currency. We use data from OECD
STAN exchange rates to covert values into U.S. dollars. Second, value added and gross output data for the
remaining countries are sourced from the Industrial Statistics Database INDSTAT2. This database contains
data at current prices in U.S. dollars for 23 ISIC Rev. 3 manufacturing sectors at 2-digit level of aggregation.
These two databases allow us to complete gross output and value added for about two-third of the total
number of countries and sectors in our sample, and nearly all the observations in the manufacturing sectors.
  For the remaining countries and sectors where data from these two databases were not available, we
construct sectoral value added and gross output using information from the OECD Input-Output database.
The OECD database provides input-output tables for 48 countries for the years 1995, 2000, and 2005, and
contain information for 37 ISIC Rev. 3 industries. We obtained gross output and value added for the missing
sectors and countries for the year 1995 from these input-output tables. To convert value added and gross
output to the year 1993, we assume that the sectoral shares of value added in GDP and the share of value

added in sectoral gross output remained constant between 1993 and 1995. We then combine this information
with sectoral value added data for the year 1993 from the United Nations National Accounts Database.
This database contains value added data over the period 1970-2011 for 200 countries. Value added data
is disaggregated into the following sectors: Agricultural, Hunting, Forestry, Fishing (ISIC A-B); Mining,
Utilities (ISIC C-E); Manufacturing (ISIC D); Construction (ISIC F); Wholesale, retail trade, restaurants
and hotels (ISIC G-H); Transport, storage and communication (ISIC I); and Other Activities (ISIC J-P).
We use the shares of value added in GDP from the input-output tables to split these subcategories into our
ISIC Rev. 3 sectors and we use the shares of value added in gross output to convert value added into gross
output in our sectors.
   To construct sectoral value added and gross output for the rest of the world, we …rst obtain world’s value
added for these seven ISIC industries from the United Nations database by adding value added data for
200 countries. We then apply the median shares of sectoral value added in GDP from our sample to split
value added into our ISIC Rev. 3 categories, and we then apply the median shares of value added in gross
output to convert value added into gross output for the world. After doing so, we calculate the rest of the
world by simply subtracting total value added and gross output in our sample of countries from the world’s
aggregates. With value added and gross output data we calculate the share of value added in gross output
for all sectors and countries in our sample.

   Input-Output Tables and Intermediate Consumption We constructed the share of intermediate
inputs from each sector in sectoral gross output by combining information from the World Input-Output
Database (WIOD) and the OECD Input-Output Database. The WIOD database contains input-output
tables for 40 countries over the period 1995-2011. Each input-output table provides complete information on
intermediate consumption for 35 ISIC Rev. 2 industries. We calculate the input-output coe¢ cients from the
WIOD database. The input-output tables present intermediate consumption for the aggregate ISIC Rev.3
sectors 27-28, 30-33, 34-35, 71-74. We use the information from the OECD input-output tables to split these
aggregate sectors into our sectoral classi…cation. Input-Output tables for Argentina, Chile, New Zealand,
Norway, and South Africa were not available in the WIOD database. For Norway we use the input-output
table from OECD STAN. For the rest of these 5 countries, input-output tables were incomplete, thus we
decided to input the median coe¢ cients across our sample of countries. The input-output table for the rest
of the world was also constructed using the median coe¢ cients.

   Estimation of Dispersion of Productivity To estimate the dispersion of productivity, we collect
data on trade ‡ows and tari¤ rates for 16 economies: Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China,
the European Union, India, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, New Zealand, Norway, Switzerland, Thailand and the
United States. Brazil was dropped from the sample because it was experiencing a currency crisis (large
devaluation, high in‡ation). Bilateral trade data for 1993 are not di¢ cult to …nd; however, we are restricted
by the information on tari¤s. Countries were included in the sample provided they had reliable tari¤ data
and they had cross bilateral trade with many countries. In order to increase the sample size we had to
input the values for some countries. If a country in the list did not have tari¤ data available in 1993,
we input this value with the closest value available, searching up to four previous years, up to 1989. Our
estimation is performed excluding Mexico from the sample. Canada and the United States are included in
the estimation; however, we remove all the interaction (triple combinations in (23)) terms involving Canada
and the United States. We leave the interaction of these countries with other countries in order to have a
larger number of observations since these countries have a large number of trading partners. The sample
of countries represented more than 80% of the world’s trade in 1993 and at least 72% in each sector. Data
on trade ‡ows are from the United Nations COMTRADE database for 1993. Values are recorded in U.S.
dollars for commodities de…ned using the HS-1992 at two digits of aggregation, corresponding to 30 sectors.
Using concordance tables we obtained trade ‡ows for 20 ISIC-rev. 3 sectors. The reporter country is the
importer, and imports are at CIF. values. Data on tari¤s are from UNCTAD-TRAINS for 1989-1995. Tari¤s
represent the e¤ective tari¤ rate applied by each country. Tari¤s are available for industries at four digits
ISIC-rev.3. and were aggregated up to two digits using a weighted average, where the weights are given by
the import values. Whenever data on bilateral tari¤s are not available in 1993, we input this value with
the closest value available, searching up to four previous years. The total number of observations for the 20
sectors is 9138, with an average of 457 observations per sector.
