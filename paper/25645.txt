Getting Smart About Phones: New Price Indexes and the Allocation of Spending Between
Devices and Services Plans in Personal Consumption Expenditures

                                          ABSTRACT

This paper addresses two measurement issues for mobile phones. First, we develop a new mobile
phone price index using hedonic quality-adjusted prices for smartphones and a matched-model
index for feature phones. Our index falls at an average annual rate of 17 percent during
2010-2018, close to the rate of decline in the price index used in the GDP Accounts. Given
relatively flat average prices over this period, our index points to substantial quality
improvement. Second, we propose a methodology to disentangle purchases of phones and
wireless services when they are bundled together as part of a long-term service contract. Getting
the allocation right is especially important for real PCE because the price deflators for phones and
wireless services exhibit very different trends. Our adjusted estimates suggest that real PCE
spending currently captured in the category Cellular Phone Services increased 4 percentage
points faster than is reflected in published data.

1. Introduction

         Since the introduction of the iPhone in 2007, smartphones have become one of the

wonders of the modern age, providing a level of connectivity, data access, and

functionality that was considered science fiction even ten years earlier.1 Moreover,

smartphones have become far more capable during the past decade, with an iPhone X

having about 7 times as many transistors as the original iPhone (and about 51,000 times

as many transistors as an early 1980s IBM personal computer).2 As with many other

information and communications technologies (ICT), that rapid change in capabilities

and characteristics poses challenges for estimating quality-adjusted price indexes.3

Accurate estimates of quality-adjusted prices are crucial inputs for measures of inflation,

real GDP and productivity growth, capital stocks, as well as for gauging the pace of

innovation in the technology sector.4

         Moreover, until recently, many mobile phones5 were purchased as part of a

bundle; purchasers would receive a subsidy or discount on the phone reducing the upfront

out-of-pocket cost in exchange for a commitment to a multi-month wireless service plan




1
  Following Byrne and Corrado (2015), we define smartphones as “cellular phones with powerful operating
systems that allow multi-tasking and installation of third-party applications.” We also follow IDC’s
definition of mobile phones “as a device with a screen size of less than 7.0 inches as well as out-of-the-box
cellular voice telephony with an in-built mic/speaker, capable of connecting to a cellular network for voice
communication through a service provider plan.” These definitions exclude tablets, non-telephony enabled
devices, and rugged devices.
2
  According to CNet (2018), the A12 chip powering an iPhone XS has about 6.9 billion transistors. An
entry on Quora (2016) estimated that the processor on an original iPhone had about 1 billion transistors.
Hennessy and Patterson (2012) report that an Intel 80286 powering early 1980s IBM PCs had 134,000
transistors.

  We use “mobile phone” and “cell phone” interchangeably. In the period of our study, the terms are
essentially synonymous. That is, nearly all mobile phones connect through a cellular network. Exceptions,
like satellite phones, are out of scope for our analysis.


                                                                                                           3
whose price would include payment for the remaining cost of the phone.6 This bundling,

when it occurs, is problematic for economic measurement both because a portion of

spending on services actually includes payments for phones and because that

misallocation could lead to the wrong deflators being applied to the portion of the

wireless services spending that actually reflects this spending for phones.

         In this paper, we address both of those issues, developing new price indexes for

mobile phones and proposing a methodology for disentangling the phone and service

portions of spending on wireless services in recent years.

         Regarding prices of mobile phones, we know of only a handful of studies that

have attempted to construct constant-quality price indexes. For the United States, Byrne

and Corrado (2015) developed matched-model indexes for mobile phones and other types

of communications equipment. Their mobile phone index was based on a mix of price

data—including prices of used phones for the period studied in this paper—and it

declined at an average annual rate of 22 percent from 2010 to 2016.

         Outside the United States, we are aware of only one published paper that provides

price indexes for mobile phones: Watanabe et al. (2010) for Japan. Using their hedonic

analysis for the prices for feature phones and smartphones, they found declines in prices

of mobile phones of about 13 percent per year over the period from 2002 to 2007. For

smartphones, preliminary findings for two studies have also been reported at conferences

  Verizon’s 2016 annual report provides a description of these bundled plans and their phaseout:
“Historically, wireless service providers offered customers wireless plans whereby, in exchange for the
customer entering into a fixed-term service agreement, the wireless service providers significantly, and in
some cases fully, subsidized the customer’s device purchase. Wireless providers recovered those subsidies
through higher service fees as compared to those paid by customers on device installment plans. We and
many other wireless providers have limited or discontinued this form of device subsidy.” Available at:

AnnualReport2016_mda.pdf


                                                                                                          4
and international meetings. Chessa (2016) applied hedonic techniques to smartphone

prices in the Netherlands for the 24-month period beginning in Dec. 2013 and found

average annual declines of 14 percent; similarly, the hedonic analysis by Karamti and

Haouech (2018) for Tunisia for the six-quarter period beginning in 2016Q1 found annual

average declines of around 15 percent.

          Among U.S. statistical agencies, the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA)—as

part of the 2018 Comprehensive Revision of the National Income and Product

Accounts—adopted the price index from Byrne and Corrado (2015) for mobile phones

for equipment investment, personal consumption expenditures, and trade flows.7 For the

Consumer Price Index (CPI), the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) recently implemented

two improvements to the traditional matched-model method that they had used for

smartphones through the end of 2017. Beginning in January 2018, the BLS began

adjusting prices for item substitutions in the index using coefficients from a hedonic

regression; beginning in the April 2018 data, the BLS also increased the frequency with

which smartphones in the “basket” are refreshed to twice a year. We cannot, however,

compare the BLS price index for mobile phones (or smartphones) to other indexes

because the index for mobile phones is not reported separately but rather is a component

of a broader index for “telephone hardware, calculators, and other consumer information

items.”

          Regarding the disentangling of bundled purchases of mobile phones and wireless

service plans, we know of no past effort to separate out the phone and service

components of spending on wireless service plans.

                                                                                           5
        Our approach to these issues is as follows. On price indexes, we believe that it is

important to see if hedonic techniques yield similar or different price trends than past

studies. Accordingly, we develop new estimates for the United States of quality-adjusted

prices for smartphones using data from IDC (International Data Corporation). These data

track average selling prices and units for smartphones and have not previously been used

to develop hedonic price indexes. Our preferred hedonic index—which allows

coefficients to vary over time—declines at an average annual rate of about 16 percent per

year from the first quarter of 2010 to the first quarter of 2018. In addition, we combine

our smartphone price index with a matched-model price index for “feature” phones to

obtain an overall price index for mobile phones, which falls 17 percent per year from

2010 to 2018Q1.8 These estimates provide useful points of comparison with other recent

estimates of prices, including the index used by the Federal Reserve for the Industrial

Production data (which closely tracks Byrne and Corrado (2015)). The price index for

mobile phones developed here falls rapidly like the index in Byrne and Corrado (2015)

but 4 percentage points slower in the overlap period. Yet, it has the appeal of higher

frequency (quarterly versus annual) and direct measurement of the price of new phones

whereas the Byrne and Corrado index relied on prices in the market for used phones. This

index points to rapid technical change in smartphones since 2010, broadly in line with the




8
  To the extent that our preferred index differs from the deflators used in the national accounts, such
differences likely would have limited implications for real GDP because smartphones largely are produced
outside the United States. Federal Reserve Board estimates, based on Byrne and Corrado’s (2015) reading
of Census data and private sources, show U.S. mobile phone production averaged around only $300 million
a year from 2010 to 2016. At the same time, some recent research has highlighted that a considerable part
of the value added of iPhones and some other products should be attributed to the United States rather than
the country from which they are imported. If that adjustment were made, then our estimates could have
more significant implications for real GDP and productivity. See Guvenen, Mataloni, Rassier, and Ruhl
(2017).


                                                                                                         6
double digit rates of advance for some other digital products as reported in Byrne, Oliner,

and Sichel (2017) and Byrne and Corrado (2017).9

         With regard to the allocation of spending between cellular equipment and services

in PCE, we propose two adjustments to separate equipment and services. First, we use

Service Annual Survey (SAS) data to identify upfront or out-of-pocket spending on

phones that is included in the services category. Second, we use a comparison of phone

prices from IDC and J.D. Power to gross up equipment spending to the full cost of the

phone, taking account of any subsidy offered by the service provider in exchange for a

commitment to a long-term contract for cell service. In particular, the IDC data tracks

the price of smartphones without any service commitment; that is, without netting out any

discounts (or subsidies) to the up-front cost of the phone. In contrast, the J.D. Power

data—which are based on consumer surveys—capture the up-front or out-of-pocket price

paid net of any subsidies. Accordingly, the difference in prices across these datasets

provides an estimate of the size of the subsidy. This comparison indicates that these

subsidies were quite substantial prior to 2013, in the range of $200 to $300. Then,

starting around the beginning of 2013, mobile phone providers began more frequently

offering straight up purchase options without these discounts on purchasing a device.

These subsidies or discounts largely, though not entirely, had disappeared by 2018.

         With this information on discounts in hand, we can split out the portion of

spending on wireless service plans that actually reflects spending for phones. We find

that this share averaged 28 percent from 2010 to 2017, hitting a high of more than 36

 Price trends provide information about the pace of innovation via the “dual” relationship in which price
changes reflecting changes in input costs and total factor productivity. That being said, swings in margins
and other factors may complicate the linkage between price trends and the pace of technological advance.


                                                                                                              7
percent in 2012 and falling to about 21 percent in 2017. And, we can then apply our

deflator for phones to this portion of spending to get an adjusted estimate of an overall

deflator for the spending on Cellular Telephone Services and, by implication, for real

PCE for this category.

        Our calculations indicate that, after making these corrections, the deflator for

Cellular Telephone Services fell at an annual average rate of 7.7 percent from 2010 to

2017, about 4 percentage points faster than the currently published deflator for this

category. Accordingly, real PCE for this category has grown 4 percentage points faster

per year over this period than the currently published series.

        We believe our results are valuable in their own right as a contribution to

improved measurement of prices and PCE. In addition, our results contribute to the

growing literature that documents the rapid technical change in and diffusion of products

related to the digital revolution.

        This paper is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the IDC data we use and

highlights the rapid improvement of smartphone characteristics. We describe our

methodology for estimating quality-adjusted price indexes in Section 3, and our new

results for smartphone and overall mobile phone price indexes in Section 4. Section 5

describes how we use data from the SAS and a comparison of price data from IDC and

J.D. Power to disentangle and allocate spending on phones and services when the two are

bundled together. Section 6 concludes.

2. IDC Data and Smartphone Characteristics

IDC Data

        We rely on data from IDC to develop smartphone price indexes. Specifically, we

use data from the Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker dataset published by IDC

(International Data Corporation). IDC estimates revenue, units, and prices by model for

the U.S. market using public and proprietary information from phone manufacturers,

component suppliers and distribution channel companies (e.g. retailers and

wholesalers).10 Unique models are distinguished in the data by four variables: the

“model” in IDC nomenclature (e.g. “iPhone 4s”), the size of internal storage (e.g. 8

gigabytes), the mobile telecommunications generation (e.g. 3G), and the operating system

(e.g. “Android Jelly Bean 4.1”). The database contains both consumer and commercial

sales and does not provide model-level information by market, so we cannot produce a

pure consumer price index; however, roughly 90 percent of the unit sales in the database

are to the consumer market. There are 1,294 phone models in the database.

        The model prices reported are average selling prices (before point-of-sale taxes)

offered by retailers or service providers without a contract commitment, including

channel costs such as freight, insurance, shipping, and tariffs. As noted above and

discussed below, it was common during a portion of the period covered in our analysis

for service providers to bundle phones with service contracts, and the IDC dataset

indicates over 80 percent of phones were sold through service providers in this period. A

                                                                                                     9
crucial feature of the dataset is that for phones sold through carriers, IDC analysts have

been successful in collecting the price charged for each phone model without a contract

commitment; that is, in all cases where phones were sold with a service contract

commitment, the price recorded was the price for that model of phone, without contract,

directly reported by the carrier. We also confirmed that IDC is collecting actual prices

paid, rather than manufacturers’ suggested retail prices (MSRPs), by examining cases

where a prominent manufacturer publicizes MSRPs and confirmed that prices do, in fact,

appreciably deviate from the MSRP. In a small number of cases, we recoded price

observations to eliminate implausible patterns.11



Smartphone Characteristics

         The IDC database also provides detailed information on phone model

characteristics spanning 2010Q1 to 2018Q1. Table 1 reports values of key smartphone

characteristics in the IDC data. The main inference we draw from these data is that the

quality of smartphones improved significantly over the sample period. For example,

processor speed increased at an average annual rate of 9 percent between 2010 and 2017,

while the average number of cores in a phone’s processor rose from 1 in 2010 to over 5

by 2017. Storage capacity also rose very rapidly, increasing at an average annual rate of

29 percent during 2010 to 2017, and the amount of working memory (RAM) increased at




11
  In particular, we applied two rules. In cases of apparent missing values, defined as quarters where no
units of a model were sold flanked by non-zero sales in both adjacent quarters, a price and a quantity were
added using log-linear interpolation. In cases of a price spike, defined as a price increase of 10 percent or
more in one quarter followed by a price decrease of 10 percent or more in the following quarter, or a price
“pothole,” defined symmetrically to spikes, we substituted the log-linear interpolated price for the reported
price.


                                                                                                          10
an average annual rate of 33 percent during this period. Camera resolution also improved

at a good clip during this period.

        During our sample period, other important aspects of the market for mobile

phones changed. The share of smartphones in the overall market for mobile phones rose

from 38 percent in 2010 to 94 percent in 2017. And, market concentration in the market

is substantial and climbs over this time period. The Herfindahl index calculated with

manufacturers’ revenue shares in the consumer smartphone market is 0.16 in 2010 and

climbs to 0.44 by 2017.12



3. Methodology for Quality-Adjusted Price Indexes13

Matched-Model Indexes

        We estimate both matched-model and hedonic price indexes to control for quality

change though we emphasize hedonic indexes. The matched-model approach, the most

common method employed by statistical agencies, relies in its most basic formulation on

price changes over time for specific models of the good in question, holding quality

constant by construction if models are specified in enough detail. This approach takes an

average of price changes for specific models rather than calculating the change in the

price average across models. Although the matched-model approach ideally strips out

the effect of quality change on prices, this technique may fall short in cases characterized

by frequent model entry and exit for two reasons. First, in the period of entry, no price

change relative to the previous period is available, and, of course, no price change is


12
   There were 23 manufacturers in the market in 2017. If each manufacturer had an equal share of the
market, the Herfindahl index would be 0.05.
13
   The description of hedonic methodology in this section draws heavily from Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel
(2018), including a significant amount of text taken and adapted directly from that paper.


                                                                                                         11
available in the period following the model’s exit either. Second, if entering models have

a lower price relative to quality than incumbent models and do not drive down the price

of incumbent models—that is, the law of one (quality adjusted) price does not hold—

before the older model exits the market, the quality improvement represented by the new

model may not be reflected in the index. Both issues are a concern in the market for

mobile phones.

         For matched-model indexes, we consider first an index constructed as an

unweighted geometric mean of price changes, known as the Jevons formula. We start

with unweighted indexes because statistical agencies typically do not collect weights at

the model level in each period.14 In addition, researchers estimating hedonic indexes

often do not have model-level weights.

         Such a lack of weighting raises two issues. First, some models undoubtedly

represent a greater share of the market than others—a particular concern in the mobile

phone market where a handful of Apple models account for a disproportionate share of

the market. Second, the relative importance of models changes over time. The

importance of the issue of fixed weights in price indexes has been the subject of

extensive research. Generally speaking, allowing weights to evolve over time is the

preferred approach as that allows the index to reflect consumers’ response to relative

prices and substitution across models as discussed in Diewert (1998). Our second

matched-model index addresses this issue; we calculate an index where the model-

the survey sample, but then not be asked to report sales by model in subsequent periods.


                                                                                                        12
specific price changes are weighted by the average of their revenue share in the two

periods used to calculate the price change (known as the Tornqvist formula).15


Hedonic Price Index Methodology

         Hedonic regression—estimating the statistical relationship between model prices

and product characteristics and performance—provides information that can be used in a

variety of ways to construct constant-quality indexes. One can impute model prices for

the period prior to the model’s appearance in the market and use the implied price change

in a conventional matched-model formula (Pakes, 2003). Another approach is to adjust

the price of a newly-introduced model according to the implicit valuation of the

difference in characteristics relative to an existing model.16 In this paper, we focus on a

third approach, estimating “time-dummy” hedonic price indexes. In this setup, product

characteristics act simply as control variables and the focus is on the quality-adjusted

price trend implied by the coefficient on the dummy for each time period, with the quality

change stripped out by the regression.17 All of these approaches are valid uses of hedonic

regression for the construction of constant-quality price indexes, and the choice of

method is dictated largely by the circumstances.18

         To fix ideas for our time-dummy hedonic price indexes, consider the following

simple dummy-variable hedonic specification:

         ln #$,& = ) +         , +, -,,$,&   +   & .& /$,&   + 0$,&               (1)


15
   The Tornqvist index satisfies the criteria set out in Diewert (1976) for a “superlative” price index—one
which provides a reasonable approximation to a true cost of living index.
16
   This “explicit quality adjustment” approach is used by BLS in their consumer price index for
smartphones. (See “Measuring Price Change in the CPI: Telephone hardware, calculators, and other
consumer information items,” available at https://www.bls.gov/cpi/factsheets/telephone-hardware.htm.)
17
   The BLS used this approach for the first time for their producer price index for semiconductors
beginning in 2018.

   Triplett (2006) notes these approaches are equivalent under fairly general conditions.


                                                                                                          13
where Pi,t is the price of smartphone i in period t, Xk,i,t is the value of characteristic or

performance metric k for smartphone i in quarter t (measured in logs or levels, as

appropriate), Di,t is a time dummy variable (fixed effect) that equals 1 if smartphone i is

observed in quarter t and zero otherwise, and ei,t is an error term.

         An often-cited concern with equation 1 is that the coefficients on the

characteristic or performance variables are constrained to remain constant over the full

sample period as discussed in Berndt (1991) and Pakes (2003). We mitigate this concern

by estimating each time dummy with a separate regression; that is, we estimate adjacent-

period regressions as discussed in Triplett (2006).19 Specifically, we estimate the

following regression for each overlapping two-quarter period:

         ln #$,& = ) +         , +, -,,$,&   + ./1 + 0$,&                         (2)

where Pi,t is a price observation for smartphone i in quarter t. The dummy variable D2

equals 1 if the price observation is in the second quarter of the two-quarter overlapping

period and 0 otherwise. In addition, we run weighted regressions, where observations are

weighted according to the share of revenue the models represent in the market during the

quarter when each price is observed. To construct a price index from this sequence of

regressions, we spliced together the percent changes implied by the estimated coefficients

on the D2 variables.20




19
   An alternative approach, advocated by Pakes (2003), is to run a separate regression for each period and
construct a price index using imputed prices for each period.
20
   We apply the adjustment suggested by van Dalen and Bode (2004) for adjacent-period regressions to
correct for bias introduced when going from the natural log of prices to price levels, which is based on the
standard error of the estimated coefficient on the second-period dummy. The adjustment reduces the
annual average rate of decline for our preferred index by 0.1 percentage point over the period of our study.


                                                                                                         14
4. Smartphone Price Indexes

Matched-Model

           Price indexes constructed using different formulas and specifications with the

IDC data are shown in table 2. As shown in line 1, the simple average price of

smartphones—with no quality adjustment—edged down about 1 percent per year on

average in the time period of our analysis, from the first quarter of 2010 to the first

quarter of 2018. Roughly speaking, there are two noticeable periods—prices moved up

through 2013, then fell, on balance, through 2017—a pattern visible in the quality-

adjusted price indexes as well. The trend in the unweighted Jevons index, line 2,

contrasts sharply with the path of average prices; the index falls 19 percent per year on

average. Line 3 reports results for the revenue-weighted Tornqvist index. Clearly,

weights matter a great deal for this market: the weighted index falls 10 percent per year

on average, a full 9 percentage points more slowly than the Jevons index. Numerically,

we attribute this difference to a prominent phone manufacturer which has a substantial

market share by revenue but releases relatively few phone models and consequently plays

a more important role in the Tornqvist index than it does in the Jevons index.21 Phone

models sold by this manufacturer have significantly slower price declines than those of

other producers, on average. Accordingly, we weight price observations in the hedonic

regressions we report below by model revenue for the relevant quarter.




21
     Our agreement with the data provider prevents us from disclosing the name of the manufacturer.


                                                                                                      15
Hedonic

        For our hedonic indexes, we first consider the simple, time-invariant specification

in equation (1), regressing (the natural log of) price on four continuous measures of

engineering capability (storage capacity, screen size, camera resolution, and processor

speed, all in natural log form) and an array of dummy variables.22 Specifically, we

include dummies for phone manufacturer (there are 43 in our dataset), for operating

system (there are 58 in our dataset, for example, “Android Froyo 2.2”), for

telecommunications generation (2G, 3G, 3.5G, 4G) and for input type (QWERTY

keyboard vs. touchscreen). We also include a dummy for models in their quarter of

introduction.

        Our rationale for including an introduction-quarter dummy is to account for price

variation over the model life-cycle that does not merit inclusion in measured quality-

adjusted price trends. In particular, prices paid when models are first introduced may be

affected by a number of factors that confound quality adjustment: When a model first

appears, the novelty of the item may lead select early-adopter consumers to pay a

premium for the item that does not persist over time.23 Alternately, the market may be in

disequilibrium at first in the sense that the “law of one price” does not hold and the new

item is sold at a lower quality-adjusted price than incumbent models (put another way,

the price of the old model does not fall enough to equilibrate to the price-performance


22
   We also experimented with including measures of smartphone performance from Passmark, following
the emphasis in Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel (2018) on using performance measures in hedonic regressions.
Our experimentation with a small set of models indicated that performance measures added relatively little
once a full set of characteristics were included. Though we plan to pursue the approach further in future
work, we did not do so in the current paper, and we do not report results from hedonic regressions using
performance measures.
23
   This phenomenon was first studied in Pashigian, P., B. Bowen, and E. Gould (1995) for the motor
vehicle market. See Aizcorbe, Bridgman, and Nalewaik (2009) and Williams and Sanger (2018) for more
recent discussions.


                                                                                                       16
ratio of the new model).24 Or, very early buyers may demand a discount in exchange for

bearing the burden of testing the new features of the phone.25 In addition, Apple

typically introduces new models in September—the third month of the third quarter—

implying that the average price observed in the IDC data for that quarter is not an average

of three full months of price history as for other quarters, and that difference may distort

estimates of the price change in the following quarter. Whatever the correct explanation,

we find that adding a dummy variable for the first quarter a model appears in the market

has a noteworthy impact on our results as discussed below.

            To recap, the first hedonic regression we report includes quarterly time dummies,

variables for engineering capability, dummy variables for manufacturer and operating

system, and a dummy for the quarter a model is introduced in the market. As shown on

line 4, the price index constructed by chaining the coefficients on the quarterly dummies

falls 19.6 percent per year, on average, from 2010Q1 to 2018Q1. The regression results

indicate this set of variables explains 83.9 percent of the variation in price.

           We next consider the impact of allowing the effect of these characteristics on

price to vary over time using the adjacent-quarter regressions in equation (2). For

example, a particular mobile telecommunications generation (2G, 3G, 4G) will represent

relatively high quality when first introduced and relatively low quality once the

succeeding generation enters the market. Thus, one might expect a positive coefficient

on 3G early in its life cycle and a negative coefficient once 4G phones are available.

Likewise, when phones with the Android Ice Cream Sandwich operating system

appeared, they commanded a premium over phones with Android Gingerbread, the

25
     We thank Erick Sanger for suggesting this explanation.


                                                                                            17
predecessor operating system; once its successor—Android Jelly Bean—appeared, Ice

Cream Sandwich phones sold at a discount. Dummies for these fine gradations of

operating system have the added appeal of serving as proxies for an array of small

features that are enabled by each operating system generation. This specification yields a

price index—reported on line 5—that falls 15.5 percent on average, appreciably slower

than the index derived from the regression with time-invariant coefficients. This set of

adjacent-quarter regressions explains 92.3 percent of price variation on average across the

time period, substantially more than in the time-invariant regression. For the reasons

discussed below, this is our preferred specification. And, in this specification, the

dummy for quarter of model introduction matters; when we exclude this dummy from

this specification, the aggregate price index falls 2.6 percentage points slower per year on

average.

       We also experimented with separate adjacent-quarter regressions for each of the

six phone manufacturers which accounted for 5 percent or more of the market by revenue

in at least one quarter (Apple, Blackberry, HTC, LG Electronics, Motorola, and

Samsung) and a seventh regression for the residual manufacturers. These separate

manufacturer regressions also introduce yet another form of flexibililty – characteristic

effects are permitted to vary across manufacturers. The resulting price indexes vary

tremendously across vendors, ranging from a 12 percent to 29 percent annual average

decline during 2010 to 2018. Aggregating these price indexes using revenue weights

yields a price index—shown on line 6—that falls 16.0 percent per year on average.

Because this rate of decline is roughly the same as that for the regression which pools




                                                                                            18
manufacturers—reported on line 5—and because the pooled price index is somewhat

more precise, we prefer the pooled regression shown on line 5.26

         Table 3 presents an overview of the regression results for our preferred

specification—the adjacent-quarter specification run with revenue-weighted

observations. As shown in the upper panel, individual adjacent-quarter regressions have

417 model observations on average, and no regression has fewer than 145 observations.

The regressions explain 92 percent of price variation on average, as measured by the r-

squared statistic, and no regression has an r-squared below 0.88.

         The middle panel highlights that, among the continuous performance variables,

internal storage and camera resolution are statistically significant as control variables at

the 10 percent level in 31 out of the 32 adjacent-quarter regressions. Screen size and

processor speed are significant in 25 and 23 out of the regressions, respectively. As

noted previously, in this hedonic approach, model characteristics are treated as control

variables and their estimated sign and magnitude are difficult to interpret.27 That being

said, we note that coefficients for all four of the performance variables are positive, both

on average as shown in the table, and in all cases where the coefficient estimate is

significant. The model-introduction quarter dummy variable discussed above is

significant in 19 of 32 regressions, negative on average, and negative in 14 of 19 cases

where the variable is significant.


26
   The regression which pools all manufacturers is more precise in the sense that 22 of 32 quarterly time
dummy coefficients are significantly different from zero at the 90 percent level in contrast to the
manufacturer-specific regressions, for which the number of significant time dummies ranges from 4 to 11.
Note that because our data covers the entire population of mobile phone models, p-values reflect population
dispersion, rather than sampling variation.
27
   Although the full vector of characteristics coefficients can be used to quality-adjust individual prices, we
view the common practice of informally considering coefficients on individual characteristics as implicit
prices as ill advised. Pakes (2003) notes that “the hedonic regression is a “reduced form,” that is, its
coefficients have no obvious interpretation in terms of economic primitives.”


                                                                                                           19
         The lower panel summarizes results for other discrete variables. In nearly all of

the regressions, at least one operating system and manufacturer dummy was significant—

28 and 30 cases, respectively. There are 54 distinct operating system versions in the data,

but only a handful are relevant in any particular adjacent-quarter regression.28 Although

on average, only 5.4 of these have significant coefficients in each regression, 39 of the 54

dummies are significant at least once. Similarly, 6.7 of the 41 manufacturer dummies are

significant on average. The dummy variables for input type and for mobile generation

play a role less frequently, with at least one of these dummies statistically significant in

12 and in 5 regressions respectively. To provide additional background on our results,

Table A1 in the Appendix shows complete regression results for two selected quarters for

our preferred specification.

         Bottom line: our preferred specification delivers a price index that falls at an

average annual rate of 15.5 percent from 2010:Q1 to 2018:Q1.

         We also created an index using the IDC data on feature phones (i.e. mobile

phones that aren’t smartphones). The database does not provide model-level information

for feature phones, but does allow us to construct a matched-model index using average

prices for narrowly defined groups of phones.29 Our feature phone price index falls at an

average annual rate of 18.5 percent during 2010 to 2018 as shown in a memo item in

table 2. We created a Fisher chain-aggregated index for all mobile phones using this

feature phone index and our hedonic smartphone index—also shown in the table—which

   The count of operating systems in our sample is 17 Android, 9 BlackBerry, 9 iOS, 8 Windows Mobile,
and 11 miscellaneous others.
29
   The characteristics used to define narrow our narrow groups of phones are manufacturer, form factor
(clamshell, bar, etc.), storage, generation, camera resolution, GPS capability, primary memory card, color
display, and input type (QWERTY, touchscreen, etc.).


                                                                                                         20
falls at an average annual rate of 16.6 percent. This rate of decline is similar, but 4

percentage points slower than that of the Byrne and Corrado index—reported in the

memo item in table 2—that currently is being used by the BEA for mobile phones. We

prefer our new index to the Byrne and Corrado index because the new index relies on

prices for new phones rather than used phones, draws on data with broader coverage, has

revenue weights, and uses quarterly rather than annual observations.


5. Allocation of PCE Spending Between Cellular Devices and Bundled Service
   Contracts

       An improved price index is useful for proper deflation of nominal spending on

mobile phones as recorded in PCE. However, in the NIPAs, nominal spending for

mobile phone purchases is not reported in a single category. Although the PCE category

“telephone and related communication equipment” includes purchases at retail outlets,

the bulk of mobile phones purchased in the past decade were obtained directly from

wireless carriers. Moreover, for reasons that we detail below, the value of those phones

ends up misreported in PCE for Cellular Telephone Services.

       In this section, we propose a method to identify the component of PCE for

Cellular Telephone Services that represents spending on mobile phones. Extracting this

component entails two corrections. First, we use data from the Census Bureau to identify

the upfront cost of phones paid by purchasers. As described below, this reported upfront

spending on phones does not represent the full cost if the phone was subsidized by the

service provider. Accordingly, our second correction makes a further adjustment to

account for these subsidies so that the full cost of the phone is captured as equipment

spending at the time of purchase. This method corrects the misallocation of some phone




                                                                                          21
purchases as services and thereby provides a way to apply the appropriate deflators to

each category of spending.



Accounting for the Upfront Cost of Phones

       There are two potential data sources that could be used to estimate the upfront

cost of phones (that currently is counted within the services category in PCE): both the

Census Bureau’s Service Annual Survey (SAS) and the quinquennial Economic Census

provide some information on the detail underlying the top line estimate for total revenues

of wireless service providers. In addition, because respondents to these surveys typically

follow the accounting rules that they use in their annual reports, annual reports contain

useful corroborating information. To sort through these accounting issues, we begin by

considering how some hypothetical transactions are recorded in the annual reports, the

SAS survey, and in the quinquennial Census.

       We illustrate the accounting underlying these transactions by considering four

ways that one could have acquired an Apple iPhone 3G at introduction. Our first

scenario considers a purchase of the phone at a subsidized price with a commitment to a

two-year service contract, and the second considers an outright purchase of the phone.

Apple’s initial announcement offered two prices: $199 if one was willing to commit to a

two-year contract with AT&T, and $499 if one did not commit to the contract. In these

types of contracts, the $199 was commonly referred to as the subsidized price to reflect

the fact that the service provider had held down the upfront cost of the phone. Because

the accounting convention used by service providers in their annual reports was to record

revenues as they were received, the cost of the phone (whether $199 or $499) was




                                                                                            22
recorded in the SAS and in company annual reports as equipment revenue in the year the

purchase was made.

        What about the monthly payments for wireless service in these two scenarios?

When consumers entered into (typically two-year) contracts with the carriers, the

providers would attempt to recoup the gap between the full and subsidized prices ($499

vs $199), by elevating the monthly amount paid for wireless service over the course of

the contract. In our example, suppose that this raised their monthly charge by $12.50 so

that consumers that signed a contract made (inflated) monthly service payments of

$62.50 for two years for services, whereas consumers that paid for the phone up front

only paid $50 per month for services.30

        The first two rows of table 4 compare how spending for equipment and services

would be recorded in each of these two scenarios. In service-provider annual reports, the

revenue recorded for those that paid the full cost of phone up front (line 2 of the table)

correctly includes the $499 for the phone as equipment and the monthly charges that only

cover services as service revenue. For those that sign a contract (line 1), providers

recorded part of the full cost of the phone—the upfront piece—as equipment revenue.

But a convention prevalent through the end of 2017 was to report the additional cost of

the phone paid in the elevated monthly service bill as service (not equipment) revenue.

So, in this example, the $12.50 boost to monthly service bills that covers the cost of the

phone is reported as revenue for services. That is, this practice would inappropriately

allocate revenues received for the phone as services. Moreover, it also affected the


30
  We assume the service provider recoups the unpaid portion of the non-contract price of the phone over
the duration of the service contract. The service provider may ultimately recover less (or more) than the
price for purchasing the phone outright (the IDC price) if, say, the price elasticity of demand differs
systematically between customers who pay the full price up front and those who do not.


                                                                                                        23
timing for recording the phone purchase: only the upfront cost was reported on the day

of the transaction, the other revenues collected over the service contract were spread over

the span of the contract.

         As shown in line 3, the accounting treatment when a consumer purchases the

phone though an installment plan is the same as when consumers pay the full cost of the

phone up front (line 2); the annual reports accurately exclude any payments for phones

from service revenues. Similarly, line 4 shows the case where consumers purchase their

phone at a retail outlet not affiliated with the carrier (like Best Buy) and sign up for

wireless services separately. Again, the service revenues reported by providers correctly

only includes consumer payments for the services; the purchase of the phone is recorded

separately in Best Buy’s financial statements.

         We confirmed that numbers reported in the annual reports lined up with those in

the SAS survey. In the annual reports, firms report revenues received from equipment

sales separately from service sales in a line item typically called “equipment revenue” in

their income statements. Similarly, in the SAS survey, detail on the sources of revenues

includes a line item called “Reselling services for telecomm equipment, retail” that gives

the dollar value of equipment sales as reported by the carriers.31 To see if these two

series are capturing the same spending, we compare the ratio of equipment to total

revenue in the annual reports to the ratio of SAS reselling revenues to total revenues. In

2012, for example, the ratios from the annual reports for the top four carriers, Verizon,




31
  The coverage of this line in the SAS survey is broader than we would like in that it includes sales to all
subscribers—not just consumers—and for all types of equipment—not just phones. We do not view the
product coverage issue as a big problem because most of this spending is on phones and carriers only more
recently began reselling tablets and other equipment.


                                                                                                         24
AT&T, Sprint and T-mobile, were either 10 percent or 11 percent. In the SAS survey,

the ratio of reselling revenues to total revenues was 11 percent that year.

       So, again, for purchases that involve a contract, the SAS survey reports the $199

upfront cost of the phone as equipment and all other payments received on a monthly

basis (including the part that covers the phone subsidy) as service revenue.

       As in the SAS survey, the top line revenue estimate for wireless service providers

in the Economic Census also includes revenues for equipment. However, unlike the SAS

survey, the Economic Census does not provide a separate line item that one could use to

split out the equipment revenue from the top line.

       This feature of the Economic Census, that all equipment revenue received by

wireless service providers is included as service revenue, has important implications for

nominal PCE because in Census years, the level of nominal PCE for wireless services is

set to match that in the Economic Census. Specifically, for Census years, BEA estimates

current dollars for this category by applying a commodity-flow method to total receipts

(business, consumer and exports) reported by wireless carriers in the Economic Census.

Those benchmarks are then extrapolated using data on receipts reported by wireless

carriers in the Service Annual Survey (SAS). Accordingly, the level of PCE for wireless

services includes all the revenues received for mobile phones that they sold to subscribers

(upfront and other).

        Correcting for this problem, however, turns out to be straightforward because of

the data described above from annual reports and the SAS survey that isolate the upfront

revenue received by service providers for equipment. The relevant calculations are

shown in Table 5. The top line shows current estimates of PCE for Cellular Telephone




                                                                                        25
Service. Lines 2 and 3 are from the SAS survey: total revenues and revenues from

reselling the phone equipment. The implied share of equipment to total revenue (line 4)

averages just over 13 percent in the period during 2010 to 2017; it increases steadily over

the period, rising from a bit over 9 percent in 2010 to 18 percent in 2017.



Adjusting for Subsidies (or “Discounts”) on Smartphones

        The more difficult problem is teasing out the part of monthly service payments

that represent phone purchases. To solve this problem, we combine the IDC price data

described above with additional price data from J.D. Power to estimate the

discounts/subsidies implicit in the upfront equipment revenue reported by providers. We

then use this ratio to form an adjustment factor to the share of equipment to total revenue

that we formed from the SAS survey. This adjustment effectively augments the upfront

revenues in the SAS data (the $199 in our example) to a non-contract purchase cost basis

(the $499).

        The IDC data we used above to estimate new price indexes provide average

selling prices of smartphones without any discounts (or subsidies). In contrast,

consumers surveyed by J.D. Power report the upfront price they paid for their

smartphones, net of discounts.32 Thus, a comparison of prices in the IDC and J.D. Power

datasets provides a reasonable gauge of the size of discounts. In our earlier example, IDC

dataset would record a price of $499 under all of the four transactions. In other words,

units sold with a service contract are recorded by IDC with a price that does not include



32
   The reported price in the J.D. Power data is the respondents’ answer to the question: “How much did
your current wireless phone cost, including any rebates or cash-back deals received? Your best estimate is
fine.” Thus, this price reflects any discounts or subsidies received by the consumer.


                                                                                                        26
any cross-subsidy between device and service plan. Note that if the carrier dropped the

no-contract price of the phone to $490 the following quarter, this price would be recorded

in the IDC database, even if the “marquee” price on the Apple website continued to be

$499.

        In contrast, the J.D. Power survey reports the upfront price. In our example,

prices for transactions that did not involve a contract would be the same as the IDC price,

$499. However, in the transaction with a 2-year plan commitment in our example,

respondents to the J.D. Power survey would (correctly) report they paid $199 and the

survey would record the price as $199. That is, the J.D. Power price is the upfront price

that nets out all discounts and subsidies. This difference in price concept allows us to

identify the discounts or subsidies that were an important feature of smartphone pricing.

Carriers began eliminating discounts in 2013 and, according to press reports, discounts

largely—though not entirely—were gone by the end of 2016 and finally disappeared by

2018 as consumers paid for the full price of smartphones up front or had an explicit

charge on their wireless bill for installment payments.

        To gauge the size of discounts or subsidies, figure 1 plots average smartphone

prices from both the IDC and J.D. Power data (which also are reported in table 6). By

average prices, we mean the average of reported prices in the datasets prior to any quality

adjustment. The difference in trends is stark. The IDC average prices are flat through

about 2013 around $500 per phone. Prices then drift down through 2016 before popping

back up in 2017 to $460 per phone. The average price in the J.D. Power data is about

$160 per phone from 2010 to 2012. In 2013, these prices then begin rising rapidly (right

around the time that plans with discounts were beginning to be removed) and by 2016




                                                                                           27
and 2017 were relatively close to the IDC average prices.33 Although a portion of the

difference in average prices between the datasets could reflect differences in coverage

(e.g. a small share of the price observations in the IDC dataset are for sales to business

customers), we believe that these differences largely reflect discounts or cross subsidies,

and these discounts amounted to about $300 per phone between 2010 and 2012.34 The

removal of these discounts thereafter led to a steep uptrend in average prices as

experienced by consumers beginning in 2013. And, to the extent that service providers

recaptured those discounts in the prices set for wireless service plans, a substantial

amount of spending recorded as for wireless service actually reflects payments for

devices.35

         To correct this understatement of equipment purchases, we use the ratio of IDC to

JDPOWER average prices (including “zero” price phones)—shown on line 5 of table 4—

as an adjustment factor to the equipment share of revenues reported in the SAS survey.36


33
   The line plotted in figure 1 includes all reported positive or zero prices. Table 4 also reports average
prices when observations with a reported price of zero are excluded.
34
   As further evidence of subsidies and their gradual disappearance, Verizon’s annual reports indicate that
their cost of purchasing wireless phones from manufacturers was twice the resale revenue of the equipment
reported in 2013 and 2014, when most subscribers had the upfront cost of the phone subsidized. As
consumers shifted away from traditional plans towards plans that required them to pay the full cost up
front, this gap between the reported equipment cost and resale revenues narrowed significantly: that ratio
dropped to 1.17 (from 2.0) by 2017, when the majority of subscribers were on plans that required that they
pay the full cost of the phone up front.

35
   That a large amount of equipment revenue from subsidized plans was actually reported as service
revenue by firms was highlighted by service providers when the shift from subsidized plans (with a lot of
equipment revenue recorded in services) towards no-subsidy plans (with no equipment revenue recorded
in services) lowered the service revenues that providers showed in their financial statements. The
declines were significant and required explanation. For example, Verizon’s 2015 annual report included
the following statement about the effect of increases in no-subsidy plans: “The increase in activations of
devices purchased under the Verizon device payment program has resulted in a relative shift of revenue
from service revenue to equipment revenue and caused a change in the timing of the recognition of
revenue. This shift in revenue was the result of recognizing a higher amount of equipment revenue at the
time of sale of devices under the device payment program.”

36
  One caveat to our results is that the adjustment factor is based on prices for smartphones, whereas the
spending is for all mobile phones.


                                                                                                            28
This ratio provides the key piece of information on the relationship between the recorded

out of pocket cost of a phone and the actual full cost. Specifically, we multiply the ratio

of average prices (shown in line 5) and the equipment share of revenues in line 4 to

obtain an adjusted share (line 6). That adjusted share averaged about 28 percent from

2010-2017, rising until 2012, then falling appreciably through 2017, as average phone

prices declined and an increasing share of phones were sold at retail outlets, for which

only the wireless services would be recorded in the SAS.

         We then use the adjusted share from line 6 to allocate spending for Cellular

Telephone Service (line 1) into phones and wireless services. As seen in lines 7 and 8,

our estimates suggest that a nontrivial share of what is reported as wireless services in

PCE represents revenues from equipment sales by carriers.



Real PCE Spending on Phones and Wireless Services

         Our derivation of the adjusted deflator and real PCE for spending currently

categorized as Cellular Telephone Services is shown in table 7. The new, adjusted index

requires expenditure and price indexes for the two components: phones and services.

Given the split derived above between phone and service revenues in the PCE Cellular

Telephone Services category (lines 1 and 2), we can deflate the phone component using

the new price index that we have developed and deflate the service spending using the

CPI currently used in the NIPAs, “wireless telephone services.”37



37
  We believe that falling constant-quality prices for the devices is not already captured by the matched-
model methodology used for the CPI for wireless telephone services because the price of service plans
collected for construction of the CPI do not vary depending on the device purchased by the customer. Note
that explicitly collected installment payments for devices are not included in the CPI for wireless telephone
services. (See https://www.bls.gov/cpi/factsheets/telecommunications.htm.)


                                                                                                          29
       Our mobile phone price index falls substantially faster than the CPI currently used

to deflate spending for mobile phone services; our phone index falls about 17 percent per

year, compared with an average 3-1/2 percent decline in the CPI deflator during 2010 to

2017. A new overall deflator calculated as a weighted average of the two indexes yields

a new index for Cellular Telephone Services (line 4) that falls about 4 percentage points

faster than the deflator currently used in the NIPAs (declines of 7.7 percent compared

with 3.5 percent). This difference in deflators translates directly into a mirror image

difference in real PCE growth for this category, implying about 4 percentage points of

additional real PCE growth when adjusted deflators are used (lines 7 to 9).

       For overall PCE, we note that nominal spending on Consumer Telephone Services

makes up around one percent of overall PCE over this period. Using this share, our new,

adjusted deflator for wireless services implies that the overall PCE deflator increased an

average of about 4 to 5 basis point less per year from 2010 to 2017, with a corresponding

boost to overall real PCE growth. Our results also imply a small offset of about 1 basis

point lower PCE growth from deflating the PCE spending on cell phones recorded in the

“telephone and related communication equipment” by our new deflator, which falls more

slowly than the price index currently used in the NIPAs.

        Although we do not provide estimates for earlier years, our best guess is that our

results do not imply greater acceleration of PCE. We have no reason to believe that the

share of telecom service provider revenue accounted for by reselling equipment was

different prior to the period of our analysis. And, Byrne and Corrado (2015) found that

mobile phone prices have declined at similar rates in the past.




                                                                                          30
5. Conclusion

       This paper addresses two problems related to the measurement of smartphones.

First, we develop new quality-adjusted price indexes for smartphones using data from

IDC that have not previously been used for this purpose. Our preferred index—a hedonic

index that allows coefficients on characteristics to change over time—falls at an annual

average rate of 16 percent from 2010 to 2018. Combining this hedonic with a matched

model index for feature phones yields a price index for mobile phones overall that falls at

an average rate of 17 percent. This rate of decline is close to, but about 4 percentage

points slower, that in Byrne and Corrado (2015) and to the index currently being used by

the Bureau of Economic Analysis since the Comprehensive Revision of the GDP

accounts in the summer of 2018.

       Second, we develop a methodology for disentangling and correctly allocating

spending on phones and wireless services when the two are bundled together, typically

with a discount on the upfront out-of-pocket cost of the phone in exchange for a

commitment to a multi-year service plan. This bundling causes measurement challenges

because the accounting conventions used by wireless service providers led to some

equipment purchases being counted as service revenues. We correct this misallocation

using detail in the Service Annual Survey. In addition, we use a comparison of price data

from IDC and J.D. Power adjust for the subsidies on phones that some purchasers

received in exchange for committing to a long-term contract for wireless service. With

these changes, the adjusted deflator for the PCE category Cellular Telephone Services

fell at an average annual rate of 7.7 percent during 2010 to 2017, about a 4 percentage

points faster decline than in currently published measures. Similarly, this adjustment




                                                                                          31
implies faster growth in this category of real PCE by about 4 percentage points. Given

the share of this category in overall PCE, our results imply 4 to 5 basis points faster

growth in overall real PCE over this period.

       Taken together, our results highlight the rapid decline in quality-adjusted prices

for products related to the digital economy and, by implication, continued rapid technical

advance in these products.

for 6 major manufacturers and a residual category. We apply to the results in lines 4 and 5 the adjustment suggested by van Dalen and Bode (2004) for adjacent-
period regressions to correct for bias introduced when going from the natural log of prices to price levels, which is based on the standard error of the estimated
coefficient on the second-period dummy. Average growth rates for Byrne/Corrado index extend through 2016. For the 2011-2016 period, the average growth
rate for the overall mobile phone price index developed in this paper is -18.2, roughly 4 percentage points slower than for the Byrne/Corrado index.
