                                      ABSTRACT



        This paper reconsiders the effects of taxation on risky assets,

recognizing the importance of variations in asset prices. We show that

earlier analyses which assumed that depreciation rates are constant and

that the   future price of capital goods is known with certainty   are very

misleading, as guides to the effects of corporate taxes. We then examine

the concept of economic depreciation in a      risky environment, and show that
depreciation allowances, if set ex—ante, should be adjusted to take account
of future asset price risk. Some empirical calculations suggest that
these   adjustments are large, and have important implications for the burdens
of,   and non—neutralities in, the corporate   income tax.

Introduction

        The enormous volatility in the prices of capital assets in the

American economy has been widely noted. The standard deviation of real

stock market returns appears to be about 20 percent per year. Over the

last 15 years the price of used capital goods as measured in the stock

market relative to consumption goods has varied by a factor of more than

two. Comparable volatility is observed in the pricing of used capital

goods such as airplanes and office building where an active second—hand

market exists. It seems clear that realistic positive or normative analysis

of the effects of capital income taxation requires models in which there Is

substantial scope for variation in the price of capital assets. Yet, the

substantial literature on capital income taxes and risk taking has focused

almost entirely on models where the return from capital goods is variable

but their relative price is certain.

        This paper reconsiders the effects of taxes on the return from

risky assets, recognizing the importance of variations in the price of

capital goods. The results suggest that the burden of the corporate income

tax is much greater than that implied by analyses such as Gordon (1981),

Stiglitz (1969) and Feldstein (1971), suggesting that it falls primarily

on the risk premium on corporate equity. The essential error in earlier

analyses is in the treatment of depreciation. The observations that capital

asset prices are far more volatile than earnings streams suggests that most

of the risk associated with capital assets is in their rate of economic

(though perhaps not physical) depreciation rather than in their contemporaneous

marginal product. The tax laws' use of ex ante depreciation schedules rather


                                       1
                                      2



than ex post depreciation means that depreciation or "capital" risk

is not shared by the tax collector. Therefore, a tax like the U.S.

corporate income tax absorbs a much greater part of the return than of

the risk on capital investments.

        The implications of capital risk for depreciation policy are then

considered. We argue that traditional concepts of what constitutes economic

depreciation are likely to lead to serious errors in realistic settings.

In particular, the notion which pervades theoretical and empirical work

on depreciation policy, that economic depreciation can be measured by the

expected decline in the price of capital assets, is shown to be wrong. We

derive a new measure of economic durability which can be calculated from

observable market data on asset rentals and prices, and use it as a bench-

mark for evaluating current tax policies.

        The implications of using this new measure of economic durability

for a number of tax policy questions is analyzed. Using two alternative

empirical methods based on financial market data, we show that prior calcu-

lations of appropriate economic depreciation represent serious underestimates

because of their failure to consider risk. We also show that proper risk

accounting suggests that previous calculations of effective tax rates are

very misleading, and that their implications for the problem of neutrality

between assets of different durability are not valid. A final implication

of the results is that true rates of economic depreciaton have increased

very substantially over the last decade due to increasing uncertainty.


        The first section of this paper examines the effects of capital

income taxes on investment within standard models where the price of capital

goods is known with certainty. A number of serious logical, and empirical

problems which arise in applying this analysis to actual corporate income taxes
                                      3




are then pointed out. The crucial distinction between accounting income

on which the corporate tax is levied, and real economic income which

includes capital gains and losses is emphasized. The second section shows

that these difficulties can be avoided by recognizing the distinction

between income and capital risk. The observation that most risk is of

the latter variety leads to a reconsideration of tax depreciation policy.

In the third Section our new economic durability measure is introduced,

and the concept of economic depreciation in a risky environment is analyzed.

The implications of the analysis for the evaluation of tax policy are taken

up in the fourth section. Empirical estimates based on financial market

data, suggesting the importance of taking account of asset price risk in

estimating rates of economic depreciation are also presented. A fifth

section of the paper summarizes the results and suggests direction for

subsequent theoretical and empirical research.

I. Taxes and Risk Taking When      Depreciation
    is Known with Certainty
           This section reviews previous results regarding the effects of

taxation on investment in risky assets. We show that the seemingly

paradoxical conclusion of much of this literature, that taxes on risky

assets actually encourage investment in them, is a consequence of the

fact that the claim taken by the government has a negligible or negative

market value. We then assess the relevance of standard models for the

problem of evaluating the effects of the U.S. corporate income tax.

The models are found wanting because of their failure to take account of

changes In the relative price of capital goods.

          We begin by considering a simple model of corporate investment

in a mean variance setting similar to the one employed in earlier work

on taxation and risk taking. While the model has only one period,

Hamilton's (1981) analysis suggests that results very similar to those

reported here could be obtained in the context of a continuous time

intertemporal capital asset pricing model. While the expected return from

risky assets is uncertain, we assume that their terminal price is known

with    certainty. This assumption (which we relax below) although implicit,

plays a crucial role in the analyses of the effects of taxes on risky

assets presented in Stiglitz (1969), Feldstein (1971) and Gordon (1981)

among    others.   For simplicity, we initially ignore inflation and personal

taxes.

          We assume that the perfect capital market assumptions necessary

for the validity of the Capital Asset Pricing Model1 are valid. In this

case, individuals are compensated for only the systematic risk which they
                                        5


bear. Diversifiable risk is not compensated so that private and social

risk are equal. This implies that there is no gain from risk spreading

through government taxation of risky assets. The private capital market

is able to accomplish all feasible risk sharing.2 In the context of the

Capital Asset Pricing Model in the absence of taxes, the corporate sector

will invest up to the point where:



(1.1)




where ft(K)e is the expected marginal product of capital, assumed to be

a declining function of K,    tS is the rate of geometric decay of capital

goods,3 r is the real interest rate, and a is the risk premium on corporate

sector investments. In the context of the CAPM, a
                                                         var(r
                                                                    •
                                                                      —
                                                                        r
where r is the excess rate of return on the market portfolio, and         is

its expected value. Note that because of the assumption of a constant

relative price of capital, no term reflecting capital gains or losses appears

in (1.1). This assumption is relaxed below.

        Now introduce a corporate income tax at rate T with full loss offsets

which allows depreciation deductions of 5K each period.4 Such a tax reduces

both the expected return and standard deviation of returns on corporate

investment by lOOT percent.

        Tobin (1958) effectively considers the case where government spending

is invariant to corporate tax collections, individuals consider government

debt part of net wealth, and the rate of return on the riskless asset is

zero. In this case risky investment rises to       times the level it was

before the tax, so that each investor has the same expected return and standard

deviation as before. The lOOT percent of the systematic risk on corporate

investment is effectively eliminated from the economy by the government's
                                         6



ability (by issuing government bonds when tax collections are low and

repurchasing the bonds when collections are high) to create new wealth

to offset any risk in tax collections.

        Stiglitz (1969) and Feldstein (1971) continue along the same vein

with models where the government is able to eliminate from the economy

any risk in tax collections. They consider the case where the riskless

rate exceeds zero. In their models, if a tax were levied strictly on the

risk premium (ct, or the actual return less riskless rate) the Tobin result

of risky investment rising to       of previous levels is attained. However,

if the tax is on the entire return to the risky asset the effect on risky

investment is ambiguous: If the risky asset earns the riskless rate

pre—tax it yields its owner a lower after—tax return than the riskiess

asset. This extra tax deters risky investment while the tax on the risk

premium encourages it.

        Gordon (1981) in his provocative analysis of the effects of the

corporate income tax assumes that all revenue risk is ultimately borne by

the private sector. In the Gordon model a tax on the risk premium is

non—distort ionary: unlike the earlier models, risky investment is unchanged

because after the tax is imposed in aggregate investors are still bearing

as much risk as they wanted to before the tax.

        If there is a tax   on the entire return the corporate income tax
reduces corporate capital accumulation. For example, in the case where

investor preferences were such that they demanded the same after—tax

capital market line (i.e. risk/return possibilities) as before the tax then

corporate investment would take place up to a point where:

        (1.2)    (1_T)(f(K)e_ )    =r   + a(1-T)

        Gordon points out that the change in the marginal product of corporate

capital caused by the imposition of the corporate tax is equal to:
                                       7




             (1.3)   tf'(K) =    r.
          Given the very low level of real interest rates available in the

American economy, this expression seems to imply that the corporate income

 tax has only a negligible impact on corporate investment.    Assuming a
two percent real interest rate and a Cobb—Douglas production function,

this expression implies that the corporate income tax reduces the size

of the capital stock by only about 13 percent.5 This low estimate is

obtained without considering the effects of accelerated depreciation,

the investment tax credit, the tax advantages of debt finance, or the

government's ability to spread risk. Introduction of these factors as

in Gordon and Fullerton (1981) could even lead to the conclusion that

the corporate income tax encourages corporate capital investment. One

paradoxical result that arises in this formulation is that the corporate

tax encourages investment despite the fact that It raises a significant

amount of revenue. The expected revenue yield from the corporate tax is
rK   (r+ ) which
                 may be quite large. Plausible American magnitudes    suggest
that expected annual tax revenues would represent about five percent of the

market value of capital stock.

         Gordon's provocative paper has several other striking implications.

It seems to imply that the corporate tax is very desirable, having little

effect on behavior but raising significant revenue. Equation (1.3) would

also seem to imply that changes in the tax treatment of the non—corporate

sector would have only small effects on the level of corporate investment,

unless the real after—tax interest rate was substantially altered.

Likewise, the results suggest that differences in the corporate tax rate

between sectors are unlikely to have important allocative effects.

         These results seem violently counterintuitive. How can a tax

which raises significant revenue encourage the activity which is being
                                  8




taxed? One way to examine this question is to look at the value of the

government's claim on the private sector. It is useful to begin with the

case where r — 0, and the corporate tax is totally non—distortionary.

In this case, the government's claim has a zero value. Any individual

investor can replicate it costlessly by borrowing and holding the risky

asset. The government's tax revenues are fair compensation for the

risk that it takes on, but no more. When an individual receives an

endowment of part of government revenues, it makes him no wealthier or

poorer, since he can costlessly restore his original risk—return

position. There is no free lunch here. The non—distortionary character

of the tax is a concomitant of its zero market value.

    What about the case where the government is able to reduce risk?

In this case, as Tobin (1958) and Stiglitz (1969) noted, the corporate

tax tends to encourage corporate investment. Unless bonds are net wealth,

this situation can only arise if private capital markets are imperfect

and so unable to fully diversify risk. By providing a valuabe diversification

service the government is able to increase the slope of the capital market

line faced by investors, even though expected revenues are positive. The

net effect can be an increase in risky investments. In this case, the

government is providing to taxpayers a form of insurance which is not

provided by the private sector.

        These results need to be modified slightly in the case where r

Is positive. The results just stated would then be valid for a tax which

had its base the excess return (f'(K) —   6   —   r)   on corporate capital.

As Mintz (1981) and others have observed, a tax on an asset's risk premium

has zero market value and no incentive effects.6 A standard corporate

income tax would then have an effect insofar as it fell on the certain

component of the return to corporate investment. The market value of the
                                     9



government's claim (for a given year) is .       In   this case where the

government's claim is positive, it does have some negative effect on

corporate investment.                                             -




        Introducing   inflation and personal taxes would not have any

substantial effect in the preceding conclusions. The corporate tax

in the foregoing analysis can be treated as an integrated tax including

the effects of dividend and capital gains taxes. Introducing inflation

would alter the conclusions slightly because of the taxation of nominal

as well as real capital gains and interest., However, Cordon's analysis

which includes both inflation and personal taxes reaches conclusions similar

to those obtained here. The introduction of risk into the models which

are normally used in public finance appears to have the dramatic implica-

tion that a corporate income tax has only very small allocative effects.

In the next section we show that this is a consequence of standard models'

failure to account for fluctuations in the relative price of capital goods.



II. Fluctuations in the Price of Capital Goods



         The foregoing discussion makes it clear that there are no free

lunches in corporate taxation. Only taxes which extract a claim of zero

value fail to discourage the taxed activity. In this section we examine

the applicability of analyses of the type reviewed in the previous section

to the U.S. corporate income tax. We conclude that they are net applicable

because the vast majority of the risk borne by corporate investors involves

capital gains and losses as the relative price of corporate capital goods

changes. The corporate income tax is levied on accounting income which

excludes these capital gains and losses. Hence it does not share in this

type of risk.
                                  10


       The implausibility of the standard framework's interpretation

of the corporate income tax is easily exhibited. If corporate capital

requires a significant risk premium, it follows that there must be a

sizable risk that the return from holding corporate capital is less

than the risk free rate. Otherwise, this asset would dominate the

safe asset. The earnings—price ratio measures the rate of return

investors would receive if the relative price of capital goods remained

constant as assumed in previous analysis of the effects of taxation on

risk taking. The lowest value of the earnings price ratio observed

since 1948 was 4.62 percent, far in excess of any estimate of the riskless

rate.7 An alternative way to view the problem is in terms of the after—tax

net marginal product of capital. Holland and Myers (1979) report that the

lowest value of this statistic was 3.6 percent in 1974. Many studies

have estimated the pre—tax marginal product of capital, and have found

that it consistently lies above eight percent. These figures imply that

if the relative price of capital goods were fixed, corporate investments

would dominate acquisitions of the safe asset. In order to make the same

point in yet another way, note that the real interest rate has averaged

close to zero. Yet, corporate tax collections have always been significantly

positive, implying that the tax base has always been significant and positive.

It seems clear that any effort to model taxes taking effect of risks borne

by investors .cannot tell a consistent story if the fiction that the relative

price of capital remains constant is maintained.8

        The importance of changes in the relative price of capital goods

may be seen directly in a rkumber of ways. At the aggregate level, the q

ratio of the market value of the corporate capital stock to an estimate of
                                  11


its "replacement cost" has varied between .56 and 1.24 over the past

20 years. This measure involves the ambiguous concept of the replacement

cost of capital. An alternative approach is through an examination of

the variance in stock market returns. Ibbotson and Sinquefeld (1979)

report that the standard deviation of annual stock market returns is about

20   percent. The standard deviation of the earnings price ratio is

less than three percent, and the standard deviation of the marginal product

of capital was less than two percent. This implies that variations in the

earnings price ratio accounts for between one and 17 percent of the variation

in stock market returns.9 It seems fair to conclude that most of the risk

borne by corporate investors is capital risk, involving changes in the price

of their asset rather than income risk, involving changes in the current

return on assets.

     The enormous volatility in the relative price of capital shows up clearly

in the markets for used capital goods. Table 1 presents some information

on the variability in depreciation rates, as inf erred from used car and

truck prices. The data are drawn from published guides to used asset prices,

and so undoubtedly understate the volatility of actual transactions prices.

Since they reflect nationwide averages, they also understate the extent of

uncertainty about the rate of decline in the price of any individual capital

good. Nonetheless, the data exhibit very significant year—to—year variations

in the rate of real price change. For example, the annual rate of real

price decline for two year—old Ford F600 trucks varied between 25.8 percent

in 1971 and 7.8 percent in 1976. Overall, for most models and vintages of

cars and trucks, the standard deviation of annual rates of real price decline

was between five and ten percent. It is reasonable to expect that because

 of their short lifetimes and easy reproducibility, used car and truck

 prices should be much less volatile than those of other capital assets.

        While data are not available on the rents earned by owners of

cars and trucks, it seems fair to conclude that most of the risk borne

by holders of these assets is capital risk involving changes in the price

rates than income risk involving changes in the current return. These

data corroborate the inference drawn from aggregate data that most of

the risk borne by corporate investors involves changes in the relative

price of corporate capital, rather than movements in the marginal

productivity of capital.


Income Risk vs. Capital Risk


     It will be useful in what follows to distinguish carefully between

income risk and capital risk. An investor demands a premium for holding

a risky asset both because the value of the rental services produced this

period are risky and because the asset's value at the end of the current

period is uncertain. More formally, the holding return on an asset is
         f    p
given by    + — . Income risk refers to the uncertainty in the first
         K K
term while capital risk refers to uncertainty in the second term.
        Assets with pure "income risk" would yield uncertain profits in

the current period but have a predetermined end—of—period market value.

For example, consider an asset that was always supplied perfectly

elastically at a price of p and exhibited no physical depreciation.

In equilibrium the asset would be supplied to the point where the expected

return would equal the riskiess rate plus any premium necessary to allow

for the fact that the current period's income was risky. The asset's

terminal value, will be p for certain, and therefore in a futures market

the owner could contract to sell the asset at the end of the period for

its expected terminal value of p* with no premium necessary for any

risk in the capital value.
                                  14


        A second type of asset may yield a current income that is predictable

with virtual certainty, but the asset's end—of—period value (the present

value of subsequent income) will fluctuate substantially. For example,

an investor who buys a long—term bond knows that at the end of the current

period he will receive a certain amount of income, but the capital value

of his bond may change dramatically because of changes in the interest

rate and changes in the probability that the bond issuer will be able to

make subsequent payments.

        For a capital asset, uncertainty about the current period's demand

curve and uncertainty about the cost of inputs in the current period cause

income risk. Uncertainty about future demand and input prices, plus a

less than perfectly elastic capital supply curve, enable asset prices to

fluctuate and cause capital risk. Sumiers (l981a, 198lb) shows how the

assumption of rational expectations can be used to model the evolution

of asset prices in a situation where the adjustment of the capital stock

is costly. The size of fluctuations in asset prices is negatively related

to the elasticity of supply of capital goods. Alternatively, and more

simply, there may be uncertainty about the rate at which an asset depreciates

physically or becomes obsolete.

        The distinction between income and capital risk is not of fundamental

economic significance, since it refers to forms rather than the size of real

economic returns. However, it is crucial to an analysis of a corporate income

tax like that in most countries which is levied on accounting measures of

income, rather than real economic income. Because accounting income excludes

capital gains and losses, the corporate income tax provides a much better

hedge against income risk than it does against capital risk. An extra dollar

in current income will yield something like an extra dollar in taxable profits.

Therefore, the government taxes a share equal to the tax rate in any
                                  15


unanticipated income gains or losses. This means that the government

takes an approximately equal share of risk and return so that the

preceding discussion of tax effects is applicable.

     Capital risk is another matter. Capital gains and losses on capital

are excluded from the tax base, except in the very rare case where they

are realized through the sale of used assets. The only allowance made

for changes in the value of capital goods is through certain p_re—determined

depreciation deductions. Therefore, the corporate income tax does not

shield taxpayers from any of the capital risk on their assets.

     It is tempting but unwise to think that the fact that taxes will be

levied on future corporate income reduces capital risk. The extent of

capital appreciation or depreciation depends on the percentage change in

the value of future rents. A proportional tax will reduce the variance

of absolute but not proportional changes in income.

     RealIstic analysis of the corporate income tax must distinguish

then between the taxes levied on accounting income, and capital gains and

losses. This leads immediately to consideration of the difference between

allowing ex—post depreciation based on actual market valuations of

capital goods, and ex—ante depreciation based on the expected decline in

a capital good's market value. The former procedure would hedge taxpayers

against capital risk, while the latter does not.



Economic Depreciation

     The issues involved in the distinction between income and capital risk

can be brought out most clearly by examining the polar case of a depreciating

asset that has only capital risk. The asset has an expected terminal value
                                    16


of 1—d times its original value. Holders of the asset require a risk

premium of , so in a no—tax world equilibrium would require investment

to the point where




(2.1)   f'(K)      r +   +a


        Note that we can use f'(K) rather than f(K)e: if an asset

has no income risk, its gross rentals for the current period can be

predicted exactly, even though its capital value (the present value

of future returns as of the end of the period) is uncertain.

        In this no—tax setting investors are receiving certain gross

rental income equal to r + + ci     times the initial value of the asset

plus a risky claim on the capital at the end of the period with an

expected value of 1—cS times the original value. The expected value

embodies a risk premium of a, however. If the investor went into the

futures market and agreed to sell his capital at a certain price at the

end of the period, he would only be able to negotiate a price of 1 —       —a

times the initial value. Such a transaction would lock in the safe rate

of return of r.

        With a tax, the value of economic depreciation deduction can be

calculated using similar analysis. Note that economic depreciation

deductions are just the capital losses on holding an asset. In the case

above, the firm has uncertain depreciation expected to amount to cS (the

asset is expected to decline in value to 1—6 times its initial value).

        The firm   would be equally happy locking in a certain decline in
asset value of 6 + a, thereby passing the risk of ownership to the party
                                             17


it made a futures contract with. That is, the firm is equally happy

with certain depreciation deductions of a + 6 as with the uncertain

economic depreciation deductions which are expected to be 5. This

result may     seem paradoxical as it implies that the certainty equivalent

of the stream of depreciation tax shields is less than their expected

value. The paradox is resolved by noting that the depreciation tax

shield is a'hegative 8"asset. When the market does well, depreciation

is low, and conversely when the marekt does poorly, depreciation is

substantial.

          Now, the effect of a corporate tax with ex post depreciation

deductions can be measured. The investor has a required certainty

equivalent rate of return, net of depreciation, of r. This return will

require



(2.2)     f'    —f-- + 6 + a
                l—r



          The actual expected after—tax rate of return is



(2.3)     (f' —   6)(1—i)   —   r + a(l—t)

while the certainty equivalent of the rents times 1—r (i.e., f'(l—r)) less the

certainty equivalent of the economic depreciation to be suffered times

l—T (i.e., (6+ci)(l—t)) equals r.

          In equation (2.3) we see that the investor only requires a risk

premium of a(1—T) because with ex post depreciation the government has

taken on lOOt percent of the risk. Comparing (2.2) and (Z.l) we can see
                                      18

that because of this risk sharing, the marginal product of capital in

the corporate sector need rise by only        r,   which is a small amount

given the typically low values cited for r.

        Expected tax revenues are quite large, however, equaling

    r + cii; The certainty equivalent of those revenues is only j- r

with the remainder being compensation for taking on risk at the market

price. Therefore, only j.i—   r   is added in to the required marginal product

of corporate capital. This is Gordon's argument reviewed in the first

section of the paper. It shows that Gordon         implicitly assumes that

capital gains and losses are included in the corporate tax base.

        However, corporate depreciation deductions do not vary with market

valuation of capital goods. Instead, firms receive depreciation deductions

according to a fixed depreciation schedule. Contrast the required pre—tax

marginal product of capital when investors receive certain depreciation

deductions equal to expected depreciation, with the required return when

economic depreciation is permitted. With fixed depreciation deductions,

the goverrment does not share in the risk associated with capital gaiis

and losses on asset holdings. Therefore, investors will require an after—

tax expected return that fully compensates them for all risk in holding

the asset.

        The firm receives certain deductions equal to expected depreciation

of 5. The value of the tax shield produced by those deductions is Sr.

Given that the government is not sharing in the deviations of capital values

from the expected values, investors will require an after—tax return of


(2.4) f'(l—i) + r r +         + ci
                                      19

Solving for f' yields



(2.5)     f' —   f— +   o   +



          Because   the government taxes the risk premium by setting taxes

on expected economic income, but does not share in the risk, investors

require a higher pre—tax return (comparing (2.5) with (2.2)) even though

expected tax payments are the same. The difference is very substantial.

Notice that (2.5) implies that (f' — 6)(l—T) =     r+   a   which exactly

parallels standard results in the certainty model.. Data on U.S. stock

and bond returns suggests that a = .06 so that the use of ex—ante rather

than ex—post depreciation schedules has very substantial effects. The

difference in the required pre—tax rate of return in (2.2) and (2.5) is

1—T'
       which equals the certainty equivalent increase in the tax liability

caused by using expected rather than economic depreciation.



III. Ex ante Economic Depreciation


Making Ex ante Depreciation as Favorable
as Ex post Depreciation

          We have shown that given an asset with expected one period economic

depreciation of 6 plus a risk premium entirely attributable to capital risk

of a an investor would value uncertain ex post depreciation deductions with

an expected value of 6 as much as certain deductions of 6 + a. This result

can be extended to calculate the entire cx ante depreciation schedule which

is as favorable as ex post depreciation. We derive the result below for

an asset with exponential expected depreciation, with all capital risk,

and with a constant risk premium of a. Generalization to non—exponential

depreciation and fluctuating capital risk premia is transparent.
                                   20


        For this analysis the fiction of the firm considering the

sale of its asset in the futures market is again instructive. Consider

an asset with an Initial value of 1, expected depreciation of 6, and

a required risk premium of a. Then the firm could lock in a sales price

for one period from now of 1 — 6— a. Equivalently, it is equally happy

with certain depreciation of 6 + a or uncertain economic depreciation with

an expected value of 6.

        Now consider what price could be received by agreeing to sell

the asset two periods from now. If the risk premium and expected depre-

ciation rate are constant, then the firm would be able to lock in a sales

price two periods from now of (1 —     6   —   a)2.    Equivalently, the firm is

equally happy taking economic depreciation in the second period or taking

certain depreciation of (1 — 6 —   a) — (1 —          6 —           (a+6)(l   —   6   —   a).
The analysis could be continued to show that the certainty equivalent of

the risky depreciation deductions in period t is (cz+6)(1 — 6 —                   a)t.
        To show that such certain depreciation is ex ante as favorable

as ex—post economic depreciation we verify that the required rate of return with

the proposed stream of certain deductions equals the required rate of

return with ex—post economic depreciation. In both cases we verify that

for a break—even investment f' j— + 6 + a, as in (2.2).

        For the proposed certain deductions the net present value of an extra

dollar invested in the asset, including risky cash flows and riskiess

depreciation allowances can be written as



              ft(K)(1T)(16)tl      +                (a+6)(la6)Tt          —
(2.6)
        t—l        (1+ a + r)                  t1           (l+r)
                                      21


       Equation (2.6) verifies that if .the marginal product of capital,

f'(K), equals ci + d +! the expected after—tax gross rents discounted

at the risky rate of a + r plus the certain depreciation tax shields

discounted at the riskless rate make the net present value of the investment

equal zero.

       With ex—post economic depreciation, we have



(2.7) v       =        ft(K)(l5)t(lT) + tt(l_)t        —
                  t1        (l+a(l—T) + r)t


In (2.7) the numerator is the firm's expected after—tax income in each

period while the denominator is the rate appropriate to discounting these

flows, given that the government has taken lOOt percent of the risk. As

in (2.6) the required rate of return, f'(K), pre—tax, to make the NPV equal

zero, is c + + .L_ —       just   as with the previously described certain deductions.



Ex ante Depreciation Rates as a
Measure of Economic Durability

       Numerous conmientators on depreciation policy (e.g., Hulten and Wykoff

[1981]) suggest the expected decline in the market value of an asset as a

proxy for economic depreciation. Our work indicates that a better measure

would be the expected depreciation rate plus the portion of the risk premium

attributable to capital risk.       (As indicated earlier, this is most of the

risk premium.)

       Incorporating the capital risk premium in the definition of ex ante

depreciation leads to a more satisfactory measure of "economic durability."

For example, other things held equal, a greater proportion of the purchase

price of a very risky asset will be for near—term cash flows than for a

less risky asset. Therefore, one would naturally tend to think of the
                                    22




 risky asset as economically less durable.

            Similarly, a change in the riskiess interest rate effects

 the value of a risky asset as though the risk premium were part of

 the depreciation rate: A one percentage point Increase in r decreases

 the present value of an exponentially depreciating constant risk

 premium asset by r-i-°-ct percent —     that   is, the "duration" of the

 asset is




IV.   Implications   for Tax Policy Analysis

         The foregoing analysis suggests that any realistic description

of depreciation must recognize its stochastic character. In this section,

we show how the concepts developed above can be used to produce empirical

estimates of what ax ante tax depreciation schedule is required to

correspond to ex—post depreciation. Some crude estimates based on market

data of the overall rate of depreciation of the capital stock are then

presented. These are compared with standard BEA estimates. Finally,

the implications of our results for the measurement of effective tax rates,

and for analyses of the effects of taxation of the choice between assets

with differing durability are then considered.

        We continue to rely on the approximation that all risk is capital

risk. In this case the previous discussion demonstrated that it is

appropriate to add the asset's risk premium to its expected rate of physical

depreciation in order to determine the appropriate rate of ex—ante

depreciation. This suggests one empirical method of deriving estimates of

appropriate depreciation schedules. If data on a time series of used asset

prices can be obtained, and if the assumptions of the capital asset pricing

model are accepted, the economic depreciation rate for an asset can be
                                            23


estimated as:            -




(4.1)    I
        d*
                 i
                     + 8 (R —
                       i m      R
                                    f
                                        )




where        Is the rate of ex—ante depreciation which is the certainty

equivalent of ex—post depreciation, 6 is the expected rate of depreciation,

8 is the asset's beta, R is the return on the market, and R is the
 i                              m                                        f

riskiess rate.

        Unfortunately, we are unaware of any data set extensive enough

to permit estimation of B for any type of used assets. Therefore, it is

difficult to use (4.1) as a basis for deriving estimates of economic

depreciation for paticular types of capital assets. However, it is possible

to use (4.1) to make an approximate estimate of the depreciation rate on
                                                 e
the total capital stock. Estimates of                prepared by the BEA for the

National Income and Product Accounts imply an average depreciation rate

of 10.5 percent for the non—financial corporate equipment and structures

in 1979. Hulten and Wykoff (1981) obtained lower estimates using

data on used asset prices. If it is assumed that the risk characteristics

of corporate capital are like those of unlevered equity, the second term

in (4.1) Is equal to about six percent. Ibbotson and Sinquefeld (1979)

report that the risk premium on the stock market,              —
                                                                   Rf has averaged
about nine percent over the last 50 years. The six percent figure is

obtained by assuming a debt—to—market value of equity ratio of one—half

as implied by statistics reported in Gordon and Malkiel (1981).

        This calculation illustrates that taking account of risk has

important implications. These estimates suggest that it raises the appropriate
                                    24


average ex—ante rate of depreciation from 10 to 16 percent. Stated

differently, if double declining balance depreciation is assumed, our

risk adjustment reduces the appropriate average tax lives from 20 to

13 years.

        There is an alternative way of calculating the appropriate ex—ante

depreciation rate on assets. Equation (1.1) implies that in the absence

of taxation investment will take place up to the point where



(4.2)




where       is the price of capital goods. This suggests the appropriate

rate of ex—ante depreciation on an asset (5e+) can be estimated as:



(4.3)




That is, the appropriate rate of ex—ante depreciation for an asset is

given by the difference between its rental price ratio and the risk free

rate.11 The analysis is more complex in the presence of taxation since

part of the value of a capital asset represents the present value of the

depreciation tax shields which it carries. We illustrate this below when

a generalization of (4.3) is used to calculate the depreciation rate on

the aggregate capital stock. Data on rental price ratios for different

capital assets are not readily available. Gordon (1979) estimates rental

price ratios of close to 25 percent implying depreciation rates of

approximately 22 percent on airplanes. This compares to the BEA rate of

7.5 percent and an estimate of 18.3 percent by Hulten and Wykoff (1981).
                                    25



A common rule of thumb in real estate is that properties sell for 100

months rent. This implies according to (4.3) a depreciation rate of

six percent assuming that cash expenses including property taxes plus

the riskiess interest rate add to six percent. The National Incoie

Accounts use a much smaller depreciation rate. These examples provide

further evidence that current measures of economic depreciation do not

provide a good guide to appropriate tax policy, if emulating the effects

of ex—post depreciation is the desideratum.

         For the economy as a whole, we can make some calculations as to

the adequacy of depreciation deductions. We can write the market value

of the corporate sector as



(44)



where

        MVt — market value of corporate sector at time t

               present value of after—tax cash flows if no future

               depreciation were allowed

        Bt     present value of depreciation tax shields (equals tax

               rate times present value of depreciation deductions).

We also have




(4.5) R(l+r+cz) C + E(R1)


(4.6) E(R+i) R(l_e)

where

        C after—tax cash flows produced in period t, less the

             tax savings due to depreciation in the period.
                                      26


       That is, (4.5) says that including the cash payout C and the

expected terminal value of the capital E(R+i), the investor must have

an expected return of r+ct. Equation (4.6) simply defines the expected

depreciation rate as

       Combining (4.4), (4.5), and (4.6) yields



(4.7) e                    -   r
                       B
where          j   our measure of certainty equivalent economic depreciation.

Formula (4.7) allows us to use aggregate data to estimate what we call

ex—ante depreciation.

        Table 2 shows the ex—post, ex—ante, and National Income Accounts

depreciation rates for the years 1950—79. The ex—post depreciation

rate is meant to measure the percentage decrease in the real market

value of corporate physical assets that were held at the beginning of

the year. The ex—post rate was calculated as gross investment in physical

assets by non—financial corporations, taken from the National Balance

Sheets, less the increase In the real market value of physical corporate

assets. For any given year, the market value of physical corporate assets

was   taken   by adding the market value of NFC equity plus short—term and

long term debt, and subtracting financial assets. The market value of

short—term debt and the value of financial assets come from the National

Balance Sheets; the market value of long term debt is from Bulow and

Shoven (1981), who took the national balance sheet numbers and multiplied

by the ratio of market to book value of New York Stock Exchange bonds.

To calculate the increase in the real market value of physical assets in

year    t, the market value at the end of year t was reduced by the market
                                27



value at the end of t—l, times one plus the inflation rate for year t

as measured by the GNP deflator. The ex—post depreciation rate,

reported in the table, was calculated as the depreciation number derived

above divided by the market value of physical assets at the end of the

prior year, times one plus the inflation rate.

        Ex—ante physical depreciation was calculated using (4.7). It

is the after—tax cash flow less the value of depreciation tax shields for

a given year, C, divided by the market value of physical assets at the end

of the prior year, MV, (calculated above), less the present value of all

future depreciation deductions, B. C was calculated using data from the

Economic Report of the President, 1982. The formula used was corporate

profits plus capital consumption allowance with capital consumption adjustment,

plus net interest, minus corporate profits taxes, minus .48 times the

sum of NIA capital consumption allowance and the capital consumption

adjustment (the latter usually a negative number).

        B was computed by taking B/pK from Summers (1981) and multiplying

by the sum of the current cost value of inventories plus property,

plant, and equipment from the National Balance Sheets. The ex—ante
                                      C
depreciation rate was calculated as         less the riski.ess interest
                                          B
rate, calculated by subtracting the inflation rate from the average three—

month Treasury bill rate.

        Finally, NIA depreciation rates were calculated by dividing NIA

depreciation by the current cost value of all NFC tangible assets at the

end of the year, as reported in the National Balance Sheets.

       In the table we present some data on depreciation at   the   aggregate

level. Since the estimates are derived from market data, they pertain

to all the assets of the corporate sector, not only those normally treated

as depreciable. These include land and inventories, which are normally
                          28.

treated as having a zero depreciation rate, and account for about a

third percent of non—financial corporate tangible assets based on infor—

tnation in the National Balance Sheets. This means that the NIA depreciation

figures we report are roughly a third percent lower than the composite

rate on equipment and structures.

          Broadly, the results corroborate the calculations presented so

far. The mean ex—post depreciation rate is 7.5 which is quite close to

the standard estimates of the rate of depreciation. It is extremely

volatile ranging from 43.7 to —      27.2.   The mean ex—ante depreciation rate

is 13.0 reflecting its inicusion of the risk premium.

          Including the recent Hulten and Wykoff (1981) used asset price

depreciation estimates we now have four alternative measures of depreciation.

The highest estimate is ex—ante depreciation of 13.0 percent. This number

is much higher than the ex—post rate of 7.5 percent. By contrast, both

the NIA and Hulten & Wykoff estimates are significantly lower than the

ex—post rate. The NIA rate is 6.3 percent, while Hulten & Wykoff are

roughly 20 percent below the NIA estimates for 1949—74.

         The 5.5 percentage point differential between ex—ante and ex—post

depreciation     is remarkably in line ith our prediction. Recall that with
a risk premium on the market of 9.0 percent and a debt/equity ratio in the
corporate sector of      we   predict a 6.0 percent differential. Of course
estimates   of   the market risk premium include data   from 1950—79.   Nevertheless,
it   is of note that two alternative empirical methodologies of estimating

the difference between ex—ante and ex—post depreciation give virtually

the same answer.

         The most striking feature of the data is the increase in the ex—ante

rate of depreciation during the last decade. It averaged 7.8 between 1970

and 1974 and 15.4 between 1975 and 1979. This increase reflects the
                                       30



increased relative price uncertainty in the economy in three ways: first,

the increased risk may have led to increased expected returns and higher

risk premia. Second, increased relative price uncertainty increases the

expected decline in an asset's price because the investor is likely to

have made a more costly deviation from the expost optimal choice of

asset production techniques. Therefore, even if investors were risk

neutral they would require higher rental price ratios because of increased

expected economic depreciation. Third, the increased uncertainty about

relative prices could have led firms to invest in less durable assets——

particularly in the period right after the 1973—74 oil crisis when, with

new information coming in rapidly, firms were no doubt leery of committing

money to durable irreversible projects. For an excellent analysis and

discussion of these Issues see Bernanke (1982).

         Using the approach developed here to examine the effective tax rate

on capital income in the U.S. is beyond the scope of this paper. The

data do appear to indicate that current depreciation allowances are much

less adequate than is usually assumed.

               The importance of the effects considered here, and their implications

for the issue of neutrality can be examined by reconsidering standard

calculations of effective tax rates. Standard procedures include calculating

the expression:



               e   R-s
 (4.8)     r
                   —-

where 1e is the effective tax rate on a project, R. is its pre—tax internal

rate of return and s is its post—tax required internal rate of return.

Consider investing in a project which is all, equity financed, has a

marginal product of capital of f'(K), expected depreciation           and a required
                                          31


 return of r+a where a is the risk premium. Assume depreciation at rate

 is permitted by pre—tax law. Equation (1.2) holds that equilibrium requires

 that the condition (l—t)(f'(K)—)               cz+r hold. This implies that the

 standard calculation of an effective tax rate would yield



 (4.9)




 Now our analysis suggests that it would be more correct to use risk adjusted

 rates of return in calculating effective tax rates. Reinterpreting R and s

 as the risk adjusted rate of return yields:


              a+r
          e   l—t               r(cz+r)
(4.10) T
               ——a
                1—i
                                ra+r


As long as a > 0 the risk adjusted effective tax rate exceeds the

unadjusted rate. To see the importance of the risk adjustment, suppose

that a   .06 and r —   .02,   and r —     .5.   Standard effective tax rate

calculations would yield 1e — .5 while our procedure yields t              .80.
Thus the use of misleading measures of economic depreciation can lead

to serious underestimates at the burden of capital income taxation.

         Equation (4.10) also suggests that if tax depreciation is economic

in the conventional sense, the tax system will be biased against risky

(high ci) assets. These assets are likely to be ones which are long lived

since their greater durability causes their values to be more sensitive

to interest rate changes and new information. They are also likely to be

assets whose supply is relatively inelastic. Note also that if depreciation

allowances were allowed at exponential rate 5e4 e would equal r.
                                    32



          Finally, observe that the understatement of depreciation will be

greatest for long lived assets. Land, for example, has   a   (S <   0.   Our

work shows, however, that land should be depreciated. In general,

will be greatest for long lived assets. We believe that the risk effects

are sufficiently !inportant that calculations which ignore them such as

those presented in Jorgenson and Sullivan (1981) are likely to be very

misleading. In future work, we hope to use data on used asset prices and

rents to estimate appropriate ex—ante depreciation rates for different

assets.



V. Conclusions

          This research echoes, for problems involving risk, the argument

of Summers (l98lb) that analyses of the effects of capital taxation must

recognize the importance of fluctuations in capital asset prices. We

argue that most of the risk borne by owners of corporate capital pertains

not to the current rentals which are hedged by the corporate income tax,

but to changes in the relative price of these assets which are not hedged

because the tax is levied on accounting income. This means that the tax

takes a much larger fraction of the return than it takes of the risk on

corporate investments.

          We then analyze the role of tax depreciation recognizing that

there is substantial volatility in the rates at which capital assets lose

their value. The tax system as currently set up relies on ex—ante depreciation

allowances rather than actual ex—post measures of depreciation and so does

not share in the associated risk. We show that in a stochastic environment

the natural counterpart to economic depreciation involves allowing ex—ante
                                       33



 depreciation at a rate faster than the expected decline in asset values.

 More precisely if depreciation allowances are to compensate investors

 for the risks they bear, the portion of the risk premium in the asset's

 expected   return that is attributable to "capital risk" (asset price
 fluctuation) must be added to expected depreciation.
         Our empirical analysis reveals that this adjustment is of substantial
 importance.    Using two alternative methodologies both based on financial

market data we conclude that the appropriate rate of ex—ante depreciation

to allow in the U.S. non—financial corporate sector is approximately twice

that implied by data in the National Income Accounts. This suggests that

many previous analyses have significantly understated the burden of taxes

on corporate capital. It also suggests the need for further work in

order to assess possible non—neutralities between assets of different

durability and with different risk characteristics.

        The research in this paper could be extended in a number of directions.

The current analysis has ignored considerations of personal income taxation

and corporate financial policy. We have not yet attempted an analysis

of optimal taxation in the presence of capital risk. Such an analysis

would need to recognize that the prices of inelastically supplied assets

are likely to be more volatile than the prices of more elastically supplied

assets. We hope to follow the valuable work of Hulten and Wykoff (1981)

in using data on used asset prices, in conjunction with rental price data

to derive depreciation rates on different types of assets.

        Our    analysis   also has implication for work on tax reform. The

scheme we propose of allowing ex—ante depreciation deductions at a rate

which compensates investors for the risks they bear is one of a number

of equivalent types of tax reform. Similar goals could be achieved by
                                   34




including cpaital gains and losses, as measured on the stock market,

in the corporate income tax. Alternatively, a tax on the net worth

of the corporate sector could be employed. In the framework considered

here, these tax schemes would be very similar. In the context of richer

models there would be important differences which seem worthy of study.

        The analysis here also has important implications for research

on investment. The rate of ex—ante economic depreciation appears in

standard expressions for the cost of capital. Our calculations show

that rate increased substantially during the 1970's. This suggests a

possible explanation for the sharp decline in net investment which has

been observed during the 1970's.

1. These include the absence of transactions costs, limitations on short

    selling, homogeneous expectations, the existence of a safe asset,

    and competitive behavior.

2. If these assumptions are not satisfied, the government can increase

    welfare by serving as a financial intermediary. However, i.E there

    are economic reasons for the non—existence of markets, such as moral

    hazard problems, there is no presumption that tax policy can increase

    welfare.

3. Note that the gross marginal product of capital is f'(K) while the

    net product is f'(K) — 5.    The depreciation assumption implies that

    the value of a capital good declines by the factor (1—IS) each period.

4. This corresponds to standard concepts of economic depreciation in a

    certainty setting.

5. This calculation assumes that the pre—tax gross marginal product of

   capital is .20, and the aggregate production function of the corporate

   sector is Cobb—Douglas with a capital share of .25. It is also assumed

   that labor is supplied inelastically to the corporate sector.

6. This is because the government's claim can be costlessly replicated

   by bargaining at the riskiess rate to buy equity. The argument is

   the same as that presented above.

7. Similar conclusions can be obtained using the inflation—adjusted

   earnings price ratios described in Summers (1981b).

 8. There is a remote possibility of a "peso" problem,   where the market
     risk premium reflects a low probability disaster which has not yet

     taken place. Such a disaster would surely involve a change in the

    relative price of capital goods, as discussed below.

 9. The range reflects ambiguity in the allocation of the covariance

    term, and the choice of concept. Note that since much of the

    variation in earnings—price ratios, and marginal products of capital

    is forecastable, these figures overstate the extent of income risk.

10. This conclusion needs to be modified slightly because of personal

    taxation of capital gains. However, these taxes are levied at very

    low effective rates because of the advantages of deferral and the

    absence of constructive realization.

11. Note that if a —        — Rf) this equation is equivalent to (4.1).
