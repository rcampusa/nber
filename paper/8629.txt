                                               ABSTRACT


        As the exchange rate, foreign demand, production costs and export promotion policies evolve,
manufacturing firms are continually faced with two issues: Whether to be an exporter, and if so, how
much to export. We develop a dynamic structural model of export supply that characterizes these two
decisions and estimate the model using plant-level panel data on Colombian chemical producers. The
model embodies uncertainty, plant-level heterogeneity in export profits, and sunk entry costs for plants
breaking into foreign markets. Our estimates, and the simulation exercises that they support, yield several
implications. First, entry costs are typically large, but vary greatly across producers. Second, there is
substantial cross-plant heterogeneity in gross expected export profit streams. Third, these large entry costs
make expectations about future exporting conditions important for many producers, so changes in the
exchange rate regime that are credible induce much more entry than those that are not. Fourth, however,
most of the entry and exit takes place among marginal exporters who contribute little to aggregate export
revenues. Finally, subsidies on export earnings have a much larger impact on export revenues (per dollar
spent) than subsidies that reduce the entry costs faced by new exporters.

1.      Overview

        In developing countries, manufacturing sectors that respond to export stimuli are highly

prized. By making greater imports feasible, these sectors help to generate the traditional gains

from trade. They also stabilize domestic employment by venting surplus production in foreign

markets, and they may even generate efficiency gains through trade-related technology diffusion

(e.g., Westphal, 2001). But export supply responses are poorly understood. Seemingly similar

stimuli have given rise to very different export responses in different countries and time periods,

making it difficult to know whether the next devaluation or export subsidy scheme will generate a

surge or a trickle of new exports.

        Several micro explanations might account for the puzzle of export responsiveness. First, a

strong export response may require the entry of non-exporters into foreign markets. But to break

into foreign markets, firms must establish marketing channels, learn bureaucratic procedures, and

develop new packaging or product varieties. In the presence of these entry costs, expectations

about future market conditions can critically affect current behavior, and doubts about the

permanence of export promotion packages may discourage foreign market entry.1

        Second, entry costs make firms’ export supply responses dependent upon their previous

exporting status. Firms that already export can adjust their volumes at marginal production costs,

while those that do not must bear the sunk costs of breaking in before any exports are possible.

These two margins of adjustment—volume and entry—have distinct determinants and lead to

different supply elasticities, so seemingly similar industries with different degrees of foreign

market presence may respond quite differently to exporting stimuli.


        1
          Start-up costs are the focus of the analytical literature on export hysteresis (Baldwin and Krugman,
1989; Dixit, 1989; Krugman, 1989).

                                                        1
       Finally, even within narrowly-defined industries, firms are heterogeneous in terms of their

production costs and their product characteristics. Depending upon the distribution of these

characteristics across firms, there may be many firms poised on the brink of foreign market entry,

or just a few. Thus, when these cross-plant distributions of marginal cost and foreign demand are

unobservable, widely different export responses are possible under seemingly similar conditions.

       In this paper we develop a dynamic optimizing model of export supply that captures each

of these micro phenomena, and we econometrically fit the model to plant-level panel data on

Colombian producers of industrial chemicals. We use our estimates to simulate export responses

to a shift in the mean of the exchange rate process. In doing so we quantify the roles of sunk

costs, exporting experience and firm heterogeneity in shaping export responsiveness. We also

demonstrate a methodology that should be relevant for other applications involving firms’

decisions to diversify into new geographic or product markets.

       Our estimates imply that entry costs are large and variable across plants. Further, we find a

great deal of cross-plant heterogeneity in gross exporting profits. Most producers anticipate only

very modest profits from exporting, while a handful enjoys far more favorable foreign demand

and/or marginal cost conditions.

       These features of the Colombian chemical industry shape the results of our policy

simulations. First, the fact that sunk entry costs are large makes expectations about future

exporting conditions important for many plants. Thus we find that a moderate shift in the mean of

the log exchange rate process induces sustained net entry by new exporters and rising export

volumes if producers view it as a credible regime shift. On the other hand, the exact same change

in the exchange rate process induces far less entry when producers retain their old beliefs about



                                                 2
the exchange rate process.

        Second, profits for the major exporters are sufficiently large to keep them in the export

market under any reasonable policy scenario. So the foreign market entry and exit that takes place

is concentrated among small suppliers who have a relatively minor effect on export volumes. It

follows that, while expectations have a dramatic effect on the number of exporters, their effect on

the volume of exports is much more modest.

        Third, policies that promote exports through per-unit subsidies generate far larger

responses per peso spent than policies that promote exports through lump-sum transfers for new

exporters. The reasons are that (1) exporters that need a subsidy to get into export markets are

almost always marginal suppliers; (2) these same exporters face relatively high entry costs, and (3)

large incumbent exporters, who account for most of the industry’s foreign sales are unaffected by

entry subsidies, but positively affected by volume subsidies.

        Finally, because of the cross-plant heterogeneity in our data, our simulations imply

diminishing returns to sunk or fixed cost subsidies in terms of export revenues generated per peso

spent. This is because, as subsidy rates rise, entrants at the margin are increasingly less suited to

exporting and sell increasingly little abroad.

        In addition to quantifying the micro phenomena behind export responses, our model of

exporting behavior makes several methodological contributions. First, because we use a dynamic

structural framework, we are able to estimate sunk costs in dollars rather than simply test for their

existence.2 These costs are critical to policy evaluation but they have rarely been estimated



        2
          Earlier studies of export market participation have focused on the null hypothesis that sunk costs don’t
matter, but have not been structural and thus have not quantified sunk costs (Roberts and Tybout, 1997a; Campa,
1998; Bernard and Jensen, 2001; Bernard and Wagner, 2001).

                                                         3
because they can only be identified by their very non-linear effects on market participation

patterns. Second, although we model producers as choosing foreign prices and export quantities,

we cast the estimating equations in terms of the variables that we actually observe—export

revenues and variable costs. We thus sidestep the usual problem that arises with plant-level

survey data of constructing proxies for prices and quantities from poorly measured variables.

       The remainder of the paper has four sections. Section 2 develops an dynamic empirical

model of both the plant’s discrete decision to participate in the export market and it’s continuous

decision on the level of export revenue. Section 3 discusses econometric issues. Section 4

presents empirical results and section 5 discusses their implications for export supply response.

Finally, section 6 offers concluding remarks.



2.     An Empirical Model of Exporting Decisions with Sunk Costs and Heterogeneity

       Our model of export supply is based on several key assumptions. First, products are

differentiated across firms, and the foreign and domestic market for each is monopolistically

competitive. This eliminates strategic competition, but it ensures that each firm faces a

downward-sloping marginal revenue function in each market. Second, producers are

heterogeneous in terms of their marginal production costs and the foreign demand schedules they

face for their products, so export profit trajectories vary across firms. Third, future realizations on

the exchange rates, marginal costs, and foreign demand shifters are unknown, but each evolves

according to a known Markov process. Fourth, firms must pay stochastic sunk start-up costs to

initiate exports. Finally, marginal costs do not respond to output shocks. This assumption implies

that shocks that shift the domestic demand schedule do not affect the optimal level of exports, so



                                                  4
it allows us to focus on the export market only.3



2.1      Gross export profits and revenues

         We begin by characterizing the export profit stream that firms earn once they have broken

into foreign markets. The magnitude of this stream depends upon things that shift the marginal

cost schedule, like technology shocks and factor prices, and things that shift the foreign demand

schedule, like foreign aggregate demand and the real exchange rate. We assume that marginal

costs and foreign demand are Cobb-Douglas functions of these factors, so that gross export

profits are log-linear in the same set of arguments:

                                      ln(Bit)   ' R0 zi % R1 et % R2 t % <it                                           (1)


Here    it   is firm i’s gross operating profits in the export market during year t (i = 1, . . . n; t =1, . .

., T), zi is a vector of time-invariant, firm-specific characteristics that lead to differences in

marginal costs and product desirability, et is the log of the real exchange rate and t is a time trend

that captures secular trends in factor prices, technical efficiency and foreign demand that are

general to all firms.4 Finally, vit is a stationary, serially-correlated disturbance term that captures

all idiosyncratic shocks to foreign demand and marginal production costs.

         Controlling for the trend, export profits evolve over time with exogenous shocks to et and

vit . We assume that the exchange rate follows a first-order Markov process with normally

distributed shocks and we collect the parameters that characterize this process in the parameter

         3
          The assumption appears to be reasonable for the industry, country, and time period we will study, since
some excess capacity was present. Estimates of average variable cost functions revealed little dependence on
within-plant temporal output fluctuations.
         4
           Some characteristics, such as domestic market size or capital stock, do change over time but including these as
time-varying state variables requires an increase in the complexity of the model that makes it intractable.

                                                            5
vector       e.   Because the profit function disturbance, vit , picks up unobserved shocks on both the

demand and the cost side, it requires a less restrictive specification. To allow for multiple sources

of shocks while keeping firms’ dynamic optimization problems tractable, we assume that vit can

be represented as the sum of m normally-distributed, first-order Markov processes, which we

collect in the vector xit = ( xit1 , xit2 ,   K, x )’.
                                                   m
                                                   it
                                                            5
                                                                This assumption implies that vit is normal and has a

stationary ARMA(m, m-1) representation. We collect the parameters that characterize the

distribution of xit and vit in the vector          x.

         Our data set includes information on export revenues but not on export profits, so we

cannot estimate Ψ = ( ψ 0 , ψ 1 , ψ 2 ) and             x   directly from equation (1) .6 To surmount this

problem we assume that firms incur no adjustment costs when changing from one positive level of

exports to another. Then short-run profit maximization implies the standard mark-up relationship

between price (Pit) and marginal cost (Cit): Pit (1 − η i−1 ) = Cit , where η i > 1 is a firm-specific

export-demand elasticity. Also, given our earlier assumption that marginal costs do not depend

upon output levels, we can multiply both sides of this relationship by output and re-write it a

simple expression linking exporting profits and exporting revenues (Rit):

π it = Rit − Qit Cit = η i−1 Rit . Substituting ln( η i−1 Rit ) on the left-hand of (1) renders the dependent

variable observable up to the vector of firm-specific foreign demand elasticities,                         ={     i   },

i=1,2,...n., which become parameters to be estimated.




         5
            It would be straightforward to allow for higher-order exchange rate processes in the same way that we
treat vit . However to keep the number of state variables reasonably small we do not do so.

         6
            Most plant- and firm-level data sets, including ours, lack information on the prices, export quantities, and factor
prices that would be necessary to identify marginal revenue and marginal cost schedules.

                                                                 6
2.2      The export market participation rule7

            Because we have used a logarithmic functional form for equation (1), gross export profits

are always positive. Nonetheless, firms may choose not to export for several reasons. First, firms

that aren’t already exporting face the sunk start-up costs of establishing distribution channels,

learning bureaucratic procedures, and adapting their products and packaging for foreign markets.

Second, exporters incur some fixed costs each period to maintain a presence in foreign markets,

including minimum freight and insurance charges, and the costs of monitoring foreign customs

procedures and product standards. We now characterize firms’ exporting decisions in the face of

these costs.

         Denote the fixed costs of exporting             F   - g1it, where    F   is a component common to all firms

and g1it captures all variation in fixed costs across firms and time. Also, if the ith firm did not

export in period t-1, assume it must pay the additional start-up costs,                     z + g1it - g2it , where
                                                                                           S i                            S   is

a vector of coefficients on the fixed plant characteristics, zi, and εit = (ε1it , ε 2it ) is a vector of firm

specific shocks that is normally distributed with zero mean and covariance matrix                          g,   . Following

Rust (1988), we assume that each component of                  ε it is serially uncorrelated and independent of xit
and et. 8

            Finally, define the binary variable yit to take a value of one during periods when the firm

exports and zero otherwise. Then, denoting the gross profit function in equation (1) by (xit, zi, et,

t), and assuming that all sunk costs are borne in the first year of exporting, net current export

         7
           Dixit (1989), Baldwin and Krugman (1989) and Krugman (1989) develop theoretical models that characterize
export market participation decisions in the presence of sunk entry costs. Our representation of the decision to export is a
variant of their basic framework.

         8
            These are Rust’s (1988) conditional independence assumptions. They substantially simplify the numerical
solution of the firm’s dynamic optimization problem. Note that the errors git can also be interpreted as the managers’
transitory optimization errors when choosing export quantities or prices, as well as variation in fixed and sunk costs.

                                                              7
profits accruing to the ith firm in year t may be written as:

                                                  (xit, zi, e t, t)   &   F   %   1it              if y it   ' 1 and yit&1' 1
      u(et, xit, z i, t, yit, yit&1,   it)   '    (xit, zi, e t, t)   &   F   &   S zi   %   2it   if y it ' 1 and yit&1 ' 0 (2)
                                                 0                                                 if y it ' 0

Note that net profits depend on the firm’s export participation in the previous year, yit-1 , because

that determines whether it must pay the sunk entry costs to export in year t.9 Thus the return to

becoming an exporter today includes the expected value of being able to continue exporting next

period without incurring start-up costs, which in turn depends upon the perceived distribution of

future gross exporting profits (e.g., Dixit, 1989).

         We shall assume that each period, prior to making their exporting decisions, firms observe

the current period realizations on the arguments of their gross profit function (1): zi , et , and xit .

These variables all follow first-order Markov processes, so they provide all the information

available at time t on the possible future paths for gross exporting profits. Suppressing i

subscripts, at time 0 a firm that maximizes its discounted expected profit stream over a planning

horizon of H years will therefore choose the sequence of decision rules

Y   ' {yt ' y(et, x t, z, ,t, yt&1, t, )}Ht'0 that solves:


                                                         H
                                        max                   t
                                                     E0{j         u(et, xt, z, t, yt&1, yt, t, )}                               (3)
                                         Y              t'0




Here E0 is the expectation operator conditioned on information available at time 0, is a discount

         9
            Equation (2) implies that firms completely lose their investment in start-up costs if they are absent from the
export market for a single year. Earlier studies suggest that these investments depreciate very quickly, and that firms which
most recently exported two years ago must pay nearly as much to re-enter foreign markets as firms that never exported
(Roberts and Tybout, 1997a). In light of these findings, and given that more general representations make structural
estimation intractable, we consider (2) to be a reasonable abstraction.

                                                                      8
factor 0 < < 1, and                             is the parameter vector θ = ( Ψ , Γ F , Γ S , Ω x , Ω e , Ω ε ) .

         To characterize the decision rule y(@), note that expression (3) is equal to the value

function that solves the Bellman equation:



       Vt(et, x t, z, t, yt&1,                   t,   )   '     max [u(et, xt, z, t, yt&1, y t, t, )   % EVt(et, xt, z, t, y t, )],        (4)
                                                              yt0{0,1}



where EVt is the expected value of Vt+1 over the future paths of the state variables e, x, and g :



          EVt(et, x t, z, t, yt, ) =                                                                                                       (5)

           *
               e t %1   *x           *          Vt%1(et%1, xt%1, z, t, yt, t%1, )dFex(et%1, xt%1, *et, xt ,   x,   e)dF   ( t%1 *   ),
                             t %1        t %1




and dFex and dF are the conditional distribution functions for the period t+1 values of the vectors

(e, x) and g, respectively.10 Thus the sequence of optimal decision rules satisfies:



 y(et, xt, z, t, yt&1,                   , )
                                         t
                                                  ' argmax [u(et, xt, z, t, yt&1, yt, t, ) % EVt(et, xt, z, t, yt, )]                    (6)
                                                      y t0{0,1}



         Given the parameter vector                              θ and our distributional assumptions for the exogenous state
variables (et, xit,                 it) ,    equations (6) and (1) determine optimal foreign market participation

patterns and export profits for the ith firm. Also the relationship π it = η i−1 Rit converts profits to

revenues. Hence, aggregating over firms, these three equations provide a framework for



         10
            This model satisfies the regularity conditions required for the existence and uniqueness of the value function:
time separability of the profit function, a Markovian transition density for the state variables, and a discount rate less than
one. See Rust (1995), section 2.

                                                                               9
assessing the roles of heterogeneity, sunk costs, expectations, and history in shaping export

responsiveness at the industry level. In the next section we discuss the econometric issues that

arise in estimating equations (1) and (6) with micro panel data.



3.      Econometric Issues

        We will base our estimates on annual panel data describing all manufacturing plants in the

Colombian chemical industry operating continuously over an 11 year period.11 For each plant and

year we observe a few fixed plant characteristics (zi), total sales revenues ( TRit ), total variable

costs ( TVCit ), and export revenues (Rit ). Given Rit, we can, of course, infer each plant’s discrete

decisions concerning whether to export (yit). Finally, we have time-series observations on the

real peso-dollar exchange rate (et), adjusted for the relevant export subsidies (Ocampo and Villar,

1995). We do not observe plants’ gross export profits, output prices, input prices, physical

quantities sold, or any direct information on the sunk and fixed costs of exporting.

        Our objective is to obtain estimates of the parameter vector             =( ,    F,   ,
                                                                                              S   x,   ,
                                                                                                       e   g   )

using the likelihood function for observed trajectories of the endogenous variables, (yit, Rit). By

equations (1) and (6), yi and Ri depend upon (e, xi , zi , ε i ) , where variables without t subscripts

denote entire trajectories over the sample period (t = 1, ... T). However, both the xi and the ε i

trajectories are unobserved, so to state the likelihood function in terms of our data we must take

the expectation of the joint density function for ( yi , Ri , e, xi , zi , εi ) over ( xi , ε i ). Expectations

with respect to   ε i are straightforward to calculate because these disturbances are serially
uncorrelated and independent of ( xi , zi , Ri , e) . But the xi trajectories are serially correlated and

          Firm-level data would have been preferable but these were unavailable.

related to (e, zi , Ri ) by equation (1). Matters are further complicated by the fact that we do not

see the export revenues that were available to plants in the years when they are were not

exporting. That is, Rit is censored at zero when yit = 0 .

        To deal with these problems, we base the likelihood function on observed profits of

exporters, π ia = η i−1 Ria where Ria is the sub-vector of Ri for which Rit is strictly positive. Then,

after taking expectations over        ε i , the likelihood function for the ith plant becomes:


            Li =   ∫ P ( y | e, x , z , θ ) g ( x | η
                           i      i   i          i
                                                        −1
                                                        i    Ria , e, zi , Ψ , Ω x )h( η i−1 Ria | e, zi , Ψ , Ω x ) dxi               (7)
                   xi




The product of the three components of the integrand is the joint distribution for yi , Ria and xi ,

conditioned on zi and e. (The integration over xi is mT-dimensional where m is the number of

state variables in x.) The first component of this product, P( ⋅ | ⋅ ) , is the conditional probability

for the exporting trajectory, yi , based on the decision rule (6), after taking the expectation over

ε i . The second component, g( ⋅ | ⋅ ) , gives the distribution for the exogenous state variables, xi ,
conditional on the observed export revenue stream (among other factors). Note that because xi is

serially correlated, export revenues in each year convey information on xit for all t. The last

component, h( ⋅ | ⋅ ) , which corresponds to equation (1), is the density for profits from foreign

sales during the exporting years, given the exogenous conditioning variables. All three

components of the integrand in equation (7) depend on the profit function parameters ( ,                                       x   )

and the vector of firm demand elasticities, , but only P( ⋅ | ⋅ ) depends upon                               F,   S, or    .

        Given the need for several layers of numerical integration (discussed below), it is not

feasible to obtain estimates of all of the parameters that appear in (7) from a one-step maximum



                                                                   11
likelihood estimator .12 To handle the complexity we proceed in stages. First, we estimate those

parameters that can be identified outside the model—the vector of firm-specific foreign demand

elasticities, η , and the parameters that govern the exchange rate process,                  . Next we estimate
                                                                                             e


the profit function parameters ( ,           x) using the conditional density h( η i−1 Ria | zi , e, Ψ , Ω x ) . Then

using these parameters, we construct the plant-specific conditional density for the mT profit

shocks, g ( xi | η i−1 Ria , e, zi , Ψ , Ω x ) . Finally, taking ( ,   ),
                                                                       x    and   e   as given, we construct the

likelihood function for observed export market participation patterns and maximize this function

over ( F,      S,   g   ). This approach limits the number of parameters we solve for in the

computationally-intensive third stage, which requires repeated multi-dimensional integration (see

equations 5 and 7). The costs of this approach are that, first, it is less efficient than single-stage

maximum likelihood, and second, it means that the standard errors for ( F,                   S   ,   g   ) based on the

information matrix from the final stage likelihood function are asymptotically biased downward.

We deal with the latter problem by constructing bootstrap standard errors.




3.1      Estimating demand elasticities and the exchange rate process

          To estimate the vector of plant specific demand elasticities, we assume that each plant’s
                                                                            −1
demand elasticity is the same at home and abroad, making η i one minus the ratio of total

(domestic and foreign) variable production costs (TVC) to total revenue (TR) by the mark-up

rule. Then, assuming that true variable costs are measured up to a zero-mean error by labor and

intermediate input costs, we estimate ( i)-1 as a plant-specific average of the right-hand-side of this

and true elasticities will induce measurement error in profits and will be reflected in vit.                   Given

our identifying restriction that et is independent of xi and         i       trajectories, there is no advantage to

estimating the exchange rate process jointly with other parameters. Hence, at this preliminary

stage we also obtain the parameters of the exchange rate process by fitting a simple AR(1)

process to macro data on et .



3.2     Estimating profit function parameters

        Next we obtain maximum likelihood estimates of the profit function. By earlier assumption,

the disturbance term of this function can be written as νit = l’xit where = (1, 1,       l             L    1)’ is an m

by one vector of ones and the elements of xi follow normal AR(1) processes. We we write the

latter as:

                            xit = Mxit −1 + ωit ,                                                                    (8)

rendering of the AR(1) processes implies the parameter vector describing the evolution of the state

variables xit is   x   = (M, Q). More substantively, assuming that each plant begins with a random

draw from the steady state distribution of xit, it implies that the profit shocks vit are distributed



        13
            The assumption that the elements of it are orthogonal to one another is innocuous. If they were not, we
could re-state the model in terms of orthogonal shocks by using a Cholesky decomposition of their covariance
matrix.

N (0, l’Q[ I − M 2 ]−1 l) . Also, for all k ≠ 0 , E [ ν it vit − k ] = l’ M |k |Q[ ( I − M 2 ) −1 ] ’l and

E[ν it v jt − k ] = 0 ∀ i ≠ j (e..g., Chow, 1983). These relationships define the conditional density

h(η i−1 Ria | e, zi , Ψ , Ω x ) , which in turn provides a basis for estimation of the parameters

Ψ and Ω x .

           Two final complications must be dealt with. First, we apply our estimator to the unbalanced

panel of observations for which exports are positive. But firms self-select into the export market

partly on the basis of      νit , so we need to correct for selectivity bias. In principle we could handle
this problem by maximizing a likelihood function based on (7) over the entire parameter vector .

However, as noted earlier, this approach is computationally very burdensome. We therefore use a

variant of Heckman’s (1979) selection correction that amounts to including a Mills ratio in (1).

This variable is based on a simple reduced form probit equation that explains each plant’s

probability of exporting as a function of its strictly exogenous characteristics: location, business

type, and initial capital stock.14

           Second, firms that have just entered the export market and firms that are about to leave the

export market do not typically report a full year’s worth of export revenues.15 We assume that their

reported values represent some fraction of the year drawn from a uniform distribution on the (0,1]

interval, and these fractions are independent across plants and time. Then we numerically integrate

them out of the likelihood function based on h( η i−1 Ria | e, zi , Ψ , Ω x ) .

           Once we have obtained estimates of ,               x, and    we can construct the conditional



           14
             Monte Carlo experiments confirm that this procedure does a good job of recovering true values for
Ψ   and    Ω x.

             Brooks (2000) finds that, for a given plant, the first and final year of exporting data are significantly

                                                                                                                 a
collecting all of these observable realizations on               it


exploiting well-known properties of the multivariate normal distribution, we obtain:

Here xi is the column vector obtained by stacking the year-specific xit’s, and representative blocks

of the matrices that appear in (9) are defined by:


                                                 {
                    ∑ xx ={ E ( xitxit + s ’)} = M Q( I − M 2 ) −1 ,

                                                {
                    ∑ xv = {E ( xitν it + s )} = M Q( I − M 2 ) −1 l

                    ∑ vv = {E (ν it ν it + s )} = {l’ M s Q( I − M 2 ) −1 l} .

          Several features of the density (9) merit comment. First, although our notation does not

show it explicitly, the dimensions and composition of Σ xν and Σ νν vary across plants with their

export market participation patterns. Second, equation (9) uses information on a plant’s observed

exporting revenue to extrapolate to non-exporting years, given the autoregressive processes

summarized by          x   . Finally, if the ith plant never exports, we do not observe νit in any year so the

distribution of xi is unconditional: E( xi ) = 0 and E ( xi xi ’)= Σ xx . This is the only case in which Σ xx

                                                                        [                   ]
is full rank; otherwise the constraint l’xit = η i−1 Rit − ψ 0 zi + ψ ‘et + ψ 2 t makes one component of

xit a deterministic function of the others in the exporting years.

                                                                 15

      g   ). Given our assumptions on the exogenous state variables ε i , xi ,and ei , exporting decisions in

    year t depend only upon exporting status in year t-1 and current year information. So, taking

    expectations over         ε i , the probability of the participation trajectory yi may be written as a product
    of year-to-year transition probabilities, conditioned on the other variables:

 probabilities.) The likelihood function we use for our final stage of estimation is thus:

             When evaluating (11), we integrate over xi trajectories numerically. Specifically, plant by

 plant, we sample xi realizations antithetically from g ( xi | η i−1 Ria , zi , e, Ψ , Ω x ) , calculate the

 associated probabilities, P[ yi | e, xi , zi , θ ] , and average them.16

             Obtaining the transition probabilities themselves is more involved. To calculate them we first

 evaluate EVt(et, x it, zi, t, yit, ) at yit = 1 and yit = 0 using backward induction. Then we substitute

 these values into right-hand side of the decision rule (6) along with the net profit function (2), and we



               16
                 Antithetic sampling is a way to limit simulation error. It means that for each draw from the relevant density we
    include its mirror image, ensuring that the set of draws used is symmetric about the true mean. See Rubinstein (1986) for
    discussion.

                                                                                16
take the expectation of the implied yit choice over ε it . We repeat these calculations plant by plant for

each sample year, every time the likelihood function is evaluated. Further details are provided in

appendix 1.

        Each step of the backward induction involves taking expected values over (et + 1 , xit + 1 )

realizations, given (et , xit ) . Earlier studies have performed this type of calculation by discretizing the

vector of state variables and calculating transition probabilities among each vector of values (Rust,

1988, Das, 1992). The problem with this approach is that it involves a large number of calculations.

For example, with 3 continuous state variables and r different values per state variable, there are r3

points in the state space and r6 transition probabilities involved in the calculations at each stage of the

backward induction. With a reasonably long planning horizon, approximation errors compound, and it

becomes necessary to use very large values of r. This “curse of dimensionality” led Rust (1997) to

develop an alternative approach. Instead of treating all possible combinations of values for the

discretized state variables as elements of the state space, Rust generates the state space with random

draws from the joint probability distribution for the vector of state variables. This solves the

dimensionality problem because increasing the number of state variables increases the dimension of

each point, but does not increase the number of points over which one integrates.

        We adopt Rust’s (1997) approach in the present study. First, taking our estimates of

Ω x and Ω e as given, we draw G points from the steady state distribution of (et ,xit ) using antithetic

sampling. Then using Ω x and Ω e once more, we calculate the G2 transition probabilities for

movements between all possible pairs of these points, thereby constructing a discrete analog to

dF (et +1 , xit + 1 | et , xit , Ω e , Ω x ). Together, these points and transition probabilities allow us to perform

the integration at each step of the backward induction algorithm for calculating EVt .

4.          An Application to the Colombian Chemicals Industry

4.1         Overview of the export patterns

            Although our framework should describe any industry in which exporting is potentially

profitable for some firms, it is easiest to identify parameters in those industries which have many

exporters, and which exhibit substantial variation in the set of exporters over time. For these reasons,

we choose to estimate our model using data on the Colombian chemicals industry for the period 1982

through 1991, which is summarized in table 1 below. Our data set covers 62 major chemical

producers that operated continuously during the sample period.17 It was originally collected by

Colombia’s Departamento Administrativo Nacional de Estadistica (DANE), and was cleaned as

described in Roberts and Tybout (1996).

            Note that the Colombian peso depreciated substantially in real terms during the sample period,

and that chemical exports simultaneously grew. The expansion was partly due to an increase in the

number of exporters, and partly due to increases in the magnitude of foreign sales at the typical

exporting plant.18 Colombian chemicals plants produced 35.00 billion pesos ($236 million US) worth

of exports in 1991, of which 29.94 billion came from plants that were exporting in 1984. So entry by

new exporters contributed 5.06 out of the 27.10 expansion. Also, of the 62 plants that existed during

the entire sample period, 18 exported in all ten years, 26 never exported, and 18 switched exporting

status at least once. So, although there were a number of switches, the data exhibit substantial


              17
                  A more general framework would treat each plant as making simultaneous decisions to enter or exit
     production and to enter or exit the export market. This would require us to model the sunk costs involved in setting up a
     plant. In Colombia, most exports over the sample period came from the plants that were continuously in operation and
     focusing solely on this group of plants is a reasonable starting point that substantially simplifies the empirical model.
              18
                The number of chemical plants remains fixed at 62 during the sample because we have excluded
     producers who enter or exit to simplify the econometrics, so there is some potential for selectivity bias.

                                                                 18
persistence. This could be due to serial correlation in the plant-specific state variables, ( xit1 ,x it2 ) , or it

could be due to sunk entry costs, or some combination of both. Our estimates will shed light on the

relative importance of these different forces.



4.2     First Stage Estimation: Demand Elasticity and the Exchange Rate Process
                          1           TVC 
        Using ( η$ i ) = T ∑ t = 1  1 − TR  , we begin by obtaining plant-specific estimates of the
                      −1       T             it

                                          it 


elasticity of demand. The smallest elasticity is 1.5 and the largest elasticity is constrained to be 20.

(Six plants were affected by this constraint.) More than 80 percent of the plants fall between 1.5 and

8.5, and the median elasticity is 5.0. Thus export profits at the typical plant amount to approximately

one-fifth of export revenue.19

        Using data for 1967-1992, we estimate a simple AR(1) process for the real effective export

exchange rate calculated by Ocampo and Villar (1995).20 The coefficients (standard errors in

parentheses) are e$t = .549 (.429) + 0.883 (.094) et-1 and σ$ 2 = 0.0043. The Dickey-Fuller test


statistic for stationarity is -1.93 and the critical value is -2.78 at a 90 percent confidence level. So,

although our point estimates suggest the exchange rate process is stationary, the usual problem with

test power prevents us from rejecting the null hypothesis of a unit root.




           19
              Goldberg and Knetter (1999) use data aggregated to the seven-digit industry level to estimate much
  lower export demand elasticities for manufactured products. The discrepancy between their results and ours
  probably traces largely to the fact that individual plants within a narrowly defined product category export close
  substitutes for each others’ products.
           20
             An AR(2) process fits the data significantly better, but the improvement is minor (R2 = .85 versus R2 =
  .79), and the cost of adding an additional state variable to the model is substantial. Given that the focus of the
  paper is not on modeling the exchange rate process, we have chosen to keep this aspect of the model as simple as
  possible.


                                                           19
4.3    Second Stage Estimation: Profit Function Parameters

       Next we use π it = η$ i− 1 Rit to impute export profits and we estimate the profit function (1).

Exploratory tests using GMM estimators reject the null hypothesis that the error in the profit function

error, νit , follows a first-order process, but they do not reject the null that it follows an ARMA(2,1)

(see appendix 2). Thus we model the profit error as the sum of two AR(1) processes and use

maximum likelihood to estimate the parameters of the profit function        and    x   = {Q, M} that

describe the evolution of the profit shocks.

       The resulting parameter estimates are reported in Table 2. Recall that zi is meant to capture

time-invariant heterogeneity in operating profits. We model these using a set of three size dummies

based on domestic sales in the pre-sample year. These dummies should proxy for both product quality

and marginal production costs at the beginning of the sample period. Our estimates imply that this

type of variation in not particularly important. (Experimentation with other dummies based on

geographic location and business type yielded similar results.)

       On the other hand, the elasticity of export profits with respect to the exchange is 2.45 and

significant. Since the same elasticity describes responses of export revenues, it implies that

devaluations do more than simply revalue a fixed physical quantity of exports—volumes respond too.

The trend term, which picks up secular growth or shrinkage in foreign markets and/or in marginal

production costs, adds little. We caution, however, that both of these coefficients are identified with

only eleven years of data, so they may not be representative of longer time periods. Replacing the

exchange rate and the trend term with annual time dummies did not improve the fit significantly

(results not reported), so these variables appear to do a reasonable job of controlling for time effects

that are common to all plants. Put differently, barring spatial correlation, our assumption that the



                                                    20
disturbances in equation 1 are not correlated across plants seems reasonable. Finally, note that the

Mills ratio has the expected sign and is quite significant. This implies that exporting firms enjoy

relatively favorable realizations on vit .

         The parameters of the xit process,            x, are reported at the bottom of table 2. Each is identified

with plant-specific variation and thus is estimated with a good deal of precision. Both                         1   and   2   are

less than one in absolute value and significantly different from zero. The variances, q1 and q2 , are also

significantly greater than zero. Thus, as suggested by the specification tests reported in appendix 2, it

would be inappropriate to treat the profit function disturbance, vit, as a first-order process. Our

interpretation is that profit shocks arise from both demand and cost shocks, each with its own root.



4.4      Third Stage Estimates: Sunk Costs and Fixed Costs

         Table 3 reports our estimates of ( Γ F , Γ S , Ω ε ) . Four             s   estimates appear in this table,

corresponding to the four plant size quartiles we distinguish. We report two types of standard errors.

The first, reported in column 2, is based on the information matrix for the third stage likelihood

function (11), and therefore is not adjusted for the fact that the first and second stage parameters are

estimated. The second, reported in column (3), is a bootstrap estimate that recognizes the estimation

of all the parameters in the model. 21 Although the bootstrap standard errors suggest that our third

stage parameter estimates are not significantly different from zero, this implication is misleading.

Their magnitude reflects the fact that, out of the 200 bootstrap samples, several contained very few

           21
              To generate the bootstrap standard errors, we repeatedly draw random samples of 248 plants (with
  replacement) from our data set of 62 plants. Each draw is an entire plant-specific trajectory for the variables that enter our
  estimator. For each bootstrap sample we repeat all stages of estimation except the exchange rate process. Then we
  construct the mean squared deviation of bootstrap estimates from the estimates based on our original sample of 62 plants.
  We used bootstrap samples 4 times the size of the original sample because when only 62 plants are drawn we occasionally
  get a sample with too few transitions in exporting status to identify all of the parameters. To correct for this difference in
  sample size, we double the root mean squared deviations (i.e., weight them by 4 ) before reporting them.

                                                               21
exporting plants and thus poorly identified ( Γ F , Γ S , Ω ε ) . Nonetheless, as figure 1 demonstrates, all

of the bootstrap samples yielded Γ S parameter estimates greater than zero. Further, the bootstrap

samples that yielded large Γ S estimates also yielded large estimates of           σ ε 1 and σ ε 2 . Thus we
estimate the ratios of sunk costs to the noise in the profit function for entrants with much greater
                         Γ S1 Γ S 2 Γ S 3 Γ S 4
precision. The vector ( σ , σ , σ , σ ) is estimated to be (4.06, 2.27, 2.60, 1.81) and the
                                 2ε   2ε        2ε   2ε

associated vector of asymptotic z-ratios is (1.39, 2.76, 2.53, 2.55). So for all size categories except

the smallest, sunk entry costs are clearly greater than zero.

           Turning to the parameter estimates themselves, note first that sunk costs appear to fall with

plant sizes, suggesting that big plants with large domestic market shares are in a better position to

step into international markets. (         s1   is the average export market entry cost among plants in the

smallest size quartile,     s2   is the average entry cost for plants in the second quartile, and so on.) This

pattern could reflect existing contacts and distribution channels among large firms, the types of

products large firms produced, or to the mix of people they employ.

           One advantage of structural estimation is that it allows us to calculate the sunk costs of

entering foreign markets in currency units. Table 3 implies that, at a discount factor of 0.9, the

expected sunk costs of breaking into export markets vary from 108 to 242 million 1986 pesos,

depending upon which plant size category we are describing. In 1999 US dollars, these figures are

$730,000 and $1.6 million, respectively.

           The fixed cost   F    estimate is very close to zero, and as already discussed, our bootstrap

distribution suggests that these costs are negligible on average. Recall, however, that fixed costs are

     - ε it , and our bootstrap distribution bounds σ ε above zero. So fixed costs are important at least
       1
 F

some of the time for some of the plants. Finally, note that σ ε 2 is similar in magnitude and also



                                                             22
bounded above zero by the bootstrap distribution, implying that sunk costs vary considerably across

plant, even after controlling for their size class.

          Given that the estimation procedure involves several stages and repeated multi-dimensional

integration, we explored the sensitivity or our estimates to the fineness of the grid used for integration

over one-step-ahead realizations on exogenous state variables and the number of trajectories drawn

per plant for integration over xi . Coefficient estimates varied roughly 20 percent with grid draws

and xi draws. However, this range of variation did not decline as we increased the number of grid

points and xi trajectories per plant to the maximum values feasible with our hardware. (The maximum

number of grid points, G, we used was 300 and the maximum number of xi trajectories per plant we

used was 50.)



5.        Implications for Export Supply

5.1       Profits, option values and transition probabilities

          To explore the implications of sunk costs and plant profit heterogeneity, we calculate the

plant-specific gross expected value of exporting in year t before netting out sunk costs:


                  ∫ [π ( x , z , e , t ) − Γ
          ~
          Vit =              it    i   t       F    +

                  δ ( EV ( x , z , e , t , y
                         t        it   i   t   it                                               ]
                                                    = 1) − EVt ( xit , zi , et , t , yit = 0)) ⋅ g ( xit | Ria , et , zi )dxit
                                                                                                                                 .



This expression has a current profit component (first line) and an option value component (second

line), which measures the value of being able to export next period without paying entry costs. Note
      ~
that Vit is an expectation over the unobservable xit values, so it shows less cross-plant heterogeneity

than was actually present.



                                                                  23
        The gross expected value of exporting for the first year in our sample (t=1982) is compared

with expected sunk entry costs, Γ S zi , plant by plant, in figure 2. Plants are sorted by sunk cost
                                ~
category, then by ascending Vi ,1982 . The circled lines in the figure are the sunk costs that are estimated

for each of the four plant types, where the type is defined by the plant’s size in the domestic market.

For the left-most group of plants, the ones with the smallest domestic output levels, the sunk cost of

entry (242 million pesos) exceeds the gross expected export value for all the plants. This is also true

for the second group of plants, which faced a sunk entry cost of 136 million pesos, but in this case

both the gross expected export value and sunk cost are lower than for the first group. Ignoring noise

in sunk costs and xi,1982 realizations, no non-exporter in either group would find it profitable to enter

the export market. For the remaining two groups of plants the profit heterogeneity is more extreme

and some plants have gross expected export values that are high enough that they would enter the

export market. For the largest plants, expected profit heterogeneity is substantial. Note that a single

plant stands out with exceptional export profits.

        For several reasons, figure 2 should not be used to predict which plants will actually be in the

export market: it averages out noise in sunk costs and xi,1982 realizations, and it provides no

information on plants’ prior export experience. To illustrate the difference that prior experience

makes, we construct the 1982 plant-specific transition probabilities, once again taking expectations

over xi,1982 . Figure 3 shows the probability that each plant will remain an exporter, assuming it

exported in the previous year, and the probability that each plant will enter the export market,
                                                                                                ~
assuming it did not export in the previous year. Plants are sorted in order of ascendingVi ,1982 . The

probability of remaining an exporter, once in, is above .8 for virtually all plants. That is,
   ~
P( Vi ,1982 + ε 1i ,1982 > 0) is quite high for most plants. In contrast, the probability of entering the market



                                                       24
   ~
P( Vi ,1982 − Γ S zi + ε 1i ,1982 >0) is much lower for virtually all plants, and below .1 for half of the plants.

Only a few plants have entry probabilities that exceed .5, indicating that the sunk entry costs are a

significant entry hurdle for most producers.

        We now isolate the role of option values in determining export market participation patterns.
                      ~
This component of Vi ,1982 depends on the plants’ expectations of future market conditions and is

bounded by their sunk costs. To illustrate how important the option value is as a source of the plant’s

total export value, figure 4 plots current profit net of fixed costs, Γ F , and total export value for each

of the non-exporting plants in 1982. The difference between the two curves is the option value. If

there were no sunk costs of entry, the option value would be zero and the two curves in figure 4

would be identical. The figure demonstrates that the option value is a large component of the total

value of the plant. In fact, in many cases the current profits that would be earned by being an
                                                                                         ~
exporter are close to zero, so that the option value is the largest component of Vi ,1982 . Even among

firms with substantial current profits from exporting, the option value still accounts for about two-

thirds of total export value. As expectations of future market conditions improve, the option value

term increases and can induce entry even if current profits are unaffected.

        Total industry exports depend on both the number of plants exporting and the foreign sales

volume of each plant. Figure 5 illustrates the distribution of export revenue for all plants in 1982,

sorted by export revenue. The upper line, denoted by triangles, gives the cumulative export revenue

earned by the 25 plants that were actually in the export market in that year. Total export revenues

were approximately 6.3 billion pesos. Differences in the size of the exporters are obvious, with the

largest two plants accounting for almost half of the industry revenue. Figure 5 also illustrates the

predicted revenues that would have been earned by each of the non-exporting plants if they had been



                                                       25
induced to enter the market. The cumulative predicted exports of the 37 non-exporting plants are

approximately 2.6 billion pesos. These plants would have increased industry export revenue by

approximately 41 percent if they had been in the market, but no one of the non-exporters would have

added more than several percentage points by itself.



5.2     Simulated Effect of a Devaluation

        The export supply response to a devaluation reflects adjustments on two margins: entry-exit

and output adjustments among incumbents. To quantify each type of response we simulate firms’

reactions to a permanent change in the exchange rate process that depreciates the steady state value

of the peso by 10 percent, leaving its variance unchanged.22 The regime shift takes place in period 1

and we track firms reactions over the following nine periods. Firms always begin period 1 in their

observed state, thereafter all realizations on x and e are simulated. We calculate expected reactions by

simulating 300 exchange rate trajectories under each scenario and averaging each firm’s responses.

        The effect on the number of exporting plants is illustrated in the top panel of figure 6. The

first simulation, which we label “credible devaluation,” characterizes reactions when the regime

switch is correctly anticipated and believed by all plants. By this terminology we mean that all plants

use the correct new regime parameters for the exchange rate process when they formulate

expectations about future profits. Under this assumption we calculate an expected first-year increase

of 4.5 percent in the number of exporting plants. The expected number of exporters continues to

expand by a total of 12.2 percent over the nine-year horizon we simulate.

          22
               This is accomplished by increasing the intercept of the estimated autoregressive process for the log of the
 exchange rate. Given the parameter estimates reported in section 4.2, the steady state mean of the logarithmic exchange
 rate is .549/(1-.883) = 4.69. Using the relationships between the mean and variance of a normal and a log normal random
 variable, a two percent increase in the mean of the log exchange rate translates into a 10 percent increase in the mean of the
 exchange rate itself.

                                                              26
       Figure 6 also shows expected responses to a “non-credible” regime switch in which producers

incorrectly continue to use the pre-reform exchange rate parameters in their evaluation of future

profit trajectories. Under this scenario there is virtually no response in the expected number of

exporting plants. Even after 5 years of experience with the more favorable exchange rate, no new

entry has occurred. This markedly different outcome is solely due to differences in expectations,

since gross operating profits evolve in the same way under both scenarios. Thus a substantial,

permanent change in the exchange rate process may not induce entry if firms view the outcomes as

transitory shocks generated by the old regime.

       The effect of the same devaluation on the level of export revenue is illustrated in the bottom

panel of table 6. Here expected export revenues increase approximately 5 percent in the first year of

the new policy and approximately 37.5 percent over the nine-year horizon. The increase in total

export revenue is driven primarily by the expansion of the existing exporters and this is insensitive to

the perceived credibility of the exchange rate change. The difference in revenue growth between the

credible and non-credible devaluation is the result of the entry of the new exporters in the credible

regime. While there is significant new entry, the new exporters are relatively small and so they make

only a small contribution to total export revenue.



5.3    Alternative Policies to Subsidize Exports

       The case for export promotion policies is controversial.23 Nonetheless, it is quite common to

find significant promotional regimes in place. In this section we shall ignore the question of whether



         23
            Those who advocate export promotion (e.g., Westphal, 2001) argue that exports generate various
 positive spillovers, while those who are opposed to export promotion (e.g., Panagaria, 1999) discount the
 importance of these spillover effects.

                                                       27
export promotion is desirable and address the positive quantitative issue of how effective various

types of promotion are in terms of their impact on export volumes.

         Aside from currency devaluation, governments in developing countries and elsewhere have

used a variety of tools to encourage manufactured exports. (Panagaria,1999, provides a critical

review.) In terms of value, the most significant ones are usually direct subsidies linked to plant’s

export revenues.24 Preferential credit and insurance are commonly provided by official export

promotion agencies and/or administered through the financial sector. Export processing zones

provide duty-free access to imported inputs that are subject to tariffs among non-exporters. Policies

that affect transport costs through the public development of port facilities do the same. All of these

subsidies increase the profits of plants once they are in the export market and thus tend to induce

volume adjustments among incumbent exporters, as well as net entry.

         A second policy option is to directly subsidize the sunk costs that plants incur to enter export

markets.25 Matching grant programs that subsidize information acquisition or investments in

technology acquisition for export development fall under this heading, presuming that these are one-

shot start-up costs.26 Support for participation in trade fairs might also be classified as this type of


           24
               In Colombia, the most important subsidy has been a tax rebate that is proportional to foreign sales. This
  rebate has been delivered in the form of negotiable certificates (Certificado Abono Tributarios) that recipients can
  use to retire their taxes or sell on a secondary market. Other export subsidies have included a duty drawback
  scheme (Plan Vallejo), insurance against exchange rate risk on dollar-denominated export loans (discontinued in
  1977), and subsidized export credit (from PROEXPO). As Ocampo and Villar (1995) document, the combined
  value of these subsides fluctuated between 16 and 27 percent of export sales for manufacturing overall during the
  sample period. We use Ocampo and Villar’s real effective export exchange rate to estimate our model, so although we
  do not isolate their effects, these subsidies are built into our analysis.
           25
              Alternatively, creation of export trade groups that collect information on sources of demand and match foreign
  buyers and domestic producers can also act to reduce one substantial cost of entry for new exporters. Information
  deficiencies were identified as significant impediments to exporting by Colombian manufacturers in a recent survey. See
  Roberts and Tybout (1997) for discussion.
           26
            Pursell (1999) notes that such programs have gained popularity rapidly at the World Bank during the
  past decade. “The justification for these projects is generally that there are exporting firms that would increase

                                                              28
policy, given that it reduces the costs of establishing a foreign clientele. Sunk cost subsidies

encourage entry, but if they do not affect marginal production costs they should not affect export

volume decisions, given foreign market participation. Further, they also encourage exit if they are

available repeatedly to the same producer because they reduce the incentive to avoid re-entry costs by

remaining in foreign markets during unprofitable periods.

        A third type of export promotion provides subsidies that are not directly tied to plants’ export

level but rather are flat payments designed to cover the annual fixed costs of operating in the export

market. The same types of policies that help to reduce entry costs can fall under this heading,

provided that regular expenditures are required to maintain foreign clients and/or adapt the product to

evolving tastes, technologies and characteristics of competing products. Unless they shift the marginal

production cost schedule, fixed costs subsidies resemble sunk cost subsidies in that they operate on

the entry-exit margin but not the volume margin. However, given that they do not affect the threshold

costs associated with exit and re-entry, their effect should be primarily on the number of exporters

rather than the long run rate of turnover among exporting plants.

        Using our estimated model, we simulate each of these policy options. First we explore the

effects of a per-unit subsidy equal to 10% of their export revenue. Second, we simulate fixed cost
                                                                                           ~
subsidies amounting to 10 million pesos and 20 million pesos. (The average Vit value is 152 million

pesos among the existing exporters in 1982.) Finally, we simulate a reduction of sunk entry costs by

50 million pesos, which given our estimates of 108 to 242 million pesos, amounts to a 20 to 50%

reduction in entry costs, depending on the plant type. In order to compare these policies, we



  their exports and non-exporters that would start to export, but do not do so because they lack crucial information
  and services, e.g., information on export markets, production techniques, packaging and delivery requirements,
  product standards, etc.” (Pursell, pp. 20-21)

                                                           29
construct a benefit-cost ratio for each one by calculating the total gain in export revenue that would

accrue in each year and dividing it by the direct cost of the subsidy in that year.

       Export revenues per unit subsidy (hereafter “benefit-cost ratios”) for the four policy options

are graphed in figure 7. Policies that subsidize fixed or sunk costs all generate benefit-cost ratios that

are less than one, varying from .11 to .57 in the first year after the change. In contrast, the subsidy

proportional to revenue has a benefit-cost ratio of 3.3 in the first year. The reason for this difference

is that revenue subsidies act directly on the exports of the largest exporting plants which, in turn,

account for a substantial increase in total market revenue. In contrast, the other three policies all act

exclusively on the entry-exit margin. All induce new exporters to enter, but because the new entrants

are very small and the policy provides no incentive for the large existing exporters to expand, the

overall impact on total market revenue is small. For example, the policy that reduces fixed cost by 10

million pesos generates a 14.8 percent increase in the number of exporting plants but only a 1.8

percent increase in total export revenue. Increasing the subsidy to 20 million pesos generates a 34.4

percent increase in exporters and a 3.5 percent increase in revenue. Both policies are relatively

expensive because they subsidize every exporter by the same amount, regardless of export volume.

       Over time the benefit-cost ratios change as additional entry and exit occurs. The ratio for the

policy that reduces fixed costs by 10 million pesos trends upward over time and exceeds one after five

years. At that point the total number of exporters has increased by 48.1 percent and total export

revenue by 6.7 percent. The higher subsidy of 20 million pesos also has a benefit-cost ratio that

trends upward over time as entry occurs but the ratio never exceeds .77. The reason for this is that it

encourages the entry of many more small exporters. The total number of exporters increases by 91.7

percent over 5 years and, while this generates a larger increase in export revenue, 10.4 percent, than



                                                    30
the smaller subsidy, it also generates significant subsidy costs. The rate is so generous that many

small plants choose to enter and remain in the export market but generate so little revenue that they

do not cover the cost of the subsidy they receive.

       Sunk cost subsidies also generate a gradual increase in the number of exporting plants, 17.0

percent, and export revenue, 2.8 percent, over the nine year simulation horizon. However, the

benefit-cost ratio for this type of policy never rises above .65. The main reason for this is that the

sunk cost subsidy is available to each plant each time it enters, so the government repeatedly pays the

entry costs of the same group of marginally profitable exporters as they move in and out of the

market. Total turnover, the sum of the number of entering and exiting plants, doubles, from 5

plants/year before the subsidy to 10 plants/year afterward, making this a relatively inefficient way to

generate export revenue. Finally, entry into the export market also affects the benefit-cost ratio of the

revenue subsidy policy. In this case the ratio falls over time. This happens because the marginal

exporters drawn into the market by subsidies have relatively low demand elasticities, and thus

generate relatively little revenue per unit of subsidy received.



6.      Summary

       In this paper we develop a dynamic structural model that characterizes firms’ decisions

concerning whether to export and the volume of foreign sales among those who do. The model

embodies uncertainty, plant-level heterogeneity in export profits, and sunk entry costs for plants

breaking into foreign markets. We estimate the model with plant-level panel data on sales and

production costs among Colombian chemical producers. Then we use the results to quantify sunk

entry costs and export profit heterogeneity, and we conduct dynamic policy analysis.



                                                     31
       Our results imply that entry costs are substantial. Consequently, producers don’t initiate

exports unless the present value of their expected future export profit stream is large. They also tend

to continue exporting when their current profits are negative, thus avoiding the costs of re-

establishing themselves in foreign markets when conditions improve. For example, we calculate that

plants exporting in year t generally remain exporters in year t+1 with probability 0.8 or greater. But if

these same plants were, for some reason, not to have exported in year t, very few would have

exported in year t+1 with probability greater than .5. Further, for many plants the option value of

being able to export next year without paying entry costs substantially exceeds the current profits that

they expect to earn by exporting.

       Heterogeneity in plants’ marginal production costs and the foreign demand conditions they

face also affects their export sales volumes. In a typical sample year, the 5 largest exporters account

for 74 percent of total sales while most of the other 20 exporters contributed less than one percent

each. We calculate that the 37 non-exporters would have contributed even smaller shares, on average,

if they had entered. The major exporters find it profitable to maintain their foreign market presence

under any reasonable policy scenario, so almost all of the entry and exit that takes place is

concentrated among these small producers.

       The export growth induced by a pro-trade shift in the exchange rate regime depends on the

volume response among existing exporters and the number and size of foreign market entrants versus

quitters. In our application, much of the response to a 10 percent devaluation in the expected steady

state rate comes from foreign sales growth among existing exporters. For example, after 9 years, a

credible 10 percent devaluation in the steady state expected exchange rate results in a 12.2 percent

increase in the number of exporters and a 37.5 percent increase in export revenue. The average



                                                   32
incumbent exporter is 19.3 percent larger at the end of the period and the average entrant is 6 percent

larger. These results on the number of exporters depend crucially on the credibility of the exchange

rate change and the magnitude of sunk entry costs. When producers view the same exchange rate

realizations as generated by the pre-reform regime, the number of exporting plants increases by only

2.3 percent and the total increase in export revenue is virtually unchanged.

       Finally, the effectiveness of export promotion policies depends upon their form. Subsidies that

are proportional to plants’ export revenues generate far more foreign exchange per peso spent than

policies that reduce the sunk costs of foreign market entry. For example, a 10 percent subsidy on

export sales generates 3.3 pesos worth of foreign exchange per peso spent by the government. In

contrast, a 50 million peso reduction in sunk entry costs (which amounts to a 20 to 50 percent

reduction in entry costs, depending upon the plant) generates only 0.1 peso worth of foreign

exchange per peso spent. The relative inefficiency of market entry subsidies reflects the fact that they

act only on the entry/exit margin, and thus induce no sales responses among the dominant export

suppliers. Further, the producers who are induced to enter by entry subsidies are generally marginal

suppliers.

       In sum, sunk entry costs and cross-plant heterogeneity in cost and foreign demand conditions

significantly affect export dynamics. We have demonstrated how to characterize these effects

empirically using plant-level panel data on a few basic variables. While the parameter estimates we

report and the quantitative effects they imply are specific to the Colombian chemicals industry, we

believe that the forces we have documented are general, and that the methodology we exposit here

should be adaptable to other contexts involving market diversification .

        The likelihood function in equation (11) requires evaluation of transition probabilities for

export status. These in turn require us to calculate the optimal export decision in (6) and evaluation

of the expected future value EVt in (5). Let V0t, V10t and V11t respectively be the value from not

exporting in period t, from beginning to export in period t after not exporting in period t-1, and from

continuing to export in period t after exporting in period t - 1, each exclusive of transitory noise:

         Once V0t, V10t and V11t are calculated up to the unknown parameters, maximum likelihood

estimation using equation 11 becomes straightforward. However, these expressions are difficult to

calculate because they involve the expected value of the period t+1 value function conditioned on

period t information. We begin by writing this expectation as:



           EVt(et, x t, yt, )      ' yt Et max(V11t%1%         1t%1,V0t%1 )   % (1&y t)Et max(V10t%1%         2t%1,V0t%1 )   (A1.3)

where:


 Et max(V11t%1% 1t%1,V0t%1)        ' P[   1t%1 > V0t%1   & V11t%1]@[V11t%1 % E(         1t%1 | 1t%1 > V0t%1   & V11t%1)]
                                   % P[   1t%1
                                                 < V0t%1 & V11t%1]@V0t%1

Et max(V10t%1% 2t%1,V0t%1)         ' P[   2t%1 > V0t%1   & V10t%1]@[V10t%1 % E(        2t%1 | 2t%1 > V0t%1   & V10t%1)]
                                   % P[   2t%1

We construct EVt ( et , xt , yt , θ ) using the backward-induction algorithm described by Rust (1995).

Specifically, we assume that firms have a finite planning horizon of H years. In the terminal year

there are no future periods to consider so EVH ( eH , xH , yH , θ ) is set to zero in (A1.1), and each firm’s

exporting decision maximizes current payoffs, u( eH , x H , z , ε H , y H , y H −1 , θ ) . Accordingly, for period

H-1, the expected value function is simply:



         EVH − 1 (eH − 1 , x H − 1 , z , y H −1 , θ ) =              [
                                                           E H − 1 max u(eH , x H , z , y H , ε H , y H −1 , θ )    ]
                                                                             yH
where expectations are taken over both ε H and x H conditioned on x H −1 , as in (A1.4). Once the

expected value function for period H-1 has been calculated for each possible realization on x H −1 , it

enters into the calculation of the expected value function for period H-2 can be calculated for each

possible realization on x H −2 :



             EVH − 2 ( eH − 2 , x H − 2 , z , y H − 2 , θ ) =
                                        [                                                                                                            ]
                                 E H − 2 max {u(eH − 1 , x H −1 , z , y H − 1 , ε H −1 y H − 2 , θ ) + δ EVH − 1 ( eH −1 , x H −1 , z , y H − 1 , θ )}
                                            y H −1


This calculation can be repeated, backing up one year at a time, until period t. This generates the

values needed for V10t, V11t, and V0t which in turn enter the likelihood function.



                                                                           38
                           Appendix 2: Specification Tests for the Profit Function



1.      Trend Stationarity

        To establish whether profits are trend stationary we first conduct an augmented Dickey-Fuller

test using the specification:

                   ln( π it ) = φ 0i + φ 1 ln( π it −1 ) + φ 2 ∆ ln( π it −1 ) + φ 3t + ν it          (A2.1)

Here, as in our structural model, the intercept is allowed to vary across 4 size classes. Given that

there are no unobserved plant effects or random coefficients, this specification does not suffer from an

incidental parameters problem and the distribution of the test statistic is straightforward to obtain.28

Specifically, if we let n (the number of plants) approach infinity while holding the number of time

periods and the number of size classes fixed, the parameters are asymptotically identified by the cross-

sectional variation in the data and the GMM estimator of standard errors is asymptotically correct

regardless of whether a unit root is present. The Dickey-Fuller test then amounts to a simple t-test of

whether H0 :φ 1 = 0 .

        Results for the augmented Dickey-Fuller test are reported in Table A2.1.               Note that we can

reject the null hypothesis of a unit root, despite the relatively small coefficient on lagged profits. This

is because we use enough orthogonality conditions in our GMM estimator to obtain very precise

estimates. OLS estimates (not reported) are quite similar, but their standard errors are larger, and do

not permit us to reject the null of a unit root.




          28
               Breitung and Meyer (1994) make this observation in a similar context.

                                                                  39
2.         Order of the          it   Process

           To determine whether               it   can be represented as the sum of two AR(1) processes (i.e., whether

m = 2 is a reasonable assumption), we multiply both sides of equation (1) by (1& 1L)(1& 2L) ,

yielding an ARMA(2,1) expression for log profits, conditioned on a distributed lag in the exchange

rate and a trend:

            ln( π it ) = β *0i + β 1* ln( π it −1 ) + β *2 ln( π it − 2 ) + β *3et + β *4 et − 1 + β *5et − 2 + β *6t + ψ it + µ ψ it −1   (A2.2)
                                                                                                                                             .

Here ψ it = ω 1,it + ω 2 ,it is serially uncorrelated and β * ’s are functions of the various underlying

structural parameters. (Note in particular that β 1 = λ 1 + λ 2 and β *2 = − λ 1λ 2 .) This form of (11) can
                                                  *



be implemented using GMM estimators if the non-linear parameter constraints are ignored; doing so

allows us to perform a battery of specification tests without cumbersome programming. In particular,

the presence of second order serial correlation in the disturbances or the significance of a third lag on

profits would challenge the assumption m = 2.

           Estimates of equation A2.2 are reported in Table A2.2. Note first that our results are quite

consistent with the stationary ARMA(2,1) process implied by m = 2. Using Arellano and Bond’s

(1991) tests for serial correlation in the residuals, the null of no first-order correlation is rejected with

a p-value of 0.062, but the null of no second order correlation is easily accepted (p-value 0.782).

Further, although the second lag on log profits is quite significant, adding a third lag to the equation

does not significantly improve the fit.29 As an aside, it is worth noting that the coefficients on lagged

profits imply roots of 0.972 and -0.452, which are close to the roots estimated by applying maximum

likelihood to equation 1. (See table 2 of the text.)




              29
                 The coefficient on the third lag was -0.059 with a standard error of 0.053. These results are not
     reported in Table A2.2.

                                                                         40
