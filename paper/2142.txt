freeze and paying insufficient attention to the need for fiscal
restraint.

     On February 28th 1986, with inflation at 400 percent per year, Brazil

embarked on her second major stabilization effort in twenty five years.

Figure 1 shows the history of the Brazilian inflation. In the 5 years

between 1959 and 1964, increasingly populist administrations carried

inflation from 10 to 100 percent. By 1968 it was down to 20 percent, a level

that persisted until the first oil shock, when inflation jumped to 40

percent. There it remained until 1979. In the 5 years between 1980 and 1985,

the government failure to absorb the debt and oil shocks in a non-

inflationary manner pushed inflation from 50 to 220 percent.3

     The inflation process in Brazil is highly institutional. It does not

resemble hyperinflations where pricing and wage setting are geared to the

exchange rate by the hour, making it possible to stop inflation by simply

containing money creation and fixing the exchange rate. The design of an

appropriate stabilization mix for Brazil, therefore, needs to recognize

backward—looking indexation of wages, bonds and rents. Both the 1964 and the

current program, rather than focussing exclusively on demand—oriented

policies, enlist supply side measures to avoid the recessionary consequences

typically associated with inflation fighting.

    This paper highlights the institutional features of the inflation

process and contrasts the two stabilization efforts. Brazilian inflation is

best understood by recognizing the interaction of supply shocks and

indexation as the main elements in generating acceleration. The two

stabilization efforts demonstrate that an incomes policy is an essential

ingredient to non—recessionary stabilization. But they also show that demand

restraint is inevitable if disinflation is to be viable. The 1964 program

was gradualist and two-handed, relying on the supply side on wage

repression. The 1986 plan was a heterodox shock treatment centered around

an uncompromising price freeze and paying insufficient attention to the need

for fiscal restraint.



     I. A Puzzle

     Money expansion and velocity behavior are not enough to explain

inflation dynamics in Brazil. There is little doubt that, from the demand

side, large budget deficits in 1959—64 and in 1979—85 supported the

inflation process. But assigning them more than an accommodating role would

mean neglecting the important contribution of the supply side to inflation.

     In high inflation economies, institutional arrangements provide for a

periodical resetting of real wages to a peak. The peak real wage occurs at

the date of the contract immediately after the nominal wage increase.

Subsequently, up to the next adjustment the real wage is eroded by

inflation. Figure 2 shows the actual real minimum wage in Brazil over the

past 10 years. At fixed intervals the real wage increases to a PAk and then
                                    3


is eroded over the interval between adjustments, reaching a trough just

prior to the next adjustment, a year or six months later.

      Escalation of inflation to three or four digits invariably involves a

shortening of adjustment periods for wage and price setting. This shortening

of the adjustment interval increases inflation: in a context of   overlapping

contracts the shortening of the intervals meanstbat a larger number of

contracts are revised on the same date, pushing up costs and hence

inflation.

     In 1979, the annual adjustments of wages in Brazil were accelerated to

a twice yearly base. This translated into a supply shock for firms and led

to a doubling of the inflation process. Higher inflation in turn further

shortened intervals pushing inflation up once more. By the end of 1985,

firms and workers were begining to move into 3 months revision cycles. The

governemnt was keenly aware that the transition to even shorter periods

must have hyperintlationary consequences and hence tried to avoid the

shortening of intervals.

      It is important to make a distinction between the payments period,

which is weekly or monthly, and the frequency of inflation adjustment. Wage

adjustment for past inflation occurs at fixed intervals. In any inflation

process, intervals shrink from several years to a year, 6 month, 3 month, 1

month and ultimately to the daily course of the dollar. These periodic

adjustments are common to any inflation process and so is their gradual

shortening.The pattern of adjusting intervals is a poorly understood aspect

of the inflation process. The puzzle is why adjustment intervals show so

much inertia.

     The average real wage during the contract will depend on the rate of

inflation and the length of the interval. Given the expected inflation rate,

the same average real wage can be obtained by the combination of shorter

intervals and lower real peaks or larger intervals and bigger peaks. If wage

earners are unable to lend and borrow in perfect capital markets, they are

forced to hold cash in order to sustain their consumption levels during the

period when their real wages are below the real average. Cash held for later

consumption has its purchasing power eroded by ongoing inflation. Wage

earners who do not have access to perfect credit markets clearly should

prefer an even flow of real wages rather than the tooth—saw pattern of

Figure 2. They must be willing to trade smaller nominal wage increases for

shorter periods of wage resetting.

     In Brazil, adjustments intervals have shrunk from 30 months in the

1950s to 6 and 3 months in the 1980s. The costs associated with lagged

inflation adjustments can be indicated by the number of months for which the

real wage was below the real average during one interval multiplied by the

ratio average/trough wage in the same interval. Figure 3 shows how higher

costs associated with lagged inflation adjustments are related with higher

real wages for the 37 adjustment periods of the minimum wage that occurred

between 1954 and 1986 in Brazil. We do not understand however why intervals

do not melt much more rapidly when inflation accelerates, in such a way that

costs for wage earners associated with lagged adjustments would be smaller

and roughly constant.

     The costs of more frequent inflation adjustment of wages for firms are

negligible. Adjustments of the pay period use resources, but not the

revision of wages by some commonly public inflation index. Firms should be

willing to pay even wages equal in average to the discounted value of the

tooth—saw pattern. Yet we only observe a shrinking of intervals when the

inflationary erosion becomes extreme. Moreover, the transition often takes

the form of an "advance" on the upcoming adjustment.



     II. Other Institutional Aspects of Inflation

     Fischer (1977) and Taylor (1979) have drawn attention to the

persistence of price disturbances in a setting of overlapping longterm wage

contracts even under forward looking, rational expectations behavior and a

well—understood program of monetary control. In the Brazilian setting,

institutional factors take, to a large extent, the room of relative wage and

expectations mechanisms that characterize Fischer—Taylor contracts.

Mandatory indexation is backward—looking and periodically readjusts wages

and other contracts.

     We express this inflation process in Eq.(1). Wage inflation, wt, is

shown equal to past price inflation plus a disturbance term. Ceteris

paribus, current inflation, pt, is equal to past inflation, via indention

of wages, the exchange rate and public sector prices. The output gap or

unmeployment affects current inflation because it influences the marginal

costs of firms to the extent that turnover of the labor force can be used

for wage cutting. The third term, in, represents supply shocks. These are

superimposed on indexation which propagates them.



     (1)    Pt   wt +agapt +ut         wt =pt-i +vt
                                                  6

       This inflation process has several implications. First, current supply

shocks are automatically transmitted to future periods. An oil price

increase, a real depreciation, increases in indirect taxes, elimination of

public sector subsidies or increases in the real price of agricultural goods

raise the current rate of inflation and are transmitted via indexation into

increased inflation in subsequent periods. In fact, to raise real prices or

cut real wages in the presence of full indexation, the frequency of

adjustment of exchange rates and public sector prices has to be higher than

the frequency of wage adjustments. Only then is it possible to beat the

indexation, cutting the average real wage during the adjustment period by

stepping up the rate of inflation. Indexation of the financial system, of

the tax structure and of the public debt imply that changes in the inflation

rate are automatically and fully accomaodated.

       Second, a slowdown in the growth rate of nominal spending cannot

eliminate inflation from one day to the next. They run counter to the cost—

inflation that comes from lagged inflation captured by the wage inflation

tern in (1) . The neo—classical answer of instant recontracting of the labor

force with reduced wage adjustments in the face of a shift to a non-

inflationary monetary regime is implausible. The presence of inertia is thus

one good reason for the use of incomes policy in a stabilization program.

      Third, the inertia of the inflation process implies that contracts that

are not explicitly indexed in a backward looking way, as for example

shortterm loans in the financial system, carry forward looking inflation

adjustments. At any point in time there is a given stock of such contracts

outstanding. Their maturity may run as far as 6 months or a year. A sudden

disinflation would imply an arbitrary redistribution between debtors and

creditors.
                                   7


     Fourth, any escalation of inflation started off by some supply shock

encounters further endogeneous elements that feed the inflation process. One

is the increase in the velocity of money. Another one is the inflationary

erosion of tax revenue which then implies increased rates of monetary

expansion.

     Finally, an important factor in accelerating inflation is the

endogenous shortening of the interval for inflation adjustment of wages,

public sector prices and the exchange rate.



     III.Two Stabilizations

     The main reason for the sharp increase in inflation between 1959 and

1962 was the fast increase in demand. Between 1957 and 1962, industrial

output grew at 11 percent per year. The share of the Central Government

budget deficit in output increased from 2.8 percent in 1960 to 4.3 percent

in 1963, while the seignorage share in GD? widened from 3.6 percent in 1959

to 5.7 percent in 1962. The combination of a 30 percent deterioration of the

terms of trade, the lack of external finance, a bad coffee crop in 1963 and

adverse climatic conditions leading to an agriculture disaster in 1964 all

contributed to the inflation problem.

     The 1964—68 Stabilization: The economic crisis was the vehicle for a

military take—over on March 1964. The ?rograma de Acao Econômica do Governo

(PAEG,l964/66) detailed a plan to reduce inflation gradually in 3 years

using fiscal consolidation and incomes policy. The following were the main

aspects of the prograni:

     (a) Fiscal consolidation led to a gradual reduction in the deficit from

4.2 percent of GD? in 1963 to only 1 percent in 1966. The main instruments
                                   8

of this budget balancing were increases in public sector prices, cuts in

subsidies, increased tax collections obtained through an increase in

indirect taxes and better administration to avoid tax evasion. Despite the

initial increase in wages for the military and civil servants, and an

increase in investment expenditures after 1965, the deficit was reduced.

Later on, the reduction of real wages also helped the budget.

     (b) The exchange rate was devalued by 70 percent at the outset of the

program.

     Cc) Starting in 1965, the incomes policy took the form of granting wage

increases not in line with past inflation, but rather geared to "expected

inflation" which was announced to be declining.In terms of the inflation

model of Eq. (1) the disinflation was achieved by breaking the link between

current and past inflation wage adjustments became forward—looking and

limited to an officially imposed inflation forecast. The cut in wage

inflation helped absorb the impact of public sector price increases and

exchange depreciation. But the reduction in price inflation fell by a wide

margin short of the anticipated decline built into wage agreements. The

effect was to reduce real wages. The real minimum wage fell by 15 percent

between 1964 and 1967. The wage cut made room both for budget balancing and

for an improved external competitiveness while at the same time bankrolling

a cut in the rate of inflation.

     Cd) On the price side, the government introduced a program of fiscal,

credit and other incentives to firms which would accept a convenant not to

raise prices by more than a stated percentage. Allowable cost increases

excluded wage awards in excess of those contemplated in the government wage

formula. In 1966, firms were promised a 20 percent reduction in excise taxes
                                   9

if they carried out wage increases in accordance with the government wage

formula. From 1967 on, price guidelines became more pervasive, falling on

most large industrial firms.

     (e) Monetary policy was erratic. An initial moderate expansion in 1964

was followed by a tightening in 1965—66. Indexation in financial markets was

used to mobilize domestic saving and to create a market for public sector

debt. The black market premium that had reached 60 percent in the last

quarter of 1963, by the end of 1964 was already down to 4 percent and

oscillated below 1 percent in 1965 and 1966.

     The program was successful in reducing inflation without generating a

dramatic decline in economic activity. Inflation declined from 144 percent

in the first quarter of 1964 to 57 percent in 1965 and 38 percent in 1966.

Industrial production declined in the first year of stabilization by 5

percent, but then showed a rapid recovery. By 1966 it was already 6 percent

above the pre—crisis level.

     In 1968 a new plan was adopted. First, a crawling peg exchange rate

policy was introduced to depart from the pattern of real exchange rate

swings associated with discontinuous devaluations. Second, credit became

more abundant. Third, in response to public reaction against the squeeze the

government revised the wage adjustment rule. The new wage formula corrected

half—way the inflation underestimation. Real minimum wages continued to fall

until 1970 and a new formula was created in 1974. Wage readjustment then

returned to the pattern of backward lookingcatch—up indexation.

     The 1965—68 reforms were the basis for an extended period of strong

growth with stable inflation. Between 1968 and 1974 real growth averaged 10

percent per year and inflation declined to only 20 percent.

     The 1986 Stabilization: The current stabilization set an end to an

inflation that reached 400 percent per year in the first month of 1986. The

inflation escalation that started with the second oil shock and the

shortening of the intervals for wage setting accelerated with the large real

depreciation in 1983, with an agricultural disaster, with correction of

prices of the public sector and subsidies cuts. A major recession in 1983

cut the real wage, which neverthless started to recover in 1984. In 1985.

the new democratic government embarked on a program of expansion that

carried real growth to 8 percent (see Table 1)   .    Another bad crop introduced
supply shocks which, combined with the recovery, led to a shortening of the

interval for inflation adjustment in some sectors of the private sector to

only 3 months. Mindful of inflation acceleration and upcoming elections

later in the year, the government embarked on a program of stabilization via

incomes policy.

     Plans for an inflation stabilization that circumvented the critical

difficulty of inertia had been widely discussed in Brazil for more than a

year and the Argentine and Israeli precedents were already on hand. The key

steps of the Cruzado Plan were the following:

     (a) Wages were readjusted and frozen. Contracts with several months to

readjustment were rolled up and contracts that had experienced a recent

readjustment were rolled back. As a sweetener, the minimum wage received a

bonus of 15 percent increase over its past teal average and other workers

an 8 percent bonus.

     (b) All prices and the exchange rate were frozen until further notice.

     (c) A tablita was devised to eliminate the expected inflation built

into extant contracts and thus avoid arbitrary redistribution between

debtors and creditors. A new currency, the cruzado, was introduced to help

facilitate the readjustment.

     (d) Indexation which had been blamed for the acceleration of inflation

was eliminated. For wages a escala movel with a 20 percent threshold was

substituted. In financial markets indexation was maintained only for

instruments of more than one year maturity.

     (e) There was a sharp initial monetisation of the economy to avoid the

Argentine problem of exceptionally high real interest rates. In the first

three months following stabilization the monetary base doubled.

     (f) On the fiscal side the tax reform of December 1985 was expected to

have laid much of the groundwork for stabilization. The expected revenue

gains were to close a budget deficit of 6 percent of GDP. Tax revenues rose

disappointingly little due to two features of the approved tax bill: a

lowered income—tax withholding schedule and an increased reliance on
                                      12

taxation of financial assets no longer popular. Revenues of state—owned

companies were hurt by the price freeze, spending ran higher than

anticipated and subsidies that were cut during 1983—84 have since staged

back. The public sector wage bill increased in line with the economy—wide

trend.

        (g) External factors favored the program in three respects. The decline

in world interest rates reduced the debt sevice burdens in the budget and in

the external balance. Sharply lower world oil prices made a major

contribution in the same direction. Dollar depreciation in the early period

of the program helped achieve a gain in competitiveness. Thus the program

started oft with a more than favorable development on the external balance

side.

        In terms of Eq. (1) the key point of the program was to eliminate catch-

up inflation in the wage. This was done by the offsetting influences of

rolling some contracts back and others up. Thus inertial inflation was

simply suspended. But this time the real wage was increased. The cost was

borne by a reduction in profit margins of price—controlled firms.

         Between February and June, cumulative inflation was zero. Industrial

production increased by 12 percent in the first half year of the program

relative to the same period a year before.

        Over the past 8 months the program has taken a life of its own. Fuelled

by strong popular suppport for the price freeze Finance Minister Dilson

Funaro elevated controls to a fetish. The budget was allowed to deteriorate

dramatically, the trade surplus disappeared, shortages and black markets

became pervasive. But "zero inflation" remained the ministerial obsession.
                                    13

      Minor adjustments in the program were necessary already in September.

 They went in the direction of very special excise taxes: so large that they

 were claimed to solve the budget problem, and so small that they could be

 eliminated from the official price index. Following a landslide election

victory, a second round of such excise tax increases was imposed in November

with the objective of raising 4 percent of GD? in revenue. Once again they

were eliminated from the index. Clearly the government was trying to reenact

the 1964 program of real wage cuts to restore the external balance and the

budget. But the absence of any austerity and the restraints of a democratic

regime put severe limits on the exercice.

      By October, inflationary expectations were becoming extreme. The

removal of long adjustment lags in wages, which previously had been an

element of short—term stabilization, meant that inflation could accelerate

dramatically. This possibility is reinforced by the escala movel which

potentially put wage adjustments into the express lane.



     Comparison: During the 1964 stabilization the preceding high inflation

with no indexation had reduced the real value of the public debt to less

than 4 percent of GD?. In the 1986 stabilization, by contrast, prevailing

indexation and high real interest rates had left a debt—income ratio of

foreign and domestic debt combined of 50 percent as a mortgage for

stabilization. The large debt and insufficient budget improvement led to

the expectation that the government might seek to reduce the debt burden by

inflation soon pushed up nominal interest rates and the black market

premium.
                                   14

     By the end of the year the freeze remained on. but the heat was on,

too. The black market for dollars stood at a premium of more than 100

percent and even with official price stability the shortterni interest rate

reached 150 percent. A dramatically clever program appeared to have been

     IV.Issues and Lessons

     The two Brazilian stabilization programs seen in conjunction teach a

number of lessons. First, incomes policy is a valuable means in achieving

disinflation. It helps avoid dramatic unemployment. But incomes policy by

itself is not enough. Without fiscal consolidation the disinflation is not

viable, with a boom it does not even last long. Moreover, disinflation has

not been costless. In 1964 wage repression was the front payment for

disinflation and in 1986 it was the redistribution from firms to workers

implicit in the rise in real wages and the cut in profit margins, a loss in

exchange reserves and a dererioration in competitiveness.

     The second lesson concerns indexation. Indexation in the presence of

supply shocks is a source of inflation propagation. But it also protects an

inflation rate against rapid acceleration. An economy with long adjustment

periods has an inflation process that is not rapidly expected to accelerate.

Indexation of assets reinforces the element of stability. In the 1964

episode indention was reinforced and broadened. In 1986, by contrast it was

eliminated altogether and replaced by adjustment triggers without cap. The

latter setting has led to a highly volatile atmosphere where inflationary

expectations can easily become the driving mechanism for an actual inflation

and where the zthsence of financial indexation drives asset holders to goods

 and to the black market. Inflation now, contrary to the past twenty years,

 can quite possibly become self—generating. Figure 4 shows monthly inflation

between January 1984 and December 1986. The sharp deceleration of inflation

in mid 1986 was substituted by an explosion of prices in December. The

lesson is that restoration of indexation in labor and asset markets, with

long adjustment intervals, is good advice.

        A third point concerns monetisation following disinflation. During

the high inflation real money demand declines. When price stability breaks

out the demand for real balances rises. The real interest rates turns

sharply positive unless the government engages in a significant

monetisation. But it is difficult to know what is enough. One criterion is

the level of the real interest rate, the other the behavior of monetary

aggregates. It is hard to judge the appropriate level of real balances

because in the inflation period financial liberalisation will have taken

place which at least partially destroys traditional linkages between

interest rates and real balances. It is difficult to judge whether

hysteresis is important here. But being too conservative is problematic

because high real interest rates in the presence of a large public debt

create a fiscal problem.

        A final point concerns the budget. Must the budget be strictly zero,

or even in surplus for monetary reform to succeed? Or is it possible to

finance a small deficit in a noninflationary manner? To a large extent this

depends on the growth rate of output, the prospective path of real tax

revenues and the real rate of interest. If output growth is high and the

real rate of interest is negligible, there is room for deficits. If the

relation is the reverse substantial caution is needed because of the risk of
                                    16

building up a fiscal problem which ultimately requires inflationary

liquidation.
