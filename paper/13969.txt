                                               ABSTRACT

Does it matter when a child starts school? While the popular press seems to suggest it does, there
is limited evidence of a long-run effect of school starting age on student outcomes. This paper uses
data on the population of Norway to examine the role of school starting age on longer-run outcomes
such as IQ scores at age 18, educational attainment, teenage pregnancy, and earnings. Unlike much
of the recent literature, we are able to separate school starting age from test age effects using scores
from IQ tests taken outside of school, at the time of military enrolment, and measured when students
are around age 18. Importantly, there is variation in the mapping between year and month of birth
and the year the test is taken, allowing us to distinguish the effects of school starting age from pure
age effects. We find evidence for a small positive effect of starting school younger on IQ scores measured
at age 18. In contrast, we find evidence of much larger positive effects of age at test, and these results
are very robust. We also find that starting school younger has a significant positive effect on the probability
of teenage pregnancy, but has little effect on educational attainment of boys or girls. There appears
to be a short-run positive effect on earnings of beginning school at a younger age; however, this effect
has essentially disappeared by age 30. This pattern is consistent with the idea that starting school later
reduces potential labor market experience at a given age for a given level of education; however, this
becomes less important as individuals age.

        Does it matter at what age a child starts school? Older children do better on tests,

but is this because they are older and, in fact, unrelated to the age they started school?

Despite the dearth of convincing evidence, the popular press seems to suggest that there

are benefits to “redshirting” (holding back) children in kindergarten (See NY Times, June

3, 2007). But is this the case? Are the short run benefits in terms of better performance

just that: short run? And are there costs associated with finishing school and starting

work later?

        Much research has shown a consistent pattern that children who start school later

tend to score higher on in-school tests, even after accounting for the endogeneity of

school starting age.1 However, a key limitation in the interpretation of these correlations

is the inability to distinguish between the effect of school starting age and a direct age-at-

test effect, as they are perfectly collinear. As a result, it could be that children who start

school when they are older do better simply because they are older when they take the

tests and being older provides an advantage, or it could be because there are direct

benefits to starting school at an older age.

        Using data on the population of Norway, we are able to separate these two effects

using IQ test scores measured outside of school, at the time of military enrolment when

students are around age 18. The rule in Norway that children must start school the year

they turn 7 provides a discontinuity in school starting age for children born around

January 1st and provides an instrument for actual school starting age. Importantly, there is

also variation in the mapping between year and month of birth and the year the test is

taken, allowing us to distinguish the effects of school starting age from pure age effects.

Cognitive scores around age 18 are particularly interesting as it is about the time of entry

to the labor market or to higher education and so these scores are more relevant to the

labor market than scores in kindergarten or elementary school.

         Additionally, we study the effects of school starting age on longer term outcomes

including educational attainment, early fertility, and adult earnings. While this is

methodologically less complicated than studying in-school tests because age of

measurement and school starting age are not perfectly collinear, the literature has been

hindered by a paucity of data. Given the complications created by school leaving age

rules in the US, European data are attractive when studying education and earnings.2

Educational attainment has been studied in the literature and it has generally been found

that older starters average modestly higher completed education.3 However, ultimately

adult earnings are a very important outcome and we add to the literature by being the first

study to track cohorts of men and women from ages 24 to 35 and analyze how the

impacts of school starting age change with age. Also, we are the first study to examine

the effects of school starting age on the probability of teenage childbearing by women.

         There has been some more recent evidence that the timing of births may be

manipulated by parents based on school starting age cutoffs; to the extent that this is true

and that these parents may be “different” on other dimensions as well, estimates in the

  Studies using U.S. data have suffered from the fact that compulsory schooling laws specify minimum
school leaving ages rather than grades so early starters have completed more education at the minimum
dropout age. Therefore, historically, persons whose quarter of birth predicts starting early have on average
higher schooling and higher earnings (Angrist and Krueger 1991). Dobkin and Ferreira (2007) finds
younger starters also obtain slightly higher education in more recent U.S. cohorts.

                                                                                                               4
literature may be biased. Unlike the previous literature, we can control for sibling fixed

effects to take account of this possibility.

         There are a number of reasons why school starting age may have long-run effects

on children’s outcomes, although the sign of this effect is theoretically ambiguous. The

potential advantages of an early starting age could include the following: Starting school

younger means finishing school at a younger age, which implies more time for the

individual to earn returns on their investment in human capital. Starting school younger

may also be advantageous to the extent that children learn more at school than at home

(or be a disadvantage if the opposite holds true), which could affect their long run

trajectory. Finally, parental investment in their children may also depend on school

starting age – parents may provide more help to children who are young for their grade

level.

         There are also potential disadvantages of an early starting age (and some of these

could work in the opposite direction as well). It is possible that children cannot learn as

well in school earlier in their developmental life. In addition, social development may

depend on a child’s age relative to that of his/her classmates; if being relatively older is

advantageous, then it might be better to start children later (and vice versa). To the extent

that older children have an advantage on exams in school (by mere virtue of the fact that

they are older when they take the test and hence know more), they may do better in the

long run. Given these potentially offsetting effects, the true causal relationship becomes

an empirical question.

         We find evidence for a small positive effect of starting school younger on IQ

scores measured at age 18. In contrast, we find evidence of much larger positive effects




                                                                                               5
of age at test, and these results are very robust. When we examine other outcomes, we

find that school starting age has a significant effect on teenage pregnancy among girls but

no strong effect on education among girls or boys. We also find that there appears to be a

short-run positive effect on earnings of beginning school at a younger age; however, this

effect has essentially disappeared by age 30. This pattern is consistent with the idea that

starting school later reduces potential labor market experience at a given age for a given

level of education; however, this becomes less important as individuals age.

        The paper unfolds as follows. Section 2 presents the relevant literature. Section 3

describes our methodology and contrasts it to other approaches in the literature. Section 4

discusses relevant institutional details in Norway, and Section 5 provides a data

description. Section 6 presents our results and Section 7 concludes.



                                      2. Relevant Literature

        Despite the importance of the distinction, there is little solid evidence as to the

role of school starting age (SSA) versus test age (AGE) in determining school test scores.

While children are in school, researchers are faced with the identity that

        AGE AT TEST = SCHOOL STARTING AGE + YEARS OF SCHOOLING

Most of the literature has compared test scores of children who are in the same grade and

so has in fact estimated the combined effects of SSA and AGE.

        Given the difficulty with separating out the two effects, a number of recent papers

try to infer the role of age versus school starting age by looking either at early test scores

or at changes in scores over time.4 Elder and Lubotsky (2007) show that there are strong


4
 For example, Datar (2006) finds that achievement changes between kindergarten and first grade are not
highly correlated with age at school entry.


                                                                                                         6
age effects in the fall of kindergarten year, before children could have been much

affected by formal schooling. Elder and Lubotsky (2007) and Cascio and Schanzenbach

(2007) also show that effects of age-at-school-entry on test scores tend to get smaller as

children move to higher grades. Together these papers imply that the estimated starting

age effects partly reflect the endowment differences between students when school starts

and that there is little evidence that students learn more in school if they are older when

they start. However, none of this work is able to directly disentangle the direct effect of

age at test from that of school starting age.

       While most of the literature controls for time in school, there is another series of

papers that controls for age at test. There is some evidence that, when tested at the same

age, young children score better on in-school tests if they started school younger and

hence have spent more time in school. Cahan and Cohen (1989) study Israeli elementary

school children and Elder and Lubotsky (2007) compare U.S. children around age 6 but

with different predicted starting ages (based on month of birth). However, the bulk of this

evidence is for very young children in kindergarten and elementary school and it is not

clear that these findings generalize to older ages relevant to the labor market

       Most similar methodologically to this paper are papers by Crawford, Dearden and

Meghir (2007) and Cascio and Lewis (2006), both of which rely on multiple sources of

variation to identify the effect of school starting age on children’s test scores. Crawford,

Dearden and Meghir (2007) use the fact that there is variation in school starting age

across local education authorities (LEAs) in Britain to separately identify the effect of

school starting age from age at test effects on in-school tests. While some LEAs have

only one entry point (with one cutoff date), other LEAs have two entry points (with some




                                                                                               7
children starting in September and some starting in January) or even three entry points

(with children starting school in September, January, and April). So while the school

start cutoff in Britain is September 1st, August-born children start school in September in

some LEAs and later in the year in others. Thus, the effect of SSA can be distinguished

from that of test age by comparing August and September born children who are in LEAs

that have different policies. They find that age at test is the biggest factor; however, a

limitation of this methodology is that the different school starting policies may

themselves be disruptive or lead to changes in curriculum and so may impact both August

and September born children.5

         Cascio and Lewis (2006) examined the role of schooling on student performance

on the Armed Forces Qualifying Test (AFQT) in the NLSY. A nice feature is that it

focuses on older children and there is variation in school cutoff ages (arising from across

state variation) as well as variation in the age at which individuals take the test. This

suggests that the authors are able to identify the effect of school starting age while

controlling for age (they actually interpret these estimates as effects of schooling but as

described above, schooling and school starting age are perfectly collinear for in-school

children, conditional on age). Unfortunately, likely due to a relatively small sample, the

authors find very imprecise statistically insignificant effects of school starting age when

controlling for age. Because we have data on the population of Norway, we are much

better able to identify the effect of school starting age controlling for age.6




5
  Another limitation of this paper is that the authors know the LEA a child is in at the time of the exam, not
when they started school, suggesting that results for the earliest tests scores may be most valid.
6
  Mayer and Knutson (1999) also find some evidence that quarter of birth matters for test scores in the
CNLSY.


                                                                                                             8
         There is also a recent literature examining the relationship between school starting

age and longer run outcomes such as educational attainment and earnings.7 While

methodologically this is less complex because there is no link between date of

measurement and time in school, the literature has been limited by the absence of good

data. For example, the most thorough previous study of earnings by Fredrikson and

Ockert (2006) has only one year of earnings data and so cannot distinguish between

cohort and age effects. We are the first study to track cohorts of men and women from

ages 24 to 35 and analyze how the impacts of school starting age change with age.



                                            3. Methodology

Identification Strategy

         We first describe the empirical strategy we use when our outcome variable is

completed years of education, log earnings, or probability of having a teenage birth. We

then describe the adjustments we make when we look at IQ as an outcome; as described

earlier, when we look at IQ we need to account for the fact that we control for age at test.

Education, Log Earnings, and Teenage Fertility Outcomes

         Our equation of interest is as follows:

                         Yi = β 0 + β 1 SSAi + X i ' λ + ε i                   (1)

where Y is the outcome under study, SSA is the school starting age, and X is a vector of

controls that includes year of birth indicators and a local linear trend. Because the school

cutoff is at the beginning of the year, we redefine year of birth to run from July to June

rather than from January to December (so the discontinuity is now at the middle of our
7
  Bedard and Dhuey (2007) use variation in school starting age within states over time in the United States
to identify the effect of cohort age and absolute age (netting out relative age effects). Their findings
suggest a significant positive effect of increasing the school starting age on wages.


                                                                                                              9
re-defined “year”).8 We also include a local linear trend that is centered at the

discontinuity (a trend ranging from 1-12 and centered at December/January). Together

the year of birth indicators and local linear trend allow for cohort effects such as secular

increases in educational attainment over time.

           Because parents may be able to manipulate school starting age, we need to find an

instrument to identify the true relationship between school starting age and outcomes.

Our exogenous variation in school starting age comes from variation in month of birth

and the administrative school starting rule in Norway – children born in December start

school a year earlier than children born in January, with a December 31 cutoff. Therefore,

we estimate equation (1) by 2SLS using the expected school starting age (ESSA) as an

instrument for the actual school starting age. In Norway during our sample period, the

legal rule was that children must start school in the year they turn 7. We measure the

ESSA as equal to 7.7 – (month of birth -1)/12. This takes account of the fact that school

starts in August and the cutoff date is at the beginning of the year. Given the ESSA is

determined only by month of birth and not by parental choice, it seems reasonable to treat

it as exogenous and use it as an instrument for the actual SSA.

           For ESSA to be a valid instrument for SSA, two conditions must be satisfied.

First, it must be random which children are born in different months of the year; this

could be violated if different types of families have children at different times of the year.

We attempt to address this issue in a number of ways. As a robustness check, we include

family characteristics in our regression and show our resulting estimates are very close to

those estimates without these controls. In addition, and perhaps more convincing, we are

also able include family fixed effects as a check on this possibility.
8
    Fredrikson and Ockert (2006) also use this redefined-year approach in their Swedish study.


                                                                                                 10
       Second, it must be that there is no direct effect of being born at a particular time

of the year on child outcomes. While there is some evidence of small differences in

health outcomes across season of birth (Bound and Jaeger 2000), the balance of previous

evidence is that these differences are not nearly large enough to make much difference.

Importantly, our critical comparison is between December- and January- born children,

so differences between summer and winter born children are largely irrelevant.

       It is important to note that the thought experiment here is that we vary one

individual’s school starting age while holding that of everybody else fixed. Thus, we are

essentially changing two things: the age the individual starts school and the relative age

of that child in the classroom (from relatively younger to relatively older). Given that we

have no information on variation in the ages of other children in the class, we cannot tell

whether our estimated effect of starting a year later matters because it makes the child a

year older in absolute terms or because it makes the child older relative to his classmates.

IQ Scores as Outcomes

       As described previously, when we study IQ scores at age 18, we add a control for

the age of the person at the time of the test (AGE):

              IQi = β 0 + β 1 SSAi + β 2 AGEi + X i ' χ + ε i               (2)

In Norway, there is a relationship between month of birth and when persons are called to

do the test. As an example, in some years, individuals who were born in January and

February are called to take the exam in one year while individuals born after February (in

the same year) are called to take the exam a year later. Since in most years, the birth

month cutoff for the test is not December and so is not perfectly correlated with expected




                                                                                          11
school starting age, we are able to disentangle school starting age effects from general

age effects.

       A complication that arises is that not all men take the test in the year in which

they are supposed to do so. This type of deviation can occur due to illness, absence

abroad etc. As a result, age at the time of the exam is potentially endogenous.

Conceptually similar to the case of school starting age, we use the year in which you

were supposed to take the test as an instrument for the age at which did take the test. To

do so, we define test feeder groups for each test year based on year and month of birth.

For example, all persons born in calendar year 1951 were supposed to take the test in

1970, so they are all members of the 1970 feeder group. On the other hand, persons born

between April 1961 and April 1962 were supposed to take the test in 1980, so they

constitute the 1980 feeder group. We instrument for AGE using the indicator variables

for the feeder group to which each individual belongs. This exploits the discontinuity that

while cohort of birth changes smoothly, persons born in April 1961 are almost a year

older taking the test than persons born in March 1961. Given that over 90% of men do the

test in the year they are supposed to, the first stage relationships are extremely strong and

there is no concern about weak instruments.

       Appendix Figure 1 illustrates the discontinuity between test month cutoff and age

at test in our data. In the figure, zero corresponds to cutoff birth months and -1 to birth

months that are one month previous to a cutoff birth month etc. The figure shows how

average age at test varies depending on where the person’s birth month is relative to the

relevant cutoff birth month for that individual. The very large discontinuity in age at test

at the cutoff birth months is very clear.




                                                                                              12
         As described earlier, conditional on age, school starting age is typically perfectly

correlated with time-in-school when the outcome is measured while still in school. In

Norway, many boys take the military IQ tests while still in school; our estimates for IQ

will therefore provide an upper bound on the benefits of starting school young, holding

schooling constant. Later we evaluate the role played by time-in-school by providing

separate estimates for persons who had finished schooling by the time of the test.

Additional Specifications

         In addition to the 2SLS procedure described above, we also estimate two

additional specifications for all our outcomes:

Discontinuity Sample

         The specification in equations (1) and (2) uses all months for identification of the

SSA effect but allows other factors to impact IQ scores smoothly (linearly) through the

discontinuity point.9 As a robustness check, we also estimate our equation on the

subsample of individuals born in either December or January, thereby using only the

individuals born close to the discontinuity for identification. In this case, the local linear

trend is unidentified and so is excluded from the estimating equation. The assumption

underlying use of the discontinuity sample is that December and January observations are

exchangeable so that, on average, their outcomes differ only because of the difference in

their school starting ages.

Family Fixed Effects

         There has been some recent evidence that the timing of births may be manipulated

by parents based on school starting age cutoffs; to the extent that this is true and that


9
 Note that, even using all months, the discontinuity in ESSA is necessary for identification as, in the
absence of the jump in January, ESSA would be perfectly correlated with the linear trend.


                                                                                                          13
these parents may be “different” on other dimensions as well, our estimates may be

biased.10 However, because we have data on the population of Norway, we can also

investigate the relationship between school starting age and long run outcomes within

families, thereby differencing out any time-invariant family qualities. To do so, in some

specifications we estimate the 2SLS regressions with additional dummy variables for

each set of siblings. These specifications will provide consistent estimates unless the

timing of births amongst siblings is correlated with the counterfactual outcomes of the

children. This seems unlikely as child endowments are not known before birth but could

arise if, for example, parents decide to strategically time the second child in response to

indications that the first child was low quality.



                       4. The Norwegian Childcare and School System

        In Norway, children under the age of seven can be placed in a daycare facility;

Norway has both public and private facilities. However, prior to the mid 1970s, labor

market participation rates for married women were relatively low, with rates in the 35%

range in the 1960s and in the 40% range in the early 1970s. In addition, families faced a

shortage of daycare facilities during that period. As a result, prior to 1980, daycare

enrollment for children between the ages of 3-6 was around 10 percent or less, with a

large increase during the 1980s.11

        In the late 1970s through the 1980s, there was a large increase in labor force

participation rates of married women, to over 70 percent by 1990. This was accompanied

by a larger increase in preschool enrollment. The expansion that began in the 1980s

 Up to 1980, most daycare facilities were located in urban areas and most catered to the children of
working mothers.


                                                                                                       14
represented a particularly sharp increase in coverage in rural areas. Appendix Table 1

shows preschool coverage by age of child from 1963-2002. (Source: Pettersen, 2003).

While our data broadly cover children aged 6 between 1968 and 1994, most of our

outcomes rely on children born in the earlier part of the period. This suggests that, during

the time period relevant to our sample, most children were at home prior to enrollment in

school, either with their mother or an informal childcare provider such as a grandparent

or a neighbor.

           In terms of schooling, all compulsory education in Norway is free. Since 1997,

schooling has been compulsory from age 6 to 16 (10th grade). However, the cohorts we

consider faced a school starting age of 7 and 9 years of compulsory schooling (until age

16). Schools are generally run by the local Municipality and there is no streaming by

ability during the years of compulsory schooling.12

           Norway has mandatory military service of between 12 and 15 months (fifteen in

the Navy and twelve in the Army and Air Force) for men between the ages of 18.5 (17

with parental consent) and 44 (55 in case of war). However, the actual draft time varies

between six months and a year, with the rest being made up by short annual exercises.

Students have tended to attend university after completing military service with the result

that average age of college students is 22 in Norway (Mortimore et al, 2004).



                                                   5. Data

           Our primary data source is the Norwegian Registry Data, a linked administrative

dataset that covers the population of Norwegians up to 2006 and is a collection of

different administrative registers such as the education register, family register, and the
12
     There are very few private schools in Norway and only about 2% of all pupils attend them.


                                                                                                 15
tax and earnings register. These data are maintained by Statistics Norway and provide

information about educational attainment, labor market status, earnings, and a set of

demographic variables (age, gender) as well as information on families.13 To ensure that

all individuals studied went through the Norwegian educational system, we include only

individuals born in Norway. We have information on school starting age for cohorts born

from 1962 onwards and our analysis focuses on the 1962-88 cohorts.

        The IQ data are taken from the Norwegian military records from 1980 to 2005. In

Norway, military service is compulsory for every able young man. Before entering the

service, their medical and psychological suitability is assessed; this occurs for the great

majority between their eighteenth and twentieth birthday. IQ at these ages is particularly

interesting as it is about the time of entry to the labor market or to higher education.

        The IQ measure is a composite score from three speeded IQ tests -- arithmetic,

word similarities, and figures (see Sundet et al. [2004, 2005] and Thrane [1977] for

details). The arithmetic test is quite similar to the arithmetic test in the Wechsler Adult

Intelligence Scale (WAIS) [Sundet et al. 2005; Cronbach 1964], the word test is similar

to the vocabulary test in WAIS, and the figures test is similar to the Raven Progressive

Matrix test [Cronbach 1964]. The composite IQ test score is an unweighted mean of the

three subtests. The IQ score is reported in stanine (Standard Nine) units, a method of

standardizing raw scores into a nine point standard scale that has a discrete

approximation to a normal distribution, a mean of 5, and a standard deviation of 2.14 We

have IQ scores on about 84% of the relevant population of men in Norway.15                   16




13
   See Møen, Salvanes and Sørensen [2004] for a description of these data.
14
   The correlation between this IQ measure and the WAIS IQ has been found to be .73 (Sundet et al., 1988).
15
   Eide et al (2005) examine patterns of missing IQ data for the men in the 1967-1987 cohorts. Of those,
1.2 percent died before 1 year and 0.9 percent died between 1 year of age and registering with the military


                                                                                                        16
         In terms of educational attainment, we measure education at the oldest age

possible for each individual i.e. in 2006.17 To get as close as possible to completed

education, we do not include anyone in the education sample who is aged less than 27 in

2006.

         In terms of teenage childbearing, we study two related outcome variables. The

first is whether a woman has a child as a teenager, and the second is whether a woman

has a child within 12 years of her expected school starting age. While the former is the

more standard measure of teenage childbearing, the latter is plausibly a better measure of

whether early motherhood is likely to disrupt human capital accumulation and hence later

earnings potential. Given that most of our sample completes at least 12 years of schooling

and 12 is the modal level of schooling, this outcome variable measures whether women

are likely to find it difficult to obtain the normal level of education because they have

children.

         We construct the first variable by restricting the sample to women aged at least 36

in 2006 and denoting a teen birth if they have a child that is aged at least 16 in 2006 who

was born before the woman was aged 20.18 The second dependent variable is constructed


at about age 18. About 1 percent of the sample of eligible men had emigrated before age 18, and 1.4
percent of the men were exempted because they were permanently disabled. An additional 6.2 percent are
missing for a variety of reasons including foreign citizenship and missing observations. There are also
some missing IQ scores for individuals who showed up to the military.

16
  One concern is that missing IQ is nonrandom and is related to SSA. To examine this, we regressed an
indicator whether IQ is missing on SSA using the standard specification; while the OLS results are positive
and significant, 2SLS estimates were small and insignificant. We got similar results when we examined
missing earnings.

17
   Our measure of child educational attainment is reported by the educational establishment directly to
Statistics Norway, thereby minimizing any measurement error due to misreporting. This educational
register started in 1970. See Møen, Salvanes and Sørensen [2004] for a description of these data.
18
   This sample restriction is required because to know whether a woman had a teen birth we need to see
whether or not a child appears in the panel with whom she has a less than 20 years age gap. The effect is
that the cohorts we use are born between 1963 and 1969.


                                                                                                            17
using the same sample. On average in our sample, 8% of women have a birth as a

teenager and 6% have a birth within 12 years of the expected school start date.

        Finally, earnings are measured as total pension-qualifying earnings reported in the

tax registry and are available from 1986 to 2005. These are not topcoded and include

labor earnings, taxable sick benefits, unemployment benefits, parental leave payments,

and pensions.

        For the purposes of studying earnings and employment, we restrict attention to

individuals aged between 24 and 35. In this group, about 94% of both men and women

have positive earnings. Given this high level of participation, our first outcome is

log(earnings) conditional on having non-zero earnings. Since the results for this variable

encompass effects on both wage rates and hours worked (and since the earnings measure

picks up earnings from summer work by students and other short-term activity), we also

study the earnings of individuals who have a strong attachment to the labor market and

work full-time (defined as 30+ hours per week). To identify this group, we use the fact

that our dataset identifies individuals who are employed and working full time at one

particular point in the year (in the 2nd quarter in the years 86-95, and in the 4th quarter

thereafter).19 We label these individuals as full-time workers and estimate the earnings

regressions separately for this group. About 52% of our male sample are employed full

time aged 24 but this increases to 78% by age 35. The equivalent figures for women are

42% and 50%.

        Table 1 presents summary statistics for our sample.

                                                6. Results

First Stage Estimates

         In Norway during our sample period, the legal rule was that children must start

school in the year they turn 7. In practice, compliance with this rule was almost perfect

for the cohorts we study. (Appendix Table 2 shows compliance rates by birth year for

cohorts born 1962-1988.)20 This is not surprising as parents had to formally apply for an

exception from the rule and the application had to be approved by health and school

specialists as well as by the local government (Strom 2004). The high compliance rates

are reassuring as they imply that our IV estimates can be interpreted as an approximation

to the average treatment effect of school starting age rather than the usual LATE

interpretation.21

         We report first stage estimates by gender in Table 2 for the full sample and for the

discontinuity sample. Because the first stage estimates are quite similar across the

particular samples used for different outcomes, for parsimony we have chosen to report

first stages for the full set of cohorts born between 1962 and 1988. Using the full sample,

the first stage coefficient on ESSA is .80 for men and .82 for women. These change very

little when family fixed effects are added to the specification in column (3).

         As one might expect, compliance rates are lower for children born in December

and January than for persons born during the middle of the year (see Appendix Table 3).

This can be seen in the lower first stage estimate for ESSA when the discontinuity sample


20
   Bedard and Dhuey (2006), using TIMMS data, show that in 4th grade only 2% of Norwegians are not in
the predicted grade given their month of birth and Strom (2004) reports that 99.5% of the 1984 cohort of
Norwegian public school students in the 2000 PISA are in grade 10 (as they should be).
21
   Consistent with recent popular press, we find that it is the better educated mothers who are more likely to
be noncompliers; however, counter to this anecdotal evidence on “redshirting”, these mothers are actually
more likely to start their children early. (“When Should a Kid Start Kindergarten?” New York Times, June
3, 2007)


                                                                                                           19
is used (see column (2) of Table 2). However, even in this sample, the first stage

estimates are about .75.



IQ Results

Our results for IQ test scores are presented in Table 3 (we have this information only for

men). We first present the OLS results (Column 1), which suggest that SSA has a large

negative effect on military test scores. The coefficient of -.8 implies that going to school

one year later reduces test scores by 4/5 of a stanine or almost half a standard deviation.

In contrast, the OLS estimates suggest no impact of age at test, which runs counter to our

prior that older boys score higher on tests. Of course, the OLS estimates may be

suffering from selection bias, with less-able children having their school entry, and

possibly their test-taking, delayed.

       To address this issue directly, from this point forward we treat SSA and age at test

as endogenous and use the 2SLS strategy described previously. In contrast to the OLS

results, the 2SLS estimates show a strong positive effect of age at test on IQ. The

estimate implies that being one year older when taking the test increases the score by

about .22; this is one fifth of a stanine and about one tenth of a standard deviation.

Additionally, the effect of SSA is still negative and statistically significant but is much

smaller, suggesting that starting school a year later reduces IQ scores by about .06, about

one twentieth of a stanine.

       Taken together, the age-at-test and SSA coefficients provide a prediction of what

one would obtain if a boy started school a year later and, as a result of taking the exam

with his school entry cohort, took the exam a year later. In this case, the estimated SSA




                                                                                              20
effect would be the sum of the true SSA effect and the age-at-test effect. This equals .16,

which is about 8% of a standard deviation. This is somewhat lower than the findings in

the literature that use in-school tests (for example, using 9th grade GPA in Sweden,

Fredriksson and Ockert find a positive effect of SSA that is about 20% of a standard

deviation). The smaller effect is unsurprising given that our test-takers are older and that

the IQ tests probably measure fixed components of intelligence to a greater extent than

in-school tests.



Robustness checks

        In Columns (3) and (4) in Table 2, we investigate the robustness of our 2SLS

estimates to alternative specifications. In Column 3, we focus specifically on individuals

who are born in the months of December or January and hence are right around our point

of discontinuity. By restricting the sample, it is clear where our identification is coming

from. As expected, the sample size is greatly reduced and, though consistent with our

earlier findings, the results are less statistically precise.

        Finally, the fourth column includes family fixed effects estimates and controls for

the birth order of the child. The number of observations is lower for these specifications

because we exclude families in which there are not at least two boys with IQ scores.

Again, the results are quite robust to using even within-family differences for

identification. Apparently, there are no serious biases arising because of strategic birth

timing by parents.

        In Appendix Table 4 we report a set of alternative specifications to reassure that

our findings are robust to specification. These include allowing the local linear trend to




                                                                                             21
be different for each birth year, including a quadratic local trend, allowing the local linear

trend to change slope after January, including a quartic in cohort defined at the monthly

level, and including controls for maternal education, birth order, and family size. None of

these specifications provide appreciably different estimates and so we will focus on the 4

specifications in Table 3 for the remaining outcomes.22



Is the SSA effect a time-in-school effect?

         While the test is not administered in school (and is, in fact, unrelated to

schooling), there are many individuals in our sample who have not finished schooling at

the time of the test. In this case, the estimated school starting age effect will encompass

the fact that later starters have spent less time in school (since, for example, among

individuals who ultimately complete college, those who started a year later will have not

only a later school starting age but one year less of education at the time of the test.)23 To

test the sensitivity of our results to this, we break our sample into those who, ex post,

actually were finished with their schooling at the time of the test (i.e. those who have ten

or fewer years of education in 2006) and those who have not completed their education at

the time of the test (i.e. those who have at least twelve years of education in 2006).24

         One potential problem with this approach is that completed education may be

endogenous because SSA influences educational attainment. However, as we will see in




22
   While we do not report them, we have carried out similar specification checks for the other outcomes and
found those estimates to be similarly robust to specification.
23
   Leuven et al. (2006) find little evidence that time in school matters for Dutch Kindergarten children.
24
   Among those who ultimately completed 12 years of education, we are observing a mix of those who did
and did not complete their education at the time of the test – in almost all cases, persons with 12 years of
education who are born in January and so start school late had not finished schooling at the time of the test.


                                                                                                           22
the next section, there is no evidence in our data that educational attainment of men is

affected by SSA.

         These results are presented in Columns 5 and 6 in Table 3. When we restrict the

sample to cases where both early and late starters are finished education by the time of

the test, we get no statistically significant effect of school starting age and a slightly

smaller (but still statistically significant) effect of age at test. Given that we have found

relatively small effects of SSA on IQ in earlier specifications, this is consistent with even

these small effects being largely explained by the fact that early-starters have more

schooling at the time of the test (given that effect goes away in the sample where those

with an earlier starting age have no education advantage). The estimates also suggest that

a small proportion of the estimated age effect is actually a time-in-school effect.25



                                            Other Outcomes

         We are also able to examine the role of school starting age on a number of other

longer-run outcomes. These include education, earnings, and teenage childbearing.

Education

         There are a number of mechanisms through which school starting age can affect

educational attainment. Costs and benefits of schooling may vary with SSA as they are

influenced by how effectively skills are being learned in school. For example, to the

extent that older children may do better in school, this could have positive spillover

effects onto educational attainment. On the other hand, because later starters will be older




25
  Note that we are attributing the difference in the estimated effect of SSA to time in school and not to
heterogeneous treatment effects by educational attainment.


                                                                                                            23
at any educational level, their time horizon to recoup educational investments will be

shorter and this will tend to depress demand for education.

       In the returns to education literature, Angrist and Krueger (1991) first used

quarter of birth (as a proxy for school starting age) as an instrument for educational

attainment acting through compulsory schooling legislation. (Students had to remain in

school until a certain age; those who started school younger would have more schooling

at the time of dropping out.) However, in the Norwegian case, compulsory schooling is

based on years of school completed and not age, so this is not relevant.

       Table 4 presents the education results separately for men and women.         As with

IQ, Column 1 has OLS results, Column 2 has 2SLS estimates using the full sample,

Column 3 has 2SLS estimates using the December and January subsample, and Column 4

has 2SLS estimates with family fixed effects and birth order controls.

       For men, the OLS estimates are strongly negative. However, as before with IQ,

there is little evidence of a causal effect of school starting age on educational attainment

for men, with 2SLS estimates being very small and statistically insignificant in both the

full and discontinuity samples. The only significant effect of SSA for men is in the family

fixed effects specification which shows a negative effect of -.06. This is not a large effect

as it implies that starting a year later reduces education by one year for about one person

in twenty.

       The results for women are quite similar. The OLS effect of SSA is large and

negative but the 2SLS specifications give small and statistically insignificant effects. The

exception is that the estimate from the discontinuity sample is statistically significant at

.07 (.03). While this is positive, it is still of modest size. Overall, the evidence for men




                                                                                               24
and women suggests that SSA has at best very small impacts on completed years of

education.26



Timing of First Birth

        Motherhood at young ages has been associated with many long-term economic

and health disadvantages such as lower education, less work experience and lower wages,

welfare dependence, lower birth weights, higher rates of infant mortality, and higher rates

of participation in crime (Ellwood, 1988; Jencks, 1989; Hoffman et al., 1993; Kiernan,

1997). There is an ongoing debate as to the extent that these adverse effects of teen

childbearing are truly caused by having a teen birth rather than reflecting unobserved

family background differences. (See Hotz, McElroy, Sanders 2005 for an example).

However, as a policy matter, efforts to reduce the rate of teen childbearing are often

considered as a strategy to improve the life chances of young women.

        There are at least three reasons we might expect early fertility to be impacted by

school starting age. First, since it is likely to be quite costly to be in school as a young

mother, starting school later may be associated with a postponement of fertility. This has

been called the “incarceration effect”; while women are in school, they do not have the

desire/time/opportunity to have a child. Second, since education increases human capital,

additional schooling may make you “smarter” and hence decide to postpone childbearing;

this might imply that later starters (who have less education at any particular age) are

more likely to have children at a given age.27 Finally, it is likely that a major effect of


26
   We have also studied whether the individual has at least 12 years of schooling as the outcome variable
and found very similar results.
27
   Black, Devereux, Salvanes (2008) discuss these mechanisms in the context of the effects of compulsory
schooling laws on teenage fertility.


                                                                                                       25
starting school young is that the child’s peer group is older than it would otherwise be.

Therefore, young starters may be more likely to engage early in adult-type behaviors such

as drug taking and sex.28 While we don’t observe these behaviors directly, childbearing at

young ages signals sexual activity.

         The first panel of Table 5 presents the results for the indicator whether or not a

girl had a birth as a teenager (less than 20 years old) and the second panel presents the

results for the indicator whether she had a birth within 12 years of her expected school

starting age. The OLS estimates suggest a small positive effect of SSA on teen

childbearing. However, when we use 2SLS, we find a statistically significant negative

effect of school starting age on teenage pregnancy for both the full sample and the

discontinuity sample, and the coefficient is about -.018 in both specifications.29 This

implies that a three month increase in school starting age reduces the probability of

teenage pregnancy by approximately 0.5 (.25*.018*100) percentage points. While the

family fixed effects estimate is smaller at -.008, it should be noted that it is quite

imprecisely estimated, with the standard error of .008.

         When we instead consider the effect on the probability of having a birth within 12

years of the expected school start, the OLS effect of SSA is .019 (.002). The 2SLS effects

of SSA are also positive and even larger: about .04 - .05. A three month increase in

school starting age will increase the probability of a birth within the first 12 years of

school by about 1.2 (.25*.05) percentage points. The family fixed effects estimate is also



28
   This argument is similar to that of Argys et al. (2006) who suggest that higher birth order children are
more likely to engage in risky behaviors at young ages because they are influenced by their older siblings.
Also, Black, Devereux, and Salvanes (2005) find that higher birth order women in Norway are more likely
to have births as teenagers.
29
   We have verified that the average derivatives of the reduced forms from probit models are very similar to
the linear probability estimates and have similar sized standard errors.


                                                                                                         26
about this size. The main reason for this large positive effect is that, 12 years after the

ESSA, January-borns are almost one year older than December-borns and age is a prime

determinant of fertility. Our estimates suggest that, although starting school older does

reduce teenage pregnancy, it still increases the probability that a girl will interrupt her

schooling to have a baby.



Earnings

       For simplicity, assume that earnings depend on (1) labor supply, and (2) the wage

rate. At age 24, some Norwegians are still in full time education and performing little

paid work. Thus, at these young ages, labor supply differences are particularly important.

Because early starters tend to finish schooling a year earlier, this is a major reason they

should have higher earnings at young ages. At older ages (late 20s on) most individuals

are working so differences in wage rates are probably the dominant reason for earnings

differences. Since wages depend on human capital, they depend on skills acquired up to

the end of schooling, and skills developed through work experience after schooling.

       Given that, empirically, there is little impact of starting age on schooling

attainment or IQ scores, the biggest effect of SSA on earnings probably comes from the

fact that early starters tend to have more work experience at any age. Since age-earning

profiles are concave, this should imply that the effects of starting later get more positive

(or less negative) as people get older. For this reason, we exploit the fact that we have

panel data on earnings from 1986 to 2005 in order to examine how SSA effects change

with age. To follow persons from age 24 (when some have not finished schooling) to 35

(at which point the marginal value of a year of extra labor market experience should be




                                                                                              27
getting low), we use a sample born between 1962 and 1970. Notice that a crucial feature

of our data is that we can follow cohorts (and even individuals) as they age and so can

distinguish between cohort and age effects. In contrast, in their Swedish study,

Fredriksson and Ockert (2006) have only 1 year of earnings data and so cannot make this

distinction.

        For maximum flexibility, we estimate separate regressions by age for all

specifications. One potential problem is that earnings may be generally higher in a

particular year because of, for example, favorable economic conditions. As a result, we

do not want to compare earnings in one year for December-borns to earnings in a

different year for January-borns. So, as before, we redefine a birth year to include people

born between July 1 and the following June and measure earnings for all individuals in

the redefined birth year at the same time.

        As mentioned earlier, we study the earnings of all labor market participants and

the earnings of full time employees in an effort to distinguish labor supply from wage

effects. We present the same four specifications as before for both log earnings of all

individuals with positive earnings (Table 6 for men and Table 8 for women) and log

earnings of full time workers (Table 7 for men and Table 9 for women). We run each

regression by age and the reported coefficients are the effect of SSA on log of earnings.

The estimated SSA effect gives the effect of school starting age conditional on age so

(assuming no effect of SSA on educational attainment) can be interpreted as the benefit

of spending a marginal year before starting schooling rather than after finishing

schooling.




                                                                                           28
         The OLS estimates for men are negative, and the negative effect gets larger as

men get older. This is inconsistent with the effects of SSA wearing off with experience

but is probably explained by the fact that earnings at older ages provide more information

about skills and late starters are negatively selected. Unsurprisingly the 2SLS estimates

are very different. For men, the main finding is that higher SSA leads to lower earnings

until about age 30. This is true both for all earnings and for the subsample of full-time

workers. The negative effects of SSA are greater in the discontinuity sample than in the

full sample but for the most part the differences between methods are not very large.30

Quantitatively, the initial negative effects are larger (about 10% at age 24) when all

earners are included than when only full-time workers are included (about 5% effect at

age 24). This is consistent with much of the earnings impact coming through differential

labor supply, with older school starters working fewer hours at younger ages. The

estimates for women in their 20s are generally similar to those of men but are less

precisely estimated.

         After about age 30, the 2SLS estimates for both men and women become close to

zero and are almost always statistically insignificant. Given the large sample sizes, the

estimates are quite precise and we can be confident that there is no large effect of school

starting age on earnings in either direction once men or women are in their mid-30s.31

         Figure 1 presents a visual representation of the estimates (and the upper and lower

confidence intervals) from the 2SLS all-male workers specification. At age 24, the

30
   We expect the estimates using the discontinuity sample to be a little more negative at early ages because
when we use that sample we do not account for the fact that December-borns are one month older than
January-borns when earnings are measured.
31
   In our standard 2SLS specification, we estimate both the SSA effect and the linear trend. The linear trend
gives the value of an extra month of age, conditional on SSA, and so is the return to potential experience
provided there is no cohort effect conditional on the year of birth dummies. While we do not report the
estimates, we have verified that by age 35, the coefficient on the linear trend also becomes negligible and
statistically insignificant. This is consistent with the return to experience being close to zero by that age.


                                                                                                           29
effect on male earnings is particularly large, being about 10%. However, this negative

effect disappears relatively quickly and by age 32 is almost gone. Figure 2 plots the

estimates for full time male workers. Figures 3 and 4 provide the analogous picture for

women.32

        The fourth rows in Tables 6-9 provide family fixed effects estimates for log

earnings. The numbers of observations are lower in these rows as we have omitted cases

where there are not at least two observations from the same family in a particular

regression. For men the fixed effects estimates are somewhat imprecise but are broadly

similar to the other 2SLS estimates. The fixed effects estimates for women are not very

informative, as the standard errors become quite high.



Additional Robustness Check

        In Figures 5 – 10, we plot the estimates on the month of birth dummies from

regressions that simply regress the outcome variable on the month of birth of the

individual and the year of birth dummies.33 These are essentially descriptions of the

reduced forms underlying our earlier 2SLS estimates. The January effect is normed to

zero in all figures. These figures provide a simple description of the raw data that

provides intuition for the model estimates. It is important to remember that each point in

the figures is an estimate and so much of the variation can be attributed to sampling error.

Even still, the reduced form effects of ESSA underlying our 2SLS estimates are clearly


32
   One might still be concerned that 35 is too young an age to cease the analysis. We have information on
ESSA, but not SSA, for cohorts born between 1950 and 1962 and we have used the 1950-1965 cohorts to
estimate the reduced forms all the way from ages 22 to 40. As can be seen in Appendix Figures 2 and 3, the
ESSA effect between 36 and 40 is always close to zero and never statistically significant. Given the
generally high compliance rates, this suggests the SSA effect is also very small for these ages.
33
   We do not have an analogous figure for IQ because, given the age-at-test effects, there is no clear
relationship between month of birth coefficients and the estimated SSA coefficient.


                                                                                                       30
visible for teen pregnancy and for earnings at age 24, as the jump between December and

January is very apparent. On the other hand, the basis for finding no SSA effect on male

education and earnings at age 35 is also obvious, as there is no jump between December

and January for these outcomes.



                              Heterogeneous Effects of SSA

       One concern might be that, by looking at the entire sample, we are missing

important differences across the distribution of children. One might expect the effects of

school starting age to differ based on the family’s characteristics. For example, children

from poorer families may be more at risk and hence suffer most from being young in

school; wealthier families may be able to better offset any negative school effects.

       To examine this directly, we regress each outcome (by gender) on a variety of

family background characteristics (mother’s education, family size, and birth order) and

obtained a predicted value for each individual. Using this predicted value as our index of

family background (essentially just a weighted average of the three family background

characteristics), we divide the sample into 4 quartiles and present the results separately

for the first quartile, the second and third quartiles, and the fourth quartile. Table 10

presents these results.

       As can be seen, there is some evidence that the effects of school starting age are

strongest for the most disadvantaged groups (note that, with the teenage pregnancy

outcome, the highest quartile is the most disadvantaged, as the outcome is a negative

one). This is particularly true with earnings at age 24 for both men and women and

teenage childbearing for women.




                                                                                             31
                                       7. Conclusions

       The literature has come to two broad conclusions about the relationship between

school starting age and children’s outcomes. First, much research has shown a consistent

pattern that children who start school at older ages tend to score higher on in-school tests.

The second broad conclusion in the literature is that, when tested at the same age, very

young children score better on in-school tests if they started school younger and hence

have spent more time in school. These findings suggest that school starting age may have

significant effects on the outcomes of adults. In this paper we find that this is, for the

most part, not the case. Despite the fact that the effects of SSA on in-school tests in

Norway are as large as those in the U.S. (Bedard and Dhuey 2006), the long-run effects

of SSA seem very modest. For men, there appear to be no long-term effects on education

or earnings, and the effects on military test scores are very small when one allows for

age-at-test effects. For women, there is little evidence of large impacts on educational

attainment. An intriguing result is that starting early increases the likelihood of giving

birth as a teen but reduces the likelihood of giving birth within 12 years of starting

school. Overall, there is not much evidence to suggest that there are strong reasons for

parents to hold their children out of school or to time the births of their children to

influence school starting age.

       The results also speak to the validity of starting age (or quarter of birth) as an

instrument for educational attainment as used by Angrist and Krueger (1991). In

Norway, individuals are required to stay in school for a particular number of years of

school, not until a certain age. As a result, starting school at a different time will have no




                                                                                             32
effect on educational attainment through compulsory schooling legislation. Since we do

not find longer-run effects of school starting age on earnings (once we consider a sample

aged at least 30), school starting age or quarter of birth may be a valid instrument for

educational attainment.




                                                                                           33

Sample includes cohorts born between July 1962 and June 1970. All regressions include indicators for year of birth (defined as running from July to the
following June). The regressions in rows (1), (2), and (4) also include a linear trend that runs from July to the following June. In addition, row (4) contains family
fixed effects and birth order dummies.
The Discontinuity Sample includes only persons born in December or January.
The sample used with family fixed effects includes only families in which there are at least 2 boys.
Standard errors in rows (1), (2), and (3) allow for clustering by birth cohort (defined in months).

      Sample includes cohorts born between July 1962 and June 1988. All regressions include indicators for year of birth (defined as running from July to the
      following June).
      The Discontinuity Sample includes only persons born in December or January.
      Standard errors allow for clustering by birth cohort (defined in months).

Appendix Figure 1 illustrates the discontinuity between test month cutoff and age at test in our data. The
discontinuity comes from the following: For each cohort of men (though the definition of cohort varies over
time), there is a specified year in which they required to take the test. This implies that there are cutoff
months such that persons born before that month take the test a year earlier than persons born in that month
and after. In the figure, zero corresponds to cutoff birth months and -1 to birth months that are one month
previous to a cutoff birth month etc. The figure shows how average age at test varies depending on where
the person’s birth month is relative to the relevant cutoff birth month for that individual.
