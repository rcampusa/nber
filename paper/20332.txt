                                             ABSTRACT

While at least a dozen state legislatures in the United States have recently considered bills to allow
the consumption of marijuana for medicinal purposes, the federal government is intensifying its efforts
to close medical marijuana dispensaries. Federal officials contend that the legalization of medical
marijuana encourages teenagers to use marijuana and have targeted dispensaries operating within 1,000
feet of schools, parks and playgrounds. Using data from the national and state Youth Risk Behavior
Surveys, the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 and the Treatment Episode Data Set, we
estimate the relationship between medical marijuana laws and marijuana use. Our results are not consistent
with the hypothesis that legalization leads to increased use of marijuana by teenagers.

These last couple years, the amount of attention that’s been given to medical marijuana has been
huge. And when I've done focus groups with high school students in states where medical
marijuana is legal, they say “Well, if it’s called medicine and it’s given to patients by caregivers,
then that’s really the wrong message for us as high school students.”

--R. Gil Kerlikowske, Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy



                                     1. INTRODUCTION

       Tobacco and alcohol use by American high school students has been declining since the

mid-1990s. Marijuana use followed a similar trend until the mid-2000s, when, according to data

from Monitoring the Future, there was a 3 to 4 percentage-point increase in the percentage of

high school students who reported having smoked marijuana in the past 30 days accompanied by

a similarly-sized decrease in the percentage of 10th and 12th graders who view regular marijuana

use as risky (Johnston et al. 2011). Federal officials, including the Director of the Office of

National Drug Control Policy (also known as the “Drug Czar”), have attributed these

developments to the legalization of medical marijuana, noting that the medical marijuana

industry has grown dramatically since the mid-2000s.

       In an effort to combat youth marijuana use, John Walsh, the U.S. Attorney for Colorado,

recently sent letters to medical marijuana dispensaries located within 1,000 feet of schools asking

them to relocate or close. Walsh cited figures from the Colorado Department of Education

showing that drug-related school suspensions, expulsions and law enforcement referrals

increased dramatically from 2008 through 2011 (Ingold 2012), and he was quoted as saying that

many school districts in Colorado “have seen a dramatic increase in student abuse of marijuana,

with resulting student suspensions and discipline” (McCrimmon and Jones 2012). Melinda

Haag, the U.S. Attorney for the Northern California district, has targeted dispensaries located

within 1,000 feet of schools, parks, and playgrounds, arguing that marijuana serves as a gateway

                                                  1
drug and that, because “brains are not fully developed until your mid 20s”, youth are particularly

susceptible to its effects (Brooks 2012). Local law enforcement authorities have also argued that

there is a connection between the legalization of medical marijuana and the use of marijuana by

teenagers. For instance, Tim O’Connell, the Deputy Police Chief in Billings, Montana, was

quoted by Uken (2012) as saying, “We are definitely seeing an increase in the schools, and it’s

definitely related to bad legislation…We can thank the passage of legalizing marijuana.”

       There is, in fact, evidence that adolescents and young adults who use marijuana are more

likely to use other substances such as alcohol and cocaine (Saffer and Chaloupka 1999;

DeSimone and Farrelly 2003; Williams et al. 2004; Yörük and Yörük 2011), as well as evidence

that they are more likely to suffer from mental health problems (Fergusson et al. 2003; van Ours

and Williams 2011), partake in risky sexual behaviors (Rashad and Kaestner 2004), and do

poorly in school (Yamada et al. 1996; Roebuck et al. 2003; van Ours and Williams 2009).

However, only two previous studies have examined the relationship between medical marijuana

laws (hereafter MMLs) and marijuana use among minors.1 Drawing on data from the National

Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) for the years 2002 through 2007, Wall et al. (2011)

found that rates of marijuana use among 12- through 17-year-olds were higher in states that had
1
  Several studies have examined the relationship between MMLs and marijuana consumption
without focusing on minors. Khatapoush and Hallfors (2004) used data on 16- though 25-year-
olds living in California and 10 other states. They found no evidence that marijuana
consumption went up after California legalized medical marijuana in 1996. Using data for the
period 1995–2002 from Denver, Los Angeles, Portland, San Diego and San Jose, Gorman and
Huber Jr. (2007) found little evidence that marijuana consumption increased among adult
arrestees as a result of the legalization of medical marijuana. Chu (2013) found that legalization
was associated with an increase in arrests of young adult males for marijuana possession. Cerdá
et al. (2012) examined the cross-sectional relationship between MMLs and marijuana use among
adults 18 years of age and above. Other studies have examined the relationship between the
decriminalization of marijuana and marijuana use (Thies and Register 1993; Saffer and
Chaloupka 1999; Damrongplasit et al. 2010; Williams 2004). See also Van het Loo et al. (2002)
who discussed the decriminalization of drug use in Portugal, and Adda et al. (2011) who
analyzed the relationship between the depenalization of cannabis possession and crime in
London.
                                                2
legalized medical marijuana than in states that had not, but noted that “in the years prior to MML

passage, there was already a higher prevalence of use and lower perceptions of risk” in states that

had legalized medical marijuana (p. 714). Drawing on NSDUH data for the years 2002 through

2009, Harper et al. (2012) found that legalization was associated with a small reduction in the

rate of marijuana use among 12- through 17-year-olds.

       The current study examines the relationship between MMLs and marijuana consumption

among high school students using data from the national and state Youth Risky Behavior

Surveys (YRBS) for the years 1993 through 2011. These data cover a period when 16 states,

including Alaska, California, Maine, Oregon and Washington, legalized medical marijuana.2

The NSDUH did not provide information on substance use at the state level prior to 1999. As a

consequence, neither Wall et al. (2011) nor Harper et al. (2012) had information on substance

use among 12- through 17-year-olds in these states before legalization occurred.

       Another advantage to using the YRBS data is that they contain information on the

behavior and characteristics of individuals, allowing us to examine the relationship between

MMLs and marijuana use by age and gender. With two exceptions (Khatapoush and Hallfors

2004; Cerdá et al. 2012), previous studies in this area have relied on aggregate data, despite the

fact that the choice to smoke marijuana is made at the individual level. Finally, the YRBS data

contain information on marijuana use and availability at school. These outcomes are of special

interest given the current efforts in California and Colorado to close dispensaries operating near

schools.
2
  Appendix Table 1 provides a list of states that have legalized medical marijuana during the
period 1993 through 2011. A number of states legalized medical marijuana prior to 1999,
including California, Oregon and Washington. The District of Columbia legalized medical
marijuana on July 27, 2010. Although the New Jersey medical marijuana law came into effect
on October 1, 2010, implementation was delayed (Brittain 2012). Coding New Jersey as a non-
medical marijuana state in 2011 has no appreciable impact on the results presented below.

                                                 3
        Our results suggest that the legalization of medical marijuana is not accompanied by

increases in the use of marijuana among high school students. Specifically, estimates from our

preferred specification are small, negative and statistically indistinguishable from zero. Using

the 95 percent confidence interval around these estimates suggests that the impact of legalizing

medical marijuana on the probability of marijuana use in the past 30 days is no larger than 0.8

percentage points.

       In addition to analyzing data from the YRBS, we conduct two complementary analyses.

The first uses data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97). The

behavior of NLSY97 respondents can be observed over time, allowing for the estimation of

models that control for unobserved heterogeneity at the individual level. The second uses data

from the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS), which contains information from drug treatment

providers on patients who reported using marijuana before being admitted. These analyses

provide further evidence that youth marijuana consumption does not increase with the

legalization of medical marijuana.



                                     2. BACKGROUND

       In 1996, California became the first state to legalize medical marijuana. Since then, 20

additional states and the District of Columbia have legalized medical marijuana, and more than a

dozen state legislatures have recently considered medical marijuana bills (Klofas and Letteney

2012). In addition to removing criminal penalties for using, possessing and cultivating medical

marijuana, medical marijuana laws provide immunity from prosecution to physicians who

recommend medical marijuana to their patients.




                                                 4
       While the therapeutic properties of marijuana are the subject of debate (Gilman 2005;

Cohen 2009), the client base of doctors who recommend medical marijuana has expanded to

include adolescents with conditions such as autism, insomnia, obsessive compulsive disorder,

and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (Browstein 2009; Ellison 2009; Joseph et al. 2010).3

Advocates of recommending medical marijuana for these conditions maintain that it is safer than

alternative medicines such as methylphenidate (also known as “Ritalin”), the stimulant most

often prescribed to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (Lucido 2004; Ellison 2009), and

zolpidem tartrate (also known as “Ambien”), a medication prescribed to treat insomnia

(Chaboya-Hembree 2012).

       Patients under the age of 18 must have the permission of a parent or legal caregiver in

order to use medical marijuana, and must be accompanied by a parent or legal caregiver when

visiting a dispensary (Ellison 2009). Moreover, there is evidence from registry data that only a

small percentage of medical marijuana patients are minors. For instance, only 0.08 percent of

medical marijuana patients are under the age of 18 in Arizona; in Montana, 0.13 percent of

patients are under the age of 18.4 However, because it is prohibitively expensive for the

government to ensure that all marijuana ostensibly grown for the medicinal market ends up in the

hands of registered patients, diversion to the recreational market almost certainly occurs, and

ambiguity surrounding the source of supply creates legitimacy for illegal suppliers and decreases




3
  Medical marijuana has also been used to treat adolescents suffering from chronic pain. Belkin
(2009) described the case of a 9-year-old autistic boy who used medical marijuana to treat
constant pain.

  Arizona and Montana are the only MML states that publicly record the age distribution of
registered patients.

the risk of selling marijuana to recreational users (Pacula et al. 2010).5 These supply-side factors

could, in theory, lead to lower prices in the illegal market and increase youth consumption.

         On the demand side, researchers, policymakers and law enforcement officials contend

that legalization reduces the stigma associated with the use of marijuana (Roan 2011; Suthers

2012; Uken 2012) and encourages young people to underestimate the health risks associated with

marijuana use (O’Connor 2011; Roan 2011). In addition, legalization could increase demand by

providing more opportunities for young people to interact with legitimate users (Pacula et al.

2010). Not surprisingly, past research has shown that attitudes and perceptions with regard to

the harmfulness of marijuana are strongly correlated with use (Bachman et al. 1998; Pacula et al.

2001).

         Our empirical analysis is reduced-form, based on the approach taken by previous

researchers interested in the determinants of marijuana use. For instance, Farrelly et al. (1999)

examined the reduced-form relationship between more stringent anti-marijuana policies and

marijuana use, while Thies and Register (1993), Saffer and Chaloupka (1999) and Williams

(2004) examined the impact of decriminalization. In a similar vein, Pacula (1998), Farrelly et al.

(2001), and Williams et al. (2004) examined the impact of alcohol and cigarette policies on

marijuana use.




5
  It has been estimated that thousands of pounds of surplus medical marijuana are diverted to the
illegal market in Colorado (Wirfs-Brock et al. 2010), and there is anecdotal evidence that MMLs
have led to a substantial increase in the supply of high-grade marijuana in California
(Montgomery 2010). Consistent with this anecdotal evidence, Anderson et al. (2013) found that
the legalization of medical marijuana was associated with a substantial reduction in the price of
high-quality marijuana. Thurstone et al. (2011) interviewed 80 adolescents (15 through 19 years
of age) undergoing outpatient substance abuse treatment in Denver. Thirty-nine of the 80
reported having obtained marijuana from someone with a medical marijuana license. Florio
(2011) described the story of four eighth-graders in Montana who received marijuana-laced
cookies from a medical marijuana cardholder.
                                                 6
       These studies provide some evidence that marijuana use is sensitive to changes in policy.

For example, Farrelly et al. (1999) found that stricter enforcement of marijuana laws by police

and higher fines for marijuana possession decreased use among adults. However, Farrelly et al.

(1999) found that these policies had little impact on marijuana use among those under the age of

21. Using data from the United States, Thies and Register (1993) found that decriminalization

did not lead to increased use of marijuana, while Saffer and Chaloupka (1999) found that

decriminalization increased the probability of having smoked marijuana in the past 30 days.

Using Australian data, Williams (2004) found that decriminalization increased marijuana use

among males over the age of 25, but had no effect on marijuana use by females or by younger

males. Finally, Farrelly et al. (2001) found that cigarette taxes were negatively related to

marijuana use, while Williams et al. (2004) found that cigarette prices were essentially unrelated

to marijuana use.



                                        3. THE DATA

       The primary data for this study come from the national and state YRBS. They are at the

individual (micro) level and cover the period 1993 through 2011.6 The national YRBS is

conducted biennially by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and is a

nationally representative sample of U.S. high school students. Federal agencies rely upon the

national YRBS to track trends in adolescent behavior including eating and exercise habits,

violence, sexuality, and substance use. Previous studies such as Merrill et al. (1999) and Abdel-

Ghany and Wang (2003) have used these data to examine determinants of youth marijuana use.


6
 The national YRBS was first conducted in 1991. However, because the 1991 wave is based on
only a handful of schools, we chose to omit it from the analysis.

                                                 7
The state surveys are coordinated by the CDC and are administered by state education and health

agencies. Like the national YRBS, the state YRBS is school-based and contains multiple items

designed to elicit information on risky behaviors. To our knowledge, no previous study has used

state YRBS data to examine the determinants of youth marijuana use.

       Our analysis draws on both of these data sources in order to ensure that identification is

based on as many MML changes as possible. Although intended to be nationally representative,

not all 50 states are represented in any given wave of the national YRBS. In fact, between 1993

and 2011, only 6 states contributed data to the national YRBS every year (California, Florida,

Georgia, Michigan, New York, and Texas), and 11 states contributed data to the national YRBS

before and after the legalization of medical marijuana (Arizona, California, Colorado, Delaware,

Hawaii, Maine, Michigan, New Jersey, New Mexico, Oregon, and Washington). Appendix

Table 2 shows the number of observations by year and state in the national YRBS. States that

legalized medical marijuana are denoted with a star superscript and post-legalization

observations are italicized.7

       With a few exceptions, most states conducted their own version of the YRBS sometime

between 1993 and 2011, and at least 15 administered the YRBS in any given year during this

period.8 However, only 24 states have given the CDC permission to release their data, while 20

states require that requests to use their data be made directly. We obtained data from 11 of these

20 states, bringing our total to 35, 11 of which conducted surveys before and after the


7
  In the regression analyses, the fraction of the year that the law was in effect was used when a
state legalized medical marijuana during a survey year. We experimented with assigning 0 to
these years; we also experimented with assigning 1 to these years. The results, which are
available upon request, were similar to those reported below.

 The following CDC webpage provides a detailed history of the state YRBS:
http://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/yrbs/history-states.htm.

                                                 8
legalization of medical marijuana (Alaska, Arizona, Delaware, Maine, Michigan, Montana,

Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, Rhode Island, and Vermont). Appendix Table 3 shows the

number of observations each state contributed to the state YRBS analysis. Again, states that

legalized medical marijuana are denoted with a star superscript and post-legalization

observations are italicized.

       When combined, the national and state YRBS data cover the District of Columbia and 49

states; sixteen of these states contributed data before and after the legalization of medical

marijuana.9 Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for the national and state YRBS samples by

whether medical marijuana was legal at the time of the interview. According to the national

YRBS data, 22 percent of high school students used marijuana at least once in the past 30 days,

and 9 percent used marijuana at least 10 times during the past 30 days (our definition of frequent

use). In the state YRBS data, 21 percent of respondents used marijuana in the past 30 days and 8

percent were frequent users.

         Figure 1 presents trends in marijuana use based on weighted national YRBS data. It

shows a steady decline in marijuana use among high school students from the late 1990s through
9
  For instance, California contributed two years of pre-legalization data and 8 years of post-
legalization data to the combined analysis; Colorado contributed 3 years of pre-legalization data
and 4 years of post-legalization data to the combined analysis; Maine contributed 3 years of pre-
legalization data and 7 years of post-legalization data to the combined analysis; Michigan
contributed 8 years of pre-legalization data and two years of post-legalization data to the
combined analysis; Montana contributed 6 years of pre-legalization data and 4 years of post-
legalization data to the combined analysis; New Mexico contributed 5 years of pre-legalization
data and 3 years of post-legalization data to the combined analysis; Rhode Island contributed 5
years of pre-legalization data and 3 years of post-legalization data to the combined analysis;
Vermont contributed 4 years of pre-legalization data and 3 years of post-legalization data to the
combined analysis; and Washington contributed 3 years of pre-legalization data and 4 years of
post-legalization data to the combined analysis. Wyoming is the only state for which we do not
have national YRBS or state YRBS data. Medical marijuana was illegal in Wyoming during the
period under study. Although the District of Columbia legalized medical marijuana in 2010, it
has never conducted a state YRBS and contributed observations to the national YRBS in only
two years, 1995 and 2011.

                                                  9
2007. From 2007 to 2011, the percentage of high school students who used marijuana in the past

30 days increased from 19.7 percent to 23.1 percent. Figure 2 presents trends in marijuana use

based on unweighted state YRBS data. Despite the fact that they are designed to be

representative at the state level, these data show the same steady decline in marijuana use from

the late-1990s through the mid-2000s and a comparable increase after 2007, suggesting that the

national and the state YRBS are capturing the same broad changes in tastes and policies.

       Figures 3 and 4 present pre- and post-legalization trends in marijuana use based on

national and state YRBS data, respectively. We report marijuana use for the three years prior to

legalization, the year in which the law changed (year 0), and the three years following

legalization. These figures provide simple and direct tests for whether youth marijuana

consumption changed with the legalization of medical marijuana. In Figure 3, there appears to

be a small decrease in marijuana use immediately after legalization, followed by an increase of

comparable magnitude. A similar pattern is evident in Figure 4: marijuana use decreases

immediately after legalization, increases after one year, and then decreases again by a

comparable amount after two years. Although neither figure provides strong evidence of an

increase in marijuana use after legalization, other factors related to, for instance, economic

conditions could be masking the impact of legalization.



                                  4. STATISTICAL METHODS

       In an effort to control for economic conditions and other policies (as well as any changes

in the composition of the YRBS), we turn to a standard regression framework that exploits both

temporal and spatial variation in MMLs. Specifically, we estimate the following equation:




                                                 10
(1)               Marijuana Useist = β0 + β1MMLst + X1istβ2 + X2stβ3 + vs + wt + Θs ∙ t + εist,



where i indexes individuals, s indexes states, and t indexes years. The vectors vs and wt represent

state and year fixed effects, respectively, and state-specific linear time trends are represented by

Θs ∙ t. The state-specific linear time trends are included to control for unobserved factors at the

state level that evolve smoothly over time such as preferences and tastes. The variable MMLst is

an indicator for whether medical marijuana was legal in state s and year t. The coefficient of

interest, β1, represents the effect of medical marijuana legislation.10

         The dependent variable, Marijuana Useist, is equal to 1 if respondent i reported using

marijuana in the past 30 days, and equal to 0 otherwise. The vector X1ist includes individual-

level controls for age, sex, race and grade, while the vector X2st includes state-level controls for

whether marijuana use and possession was decriminalized, the presence of a BAC 0.08 law, the

state beer tax, income per capita, and the unemployment rate. Previous research has shown that

marijuana use is sensitive to decriminalization (Saffer and Chaloupka 1999), alcohol policies

(Pacula 1998; DiNardo and Lemieux 2001) and economic conditions (Hammer 1992). All

regressions are estimated as linear probability models and standard errors are corrected for

clustering at the state level (Bertrand et al. 2004). In addition to examining marijuana use in the

past 30 days, we examine frequent marijuana use, marijuana use at school, and whether the

respondent was offered or bought marijuana on school property. Descriptive statistics for these

outcomes are presented in Table 1.




10
 Anderson et al. (2013) used a similar empirical strategy to examine the effects of MMLs on the price of
marijuana, traffic fatalities, and alcohol consumption. As a test of exogeneity, these authors regressed changes in
MMLs on state-level policies. Neither alcohol- nor drug-related policies predicted the legalization of medical
marijuana.

       Tables 2 through 5 present unweighted OLS estimates of the relationship between MMLs

and the outcomes discussed above. Separate estimates for the national and state YRBS are

presented along with estimates based on the combined data.

       Using the national YRBS and a “bare bones” specification without covariates or state-

specific linear time trends, legalization of medical marijuana is associated with a 5.6 percentage

point decrease in the probability of marijuana use within the past 30 days, and a 3.5 percentage

point decrease in the probability of frequent use (Table 2). We can reject the hypothesis that the

relationship between MMLs and these outcomes is positive at conventional levels. The same

specification yields smaller, but still negative, estimates of β1 using the state YRBS data. When

the national and state YRBS data are combined, we find that the legalization of medical

marijuana is associated with a 2.1 percentage point decrease in the probability of marijuana use

within the past 30 days, and a 1.1 percentage point decrease in the probability of frequent use.

We can reject the hypothesis that the relationship between legalization and these outcomes is

positive at conventional levels.

       A similar pattern of results emerges when the covariates and state-specific linear time

trends are included on the right-hand side of the estimating equation. In these specifications, the

estimates of β1 are uniformly negative, although they are not statistically distinguishable from

zero.11 Ninety-five percent confidence intervals around the point estimates produced when using

the combined YRBS data and controlling for state-specific linear time trends suggest that the

impact of legalization on the probability of marijuana use in the past 30 days is no larger than 0.8

11
  Appendix Table 4 presents estimates that incorporate the sample weights provided by the
national YRBS. Again, there is little evidence that legalization of medical marijuana led to
increased marijuana use among high school students.

percentage points and the impact of legalization on the probability of frequent marijuana use in

the past 30 days is no larger than 0.7 percentage points. In comparison, based on nationally

representative data from Monitoring the Future, marijuana use among 12th graders increased by

4.3 percentage points from 2006 to 2011; marijuana use among 10th graders increased by 3.4

percentage points over this same period.12 Based on national YRBS data, marijuana use among

high school students increased by 3.4 percentage points from 2007 to 2011.

       In Table 3, we explore whether the relationship between MMLs and marijuana use

depends on gender. These estimates are from our preferred specification that includes the full set

of covariates and state-specific linear time trends. With one exception, they are negative and

statistically indistinguishable from zero. The hypothesis that β1 for male respondents is equal to

β1 for female respondents is never rejected.

       Table 4 compares estimates of β1 for YRBS respondents who were under the age of 17

when they were interviewed with estimates for respondents who were 17 years of age or older.13

In the national YRBS data, the relationship between legalization and marijuana use is negative

and significant among respondents under the age of 17, but insignificant among respondents 17

years of age and older. The relationship between legalization and frequent use is negative (but

  Estimates of marijuana use in the past 30 days for 8th, 10th, and 12th graders are available from
Johnston et al. (2011) and are based on data from Monitoring the Future. Monitoring the Future

However, state identifiers are generally not made available to researchers. Our efforts to obtain
these data were politely rebuffed.

statistically insignificant) among both younger and older respondents. The remaining estimates

of β1 in Table 4 are small and statistically insignificant.14

        Table 5 reports estimates of the effect of legalization on the use of marijuana on school

property in the past 30 days and estimates of the effect of legalization on the probability a

student reported having been offered, sold, or given an illegal drug at school in the past year.

These estimates are of particular interest given the recent attempts to close dispensaries operating

near schools (Brooks 2012; McCrimmon and Jones 2012). The estimated relationship between

MMLs and the use of marijuana on school property is consistently negative, but never

statistically significant. In the combined sample, legalization is associated with a 2.7 percentage

point decrease in the probability of having been offered, sold, or given an illegal drug at school

in the past year



5.1 Analysis of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997

        In this section, we examine the relationship between MMLs and the use of marijuana by

youth in the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97). The NLSY97, which is

conducted annually, is a nationally representative sample of individuals who were 12 through 16

years of age as of December 31st, 1996. It contains detailed information on educational

attainment, family background and socio-economic status, and its respondents are asked a host

questions with regard to marijuana use including, “On how many days have you used marijuana




14
  Although the results are not reported, we estimated equation (1) for respondents 18 years of
age and older. There was no evidence that the legalization of medical marijuana was associated
with an increase in marijuana use among this age group. Appendix Table 5 presents estimates
that incorporate the sample weights provided by the national YRBS. They are similar to those
reported in Table 3 and Table 4.

                                                  14
in the last 30 days?”15 Because our focus is on teenagers, we limit the analysis to respondents

ages 12 through 19 at the time of the survey.

       There are two primary benefits to using the NLSY97 data. First, unlike the YRBS, the

NLSY97 includes high school dropouts. This is important because high school dropouts are

more likely to use marijuana than their counterparts who stay in school (Bray et al. 2000).

Second, because the NLSY97 data follow adolescents over time, it is possible to control for

unobserved heterogeneity at the individual level.

       However, there are two significant drawbacks to using NLSY97 data. First, California

legalized medical marijuana before data collection began and several other states legalized

medical marijuana when most of the NLSY97 respondents were in their twenties and thirties.16

Second, several of the states that legalized medical marijuana in the late 1990s and early 2000s

contributed only a handful of observations to the NLSY97.

       Table 6 presents descriptive statistics from the NLSY97 and Table 7 presents regression

results. Specifically, we report estimates from the following equation:



(2)            Marijuana Useist = β0 + β1MMLst + X1istβ2 + X2stβ3 + λi + wt + Θs ∙ t + εist,



where i indexes individuals, s indexes states, and t indexes years. Year fixed effects are

represented by wt, and state-specific linear time trends are represented by Θs ∙ t. The variable


15
  Based on the answers to this question, we are able to construct measures of marijuana use that
correspond to the marijuana use measures in the YRBS data. Economists who have used these
data to study determinants of marijuana use include Aughinbaugh and Gittleman (2004), Cowen
(2011), and Yörük and Yörük (2011).
16
 For instance, New Mexico legalized medical marijuana in 2007, when the average age of
NLSY97 respondents was 25.

                                                 15
MMLst is defined as above and β1 represents the effect of medical marijuana legislation on

marijuana use in the past 30 days. In addition, we examine the relationship between MMLs and

frequent marijuana use defined as having used marijuana on at least 10 of the past 30 days. The

vectors X1ist and X2st are composed of the individual- and state-level controls, respectively.17

       Because NLSY97 respondents are observed in multiple years, we are able to include

individual fixed effects, λi, on the right-hand side of the estimating equation. In addition to

absorbing time-invariant heterogeneity at the individual level, these effects account for factors at

the state level that may be correlated with marijuana use and the legalization of medical

marijuana, although it is important to note that identification comes from changes in the law and

from movement between states with different MMLs. All regressions are estimated as linear

probability models and standard errors are corrected for clustering at the state level (Bertrand et

al. 2004).

       Each cell in Table 7 represents the results from a separate regression. Estimates in

column (1) are based on a specification that includes only individual and year fixed effects;

estimates in column (2) are based on a specification that also includes the covariates listed in

Table 6; and estimates in column (3) are based on a specification that adds state-specific linear

time trends. Consistent with the YRBS analyses above, there is little evidence to support the

hypothesis that MMLs encourage marijuana use by teenagers. Although 5 of the 6 coefficient

estimates are positive, none are statistically significant at conventional levels. If the largest

estimates are taken at face value, the legalization of medical marijuana is associated with a 0.7

percentage point increase in the probability of marijuana use in the past 30 days, and a 1.3

percentage point increase in the probability of frequent use. Appendix Table 6 presents

  The state-level controls are identical to those used in the YRBS analysis. The individual-
levels controls include indicators for education status, which are not available in the YRBS.

estimates that incorporate the sample weights provided by the NLSY97.18 They are consistent

with those reported in Table 7.



5.2 Analysis of the Treatment Episode Data Set

       Finally, we examine the relationship between MMLs and marijuana use based on state-

level data from the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS) for the period 1992 through 2009.

Federally funded drug treatment facilities are required to provide information to TEDS including

whether a patient reported using marijuana prior to admission. Using these data, we constructed

rates of marijuana use at the state level by year.19

       There are at least two advantages to using the TEDS data. First, like the NLSY97, the

TEDS data include high school dropouts. Second, the TEDS data are compiled annually and

very few states fail to provide admissions data. In contrast, the YRBS data are collected

biennially and only a subset of states contribute data in any given year. Descriptive statistics for

the TEDS data are presented in Table 8.

       To estimate the relationship between MMLs and marijuana-positive admission rates, we

estimate the following equation:



(2)            ln(Marijuana admission rateast) = β0 + β1MMLst + Xstβ2 + vs + wt + Θs ∙ t + εast,




18
  Following Mellor (2011), we used the average of the sample weights for each individual for
the years in which he or she participated in the NLSY97.
19
  Other economists who have used these data include Anderson (2010), Corman et al. (2010),
Cunningham and Finlay (2011), and Nonnemaker et al. (2011).

                                                  17
where a indexes whether the observed admission rate is for males or females, s indexes states,

and t indexes years. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of the sex-specific

marijuana admissions rate per 100,000 of the relevant population. Because TEDS does not

provide the exact age or date of birth, we consider marijuana admission rates for two age groups:

15- through 17-year-olds and 18- through 20-year-olds. Again, the variable MMLst indicates

whether a MML was in effect in state s and year t, the vector Xst is composed of the controls

described in Table 8, and vs and wt are state and year fixed effects, respectively, and state-specific

linear time trends are represented by Θs ∙ t.

       Table 9 presents the estimates from (3).20 Each cell represents the results of a separate

regression. Estimates in column (1) are based on specifications that only include state and year

fixed effects. The estimates in column (2) are based on specifications that add the covariates,

and the estimates in column (3) are based on specifications that include state-specific linear time

trends. Consistent with the YRBS and NLSY97 analyses above, there is no evidence to support

the hypothesis that MMLs increase marijuana use among 15- through 17-year-olds. In fact, the

estimates of β1, although statistically insignificant, are uniformly negative. Likewise, there is no

evidence that medical marijuana laws are associated with increased use among 18- through 20-

year-olds.



                                       6. CONCLUSION

       Medical marijuana is popular with the general public. A recent Gallup poll found that 70

percent of Americans say they favor making marijuana legally available for doctors to prescribe

in order to reduce pain and suffering (Mendes 2010).

20
  The slight difference in sample size between estimates for 15- through 17-year-olds and 18-
through 20-year-olds is due to missing values.
                                                 18
       Given this level of support, it could be viewed as surprising that only 21 states have

legalized medical marijuana. However, opponents of medical marijuana have employed a

number of effective arguments, several of which focus on the use of marijuana by teenagers. For

instance, Montana State Senator Jeff Essmann was quoted in 2011 as saying, “The number one

goal is to reduce access and availability to the young people of this state that are being sent an

incorrect message that this is an acceptable product for them to be using” (Florio 2011).

       In order to examine the relationship between medical marijuana laws and youth

consumption, we draw on data from the national and state Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (YRBS)

for the years 1993 through 2011. These data cover a period when 16 states, including California,

Colorado, Montana, Oregon and Washington, legalized medical marijuana, and allow us to

estimate the effect of legalization on outcomes such as marijuana use in the past month, frequent

marijuana use, and the use of marijuana on school property.

       Our results are not consistent with the hypothesis that the legalization of medical

marijuana caused an increase in the use of marijuana among high school students. In fact,

estimates from our preferred specification are small, consistently negative, and are never

statistically distinguishable from zero. Using the 95 percent confidence interval around these

estimates suggests that the impact of legalizing medical marijuana on the probability of

marijuana use in the past 30 days is no larger than 0.8 percentage points, and the impact of

legalization on the probability of frequent marijuana use in the past 30 days is no larger than 0.7

percentage points. In comparison, based on nationally representative data from Monitoring the

Future, marijuana use in the past 30 days among 12th graders increased by 4.3 percentage points

from 2006 to 2011 (Johnston et al. 2011); based on national YRBS data, marijuana use among

high school students increased by 3.4 percentage points from 2007 to 2011. One potential



                                                 19
explanation for this pattern of results is provided by Anderson and Rees (forthcoming). These

authors noted that legalization allows suppliers to sell to adults with some assurance of not being

prosecuted, while selling marijuana to a minor is still a risky proposition even with the

legalization of medical marijuana.

       In addition to the YRBS analysis, we examine data from the National Longitudinal

Survey of Youth 1997 (NLSY97) and the Treatment Episode Data Set (TEDS). The NLSY97

allows us to follow survey respondents over time, while the TEDS data allow us to examine a

high-risk population. There is little evidence that marijuana use is related to the legalization of

medical marijuana in either of these data sources, a result that is consistent with research

showing that marijuana use among adults is more sensitive to changes in policy than marijuana

use among youths (Farrelly et al. 1999; Williams 2004).

       Although our estimates do not lend support to the often-voiced argument that legalization

leads to increased consumption of marijuana among teenagers, it is important to note that our

study has at least one limitation: the YRBS data are only available through 2011 and the TEDS

data are only available through 2009. In the past few years several states have seen dramatic

changes to the market for medical marijuana. For instance, as a result of Drug Enforcement

Agency raids, the number of providers in Montana has plummeted. As future waves of the

YRBS are released, researchers will be in a position to update our estimates and explore whether

these changes have affected the behavior of teenagers.
