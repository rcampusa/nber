              A TIMESERIES ANALYSIS OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND HEALTH:
                 THE CASE OF BIRTH OUTCOMES IN NEW YORK CITY


                                       ABSTRACT



           The paper presents an aggregate    time-series   analysis of unemployment

and infant health that improves on previous work in several ways.         First,

the data is monthly as opposed to annual and pertains to New York City from

January,   1970 to December,   1986.   Second, a structural production function

is estimated in which the race-specific percentage of low-birthweight

births is the health outcome. Because we are able to control for the

race—specific percentage of women who begin care in the first trimester as

well as the percentage of births to unmarried mothers, the unemployment

rate as a proxy for maternal stress enters the production function as one

among a set of well—defined health Inputs.         Third, because a pregnancy is

limited to at most ten months, we can specify a lag length with confidence.

Fourth. the data is tested for stationarity and the production function is

estimated in levels as well as in deviations from trend.         We find no

cyclical   variation   in the percentage of low-birthweight    births.   The

results are insensitive     to changes in lag length. the omission of relevant

inputs, and the functional form of the coefficients         on the distributed lag.

        Social     scientists continue            to investigate the          aggregate       time--series
relationship          between    unemployment            and   health.1 Qie attraction               is that
time-series analysis            is an     inexpensive means of investigating relation-
ships    in less than real time.                      Although        cross-sectional analysis has
similar advantages, the lack of                    temporal      variation prevents a                 clear

determination          of whether poor              health causes unemployment,               or whether

unemployment worsens health.                    Epi demi ol ogical      research,       on    the other

hand,    has       focused on work               as a    risk factor for various             diseases and

injuries.      However, as       Catalano          and    Ser,qner(1987)           point out, policy
makers       are     primarily concerned with the net effects of the business
cycle on health Tbus, tine--series analysis with aggregate data                                     has     the

potential to canplenent the work from micro--level studies.
    To date, aggregate tine-series has failed to achieve a consensus

regarding the effect of economic doc.nturns on morbidity                               and    mortality.
The     lack of clear conclusions                       has    been    attributed to a bust of
metFcdological sburtcomings.t This paper attempts                             to   overcome     a     number

of the        most     serious      weaIc-esses          by estimating a           structural       model   of
infant health. In particular, we use naithly data from New York City to
examine the impact of economic fluctuations on race specific variations

in the   percentage    of low birthweight births. An important feature is
that    we   are able to control for the utilization of prenatal care and the
incidence of         out—of—wedlock       childbearing. TPtis,           if   there    is an effect of
unemployment         on   health,    we can shed         light   on whether economic da.aiturns

indirect effect thraigh decreased                 consumption      of prenatal care             and

increased mental          instability.
        Only Brenner        (1973.     1979,     1983)    has    studied     the     time--series


relationship between unemployment and                 infant health. In his earliest
work,     annual changes        in the     United States unemployment              rate were in-
versely related to annual            changes    in the rate of     fetal    and     infant      mor-

tality.     In the latter two studies, changes in the infant n-ortality rate

in England, Scotland, and Hales were positively associated with                              mova-


ments    in the   unemployment       rate. Althoogh      the more recent work controlled

for     other factors and       used a    polynatial distributed lag specification,
the robustness of the results            has been      challenged (Gravelle, Hutchinson
and     Stern 1031). Specifically, the authors faind that                   Brenner's    results
were sensitive to the time periods under                 study, the variables used,              and

the functional form of the distributed lag.

        This study represents a                more    rigorous     test of the time-series
relationship between         unemployment and         health than has previously                been

possible.     First, the data is rranthly                  and   pertains to only       one     city
           a large one). Aggregation over time and                 region            smooth      out
(albeit                                                                      can

local     variations in        unemployment and health. Second, the measures of

health and medical care utilization are                  race--specific.          Sjsiness cycle

variations may            impact differently on white and black birth outcanes.

Third, we estimate an infant health production function derived frat a

behavioral        model    of health. Previous studies have estimated a "hybrid'

function in which reduced form determinants are employed as proxies                              for

structural inputs. Such approaches yield biased estimates of the health

                                                                            cur     indicator     of
tecimology (Rosenzweig and             Schtjltz       1033).    Fourth,

health,     the     percentage of        low birtheeight         birthe, is a well--treasured
predictor     of infant mortality and childhood morbidity (tVtCormick 1985).

Yet, unlike infant mortality, the modest                     decline       in low   birthweight     over

the   past twenty years cannot be attributed                       to techoological         change, an

exceedingly difficult variable to                   control for in         time—series analysis.

Fifth, we test the          data more rigorously for             stationarity.        Recent     work   in
time--series econanetrics                 has    shown      that inappropriate        detrending can

yield    highly spariaas results (Granger                   and Newbold 1974; Nelson and Kang

1984).

                                                Schultz (1993),               (1997),      and   Cormor,
      Following          Rosenzweig and                              Joyce

Joyce, and Grossman                (1987),       we assume      the parent's utility function

depends on         their   own consumption,         the   number   of birthe,       and     the health

of    each        child at birth. Both the                  number    of births     and    the infant's

health at         birth are choice variables. In particular, birth                               outcomes

depend       on    such     factors as the quality              and    quantity of medical core,
nutrition, stress,           and   the    own    time of the mother.         They   also     depend     on

the mother's reproductive efficiency which includes                                   an     unobserved

biological         component,   or health         endos'xnent, as     well as other aspects of

her   efficiency in hasehold production.
        The preceding ideas          are formalized          in the following        model:

                   h = f1(m,d,u,e)                                   (1)

                   m =   f2(p,w.y,e)                                 (2)

                   d =   f3(p,w,y,e)                                 (3)

                   u =                                               (4)
                         f4(p,w,y,e)
Equation (1)             is the structural production function for it relates the

incone (y), the      value   of time (w). and again the                  mother's health           endow-

meat   (e).

because family history, previous pregnancies, and more                            recently,          diag--

nostic    procedures such as amiocentesis                       can      warn     the      mother and

physician about genetic abnormalities or other conditions that could
canplicate the pregnancy and            birth.   Such       cicwledge, generally               una-own    to
the researcher, can motivate                 women     with less favorable                endowments      to
consume more care, to avoid stressful situations, and to even alter                                      the

timing and       number of their births. Cross--sectional studiem have shown

that estimates     of the production function can                   be    seriously            biased     if
this    form    of simaltaneity is not controlled                        (Rasenzweig and          Schultz
1963; Carmen, Joyce, and Grossman 1967). The implications far                                  aggregate
time- series are discussed in Section                III.
       Folling       Erenner (1973), unernploment enters                   the production func
tion   as a proxy for maternal stress. Although several studies have found

significant     associations between stressful events and                         preterm          births,

the results are difficult to generalize (Norbeck and Tilden 1963; Newtcn

et al. 1979; Gorsuch end Key 1974;).             Qe         reason is the different               instru

ments used to measure stress. Another reason is the lack of control far

other factors that can mitigate the impact of stress. For example, there

is evidence that pregnant women with strong social                             netwarks are             less

affected                                                                                  psychalogical
                                                                                      '

               by stressful      events than women with few such

assets'   (Nuckolls,     Cassel, and Kaplan 1972). To control far                          a      lack   a
social    suppurt,      we   will      include the          percent of births to unmarried

women, a well--documented risk factor far law birthwmight                             (Institute of


                                                 4
Medicine 1985).

       A difficulty of using unemployment to proxy stress is that pregnant

women who          work   beyond the seccnd trimester,                or women whose jobe are

physically demanding.          may be at risk of           a     preterm   or   low--birtheeight

birth       (Naeye and Peters 1982; Mamelle, Launtn and Lazar 1984). In other

words, adverse birth outcomes may vary                  procyclically for       a        segment    of
the    pregnant popilation.            The     magnitude        of this offsetting effect is
unknoc'n,    bt     it may have    a greater impact on black           birth cutcanes since
a greater proportion           of black     women   ore   mare   apt to work in low—wage and

physically     strenuous settings.

       Previous       time-series      analyses       of       unemployment and          health have
lacked an adequate measure             of   medical     cars     utilization. Its           omission

would bias upwards             the effect of        unemployment on        health   if    the demand

for    medical care varied        procyclically.          In the birth outcome           literature,

it     is    widely accepted that appropriate prenatal care has a favorable

impact on birth outcanes (Institute of                    Medicine     1985).       If    preventive

care    is     a    normal     good,   then     the demond for prenatal care will fall

during a recession           (Elliot, Logerfo, and Doling 1085). Nhether                    it     will

fall    sufficiently to effect aggregate birth outcomes is unclear because

nen     with health insurance that              includes maternity benefits                  may     be

unaffected by a           recession.    However,       until the     Pregnancy Discrimination

Act of 1978, only         57   percent of the         employees      covered    by health           in
surance in           1977 had policies which included maternity benefits                     (Health

Insurance          Association of      America        1982).     Although the percent               of



       In  1980, white wanen    in the New York Labor Market Area were mare
       likely than black and other women to work in white collar jobs (76.8
       percent versus 59.7 percent) and ware less likely to be service
       workers (11.5 versus 28.0) [u.s. Deportment of Labor 198lj.
employees with maternity benefits rose to 80 percent by 1982, Gold and

Kenney (1985)         estimated that          25    percent    of the   wanen    in    the U.S.      18     to
24   years      of    age lacked any public             or private health insurance in                1984.

Women      is to   24 account for 40 percent                of   all birtl-s.

        Changes      in   birth rates over the business                 cycle represent another

mechanism by which                   unemployment may impact on           infant health. Specifi--
cally,      increased     fertility may            worsen   birth   outcomes     if    the   women   at the
margin of the labor force are                 fran groups with          above     average       risks of
adverse      birth    outcanes. Teenagers and unmarried                  women    are two      examples

As with        prenatal care,            failure to ccntrol for the changes in the dis
tribution of births             among    risk groups, may bias the estimated effect of
unemployment on           infant health.5
        Whether      fertility          varies procyclically or countercyclic&ly is
still      disputed.      Sutz and Ward (1979) argue that                  recessions lower the
opportunity costs of a                   woman's      time which increases            birth rates         v4ith

annual data        fran the United States, Sutz                  and Ward show     that the cyclical
riovement     in female        wages can     explain the countercyclical pattern of                       U.S.

fertility      since the mid 1960's.                However, Macunovich and            Easterlin (1988)
report a negative effect of                 unemployment on         fertility.     The   authors apply
a   Granger-Sims causality              test to nonthly U.S. data.              They   find causality

      It     should       be    noted,  however, that lower time costs could have a
     positive effect            on birth outcomes,            if

           In sum, supporters of the stress hypothesis, of                         which Brenner       is

the most               prominent,     argue that unemployment worsens birth outcomes

directly by increasing maternal stress, and indirectly by altering the

consumption of health inputs. However, if work anong pregnant women is a

risk factor               for prematurity,       and if fertility varies over the business

cycle, then the net effect of unemployment on infant health                              is ambiguous
a priori.

                                         III.    Empirical Test
Data

           The data on          low   birtksueight,    prenatal care             and   ajt-ofwedlock
childbearing              are from micro-level         vital statistics for New York City.

Each year of data has been aggregated by rrcnth                           for blacks      and    whites
separately from January,                  1970   through December,          1986    (N=204). The data
for whites contain              a large component which is               Hispanic.     Ethnicity      was

not        identified       on New York    City birth certificates until               1078.    In   1984,

the   first       year     in   which doto on Hispanics were published, 50 percent                     of
all        white       nen      who delivered a     live birth     were     of Hispanic origin;         85

percent of the Hispanic mothers were white                        (New    York   City Deportment       of

Health 1985).
           New    York      City averaged approximately 100,000 resident live births
over the time span under study. The percentage                           of births to white           and

blacks           has   varied    between 69     percent white     and 29     percent black in        1970

to    56   percent white         and 37 percent      black   in   1985. Because        the absolute
number       of births         in the earlier years, the number of births
                                was   higher
by race has remained relatively stable, approximately 6000 white births
and 3000 black births irnthly.

           The     race-specific percentage of low birth,veight births is the
indicator of infant health. Low birthweight is a major risk factor for

infant mortality and childhood morbidity (Institute of Medicine 1085).

It is also well—reported on birth certificates.                                  In New     York     City less

than       .01 percent        of the birth records lacked: data                      on   birthweight in any
one      year.                                       -


          Prenatal care           is measured        by the race--specific number               of births to
women      who        began                 first trimester over the total number of
                                  care: in the
births to        women      who had any care at all. The other health inpjt is the

percentage            of    births to unmarried women. Prior to 1978, nen with no
care were coded             the   same as women whose                 prenatal care       was unknowo.         From

1978       and    on,       nen with no prenatal care and                        women whose      care   was   un
covr       were coded         separately. To maintain a consistent series                          we     ignored
the distinction from                    1978    to   1986. Thus, the aenominator is the number

of   sen         with at least some             care.
          The percentage          of    women   with       no   care or       whose care was unknowo            has

remained         relatively stable for               blacks hot has increased among whites. In

1970,      l3 percent of          all    black mothers              and 6   percent of white mothers           who

delivered         a        live birth reported no                   care or    their care was      uncnowo. By

1980,      the figures         were 16         percent          for: blacks hot           16.5 percent          for
whites. Of the                 16   percent, approximately two--thirds represented                           women

who had no        care.       The   large increase for whites                   is   probably      due    to the
declining         proportion of births                   to white,      non--Hispanic      women    in   New   Yprk

City.      Census data combined                with unpiblished estimates by the                      New York

City Department of Planning indicate that in                                    1970, 25.7      percent of      all
whites, males and females,                      were       of Hispanic origin.               By     1980,-     that

anng        wes,        it is unlona.nwhether             the proportion of         wanen who had no

care   varied over          the decade.    This could           introduce measurement           error
which       should     be    kept in      mind when         interpreting the        results. Marital

status,      on the other hand, has             been consistently well—reported; less

than    1   percent   of the    annual    birth       records lack data on marital status.

       The     New    York   City   unemployment          rate is fran the Current Pop.jlation
Survey. Because         of small sample sizes, the             unemployment         rate is unavail--
able by sex,      race,      or age.7     The      employment—pop.ilatiai  ratio is also
available for           New    York   City.     The   ratio is the total number of persons
employed over the           noninstitutional population               16    years    and   over. Al--

though      the   unemployment          rate allows for greater canparison with other
published work, the employment—population ratio                            may be more   sensitive to
variations in discouraged workers. This may more accurately reflect the
labor market status of teenagers and minorities. The simple correlation
between      the two labor market         measures        is   .76.

                                   is questionable whether a sex--specific
    unemployment rate would be appropriate.   First,  it might fail to
    capture the loss of work by a male head of household. Itreover, the
    female unemployment rate would increase the potential     for mintil
    taneous  equation bias between                 fertility
                                             and labor market participa

    employment found that the unemployment rate raner--caused                               fertility
    (Macunovich and Easterlin 1988).

1981)       test was       applied to the natural               logarithm of each series. The

results are presented in Table               1.   With respect     to the logarithms of the
percentage       of    low   birtkweight births and the percentage of white                         wanen

unit root.

        Eased    on   the     Dickey--Fuller        tests we specify two             sets    of regres-

stochastic trend such that a                     linear combination of the series yields              a

       The    functional form of the production function                       is   assumed    to    be

linear (in logs).               The unemployment           rate is specified as a distributed
lag.   The maxisum      duration of pregnancy provides                 a    strong rationale        for
truncating the lags            after the tenth month. The             assumption     is that stress
induced by businesscycle                    changes has no impact on           the fetus prior to

conditioned on the anticipated birth outcome. For instance, women who

                                                         a

with the greatest impact in the third trimester (lags 0 through 3).
     To check whether the lack of statistical significance may have been

caused       by    rrulticollinearity,                 we     reran the regressions using an                          Almon

distributed lag.           The     coefficient          on    the conta,iporaneous lag                    was uncon-

strained        and    the lag         on   the eleventh             month was assumed           to be zero.             The

maxirmim length        of     a    pregnancy         justified the               endpoint       restriction.
imposed       a second-order                polnornial            on the         coefficients            based on        the

pattern of the unconstrained estimates.                               The    results were        unchanged               (not
shown).       The     sum         of the    lags was         --.36   for blacks (t-ratio = -1.46)                        and

--.03   for whites (t--rotio                =   -.10); in neither case                  were   the       sum        of the
coefficients        on the unemployment rate statistically different fran zero.

        The     negative coefficients on the                               unemployment        rate in the black
regressions suggest that low birthweight                                   may     vary procyclically: As
discussed       in Section II, there is epidemiological evidence that                                              pregnant
women     who work       in stand-up jobs               and who continue                to work into the third
trimester may         be   at risk of            a   preterm or low              birthweight         birth           (Naeye

and     Peters        1982;       Mamelle,           Laumon,         and   Lazar 1984). Moreover, it                     was

anticipated       that a procyclical effect would be more                                 likely for                 blacks

given     their       disproportionate representation in such jobs. To further

examine    this proposition,                we reduced the number                 of lags from                10 to 3.
There     was     little change. The sum                 of the coefficients was                     .   17   with a t-

ratio of       --1.43.

         To   test whether the results in Table                  2   were    sensitive to the
measure  of employment, we substituted the logarithm of the employment
population ratio (in first differences) for the unemployment rate.
Changes        in the ratio           have no impact on the             rate of low birthweigth
births.       The sum      of the coefficients       on the     employment—population             ratio
was      .636 for blacks ft-ratio = .36) and                     2.21   for whites (t—ratio
1.17).
         Lagged birtheeight is an important predictor of current birthweight

arroig    blacks.     It      is less important arrong whites.          Prenatal care       has     the

correct        sign   in the black regression b.it is statistically insignificant
at conventional levels. In the white regressicn. the prenatal care
coefficient has the wrong sign and is insignificant. The results imply
that     deviations around the trend           in prenatal care hava              little impact      on

similar deviations in low birthweight.                        Measurement     error   may   also    ex--

plain     the weak performance          of prenatal care. Finally,                changes     in the
percentage of illegitimate births have no                      impact on cyclical variations

in low birtheeight.

         A   major shartcoming in aggregate time-series studies of                          uneimploy

ment and         health is the inability to control for medical care utiliza

tion.     If the use of care varies procyclically,                   then   its     omission       ild
bias upwards the                effect of     unemployment.          To test this, we excluded

prenatal care and illegitimacy fran the specification in                            Table     2.    The

results        (not      shovn) change in a trivial manner. Put               differently,         there

is    no evidence              that   unemployment     has an        indirect effect          on     low



      nant aen would have to be measured with ouch greater precision
      before oure substantive conclusions could be inferred.

any impact on low birtheeight                 it is restricted to        blacks        in the       third

trimester. The          LM   tests indicate that            the residualsare         white noise.     The

stability          of the         results between different forrre           of the     data, and     the

absence of         autoorreletion suggest that a lack                   of    stationarity          arg
sone of the regressors is not a problem (Plosser and Schwert 1078).

       The        impact     of     early    prenatal        care on    the     percentage of        l-
birthweight         births      among blacks is     statistically significant. The                  coef-

ficient         indicates that       a tenpercent       increase   in the percentage of             nen

evidence that              blacks      benefit    more fron early prenatal care than do

whites          (rray    and Bernfield 1988). However, as with the detrended                         data.

                                                 Conclusion

       The        results       fron    this study call into question the findings from

previs           aggregate time--series analyses that unemployiient                    rsens        infant

health (Brenner 1973, 1979. 1983, 1987a, 1987b). With                            nthly         data as

opposed to             annual      data,    and    with the       level of aggregation greatly

reduced, we were             unable to      uncover any      deleteris effect of changes                in

the unemployment rate on the race-specific                       percentage of low birtheeight

births.          The    results      were the same regardless          a-F   whether the data were


                                                     15
detrended or in levels. The       findings were    also insensitive to laglength

manipulations,   the omission of relevant regressors, and the                 impusition
of a functional form on the       coefficients of   the    distributed lag.
     Or results say little about the impact of unemployrent on in-
dividual birth outcomes. What they do say is that the net effect is

insignificant.    However,   the results do raise doubts about the findings
from other studies that estimated the relationship            between    unemployment

and    ncrtality with annual   data and national aggregates. This          is not the
first   time such doubts   have been   raised (Kasl 1979). Sit      it   is the first
time that the misgivings with respect to large-scale tempural                 and   spa-
tial    aggregation   have been   tested with     more   refined data   and   in   a more

consistent analytical framework.       If    aggregate   timeseries analysis is to
be   useful, then better modeling    and more     detailed data are essential.

whites, the first difference of each of the series (in logs) was
characteristic of an MA(1) process. Thus, we used an autorcgres—

of the lagged residuals depends on the degree of autacorrelation being
tested. An F—statistics is computed for the coefficients on the
lagged residuals. Mutiplying F by k yields the Chi—square statistic
with k degrees of freedom. The critical value for Chi—square at the .05
