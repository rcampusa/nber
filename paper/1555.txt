                Why Construction Industry
                Productivity is Declining



                        ABSTRACT




     According to unpublished data compiled by BLS, productivity
in the construction industry reached a peak in 1968 and, except
for a brief and small upturn between 1974 and 1976, has been
falling ever since. This paper examines the sources of this
productivity decline between 1968 and 1978 by estimating a
production function to assign weights to various factors
responsible for productivity change and deriving a new price
deflator for construction which does not rely on labor or
material cost indexes, thus eliminating a systematic bias toward
overstating the rate of growth of prices.

     The production function analysis indicates that productivity
should have declined by 8.8 percent between 1968 and 1978,
representing 41 percent of the observed decline. The biggest
factor in this decline was the reduction in skilled labor
intensity resulting from a shift in the mix of output from large
scale commercial, industrial, and institutional projects to
single—family houses. Other important factors include declines
in the average number of employees per establishment, capital—
labor ratio, percent union, and the average age of workers. The
difference between the official deflator and the new deflator
proposed here accounts for an additional 51 percent of the
reported productivity decline, leaving only 8 percent of the
decline unexplained.

I.   Introduction
     According to unpublished data compiled by the Bureau of Labor

Statistics (BLS), productivity in the construction industry
reached a peak in 1968 and, except for a brief arid small upturn
between 1974 and 1976, has been falling ever since. Real output
(value added) per hour in construction fell at an annual rate of

2.4 percent between 1968 and 1978 (see Table 1).   In contrast,

between 1950 and 1968 real output per hour rose at an annual rate
of 2.2 percent. This amounts to a decline in the annual average

rate of productivity growth of 4.6 percentage points. When
productivity is measured in terms of output per employee, the
decline in the productivity growth rate is 4.5 percentage points.
     Because construction accounts for 5 percent of employment and
output, this productivity decline has had a nonnegligible effect
on the decline in aggregate productivity growth over this
period. The annual growth rate of output per hour in the nonf arm
business sector dropped from 2.4 percent between 1950 and 1968 to
15 percent between 1968 and 1978. If productivity growth in
construction had continued at the same rate as in the 1950—1968
period, aggregate productivity growth would have fallen to 1.7
percent. Viewed in this way, roughly 22 percent of the decline
in aggregate productivity growth over these periods can be
attributed to the construction industry.1
     A study by H. Kemble Stokes, Jr. (1981) of the U.S. Depart-

ment of Commerce is, to my knowledge, the only careful analysis
of the sources of the productivity decline in construction.

Stokes found slower growth in capital per worker responsible for
a 0.9 percent decline in the growth rate of productivity. No
other factor accounted for more than 0.2 percentage points, and
all factors combined accounted for a mere one—fourth of the

change in the growth rate. Stokes' analysis implies productivity
should have continued to grow at a slower rate rather than

declining.
    A more recent study by Schriver and Bowlby (forthcoming)

examines changes in real unit cost in building construction

(excluding residential structures with less than five units)

between 1972 and 1982. They obtain these estimates through
hedonic price equations that have been deflated into 1972
dollars with a weighted average of a price index for

single—family homes and the cost indexes published by the Turner

Construction Company and American Appraisal Company. They find
that changes in the mix of output within building construction
explain over one—third of the observed increase in building
costs.

    This paper takes two new approaches to explaining this

decline in productivity. First, instead of using the

conventional growth accounting framework, I use production
function estimates to assign weights to various factors

responsible for productivity change. This approach allows me to
estimate the impact of two variables that generally are excluded

in the growth accounting approach: the extent of unionization
and the mix of output. It also allows me to test whether the
4

weight given by Stokes to changes in the capital—labor ratio is

appropriate.
      Second, my analysis attempts to confront directly the issues
involved with measuring output changes over time in construction.
The price deflator used in the national income accounts is
upwardly biased because it is still largely based on cost data

for labor and materials rather than on prices of actual

projects.      I derive a new deflator for nonresidential building
construction based largely upon F. (4. Dodge data on the value and

square footage of various types of projects. Since the
appropriateness of this deflator depends upon the assumption that

square footage is a reasonable proxy for output, I use micro data

on contract amounts, square footage, and building characteristics
for four samples of buildings to assess its validity.

II. Production Function Estimates
       To determine the impact of the capital—labor ratio,

economies of scale, labor quality, percent union, composition
of   output,   and distribution of construction projects across
regions, I estimated a Cobb—Douglas production function over data
from the 1972 and 1977 Censuses of Construction Industries
CCCI). There is a separate observation for each state in each
year. This level of aggregation was selected because it allowed
me to estimate the effect of interstate variations in the

compositon of output on measured productivity. The dependent
variable is the log of the ratio of output per employee. The
                                                                   S
output measure is value added divided by an employment—weighted
average of the cross—section Dodge Cost Index for all cities in

each state (New York City in 1972=100). Since this index is
based heavily on union wages, this procedure introduces downward

bias in the union coefficient if union wages are correlated with
productivity, as discussed in Allen (1984).

    The independent variables are the ratio of capital input to

employment, the ratio of employment to establishments, predicted
earnings based on the occupational distribution in each state

(all of the above in logs), percent union, three region dummies,
and the ratios of receipts from three different types of

construction (single—family homes, office and industrial

buildings, and educational and hospital buildings) to total

construction receipts.r Capital input equals the sum of
(1) gross capital stock at year end divided by 15.15 (the average
economic life of capital in construction, as reported in Allen
(1984)) and (2) rental payments for capital. Values for 1977 are
deflated to 1972 dollars with a weighted average of the implicit

price deflatorsfrom the national income accounts, using the
shares of each type of capital in 1954—1959 total capital

expenditures for construction reported by Boddy and Sort (1971)
as weights. Data on the occupational distribution by states and
mean national earnings by occupation come from the 1970 Census of
Population. Percent union for 1972 comes from the May 1973—75

Current Population Survey micro files; for 1977, the May 1977—78
files. All other variables come from CCI.
6

    Crass section estimates for 1972 and 1977 and pooled time
series—cross section estimates + or both years are reported in

Table 2. The F—statistic f or the hypothesis that all

coefficients except the intercept are identical in both years was
0.703, well below the 95 percent critical value. Since I cannot
reject the hypothesis that all coefficients except the intercept
are the same, I will use the pooled time series—cross section
results to analyze the sources of the productivity decline in
construction.

    The results are fairly close to those obtained in Allen

(1984) for 1972 over the same data (except for a different labor

quality variable) aggregated by two—digit SIC and states or

regions. The capital—labor coefficient is larger (.24 versus
.19), while the percent union coefficient is smaller (.12 versus
.16). The capital—labor ratio coefficient is very close to the
.20 assumption used by Stokes. The only major difference between
the results in Table 2 and my earlier study is the employees per

establishment coefficient. Whereas my earlier estimates showed
no economies of scale, the results in Table 2 show a strong

positive correlation between employees per establishment and
productivity. This seems to have resulted from the different
ways in which the samples were aggregated.

    Interstate differences in the composition of construction

output are strongly correlated with measured productivity. A ten
percentage point increase in the share of single—family homes is
associated with a 2.7 percent decrease in productivity. The same

increase in the share of office and industrial buildings is
associated with a 3.4 percent increase in productivity;

educational and hospital buildings, a 4.5 percent increase.
    The coefficients of the composition of output variables lend

themselves to two interpretations. One possibility is that these
variables reflect unobserved differences in the quality of inputs
across states. Skilled labor is used more intensively in large

commercial, educational, and hospital projects than in the
construction of single—family homes. According to a series of
recent BLS Labor and Material Requirements Surveys, the
percentage of laborer, helper, and tender hours in total onsite
hours in private single—family home construction was 28 percent

in 1969. The corresponding figures for commercial office
building construction in 1972 and 1973 was 23 percent; for

elementary and secondary school construction in 1972, 22 percent;

for hospital and nursing home construction in 1975, 21 percent.5
In addition, within narrow occupational categories, there are
also important, but usually not observable (to the person
analyzing the data) differences in labor quality between

single—family home and commercial construction. The job of a
45—year—old electrician with a high school degree on a commercial
project is usually much more complex than that of a person with
identical observable characteristics on a single—family

residential project. Accordingly, many unions have now
established separate, lower rates for residential work to
compensate for these differences.
                                                                  9

   Alternatively,   these coefficients could indicate differences

in rates of return or capital intensity. To check this
interpretation, interaction terms between the composition of

output variables and the capital—labor ratio were added to the

model. The coefficients of the interaction terms, available upon

request, were either statistically insignificant from zero or

outlandishly large. Thus, the unobserved labor quality
interpretation seems most appropriate.
III. Sources of the 1968—1978 Productivity Decline
   The impact of six possible sources of declining productivity
can be examined with the regression estimates: capital—labor
ratio, economies of scale, labor quality, unionization, changes
in the location of construction activity, and changes in the mix
of construction output. This section discusses how 1968 and 1978

values for each of these factors were obtained and summarizes

their net effect on productivity.
     a. Capital—labor ratio. The capital—labor ratio
coefficient for the pooled 1972 and 1977 sample is very close to

Stokes' assumption on capital's share. Thus, any differences
between Stokes' and my estimate of the impact of the capital—
labor ratio must arise from differences in data sources and in
how capital services are derived from capital stock data. Two
different sources of capital input data were examined: the
Department of Commerce Bureau of Industrial Economics's (BIE)
series on gross stocks of equipment and structures (book value in
constant dollars) and the American Productivity Center's (APC)
i. o



index of capital input..a The BIE series (a revised and extended
version of that used by Stokes) was converted into an annual flow

of services measure by assuming a 5 percent interest rate and
17— and 40—year lengths of life for structures and equipment,

respectively. This approach is identical to that used by
Griliches (1967). Separate flow measures for equipment and
structures were derived. Since the stock of structures grew
much more rapidly than the stock of equipment (8.8 percent per

year as opposed to a 3.6 percent per year), the service flow
measure grows by less than the combined stock of structures and

equipment (4.3 versus 4.9 percent per year). The APC series
compiled by John Kendrick and Elliot Grossman provides no
breakdown between equipment and structures. The APC measure grew
at the much slower rate of 2.4 percent per year. To obtain

capital—labor ratios, both capital measures were divided by BLS's
unpublished measure of labor hours.

       The net effect of changes in the capital—labor ratio on

productivity is very sensitive to which measure is used.
According to the BIE measure, the capital—labor ratio actually
grew by 15.6 percent between 1968 and 1978, resulting in a 3.5
percent increase in productivity. In contrast, there is a 3.8
percent decline in the APC capital—labor ratio, resulting in 0.9
percent fall in productivity.

       Which estimate is more credible? The APC measure is more
consistent with the change in the capital stock data reported in

the 1972 and 1977 CCI (no capital stock data are reported in the
                                                                  11

1967 CCI, making comparisons over a longer period impossible).
The nominal capital stock in the CCI increased by 59 percent over
this period. The price deflator used in Table 2 for capital rose
by 53 percent, implying a real increase of 3.7 percent. The BIE

measure rose at the much higher rate of 25.8 percent.   In

contrast, the APC measure rose by 7.4 percent, a rate much closer
to that observed in the CCI. The BIE capital stock series is

also based upon a much less rapid depreciation schedule than the
APC series.t Assuming that the value of much of the industry's
capital depreciated very rapidly as a result of the oil price

increases in the 1970s, the APC measure better reflects economic

reality.
       b. Economies of scale. In this report I use data from the
1967 and 1977 CCI on number of establishments with payrolls. To

make the BLS labor hours measure consistent with these data, I
use values of hours for 1967 and 1977 as well. Presumably, the
1967—1977 changes closely resemble the 1968—1978 changes.
    The number of labor hours provided by the average establish-
ment shrank considerably over this period. The number of
establishments grew by 30.2 percent, while labor hours grew at a
much slower rate of 19.5 percent. This resulted in an 8.1

percent decrease in average hours per establishment. The
regression model implies that this decline in average establish-

ment size resulted in a 1.6 percent decline in productivity.

       c. Labor quality. The predicted effect of labor quality in
the regression results (.994) is almost identical to that of
12

labor hours (.943=1+.184—.241), implying changes in the labor
quality measure have the same effect as changes in labor hours.

Although differences in the occupational structure across states
were used to estimate the regression model, there is little
reason to believe changes in this variable will tell us very much

about changes in the quality of labor services over time.

Changes in the quality of labor within each occupation resulting
from demographic shifts and schooling are likely to be much

greater than the quality change implied by occupational shifts
over such a short period. Hence, I will focus on changes in the
demographic and educational mix of the labor force.

     Stokes reports the distribution of employment by sex and two
age groups (16—24 and 25 and over for 1968 and 1978). A labor

quality index is obtained by weighting these frequencies by the
corresponding value of median usual 1967 weekly earnings for the
United States (also reported in Stokes). This index falls by 3.2
percent, implying a 3.1 (.943 x 3.2) percent decline in

productivity.
     The median level of schooling for men increased from 11.3 to

12.3 years between 1968 and 1978. To evaluate the effect of this

increase on productivity in construction, I use my wage equation
estimates (Allen (1984)). These results imply a 2.6 percent

increase in predicted earnings and a 2.4 percent increase in
productivity. The net effect of changes in both demographics and
schooling is a 0.7 percent decline in productivity.

     d. Percent union. The proportion of employees belonging to
unions in construction in 1978 is 32 percent, a figure derived

from the public use tape of the May 1978 CPS. No such figure is
available for 1968. To derive an estimate of percent union for

that year, I assume the proportional change in percent union
equals the ratio of the proportional change in union membership
to the proportional change in employment. The rate of change in
union membership is derived from unpublished data compiled by

Neil Sheflin and Leo Troy of Rutgers University. Membership
figures for each of the 16 building trades unions were adjusted
for membership outside the United States and in other

industries. The employment data are unpublished BLS estimates.
     Adjusted union membership grew from 2.16 million in 1968 to

2.35 million in 1978, an 8.8 percent increase. During the same
period, employment grew from 4.05 to 5.38 million, a 32.8 percent

increase. This implies percent union in 1978 was 81.9 percent of
percent union in 1968 and sets percent union in 1968 at 39. A

decline in percent union of 7 percentage points implies a 0.8
percent decline in productivity. There is good reason to believe
this estimate is too conservative. As I argue in Allen (1984),
the use of an output deflator based heavily on union wages biases
the union coefficient downward. The union coefficient in Allen

(1984) increased by .05 when a deflator based on hedonic housing

price equations was used instead.   If the union coefficients in

Table 2 were increased by the same amount, the decline in
unionization would result in a 1.2 percent decline in

productivity.
14

     e. ReQional shifts. The Northeast and North Central
regions lost a sizable share of industry output to the South and

West. The Northeast's share of employment fell from 22.8 percent
in 1968 to 16.2 percent in 1978. The decline for the North

Central region was somewhat smaller, 26.1 to 24.0 percent.      The

West posted the biggest gain, increasing from 15.4 to 20.1
percent, while the South's share increased from 35.6 to 39.7

percent.
     Despite these sizable shifts, changes in the location of
construction activity did not contribute to the productivity
decline. Although the declines in the shares of the Northeast
and North Central regions are associated with a 0.3 percent

decline in productivity, this is offset by the 0.4 percent

increase in productivity associated with the increase in the
share of the West. Regional shifts thus resulted in a 0.1

percent increase in productivity.'
     f. Mix of output. Table 3 summarizes the change in the mix
of construction output across different types of projects between
the 1967 and 1977CCI. Over this period there was a slight shift
from building to nonbuilding construction, but the largest
changes took place within the building sector. The biggest
change in the mix of output was the increase in the share of
single—family homes from 20 to 26 percent. This was accompanied
by substantial declines in the shares of industrial and
educational buildings.

     Shifts of this magnitude make productivity comparisons based

    on aggregate data highly misleading. As noted above, the
    technology for home building is much less skilled—labor intensive

    than the technologies for larger, more complex commercial,
    industrial, and institutional structures. Such a shift in the
    mix of output results in a decline in aggregate productivity
    because sectors with relatively low productivity automatically
    receive greater weight at the expense of those with relatively
    high productivity, a classic case of what Jorgensen and Griliches

    (1967) call an error of aggregation. This bias cannot be
    eliminated from the raw data because sector—specific indexes are

    not available to calculate a Divisia index for construction.

         To estimate the effect of these changes in output mix on

    productivity, I examined the changes in the shares of the three
    contruction mix variables used in the regression model:

    (1) single—family homes, (2) industrial and office buildings,
    and (3) educational and hospital buildings. They account for
    1.6, 0.7 and 2.2 percent declines in productivity, respectively,
    representing an overall decline of 4.5 percent. This result
    is consistent with the findings of Schriver and Bowlby for
    building construction between 1972 and 1992.

         g. Total. The results of the preceding analysis are
    summarized in Table 4. The model predicts an 8.8 percent decline
    in productivity, which accounts for 41 percent of the actual
    decline. The shift in the mix of output away from commercial and

    institutional buildings and toward single—family houses was the

    biggest contributor, accounting for 21 percent of the
                                                                   17

productivity decline. The declines in the average size of

establishments, percent union, and the capital—labor ratio were
the three next most important factors, accounting for 7, 6 and 4
percent of the fall in productivity. Labor quality declined
somewhat, as an increased proportion of young and female workers
was partially offset by an increase in median years of

schooling. This factor accounted for 3 percent of the
productivity decline. Changes in the regional distribution of
construction activity had no effect on productivity.

     Although the results of this analysis may not be spectacular
in terms of their ability to account fully for the decline in

productivity, they go considerably further than previous
studies. For instance, Stokes was able to account for only a
modest decline in the growth rate of productivity between
1950—1968 and 1968—1978. His residual (unexplained changes in

the growth rate) included jj of the productivity decline.
Nonetheless, it is difficult to reconcile the model's predictions

of relatively modest productivity decline with the data. Whether
the fault lies with the model or the data remains to be seen.

IV. Has Nominal Outnut Been Overdeflated?
     The deflator used to convert nominal to real output is still

heavily based on wage and materials cost indexes. Since the rate
of change of wages is positively related to both the general rate
of inflation and the rate of productivity growth in construction,

such indexes overstate the rate of change in prices of construc-

tion projects. As a result, real output will be underestimated.
                                                                 19

     In spite of this bias, the official measure of real output
grew at a 3.8 percent annual rate between 1950 and 1968. Thus it
is difficult to attribute the negligible 0.3 percent annual

growth in output between 1968 and 1978 to this bias unless the
bias worsened during that period. On the surface, this seems to
be unlikely, especially when one takes into account the changes
in the construction deflator initiated in 1974. True price
indexes are available for only two types of construction:

single—family homes and highways. Before the revisions, cost
indexes were used for all other types of construction. The
revised indexes for nonresidential buildings, railroad and

military construction are weighted averages of these two price

indexes and various cost indexes. In theory, this should have

made the bias between 1968 and 1978 smaller.
     The impact of these revisions can be gauged by examining the

average   annual rates of change of each component of the Depart-
ment of Commerce composite deflator for construction in Table 5.
The only price indexes used in the deflator    are the Bureau of the

Census index for new one—family homes (excluding lot value) and
the Federal Highway Administration's (FHiA) indexes for
structures and composite highway construction. Between 1950 and
1968 the residential price index grew less rapidly (by about two
percentage points) than any other component of the deflator and
the FHiA index grew less rapidly than all but one of the cost

indexes, as one would expect. In the more recent period, a
different pattern emerged. The residential price index still

rose at a slower   rate   than most of the cost indexes, but not all

of them. Also, the gap between this index and the cost indexes

narrowed to less than one percentage point. Despite upward bias,
no cost index rose more rapidly than the FHiA composite index.
This presents a puzzle——why did the cost indexes and the price
indexes grow at roughly the same rate between 1968 and 1978 in
contrast to the pattern during 1950 to 1968? Are there any

answers other than stagnant or declining productivity?
     Two developments in the 1970s provide a partial answer.

First, to the extent that extremely high inflation rates caused
the prices to single—family homes to grow more rapidly than the
prices of nonresidential buildings, the use of the housing price

index in the deflator for nonresidential buildings has resulted
in additional upward bias. To understant why, consider the
effect of inflation on housing prices under the tax codes- The
size of tax deductions for interest payments increases by the
same proportion as the interest rate, which, in turn, rises much
more proportionally than the overall price level. For instance,
suppose 5 percent inflation increases interest rates from 4 to 9

percent. Tax deductions would more than double despite a
relatively much smaller increase in prices. This lowers the user
cost of housing and increases demand for owner—occupied housing.
Even though interest costs are deductible for other types of

private construction, demand will grow less rapidly because both
depreciation and profits from sale of a project are based on

historical cost. Other things equal, prices for nonresidential
It
construction   should have grown less rapidly than residential.
While housing prices increased at an annual rate of 8.6 percent

between 1968 and 1978, the Turner Construction Company cost index
increased at a rate of 7.6 percent. Thus, the use of the housing

price index for nonresidential buildings resulted in a higher
estimate of the rate of price change than would have been

obtained with the upwardly biased cost indexes previously used in
the price deflator.

     The other development was changes in the mix of highway
construction. In addition to a shift from rural to urban highway

construction, the projects completed in rural areas changed
considerably between 1968 and 1978 as a result of the near

completion of the interstate highway system. This system
accounts for most of the capital outlays for new highway
construction in both periods. The rural segments were largely

complete by 1968 except for some short segments in areas in which
geographical factors made costs per mile especially high. This
is reflected in a rapid rate of increase in excavation costs

between 1968 and 1978. Excavation costs increased at an annual

rate of 11.4 percent, 1.4 percentage points more than the rate of
increase in the rural composite index. Since the Federal Highway
Administration CFHiA) index makes no adjustments for changes in

highway characteristics over time, this index overstates the true

rate of price change between 1968 and 1978. This bias can be at
least partially eliminated by using an index based on urban
construction only. In addition to controlling for urban—rural
shifts, it also avoids the bias resulting from the changing
character of rural construction. Urban highway construction may
very well have changed in a similar fashion; if this is so, some

upward bias remains. Urban highway construction costs increased
at an annual rate of 8.4 percent over this period, 1.2 percentage
points slower than the FHiA composite index.
    There is no easy solution to the bias resulting from the
inappropriate use of the residential deflator for nonresidential

building construction. One alternative is to give greater weight
to the cost indexes, but the fundamental problem of upward bias
jr-i both periods remains..   Instead, I propose a deflator equal to

the difference between the rate of change of value put in place
and the rate of change of square footage put in place for

nonresidential building construction as reported by Dodge
Construction Potentials.. This deflator increased at an average
annual rate of 6.9 percent between 1968 and 1978. This rate is
only moderately slower than the growth of other indexes——1.7
percentage points slower than the index for homes and 1.9
percentage points slower than the median of all the cost indexes
used in the composite deflator. These differences are consistent
with the direction o-f the biases described above. Although the
magnitude o-f these biases is impossible to gauge, it seems to me
more plausible for them to be in this range as opposed to, say,
less than one or more than four or five percentage points.

    An obvious potential problem with this deflator is the

assumption that square footage is a reliable measure over time of
24

nonresidential output. One problem is that the mix of
nonresidential construction changes over time. This calls for
the use of separate deflators for each type of nonresidential
construction, weighted by their share of output. Within each

type of construction, the square footage measure ignores changes
in building and locational characteristics.   I cannot estimate

directly the magnitude of this type of bias, but I can do so

indirectly by estimating cross—section hedonic price equations
for commercial office buildings, elementary and secondary

schools, hospitals and nursing homes, and federal buildings. In
a cross section, the price (contract amount) of the building is
the best measure of output. It is not a perfect measure because
of possible locational differences in prices, but this influence

can be largely removed by using dummy variables for regional and
urban location. If square footage is a good approximation to
output, then this variable will explain almost all of the
cross—section variation in prices, and building characteristics

will account for very little of it. On the other hand, if
building characteristics play a dominant role in determining
output, square footage will leave unexplained much of the cross
sectional variation in prices. Also, if square footage is a
valid measure of output, the coefficient of square footage in a

log—log specification should equal one.
     The results in Table 6 show that B9—to—95 percent of the

price variation in each sample can be explained in terms of

square footage. In the office building sample, building

characteristics and location variables explain only an additional

2 percent of the price variation. These variables do slightly
better in the other equations, accounting for an additional 3—to—
9 percent of the price variation. Even though square footage is
a deficient measure of output, the magnitude of the deficiency
seems to be very small.

     If nonresidential buildings have become more amenity—
intensive (as is the case in residential construction), this
deficiency will be in the direction of understating the rate of

growth in output, making my proposed deflator overstate the rate

of growth in prices.
     The hypothesis of a unitary coefficient for square footage
cannot be rejected in the models for which building
characteristics are excluded. It varies greatly from one when

those characteristics are included in only the hospital samples.
     Based on the above discussion, how much has nominal output
been overdeflated? I have proposed to use the FHiA urban
composite index for highway construction and an index derived

from aggregate value put in place and square footage data for
building construction other than single—family homes. Assuming
the Census index for single—family homes accurately measures
price changes in that sector, only one type of construction needs
further attention: nonbuilding construction other than

highways. This largely consists of public utility, water, sewer,
and conservation projects. Lacking any price data for any of
these types of construction, I will use a deflator equal to the
                                                                      27

simple   average of   the   FHiA urban composite deflator and the

deflator based on square footage and value put in place in

nonresidential buildings.
    To obtain a price index for the industry, I took the

share—weighted average of these four sectoral indexes, basing the

shares on value put in place. Using weights equal to the simple
average of   the   1968 and 1978 shares, the index for the industry
increases at an annual rate of 7.7 percent between 1968 and

1978. This is 1.4 percentage points less than the deflator
used in the national income accounts for the construction

industry and 0.9 percentage points less than the Department of

Commerce Composite Index. The new index implies productivity
fell by 10.5 percentage points between 1968 and 1978, 10.9
percentage points less than the decline in productivity as
measured by BLS. Thus, overdeflation of nominal output could
account f or 51 percent of the measured productivity decline.

    This new price index is admittedly ad hoc with respect to

nonbuilding construction other than highways; there is no way to
determine whether this component of the index is biased in either

direction. However, the cost indexes currently used in the NIPA
deflator overstate the rate of price increase, which suggests
that an index that grows at a 0.9 to 1.4 percentage point slower
rate should not be rejected out of hand. As for its other
components, this new index probably overstates the rate of price
increase. There is no adjustment for likely increases in

amenities or improved design in the proposed index for non—
28

residential buildings. As noted earlier, the urban highway
construction index does not control for changes in highway

characteristics within urban areas over time. The new index is
admittedly no substitute for a complete and careful revision of

the NIPA deflator based on micro data on a variety of different

types of projects over the entire period, but it seems difficult
to claim that it is not preferable to the official deflators for
the purposes of this analysis.

V. Has Nominal Output Been Underestimated?
     Census estimates of value put in place are based on a monthly

sample of projects. These projects are identified by four
sources: F.W. Dodge reports of new building projects in 37
eastern states and the District of Columbia, the Census monthly

Building Permits survey in the 13 western states for projects

with permit values of $500,000 or more, a separate sample of
places issuing building permits in the western states for
projects with permit values of less than $500,000, and reports
from a variety of sources such as building materials dealers and

utilities officials in areas of the western states where building

permits are not required. A Census study in the late 1960s
compared Dodge reports in the eastern states to a sample of

projects obtained from building permit data and found that a
significant percentage of construction projects were not being
reported by Dodge. Accordingly, the results of the sample survey
in the eastern states have been increased by 15 percent for some
time. The results for the western states are increased by 5
                                                                  29

percent to allow for undercoverage of construction done in areas
in which permits are not required.

     Two recent studies suggest that the volume of nonresidential

building construction is being drastically underestimated.
Sampling rates from all four sources of project data are based on

project size. All projects costing $5 million or more are to be
included in the sample. Business Rountable (1982) reported a
number of instances in which companies were not receiving any

requests from the Census Bureau to provide data on projects in
this size category. Even when they are asked to participate in
the survey, many companies refuse because of the costs involved

(reporting is not compulsory). The Business Roundtable report

concludes, "The project identification and sampling procedures
are not working."

     The other warning signal comes from a paper by Alan Slum
(198W of the Census Bureau comparing measured output for 1977 in
the Value of New Construction Put in Place (VIP) series and the

CCI. After making a number of adjustments to make the two data
sets comparable, Slum found the CCI was reporting 75 percent more
industrial construction and 29 percent more hospital and
institutional construction than the VIP.

     A comparison of the growth of nonresidential building
construction between 1967 and 1977 from these two sources

provides further evidence of an undercount. Since CCI does not
provide public—private breakdowns, both sectors are considered
together. The VIP series increases from $26.9 to $40.6 billion
3Q

over this period, while the CCI series increases from $38.2 to
$72.8 billion. Since the CCI series includes work subcontracted

to others (28 percent of total receipts), the 1967 figures are
quite comparable. The key finding is the dramatic difference in
the growth of the two series. The CCI measure increased by 91
percent, whereas the VIP measure increased by only 51 percent.
     This suggests the undercount in nonresidential building is a
relatively recent phenomenon and thus may have contributed to

the decline in measured productivity. However, this argument
ignores the other side of the NIPA ledger: the income source
accounts. Even if structures are being underestimated in the
output source accounts, the income source side must be taken into
account to be fully consistent. Accordingly, it would be
inappropriate until further evidence is available to claim that

an undercount of output has been a source of the observed

productivity decline.
VI. Conclusion
     This study's two major findings are summarized in Table 7.
First, labor productivity in the construction industry should

have declined by 8.8 percent between 1968 and 1978. The biggest
factor in this decline is the reduction in skilled labor
intensity resulting from the shift in the mix of output from

large scale commercial, industrial, and institutional projects to
single—family houses. Other important factors include declines

in the average number of employees per establishment,

capital—labor ratio, percent union, and the average age of

considerably greater than indicated by the national income
accounts. The difference between the official deflator and the
alternative deflator proposed in Section IV accounts for about

half the observed productivity decline. After making adjust-
ments for all these factors, the predicted decline in measured
productivity is 19.7 percent. This accounts for 92 percent of

the reported productivity decline.

    Although this approach quite successfully explain
productivity changes between 1968 and 1978, it does not do as
well over the 1950—1968 period. As outlined in detail in the
appendix, the model predicts a 34.4 percent increase in
productivity, whereas BLS reports a 48.9 percent increase. The
actual productivity increase was no doubt higher because of

upward bias in the price deflator. Based upon the same adjust-
ment outlined in Section IV, my estimate is that productivity

actually grew by 52.4 percent. Although the sources of almost
two—thirds of this productivity growth are identified by the
model, a substantial residual remains. This could result from
omission of variables from the analysis. For instance, there are
no data, to my knowledge, on research and development
expenditures for the construction industry. If there were a great

deal of R & D spending in the 1950s and 1960s but relatively
little in the 1970s, then the productivity changes for both the

1950—1968 and 1968—1978 periods might be explained fully by the
model. Trends in the ratio of new construction to alteration and
repair construction may have varied between these two periods as

well.S Changes in the production function and errors in
measuring changes in the levels of the independent variables may
also account for the relatively poorer performance of the model

in this earlier period. Whatever the reason, this analysis
suggests that the real productivity puzzle in construction is not
the negative residual between 1968 and 1978, but the positive
residual between 1950 and 1968.

 Notes
         'Even before 1968, many observers felt construction lagged
 behind the rest of the economy in terms of productivity growth.

 Data on productivity change by industry reported in Baily (1981)
do not bear this out. Between 1948 and 1968 labor productivity
grew more rapidly in construction than in manufacturing, finance,

retail trade, and services. However, while productivity
continued to grow in most other sectors of the economy between

 1968 and 1978, it was falling in construction. Only the mining

industry had worse productivity performance over this period.

      These variables were chosen because the shares of each of
these categories changed considerably between 1968 and 1978.
Variables representing other types of construction were also
examined but are not included in the specification because their

coefficients were estimated with very little precision.

      flhese figures are reported in U.S. Department of Labor
(1972, 1981a, 1981b, 1983).

Appendix

     The same methods used to determine the sources of the

productivity decline in construction between 1968 and 1978 can be
used to analyze the sources of productivity growth between 1950
and 1968. As no censuses Df the construction industry were taken

in the 1950s, the effects of changes in employees per

establishment and the mix of output had to be examined with

different data sources. Otherwise, the results below were
obtained in exactly the same fashion as those in the text + or the
1968—1978 period.

     a. Capital—labor ratio. The American Productivity Center's
fixed capital measure grew at an annual rate of 6.8 percent
between 1950 and 1968, while the BLS measure of labor hours grew
at a 1.5 percent rate. Based on the change in the logarithm of

the capital—labor ratio over this period, this should have
resulted in a 22.3 percent productivity increase.

     b. Economies of scale. The growth in employees per
establishment between 1953 and 1968 was calculated from County
Business Patterns.   (Data for 1950 were not available.) The
average establishment had 10.1 employees in 1968, an increase of
1.1 employees over 1953. Extrapolating the logarithmic change in
this ratio over the 1950—1968 period, increased establishment
size resulted in a 2.4 percent productivity increase.

     c. Labor quality. Changes in the age and sex distribution
of workers, as reported by Stokes, caused the labor quality index
to fall by 0.8 percent, resulting in an identical percentage
                                                                  .39


decline in productivity. Mean years of schooling increased from
9.5 to 11.3 between 1950 and 1968, resulting in a 4.4 percent
increase in productivity. The net result of these changes in the

quality of work force is a 3.8 percent increase in productivity.

    d. Percent union. Adjusted union membership grew by 28.6
percent between 1950 and 1968, whereas BLS employment grew by
35.0 percent. This implies percent union in 1968 was 95.2
percent of percent union in 1950 and sets percent union in 1950

at 40.9. A decline in percent union of 1.9 percentage points
results in a 0.3 percent decline in productivity after adjusting
for the downward bias of the union coefficient in Table 2.

    e. Reoional shifts. Between 1950 and 1968 the shares of
employment in the Northeast, North Central and Western regions

declined by 3.0, 1.7, and 1.5 percentage points, respectively.
This resulted in a 0.3 percent decline in productivity.

     f. Mix of output. The impact of changes in the mix of
construction activity was determined by comparing the shares of

different types of construction in Value of New Construction Put

in Place for 1951 and 1968.   I chose not to use 1950 as the

initial year because residential construction represented 54
percent of total construction in that year, a figure which was
significantly out of line with those for all subsequent years.
The following shares were constructed to make these data as
comparable as possible to the Census of Construction Industries
4')


categories in Tables 2 and 3:

                                     1951 share     1968 share

New housing units
  and farm dwellings                     .391              .275
Industrial and commercial
  buildings                              .102              .158
Private and public educational,
  hospital and institutional             .079              .108
Extrapolating the predicted effects of these changes an

additional year, the model predicts a 6.7 percent increase in

productivity.

      g. Bias in the deflator. Weighting by the simple average
of 1951 and 1968 shares, my proposed price deflator rises at an
annual rate of 2.3 percent, 0.4 percentage points below the NIPA

deflator. This implies productivity increased by 52.4 percent
between 1950 and 1968 in contrast to the 48.9 percent increase

reported by BLS.

      h. Total. The combined effect of these factors is a
predicted productivity change of 34.4 percent based on changes in

the capital—labor ratio, employees per establishment, labor
quality, percent union, and the regional and industrial mix of
output. After adjusting for upward bias in the deflator,

productivity actually increased by 52.4 percent. The model thus
accounts for 65.6 percent of the actual change in productivity.
