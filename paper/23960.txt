This paper studies the impact of product and labor market reforms when the economy faces major
slack and a binding constraint on monetary policy easing---such as the zero lower bound. To this
end, we build a two-country model with endogenous producer entry, labor market frictions, and
nominal rigidities. We find that while the effect of market reforms depends on the cyclical
conditions under which they are implemented, the zero lower bound itself does not appear to
matter. In fact, when carried out in a recession, the impact of reforms is typically stronger when
the zero lower bound is binding. The reason is that reforms are inflationary in our structural
model (or they have no noticeable deflationary effects). Thus, contrary to the implications of
reduced-form modeling of product and labor market reforms as exogenous reductions in price and
wage markups, our analysis shows that there is no simple across-the-board relationship between
market reforms and the behavior of real marginal costs. This significantly alters the consequences
of the zero (or any effective) lower bound on policy rates.

1       Introduction

The protracted slowdown in economic growth since the 2008-2009 global …nancial crisis and the
limited room for monetary and …scal stimulus have put structural reforms at the center of the
policy agenda in many advanced economies (e.g. Draghi, 2015, IMF, 2016, and OECD, 2015). A
large body of theoretical and empirical research supports the view that such reforms would raise
output and employment in the long run.1 However, there is an active debate regarding short-term
outcomes of market reform. A central issue in the post-crisis environment involves the consequences
of structural reforms at a time in which central banks face binding constraints on monetary policy
easing, in particular because of the impossibility in pushing policy rates into negative territory
unlimitedly— the so-called zero lower bound (ZLB) on nominal interest rates.2 Two geographic
areas where structural reforms have been advocated most forcefully, namely the euro area and
Japan, are in such a situation. At the heart of the debate ultimately lies the question of whether
market reforms have important de‡ationary e¤ects. As argued by Eggertsson (2010), in a liquidity
trap expectations of de‡ation increase real interest rates, thus depressing current demand— what
he calls the paradox of toil. Building on this insight, Eggertsson, Ferrero and Ra¤o (2014, EFR)
show that if structural reforms are interpreted as exogenous reductions in price and wage markups,
deregulation may entail near-term contractionary e¤ects when monetary policy is constrained by
the ZLB, since reforms fuel expectations of prolonged de‡ation.3 Even more disappointingly, if
agents foresee that such reforms are not permanent (due to lack of political credibility), short-term
output losses are even larger, further deepening the ongoing recession.
        The analysis in EFR maintains the assumption that market reforms act as exogenous reductions
in price and wage markups. However, from an empirical perspective, market regulation a¤ects the
incentives to create and destroy products and jobs. Price and wage dynamics are an endogenous
outcome of market reform. The goal of this paper is to address the consequences of primitive
changes in market regulation when the economy is in a deep recession that has triggered the ZLB
on nominal interest rates.
        To this end, we build a two-country, two-sector model of a monetary union featuring endogenous

and Hopenhayn and Rogerson (1993).

     All the arguments and analysis in the paper extend to any (negative) e¤ective lower bound on the monetary
policy rate.
   3
     Eggertsson (2012) argues that New Deal policies facilitated the recovery from the Great Depression by temporarily
granting monopoly power to …rms and unions.

producer entry, search-and-matching frictions in labor market, and nominal rigidities. Endogenous
variation in the number of monopolistically competitive …rms builds on Bilbiie, Ghironi and Melitz
(2012) and Ghironi and Melitz (2005). Labor markets are characterized by search-and-matching
frictions with endogenous job creation and destruction as in Mortensen and Pissarides (1994) and
den Haan, Ramey and Watson (2000). We calibrate the model to match features of the euro-area
macroeconomic data.
   We then analyze the dynamic response of the economy to three di¤erent reforms that have
featured prominently in policy debates over the years: i) product market reform, modeled as
a reduction in regulatory costs of entry in the non-tradable sector; ii) employment protection
legislation reform, namely a reduction in …ring costs; iii) a decline in the generosity of unemployment
bene…ts, that is a cut in the average replacement rate over an unemployment spell. For each reform,
we consider two alternative scenarios: i) market reform happens in normal times, i.e., when the
economy is not in a recession and the ZLB is not binding; ii) in a crisis that pushes the nominal
interest rate to its lower bound.
   Our main conclusion is that while business cycle conditions at the time of deregulation matter
for the adjustment, the presence of the ZLB does not per-se induce recessionary e¤ects of market
reforms. In fact, some reforms can be more bene…cial when the ZLB is binding, as observed for
product market reform and joint deregulation in product and labor markets.
   This result re‡ects the fact that reforms do not have de‡ationary e¤ects in the …rst place, and
some are indeed in‡ationary, at least in the …rst phase of the transition. The intuition behind
this result is easily understood. Consider …rst a reduction in barriers to entry. While such reform
reduces price mark-ups through well-understood pro-competitive e¤ects, the downward pressure on
prices is initially more than o¤set by two in‡ationary forces. First, lower entry barriers trigger entry
of new producers, which increases demand for factors of production and thereby marginal costs.
Second, incumbent producers lay o¤ less productive workers in response to increased competition.
Since remaining workers have higher wages on average, marginal labor costs rise. The latter e¤ect
also explains why lower …ring costs— which induce …rms to lay o¤ less productive workers— are
not de‡ationary either, even though layo¤s reduce aggregate demand all else equal. Finally, while
unemployment bene…t cuts have a negative impact on wages and aggregate demand by weakening
workers’ outside option in the wage bargaining process, this de‡ationary e¤ect is o¤set by the
positive general equilibrium impact of the reform on labor demand, which increases wages other
things equal.


                                                   2
    Our results highlight that prevailing business cycle conditions and not constraints on monetary
policy represent the key dimension to consider when evaluating the short- to medium-run e¤ects of
market reform. Moreover, our analysis shows that, contrary to what is implied by the conventional
modeling of product and labor market reforms— exogenous price and wage mark-up reductions—
there is no simple across-the-board relationship between market reforms and the behavior of the
real marginal cost. This is because reforms a¤ect both supply and demand in complex ways.
Output and employment responses to reform vary widely across speci…c areas already in normal
times, and how these responses are altered by the presence of a recession with a binding zero lower
bound also di¤ers across reforms. This re‡ects important di¤erences, highlighted by our model,
in the nature and transmission of di¤erent reforms. For instance, while reductions in …ring costs
and unemployment bene…ts both qualify as “labor market reforms”, their short-term e¤ects di¤er
noticeably, and there is a signi…cant “di¤erence in this di¤erence” between normal times and a
recession with a binding ZLB.
    Our paper relates to a burgeoning theoretical literature on the short-term e¤ects of structural
reforms, both in general and at the ZLB more speci…cally. Considering only normal times, Caccia-
tore and Fiori (2016) explore the short-term e¤ects of the reforms discussed here, while Cacciatore,
Duval, Fiori and Ghironi (2016a) and Cacciatore, Fiori and Ghironi (2016) assess the role of mone-
tary policy for short-run adjustment to these reforms. Cacciatore, Duval, Fiori and Ghironi (2016b)
explore the role of business cycle conditions for the short-term e¤ect of market deregulation in a
real model that ignores the role of monetary policy altogether. A number of large-scale DSGE
models have also been used to analyze the dynamic impact of reforms in normal times (Varga and
in’t Veld, 2011; Everaert and Schule, 2008; Gomes, Jacquinot, Mohr and Pisani, 2013), although
their focus is on exogenous reductions in price and wage markups.
    A few recent papers study how the impact of reforms di¤ers at the zero lower bound. Using a
simple New Keynesian model with wage and price rigidities, Eggertsson, Ferrero and Ra¤o (2014)
…nd that the impact of reforms that would be expansionary in normal times becomes a priori am-
biguous, and possibly contractionary, at the ZLB. However, they model reforms in reduced-form
fashion as exogenous reductions in price and wage markups; this makes reforms automatically
de‡ationary in their basic setup.4 Using larger-scale models of the euro area featuring richer trans-
mission mechanisms— including investment, trade with the rest of the world, liquidity-constrained

have appeared in the literature— do not feature producer entry dynamics and DMP labor market frictions.

versus optimizing households— Gerali, Notarpietro and Pisani (2015), Gomes (2014), and Vogel
(2014) reassess this result and …nd a smaller role of the ZLB. Explicit modeling of product and
labor market dynamics and the primitive features of regulation di¤erentiates our paper from these
recent studies. As illustrated above, such modeling has major implications for the e¤ects of reforms
at the ZLB and how they vary across di¤erent areas.5
       A few caveats are in order. Our analysis shows that market reform increases labor productivity
both in the long run and in the short run, even when implemented at the ZLB. However, our
modeling of product market reforms does not factor in possible productivity gains that may stem
from reduced X-ine¢ ciency among incumbent …rms or from stronger incentives for them to innovate.
Therefore, if anything, these other possible transmission channels suggest we may under-estimate
the short-term e¤ects of reforms, including at the ZLB.6 Another possible limitation of our analysis
is that we consider only one regulated non-tradable sector, while in practice the resource costs,
and therefore the aggregate demand e¤ects, of …rm entry may di¤er across sectors— for example,
they are likely to be higher in the telecommunications sector than in some professional services
such as taxis. Therefore our results should be seen as aiming to capture an average impact of
product market deregulation in the non-tradable sector. Finally, our …nding that unemployment
bene…t cuts do not have de‡ationary e¤ects— and therefore that their e¤ectiveness is not reduced
by the presence of a binding ZLB— re‡ects the strong responsiveness of labor demand, and thereby
of aggregate demand, to such reforms. The relevance of the …rm hiring channel, highlighted also
by Mitman and Rabinovich (2015), stresses more broadly the bene…cial e¤ects of labor market
policies promoting wage ‡exibility (through reductions in the generosity of wage replacement) as
opposed to employment ‡exibility during downturns. This result is consistent with the empirical
evidence in Gnocchi, Lagerborg, and Pappa (2015) and echoes the discussion in Boeri and Jimeno
(2015). However, the model abstracts from a potential counteracting force: a cut in unemployment
bene…ts a¤ects more severely lower-income, credit-constrained households, inducing them to curtail
consumption. Furthermore, households typically become more credit-constrained— and therefore
the counteracting force could become stronger— in recessions (Mian and Su…, 2011). As argued by
Kollmann, Ratto, Roeger, in’t Veld, and Vogel (2015), even if the government fully redistributes
the …scal gain from bene…t reductions through broad-based tax cuts, aggregate consumption may

     This recent literature on the e¤ect of supply-side policies at the ZLB falls within the broader context of a growing
body of work on how the ZLB may alter the impact of shocks relative to normal times. For …scal policy shocks, see
Christiano, Eichenbaum and Rebelo (2011), Erceg and Linde (2012), and Woodford (2011).

     Notice that productivity shocks are expansionary in our model, even at the ZLB— albeit less so than in normal
times due to their depressing impact on prices.

still decline and output fall.
    The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. Section 2 presents the model, except for
the speci…cation of monetary policy. Section 3 describes monetary policy. Section 4 presents the
calibration of the model. Section 5 simulates the impact of the di¤erent labor and product market
reforms under normal economic conditions. Section 6 focuses on the consequences of reforms during
recessions, with a binding zero lower bound or without it (counterfactual). Section 7 concludes.


2   The Model

We model a monetary union that consists of two countries, Home and Foreign. Foreign variables
are denoted with a superscript star. We use the subscript D to denote quantities and prices of a
country’s own goods consumed domestically, and the subscript X to denote quantities and prices
of exports. We focus on the Home economy in presenting our model, with the understanding that
analogous equations hold for Foreign. We abstract from monetary frictions that would motivate a
demand for cash currency in each country, and we resort to a cashless economy following Woodford
(2003).


Household Preferences

Each economy in the union is populated by a unit mass of atomistic, identical households. Each
household is thought of as a large extended family containing a continuum of members along a
unit interval. The household does not choose how many family members work; the measure of
family members who work is determined by a labor matching process. Unemployed workers receive
a …xed amount hp > 0 of household production units. Following Andolfatto (1996), Merz (1995),
and much of the subsequent literature, we assume full consumption insurance between employed
and unemployed individuals, so that there is no ex-post heterogeneity across individuals in the
household. We assume habit persistence in consumption utility as this improves the quantitative
performance of the model by slowing down the response of consumption to shocks.
    The representative household maximizes expected intertemporal utility,

A similar basket describes consumption in the Foreign country. Importantly, in each country’s
tradable consumption basket, 1               X    is the weight attached to the country’s own good. Therefore,
preferences are biased in favor of domestic goods whenever                                     X       < 1=2. The tradable consumption-

    Di¤erently from Ghironi and Melitz (2005), we do not model the endogenous determination of the subset of
traded goods within a tradable set, since this is not central to the analysis in this paper.



                                                                       6
       At any given point in time, only a subset of non-tradable goods                       t   2   is available. We assume
that the aggregator CtN takes a translog form following Feenstra (2003b). As a result, the elasticity
of substitution across varieties within the basket CtN is an increasing function of the number of goods
available. The translog assumption allows us to capture the pro-competitive e¤ect of deregulating
in the goods market on markups, documented by the empirical literature— see Gri¢ th, Harrison,
and Macartney (2007).8 Translog preferences are characterized by de…ning the unit expenditure
function (i.e., the price index) associated with the preference aggregator. Let pN

Production

In each country, there are two vertically integrated production stages. At the upstream level,
perfectly competitive …rms use capital and labor to produce a non-tradable intermediate input.
At the downstream level, there are two sectors producing …nal consumption goods. In one sector,
monopolistically competitive …rms purchase intermediate inputs and produce di¤erentiated non-
tradable varieties. In the second sector, perfectly competitive …rms combine intermediate inputs
and non-tradable goods to produce a consumption good that is sold to consumers in both countries.
This production structure is consistent with the evidence provided by Boeri, Castanheira, Faini,
and Galasso (2006), who document how service industries are a key supplier of the manufacturing
sector.
   8
    A demand-, preference-based explanation for time-varying, ‡exible-price markups is empirically appealing because
the data shows that most entering and exiting …rms are small, and much of the change in the product space is due
to product switching within existing …rms, pointing to a limited role for supply-driven competitive pressures in
markup dynamics. Bilbiie, Ghironi, and Melitz (2012) …nd that translog preferences result in markup dynamics that
are remarkably close to U.S. data. Bergin and Feenstra (2000) show that a translog expenditure function generate
plausible endogenous persistence in macro models. For a review of the applications of translog preferences in the
trade literature, see Feenstra (2003a).

Intermediate Goods Production

There is a unit mass of perfectly competitive intermediate producers. Production requires capital
and labor. Within each …rm there is a continuum of jobs; each job is executed by one worker.
Following Gertler and Trigari (2009) and den Haan, Ramey, and Watson (2000), we assume that
capital is perfectly mobile across …rms and jobs and that there is a competitive rental market in
capital. While …rms are “large” as they employ a continuum of workers, …rms are still of measure
zero relative to the aggregate size of the economy.
                                                  a
    A …lled job i produces Zt zti kti                 units of output, where Zt denotes aggregate productivity, zti
represents a random disturbance that is speci…c to match i, and kti is the stock of capital allocated
to the job. Within each …rm, jobs with identical productivity zti produce the same amount of
output. For this reason, in the remainder of the paper we suppress the job index i and identify a
job with its idiosyncratic productivity zt . As common practice in the literature, we assume that
zt is a per-period i:i:d: draw from a time-invariant distribution with c.d.f. G(z), positive support,
and density g (z).9 When solving the model, we assume that G(z) is lognormal with log-scale                                      zi

and shape     zi .     Aggregate productivity Zt is exogenous and common to all …rms. We assume that
Zt and Zt follow a bivariate AR(1) process in logs, with Home (Foreign) productivity subject to
innovations       Zt   (   Zt ).   The diagonal elements of the autoregressive matrix             ,   11     and   22 ,   measure
the persistence of exogenous productivity and are strictly between 0 and 1, and the o¤-diagonal
elements     12   and         21   measure productivity spillovers. The productivity innovations                    Zt    and   Zt

are normally distributed with zero mean and variance-covariance matrix                            Z; Z
                                                                                                         .
    The representative intermediate …rm produces output

                                                                        Z   1

where Lt is the measure of jobs within the …rm, kt (z) is the amount of capital allocated to a job
with idiosyncratic productivity z, and the term ztc represents an endogenously determined critical
threshold below which jobs that draw zt < ztc are not pro…table. In this case, the value to the
…rm of continuing the match is less than the value of separation, and the job is destroyed. When
terminating a job, each …rm incurs a real cost Ft . Firing costs are not a transfer to workers here and
   9
     The assumption that the idiosyncratic productivity shocks are independently and identically distributed over time
simpli…es the analysis of the model by eliminating the need to consider match-speci…c state variables for continuing
relationships. Results in den Haan, Ramey, and Watson (2000) lead us to conjecture that this would not a¤ect our
results signi…cantly.




                                                                   8
are treated as a pure loss (administrative costs of layo¤ procedures). Severance transfers from …rms
to workers would have no allocative e¤ects with wage bargaining as assumed below (see Mortensen
and Pissarides, 2002). Finally, the relationship between a …rm and a worker can also be severed
for exogenous reasons; in which case, no …ring costs are paid. Denote with                        the fraction of jobs
that are exogenously separated from each …rm in each period.
    Job creation is subject to matching frictions. To hire a new worker, …rms have to post a vacancy,
incurring a real …xed cost . The probability of …nding a worker depends on a constant returns
to scale matching technology, which converts aggregate unemployed workers Ut and aggregate
vacancies Vt into aggregate matches Mt = Ut" Vt1                "
                                                                    , where 0 < " < 1. Each …rm meets unemployed
workers at a rate qt        Mt =Vt . Searching workers in period t are equal to the mass of unemployed
workers: Ut = (1        Lt ).
    The timing of events proceeds as follows. At the beginning of each period, a fraction                              of
jobs are exogenously separated. Aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks are then realized, after which
the representative …rm chooses the productivity threshold ztc that determines the measure of jobs
endogenously destroyed, G (ztc ). Once the …ring round has taken place, …rms post vacancies, Vt ,
                                                              R1
and select their total capital stock, Kt = Lt k~t , where k~t  z c kt (z) g(z)dz= [1 G (ztc )].10 The
                                                                                    t

assumption that …rms select capital after observing aggregate and idiosyncratic shocks follows den
Haan, Ramey, and Watson (2000).
    The in‡ow of new workers and the out‡ow of workers due to separations jointly determine the
evolution of …rm-level employment:


                                  Lt = (1       ) (1   G (ztc )) (Lt     1   + qt   1 Vt 1 ) :                        (3)


All separated workers are assumed to immediately reenter the unemployment pool.
    As shown in Cacciatore and Fiori (2016), owing to perfectly mobile capital rented in a compet-
itive market, the producer’s output exhibits constant returns to scale in labor and capital:


                                                 YtI = Zt z~t Kt L1t         ;
  10
     With full capital mobility and price-taker …rms in the capital market, it is irrelevant whether producers choose the
total stock of capital Kt , or, instead, determine the optimal capital stock for each existing job, kt (z). See Cacciatore
and Fiori (2016) for the proof.

   By combining the …rst-order conditions for Lt and Vt , we obtain the following job creation

Equation (4) equalizes the marginal cost and the marginal bene…t of posting a vacancy. With
probability qt the vacancy is …lled; in which case, two events are possible: either the new recruit will
be …red in period t + 1, and the …rm will pay …ring costs, or the match will survive job destruction,
generating value for the …rm. The marginal bene…t of a …lled vacancy includes expected discounted
savings on future vacancy postings, plus the average pro…ts generated by a match. Pro…ts from the

looking iteration of equation (4) implies that, at the optimum, the expected discounted value of
the stream of pro…ts generated by a match over its expected lifetime is equal to =qt .

At the optimum, the value to the …rm of a job with productivity ztc must be equal to zero, implying
that the contribution of the match to current and expected future pro…ts is exactly equal to the
…rm outside option— …ring the worker, paying Ft . When unpro…table jobs are terminated, the …rm
loses current and expected pro…ts it would have earned had it kept the laid-o¤ workers. At the
same time, however, the …rm bene…ts from job destruction, as unproductive jobs are removed and
the distribution of job productivities within the …rm is improved.11
       The optimal capital demand implied by the …rst-order condition for Kt equates the marginal
revenue product of capital to its marginal cost:                            't YtI =Kt = rtK .


Wage Setting

As is standard practice in the literature, we assume surplus splitting between an individual worker
and the …rm. The surplus-splitting rule divides the surplus of each match in shares determined by
an exogenous bargaining weight             2 (0; 1), which identi…es the workers’bargaining power.12 The
analytical derivation of the wage equation is presented in the Appendix. We show there that the
wage payment to each worker is a weighted average between the marginal revenue product of the
match (plus a …ring costs component) and the worker’s outside option, denoted with $t :
                      "                                                                                           #
                                                   1=(1         )
                                    YI      z
           wt (z) =       (1    ) 't t                              + Ft        (1       ) Et (   t;t+1 Ft+1 )        + (1   ) $t :   (6)
                                    Lt     z~t

The worker’s outside option $t corresponds to the value of unemployment, which includes home
production, hp , unemployment bene…t from the government, bt , and the expected discounted value
of searching for other jobs:

                                                                        n                                         o
                           $t   hp + bt +        t (1       ) Et             t;t+1   1       c
                                                                                          G zt+1        ~W            ;               (7)
                                                                                                            t+1

  11
     Equation (5) implies that the …rm keeps some currently unpro…table jobs occupied. This happens because current
job productivity can improve in the future, and the …rm has to incur …ring and recruitment costs in order to replace
a worker.
  12
     Following standard practice in the literature, we formulate the problem as though the worker is interested in
maximizing expected discounted income. As pointed out by Rogerson, Shimer, and Wright (2005), this is the same
as maximizing expected utility if the worker is risk neutral, of course, but also if (s)he is risk averse and markets are
complete, since then (s)he can maximize utility by …rst maximizing income and then smoothing consumption.




                                                                        11

the average worker surplus:

       Finally, notice that …ring costs a¤ect the wage payment in the following way: The …rm rewards
the worker for the saving in …ring costs today (the Ft term in the square bracket in equation (6)),
but it penalizes the worker for the fact that, in the case of …ring, it will have to pay …ring costs
tomorrow.
       In equilibrium, the worker’s outside option is


                          $t    hp + bt +               [ #t + (1              ) t Et (   t;t+1 Ft+1 )] ;

Non-Tradable Sector

There is a continuum of monopolistically competitive …rms, each producing a di¤erent non-traded
variety !. Following the language convention of most of the macroeconomic literature, we assume
coincidence between a producer, a product, and a …rm. However, as in Bilbiie, Ghironi, and Melitz
(2012), each unit in the model is best interpreted as a production line that could be part of a
multi-product …rm whose boundary is left undetermined. In this interpretation, producer entry
and exit capture the product-switching dynamics within …rms documented by Bernard, Redding,
and Schott (2010).
       The number of …rms serving the market is endogenous. Prior to entry, …rms face a sunk entry
cost fE;t , in units of consumption.14 Sunk entry costs re‡ect both a technological constraint (fT;t )
  13
    The distinction between home production and unemployment bene…ts follows Mortensen and Pissarides (2002).
  14
    Bilbiie, Ghironi, and Melitz (2012) and Ghironi and Melitz (2005) assume that the same input is used to produce
existing varieties and create new ones. We considered an alternative version of the model in which entry costs are
denominated in units of the intermediate input. None of our results is signi…cantly a¤ected by the denomination of



                                                              12
and administrative costs related to regulation (fR;t ), i.e., fE;t             fT;t + fR;t . In every period t, there
is an unbounded mass of prospective entrants in the …nal goods sector in each country. All …rms
that enter the economy produce in every period until they are hit by a “death”shock, which occurs
with probability        2 (0; 1) in every period. As noted by Bilbiie, Ghironi, and Melitz (2012), the
assumption of exogenous exit is a reasonable starting point for analysis, since, in the data, product
destruction and plant exit rates are much less cyclical than product creation and plant entry (see
Lee and Mukoyama, 2008 and Broda and Weinstein, 2010).
    Denote with YtN aggregate demand of the consumption basket of non-tradable goods. Aggregate
demand includes sources other than household consumption but takes the same translog form as the
consumption bundle CtN . This ensures that the non-tradable consumption price index is also the
price index for aggregate demand of the non-tradable basket. The producer ! faces the following
demand for its output:

can charge while still having a positive market share. To gain some intuition about the …rm de-
mand structure, notice that …rm revenue, pN      N
                                          t (!) yt (!), is a time-varying fraction of the aggregate

demand PtN YtN . The …rm’s time-varying market share,                       ln pN   N
                                                                                t =pt (!) , depends on the price

chosen by the …rm relative to the maximum admissible price.
    We introduce price stickiness by following Rotemberg (1982) and assuming that …nal produc-
                                                                  N                 N         2 N

  t (!) =p!;t   1 (!)      1.15 When a new …nal-good …rm sets the price of its output for the …rst
time, we appeal to symmetry across producers and interpret the t                    1 price in the expression of the
price adjustment cost as the notional price that the …rm would have set at time t                        1 if it had been
producing in that period. An intuition for this simplifying assumption is that all producers (even
those that are setting the price for the …rst time) must buy the bundle of goods                         N   (!) =Pt when
                                                                                                         t

   15
      The total real adjustment cost can be interpreted as the bundle of goods that the …rm needs to purchase when
implementing a price change. The size of this bundle is assumed to be larger when the size of the …rm (measured by
its revenue) increases.
   16
      As noted in Bilbiie, Ghironi and Melitz (2008), this assumption is consistent with both Rotemberg (1982) and our
timing assumption below. Speci…cally, new entrants behave as the (constant number of) price setters in Rotemberg,
where an initial condition for the price is dictated by nature. In our framework, new entrants at any time t who
start producing and setting prices at t + 1 are subject to an analogous assumption. Moreover, the assumption that

     There are two sources of endogenous markup variation in our model: First, translog preferences
imply that substitutability across varieties increases with the number of available varieties. As a
consequence, the price elasticity of total demand facing producer ! increases when the number
of Home producers is larger. Second, price stickiness introduces an additional source of markup
variation as the cost of adjusting prices gives …rms an incentive to change their markups over time
in order to smooth price changes across periods. When prices are ‡exible ( = 0), only the …rst
a new entrant, at the time of its …rst price decision, knows what will turn out to be the average Home product
price last period is consistent with the assumption that entrants start producing only one period after entry, hence
being able to observe the average product price during the entry period. Symmetry of the equilibrium will imply
pN           N
 t 1 (!) = pt 1 8!. Bilbiie, Ghironi and Melitz (2008) show that relaxing the assumption that new price setters are
subject to the same rigidity as incumbents yields signi…cantly di¤erent results only if the average rate of product
turnover is unrealistically high.

Producer Entry and Exit                    Prospective entrants are forward-looking and form rational expecta-
tions of their future pro…ts ds in any period s > t subject to the exogenous probability of incurring
an exit-inducing shock at the end of each period. Following BGM and Ghironi and Melitz (2005),
we introduce a time-to-build lag in the model and assume that entrants at time t will start produc-
ing only at t+1. Our assumptions on exit shocks and the timing of entry and production imply that
the law of motion for the number of producing Home …rms is given by Nt = (1                                            )(Nt   1 + NE;t 1 ).

Entry occurs until …rm value is equalized to the entry cost, leading to the free entry condition

Tradable Sector

In each country, a unit mass of perfectly competitive, symmetric …rms produce a tradable con-
sumption good, YtT . Production requires both intermediate inputs and non-tradable goods. When
serving the export market, producers face per-unit iceberg trade costs,                                 t   > 1. Thus, in equilibrium,
YtT = CD;t

of non-tradable-sector …rms and a non-contingent, internationally traded bond denominated in

      For simplicity, we assume extreme home bias in equity holdings and rule out international trade in …rm shares.

anism through which household savings are made available to prospective entrants to cover their
entry costs. Since there is no entry in the intermediate and tradable sectors (and, therefore,
no need to channel resources from households for the …nancing of such entry), we do not model
trade in intermediate- and tradable-sector equities explicitly. We also assume that the pro…ts of
intermediate-sector …rms are rebated to households in lump-sum fashion.19 Pro…ts in the tradable
sector are zero in equilibrium.
       Let xt be the share in the mutual fund of Home non–tradable-sector …rms held by the repre-
sentative household entering period t. The mutual fund pays a total pro…t in each period (in units
of currency) that is equal to the total pro…t of all …rms that produce in that period, Nt dN
                                                                                           t . During

period t, the representative household buys xt+1 shares in a mutual fund of Nt + NE;t …rms (those
already operating at time t and the new entrants). Only a fraction 1                 of these …rms will produce
and pay dividends at time t + 1. Since the household does not know which …rms will be hit by the
exogenous exit shock       at the end of period t, it …nances the continuing operation of all pre-existing
…rms and all new entrants during period t. The date t price of a claim to the future pro…t stream
of the mutual fund of Nt + NE;t …rms is equal to the nominal price of claims to future pro…ts of
Home …rms, Pt eN
               t .

       International asset markets are incomplete, since only a non-contingent bond is traded across
countries. Let At+1 (At+1 ) denote nominal bond holdings at Home (Foreign) entering period t + 1.
To induce steady-state determinacy and stationary responses to temporary shocks in the model,
we follow Turnovsky (1985) and, more recently, Benigno (2009), and we assume a quadratic cost
of adjusting bond holdings          (At+1 =Pt )2 =2 (in units of Home consumption). This cost is paid
to …nancial intermediaries whose only function is to collect these transaction fees and rebate the
revenue to households in lump-sum fashion.
       The household accumulates the physical capital and rents it to intermediate input producers in
a competitive capital market. Investment in the physical capital stock, IK;t , requires the use of the
same composite of all available varieties as the basket Ct . As standard practice in the literature,
we introduce convex adjustment costs in physical investment and variable capital utilization in
order to account for the smooth behavior of aggregate investment and the pronounced cyclical
variability in capacity utilization observed in the data.20 We assume that the utilization rate of
  19
     As long as the wage negotiated by workers and …rms is inside the bargaining set (and, therefore, smaller than or
equal to the …rm’s outside option), the surplus from a match that goes to the …rm is positive, even if intermediate
producers are perfectly competitive. Since all workers are identical, the total surplus of the intermediate sector is
positive, and so is the pro…t rebated to households.
  20
     For simplicity, we do not provide a microfoundation of capital market frictions. Reduced-form investment adjust-

capital is set by the household.21 Thus, e¤ective capital rented to …rms, Kt , is the product of
                  ~ t , and the utilization rate, uK;t : Kt = uK;t K
physical capital, K                                                ~ t . Increases in the utilization rate

are costly because higher utilization rates imply faster depreciation rates. Following Greenwood,
Hercowitz, and Hu¤man (1988) and Burnside and Eichenbaum (1996), we assume the following
convex depreciation function:                   {u1+&                              ~
                                        K;t       K;t = (1 + &). Physical capital, Kt , obeys a standard law of

Obstfeld and Rogo¤ (1995) for the nominal interest rate: it+1 is the interest rate between t and

where the term           at   captures a risk-premium shock that a¤ects households’ demand for risk-free

speci…ed as an exogenous term appended to the representative household’s Euler equation for bond
holdings. As shown by Fisher (2015), the shock                           at   can be interpreted as a structural shock to
the demand for safe and liquid assets, i.e.,                 at   captures, in reduced form, stochastic ‡uctuations in
household’s preferences for holding one-period nominally risk-free assets.22 The Euler equation for
bond holdings in the Foreign economy features a similar risk-premium shock, denoted with                                             at .   For
the purposes of our exercise, we assume that                       at   and         at   are perfectly correlated, i.e.,        at    =          at

in each period.

where T Bt         Qt   T CT      T CT       denotes the trade balance. Finally, since in the currency union
                        X;t X;t   X;t X;t

the nominal exchange rate is constant and equal to one, the dynamics of the real exchange rate are
tied to the in‡ation di¤erential between Home and Foreign: Qt =Qt                         1   = 1+   C;t     = (1 +   C;t ).



3        Monetary Policy

The ECB has a mandate of price stability de…ned in terms of a (harmonized) index of consumer price
in‡ation. Since we will calibrate the model to features of EMU, we specify historical interest rate
setting for our model ECB as a rule in which policy responds to movements in a country-weighted
average of CPI in‡ation and GDP gaps relative to the equilibrium with ‡exible prices.
         In the presence of endogenous producer entry and preferences that exhibit “love for variety,”
an issue concerns the empirically relevant variables that enter the theoretical representation of
monetary policy. As highlighted by Ghironi and Melitz (2005), when the economy experiences
entry of Home and Foreign …rms, the welfare-consistent non-tradable price index PtN can ‡uctuate
even if product prices remain constant.23 In the data, however, aggregate price indexes do not take
these variety e¤ects into account.24 To resolve this issue, we follow Ghironi and Melitz (2005) and
introduce the data-consistent price index, P~t . In turn, given any variable Xt in units of consumption,
    23
      The term (1=2 ) 1=Nt 1=N    ~ in equation (1) implies that even if prices are the same for all goods, the ex-
penditure needed to reach a certain level of consumption declines with Nt . Thus, provided that > 0, the utility
function from the translog expenditure function exhibits love of variety.
   24
      There is much empirical evidence that gains from variety are mostly unmeasured in CPI data, as documented
most recently by Broda and Weinstein (2010). Furthermore, the adjustment for variety neither happens at the
frequency represented by periods in the model, nor using the speci…c functional form for preferences that the model
assumes.



                                                          20
we then construct its data-consistent counterpart as XRt                                 Xt ~t , where ~t               Pt =P~t . (Additional
details, including the analytical expression for ~t , are presented in the Appendix.)
     We assume that the central bank sets the nominal interest rate for the entire union following
the rule:

                                                 h                                   %               %Y i1 %i

The data-consistent Home output gap, Y~gt                        YRt =YR , represents deviations of data-consistent
GDP, YRt         Yt =~t , from its level under ‡exible prices. We use the NIPA de…nition of GDP as
total income: Yt         ~t Lt + rt Kt + Nt dN
                         w                        I
                                             t + dt , which equals the sum of consumption, investment

in physical capital, product creation expenses, and the trade balance: Yt = Ct + It + T Bt , where
It    IK;t + NE;t (fR;t + fT ) denotes total investment (the sum of investment in physical capital and
product creation).25
     We take explicitly into account the possibility that the nominal interest rate cannot fall below
some lower bound izlb , so that in each period it+1 > izlb . Therefore, the interest rate in the currency
union satis…es:

     The inclusion of product creation expenses in Yt is consistent with the fact that intangible capital and nonres-
idential structures (the technological components of the entry cost) are accounted for by statistical agencies when
constructing GDP; see the documentation available at http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained. Moreover,
the cost of complying with legal requirements of market entry involves the purchase of goods and services, over and
beyond licence fees; see Djankov, Porta, Lopez-De-Silanes, and Shleifer (2002).

4        Calibration

Given the nonlinear nature of the equilibrium conditions, the decision rules that determine present
and future values of all the variables cannot be solved for analytically. Thus, we must assign speci…c
values to the model parameters and solve for the decision rules numerically.
         We assume a symmetric calibration across countries.26 We interpret periods as quarters and
choose parameter values from the literature and to match features of euro area macroeconomic data
from 1995:Q1 to 2013:Q1. Unless otherwise noted, data are taken from the Eurostat database.27
We use the NIPA de…nition of GDP as total income: Ytg                  ~t Lt + rtK Kt + Nt dN
                                                                       w                         I
                                                                                            t + dt , which equals

the sum of consumption, investment in physical capital, product creation expenses, and the trade
balance: Ytg = Ct + IKt + NE;t (fR;t + fT ) + T Bt .28 Below, variables without a time subscript
denote steady-state values.
         We use standard values for all the parameters that are conventional in the business cycle lit-
erature. We set the discount factor             equal to 0:99, the risk aversion           equal to 1, the “share”
parameter on capital in the Cobb-Douglas production function                       equal to 0:33, the capital de-
preciation rate      K   equal to 0:025, and the elasticity of marginal depreciation with respect to the
utilization rate & equal to 0:41.29 We set consumption habit, hC , equal to 0:6, as estimated by
Smets and Wouters (2004) for the euro area. We calibrate the elasticity of substitution between
tradable and non-tradable goods,          N,   equal to 0:5, consistent with the estimates for industrialized
countries in Mendoza (1991). We set the elasticity of substitution between tradable goods pro-
    26
     Our choice is motivated by the fact that the level of product and labor market regulation in the euro-area is
rather homogenous across countries; see the Appendix for details. For robustness, we have repeated our exercises by
considering an asymmetric calibration in which Home and Foreign feature characteristics of the periphery and core of
the euro are, respectively. None of our results are signi…cantly a¤ected by this alternative parameterization. Details
are available upon request.

     The inclusion of product creation expenses in Ytg is consistent with the fact that intangible capital and nonres-
idential structures (the technological components of the entry cost) are accounted for by statistical agencies when
constructing GDP; see the documentation available at http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained. Moreover,
the cost of complying with legal requirements of market entry involves the purchase of goods and services, over and
beyond licence fees; see Djankov, Porta, Lopez-De-Silanes, and Shleifer (2002).
  29
     Although the term 1        does not necessarily correspond to the labor share (since the labor share in general
depends on the outcome of the bargaining process), our conventional choice for implies that wL=Y ~      = 0:61, in line
with the data. For the period 1995-2013, the average labor share in the euro area is 0:62.


                                                          22
duced in Home and Foreign,           T,   equal to 6, consistent with recent estimates provided by Imbs and
Mejean (2015).30 For the bivariate productivity process, we set persistence and spillover parameters
consistent with Baxter and Farr (2005), implying zero spillovers across countries and persistence
equal to 0:999. We set the elasticity of matches to unemployment, ", equal to 0:6, the midpoint
of estimates reported by Petrongolo and Pissarides (2006). To maintain comparability with much
of the existing literature, we choose the worker’s bargaining power parameter, , such that the
so-called Hosios condition is satis…ed, i.e.,           = ".31 The scale parameter for the cost of adjusting
prices, , is set is equal to 80, as in Bilbiie, Ghironi, and Melitz (2008). We set the lower-bound
on the nominal interest rate such that izlb = 0 and assume that                  C   = 0.32 For comparability with
EFG, we assume a zero-in‡ation targeting regime, i.e., we set the smoothing parameter and GDP
gap weights, %i and %Y , equal to zero, and set % arbitrarily large.33 Finally, we set                      = 1, which
implies that the law of one price holds exactly for tradable goods.34
       We calibrate the remaining parameters to match statistics from simulated data to empirical
targets. Concerning the parameters that are speci…c to the product market, we set the …rm exit
rate, , such that gross steady-state job destruction accounted for by …rm exit is 25 percent, the
midpoint of estimates in Haltiwanger, Scarpetta, and Schweiger (2006). (Their estimates for France,
Germany, and Italy range between 20 and 30 percent.) In order to calibrate the entry costs related
to regulation, fR , we update the procedure in Ebell and Haefke (2009) and convert into months of
lost output the OECD indicator for administrative burdens on start-ups (OECD, Product Market
Regulation Database). See the Appendix for details. Following this procedure, the aggregate
cost of product market regulation is 2 percent of GDP.35 We choose fT such that aggregate R&D
  30
      None of our main results are signi…cantly a¤ected if we use T = 1:5, the standard value in the international
business cycle literature.
   31
      Absent other distortions, the Hosios condition requires the equality of the worker share of the surplus, , and
the worker’s contribution to matching, ". This implies that congestion and trading externalities that characterize the
search and matching process exactly cancel out, leading to e¢ cient job creation and destruction. In the presence of
other distortions, the basic Hosios condition = " must be adjusted to include an appropriate additional term in
order to deliver e¢ ciency. For simplicity of exposition and consistency with much literature (for instance, Arseneau
and Chugh, 2012), we simply refer to the condition = " as the Hosios condition.
   32
      The exact level of either the in‡ation target or the bound on the interest rate is not central for our results. What
we need is that a lower bound for the policy rate exists, thus preventing the monetary authority from providing
additional stimulus. Our results are una¤ected is we set izlb = 0. The only di¤erence relative to the baseline scenario
is that the size of the risk-premium shock that makes the ZLB binding has to be rescaled.
   33
      None of our results are signi…cantly a¤ected if we calibrate the coe¢ cient of the monetary policy rule using
historical values for the euro area estimated by Gerdesmeier and Ro¢ a (2003). This requires setting the in‡ation
and GDP gap weights equal to 1:93 and 0:075, respectively, and the smoothing parameter equal to 0:87.
   34
      The absence of trade barriers from our model is consistent with the operation of the European Union’s Sin-
gle Market. Transition to the euro narrowed price dispersion across country markets (Martin and Mejean, 2013),
supporting the law of one price as a reasonable …rst approximation to reality.
   35
      The implied entry cost at the producer level is a loss of 1:3 months of steady-state …rm’s output.



                                                           23
expenditures are 1:97 percent of GDP (OECD, Science and Technology Database).36 We set the
price-elasticity of the spending share on individual goods, , such that the steady-state markup, ,
is 25 percent, a weighted-average for the euro area of the estimates provided by Thum-Thysen and
Canton (2015). We calibrate the degree of home bias,                  N,   and the size of the tradable sector,       T,

to match a steady-state import share of 15 percent (corresponding to the average within-eurozone
import share) and a steady-state output share of 38 percent in manufacturing (from the EU-KLEMS
database). Finally, we set the share of non-tradable goods in the production of tradables, , such
that the share of manufacturing value added from services averages forty percent, as documented
by Boeri, Castanheira, Faini, and Galasso (2006). This implies setting                    = 0:6.
        We now turn to the parameters that are speci…c to the conventional search and matching
framework. We set unemployment bene…ts such that the average bene…t replacement rate, b=w,
                                                                                        ~ is
32 percent (OECD, Bene…ts and Wages Database, 2013).37 We choose the cost of posting a vacancy,
 , such that the steady-state hiring cost is 13 percent of the average wage, as estimated by Abowd
and Kramarz (2003) for France. Following the argument in den Haan, Ramey, and Watson (2000),
we assume that …rms experiencing exogenous separations attempt to re…ll the positions by posting
vacancies in the ensuing matching phase. Accordingly, we choose the exogenous separation rate,
 x,     so that the percentage of jobs counted as destroyed in a given year that fail to reappear in the
following year is 71 percent, as reported by Gomez-Salvador, Messina, and Vallanti (2004) for the
euro area as a whole. We set home production, hp , the matching function constant, , and …ring
costs, F , to match the total separation rate,          tot ,    the unemployment rate, U , and the probability
of …lling a vacancy, q. We set U = 0:09, the average unemployment rate in our sample period,
q = 0:6, as reported by Weber (2000), and             tot   = 0:036, in line with the estimates in Hobijn and
Sahin (2009). With these calibration targets, …ring costs and home production amount, respectively,
to 11 and 23 percent of the average wage.38
        Three parameters are left to calibration: the lognormal scale and shape parameters,                     zi   and

 zi ,   and the investment adjustment costs, . As standard practice we choose                   such that the model
reproduces the variability of investment in physical capital, IK;t . Following den Haan, Ramey, and
Watson (2000) and Krause and Lubik (2007), we normalize                       zi   to zero and set   zi   to match the

     The implied cost of non-regulatory entry barriers at the producer level is 65 percent of output per worker, a

     As before, we consider a weighted average of the unemployment bene…ts across euro area member countries.

     The implied value of F is lower than the average value estimated for European countries, which is typically around
25 percent of yearly wages; see Doing Business Database, World Bank (2008). The reason for this discrepancy is that
empirical estimates include severance payments, while, as explained before, the model does not.

5        Market Reforms in Normal Times

We begin to investigate the consequences of structural reforms by studying the dynamic adjustment
to market deregulation assuming that the economy is at the non-stochastic steady state. We
consider a permanent reduction of policy parameters in a perfect foresight environment: the policy
shock comes as an initial surprise to agents, who then have perfect foresight from that moment
on.39 Given the large size of the shocks, transition dynamics from the initial equilibrium to the
…nal equilibrium are found by solving the model as a nonlinear, forward-looking, deterministic
system using a Newton-Raphson method, as described in La¤argue (1990). This method solves
simultaneously all equations for each period, without relying on low-order, local approximations.
         We assume that policy parameters are lowered to their corresponding U.S. levels.40 To recal-
ibrate entry costs related to regulation, fR , we apply the same procedure described in Section 4
on U.S. data. The implied loss of steady-state …rm’s output is equal to 1 month. We assume
that unemployment bene…ts corresponds to 28 percent of the average wage (OECD, Bene…ts and
Wages Database, 2013), and set …ring costs to zero as in Veracierto (2008). Since in the model
unemployment bene…ts are …nanced with lump-sum taxes, the aggregate resource constraint is not
directly a¤ected by a cut in unemployment bene…ts. That is, in the model a cut in unemployment
bene…ts only a¤ects the worker’s outside option at the bargaining stage, without directly changing
household’s income. In order to address this issue, we consider an alternative labor market reform
which reduces the value of home production. We assume the same percentage reduction implied
by the cut in unemployment bene…ts.41
         The bottom panel of Figure 1 (continuous lines) shows the e¤ects of a permanent decrease in
barriers to entry (fR ). In the aftermath of the reform, output and in‡ation increase. The reason
is that producer entry initially increases aggregate demand, since in order to pay for sunk entry
costs producers need to purchase …nal output. In turn, this boosts hiring, putting upward pressure
    39
     Market reforms are usually the outcome of legislative processes such that implementation is anticipated by agents
when it happens. This notwithstanding, treating reforms as unanticipated shocks remains a useful benchmark for
analysis.
  40
     We take the United States as the benchmark for market ‡exibility, but we make no presumption that U.S. market
regulation levels should be optimal for other countries— or, for that matter, that they are optimal for the U.S. We
leave optimal market regulation and reform in a dynamic stochastic macroeconomic framework as a topic for future
study.
  41
     Alternatively, we could change the baseline model assuming that both home production and unemployment
bene…ts are exogenous endowments that contribute to household’s income. The adjustment to a reduction in unem-
ployment bene…ts in this case would be isomorphic to a reduction in home production


                                                         25
on wages and the real marginal cost. Consumption declines in the short term, because pro…table
investment opportunities in new …rms induce households to save more, o¤setting the positive impact
of higher expected future income on current consumption. With an open capital account, increased
entry can also be …nanced by borrowing from abroad. As a result, the deregulating economy runs
a current account de…cit during the …rst part of the transition.
    As new …rms enter the market, …ercer competition in the non-tradable sector erodes the market
share of incumbents, who downsize. This reduces the demand for the intermediate input, increasing
job destruction. Since remaining jobs have higher productivity, the average real wage increases—
averaging out the wage equation (6) yields:

                                          Kt
              w
              ~t =      (1     ) Zt z~t         + Ft    (1     ) Et (   t;t+1 Ft+1 )   + (1   ) $t :
                                          Lt

Other things equal, higher average wages increase the real marginal cost, 't — see the job creation
equation (4)— further contributing to maintain in‡ation above its pre-deregulation level. Labor
market frictions further propagate the adjustment to deregulation. Since job creation induced by
new entrants is a gradual process, the slow reallocation of workers across producers increases un-
employment and lowers aggregate output. Once the number of producing …rms in the deregulating
economy has increased, the reduction in red-tape implies that more resources can be devoted to
consumption and investment in physical capital. In addition, as jobs are reallocated to new en-
trants, unemployment falls, further boosting aggregate demand at Home and abroad. The larger
number of available products results in higher goods substitutability and lower markups in the long
run.42
    The bottom panel of Figure 2 (continuous lines) plots the dynamic adjustment to a permanent
reduction in …ring costs. Deregulation, in this case, presents a di¤erent intertemporal trade-o¤.
Lower …ring costs reduce the pro…tability of low productive matches, increasing job destruction.
At the same time, however, lower …ring costs reduce the expected cost of terminating a match,
boosting job creation. Since destroying existing jobs is an instantaneous process, while matching
…rms and workers takes time, employment, output, and consumption decrease in the aftermath of
the reform but recover over time. In‡ation is essentially una¤ected following the removal of …ring
costs. The reason is that two o¤setting forces are at work. On one side, lower aggregate demand
reduces prices, other things equal. On the other, since only the more productive workers keep their
  42
     In the Appendix, we present impulse responses for the Foreign economy. Home deregulation leads to a temporary
reduction in Foreign GDP and employment. In the long run, there are positive, yet small, international spillovers.


                                                       26
jobs, and because remaining workers are better paid, marginal labor costs rise. On net, the two
e¤ects largely cancel out.
       It takes about one year for unemployment to fall below its pre-deregulation level. This happens
because the expected present discounted value of job creation increases slowly over time, re‡ecting
the production lag for new matches and the initial reduction in aggregate demand induced by …ring.
In the long run, GDP increases and unemployment falls.43
       In contrast to a reduction in entry barriers or …ring costs, a reform that lowers unemployment
bene…ts does not have short-run contractionary e¤ects. The reason is that lower unemployment
bene…ts reduce the workers’outside option and boost job creation without increasing job destruc-
tion. Thus, as shown in the bottom panel of Figure 3 (continuous lines), unemployment gradually
falls over time, with bene…cial e¤ects for aggregate consumption, output, and investment. Yet, the
dynamics of in‡ation remain muted. This re‡ects again the existence of o¤setting e¤ects. Namely,
while the reduction in the value of unemployment leads to wage moderation, higher job creation
puts pressure on wages. Moreover, the reduction in job destruction lowers the average productivity
of the pool of employed workers.44
       As noted above, unemployment bene…ts can be either modeled as a transfer from the govern-
ment …nanced by lump sum taxes or as an exogenous income endowment distributed to unemployed
workers. In the former case, unemployment bene…ts do not directly a¤ect aggregate demand in
our representative household setup because bene…ts and lump sum taxes o¤set each other in the
household’s budget constraint. However, as shown in the Appendix, when considering a reduction
in home production, hP , the short-run adjustment mirrors the dynamics following a cut in unem-
ployment bene…ts. This result suggests that, in a highly regulated economy, the bene…cial e¤ects
on job creation and the destruction implied by a reduction of the worker’s outside option dominate
the potential costs associated with lower household consumption.
       Finally, the bottom panel of Figure 4 (continuous lines) shows the adjustment to a joint reform
in product and labor markets. Such a reform has in‡ationary e¤ects in the …rst phase of the
transition, and it stimulates output and employment immediately.
  43
      As for product market deregulation, there are positive but small international spillovers from asymmetric dereg-
ulation. See the Appendix for details.
   44
      Notice that both labor market reforms imply that the deregulating economy initially runs a current account
surplus, which then turns into a de…cit. Following the removal of …ring costs, the surplus re‡ects the initial contrac-
tionary e¤ects of the reform— Foreign households …nd it more pro…table to invest domestically. By contrast, following
the reduction in unemployment bene…ts, the initial current account surplus re‡ects the depreciation of Home’s terms
of trade and the corresponding surplus in the trade balance. Intuitively, wage moderation reduces the marginal cost
of production at Home relatively to Foreign, inducing expenditure switching toward Home tradables goods.



                                                          27
       So far our analysis has not addressed an issue that has received signi…cant attention in policy
debates: the consequences of market reforms for productivity dynamics. Figure 5 presents the
response of aggregate and sectoral labor productivity. We measure aggregate labor productivity
as GDP per worker: lpt          Yt =Lt . Sectoral labor productivity corresponds to the ratio of sectoral
value added to sectoral employment. Thus, labor productivity in the non-tradable sector is lpN
                                                                                             t

                                                                D;t t X;t
                                                                              N Y N =LT , where
                                                                              t  T;t   t

LTt denotes the number of workers employed to produce the tradable output.45
       To understand the dynamics in Figure 5, notice that three factors determine the dynamics
of labor productivity. First, market reforms a¤ect job destruction, with consequences for the
average productivity of existing matches, z~t . Second, variety gains in the non-tradable sector induce
e¢ ciency gains in the production of both tradable and non-tradable consumption. Third, labor
productivity responds to changes in capital per worker (due to time-varying capital utilization).
       The …rst row in Figure 5 presents the dynamics of lpt across reforms. A reduction in barriers
to entry (…rst column) leads to the largest long-run productivity gains, while a reduction in …ring
costs (second column) and unemployment bene…ts (third column) have more modest e¤ects. Prod-
uct market deregulation raises labor productivity mostly by increasing the number of non-tradable
varieties. Importantly, higher labor productivity is not associated with lower prices because the
initial increase in intermediate input demand is strong enough to increase the real marginal cost
faced by …nal producers. The removal of …ring costs increases the average productivity of existing
matches, since relatively less productive jobs are destroyed. Finally, lowering unemployment bene-
…ts has an opposite e¤ect, since the pool of relatively less productive workers increases due to lower
wages. This explains why long-run productivity displays a small decline following the reduction of
unemployment bene…ts.
       Figure 5 also shows that the short-run response of labor productivity is larger relative to the long
run. In the case of product market deregulation, short-run productivity gains are larger because
of higher capital utilization (an increase in capital per worker)— producers rent more capital in
order to meet the intermediate-input demand from new entrants, leading households to increase
the capital utilization rate. The removal of …ring costs leads to stronger short-run productivity
  45
     Notice that GDP is not equal to the sum of sectoral value added, since aggregate value added also includes
vacancy and …ring costs. However, since the share of vacancy and …ring costs over GDP is negligible, the dynamics
of labor productivity are in practice equal to the sum of sectoral labor productivity (weighted by the corresponding
employment share).




                                                        28
gains because job destruction is not immediately accompanied by higher job creation, increasing
the average productivity of existing matches.
    Finally, the second and third rows in Figure 5 present the dynamics of sectoral productivity—
the second row refers to lpTt , while the third row refers to lpN T
                                                                t . There are two key messages.

First, sectoral labor productivities comove positively in response to market reforms. Second, labor
productivity in the tradable sector responds more than non-tradable labor productivity— in partic-
ular following a reduction in barriers to entry. Both e¤ects re‡ect input-output linkages, i.e., the
productivity spillovers from the non-tradable sector to the tradable sector.


6   Market Deregulation at the Zero Lower Bound

We next investigate how the short-run transmission mechanism of structural reforms changes in
the presence of the ZLB. In our crisis scenarios, we follow the recent literature and assume that
an aggregate preference shock (the risk-premium shock              a;t )   hits the monetary union, depressing
output and generating de‡ation. The central bank provides monetary stimulus until the interest
rate hits the ZLB. We then study the consequences of market deregulation in such macroeconomic
conditions.


The Crisis and the ZLB

We assume that at time 0 the risk-premium shock is realized. We calibrate the size of the shock to
reproduce the peak-to-trough decline of euro-area output of about 4 percent following the collapse
of Lehman Brothers in September 2008. We set the persistence of the shock such that, in the
absence of market reform, the ZLB is binding for approximately two years.
    Figure 6 shows the adjustment following the risk-premium shock. As implied by the …rst-order
condition for bond holdings

                                                                            t;t+1
                          1 + at+1 +       at   = (1 + it+1 ) Et                       ;
                                                                     1+       C;t+1


an exogenous reduction in     a;t   lowers the marginal cost of saving in the risk-free bond, thereby
increasing the incentive to save and save through this vehicle rather than via capital accumulation
or product creation. As shown by Fisher (2015), the reduction in                      a;t   is a reduced-form shock
capturing increased household’s preference for holding risk-free bonds— the one-period, risk-free
assets At+1 . Thus, as households demand more risk-free bonds, aggregate consumption, investment


                                                      29
in physical capital, and producer entry fall. In turn, lower aggregate demand results in lower
production in both tradable and non-tradable sectors, and higher unemployment.
       The central bank immediately cuts the nominal interest rate to its zero lower bound and keeps
this accommodative stance for 8 quarters. As the negative demand shock slowly reverts back, the
central bank smoothly increases the policy rate toward its long-run value. Consumption, output,
and GDP recover.46


The E¤ects of Market Reforms at the ZLB

We now study the consequences of market deregulation at the ZLB. We consider the following
experiment. We assume that at quarter 0 both Home and Foreign are hit by the symmetric risk-
premium shock described above. Next, we assume that at quarter 1 there is a permanent change
in regulation. As before, we consider a permanent reduction in barriers to entry, …ring costs, and
unemployment bene…ts, and we treat this policy shock as unanticipated.47
       The general message of our analysis is twofold. First, the e¤ectiveness of implementing product
or labor market reforms in a recession is reform-speci…c. This result con…rms the analysis in
Cacciatore, Duval, Fiori, and Ghironi (2016b). Second, and central to the present paper, the
inability of monetary policy to deliver large interest rate cuts because of the ZLB is not a relevant
obstacle to reform, since reforms do not have noticeable de‡ationary e¤ects. On the contrary,
we …nd that reforms can indeed be more e¤ective in boosting economic activity when the ZLB is
binding relative to normal times, stimulating the recovery from the recession and ensuring a faster
transition to the new long-run equilibrium.
       Consider …rst the case of a product market reform. The top panel of Figure 1 presents the
adjustment when the recession is followed by a reduction in barriers to entry (dashed lines) versus
the dynamics in the absence of market reform (continuos lines). The reform has an expansionary
e¤ect, since it immediately boosts output and employment. The reason is that, as mentioned above,
product market deregulation is in‡ationary in the short run. Higher in‡ation, in turn, lowers the
real interest rate, as monetary policy does not o¤set the in‡ationary pressure since the economy is in
a liquidity trap. Ultimately, investment and aggregate demand increase. Notice that consumption
  46
     The fact that the nominal interest rate returns to its steady-state value smoothly depends on the persistence
of the risk-premium shock. We could consider the alternative possibility of a series of i:i:d: realizations of a;t . In
this case, the reversion to the steady state would occur more quickly. Our results are very similar across the two
alternative calibrations of the risk-premium shock.
  47
     This amounts to considering an unanticipated regulation shock assuming that all the state variables of the model
take the value implied by the impact response to the risk-premium shock.



                                                          30
falls by more initially relative to the scenario without deregulation, since households must …nance
product creation— although part of the …nancing comes from abroad, as Foreign households invest
in the Home economy. Overall, the presence of the ZLB actually contributes to reducing the
magnitude of the recession and to a more rapid recovery toward the new steady state.
       The bottom panel of Figure 1 (dashed lines) shows the net e¤ect of lowering entry barriers
when the economy is in a recession in which the ZLB is binding. We construct the net e¤ect
of deregulating markets in a recession as the di¤erence between the dynamics implied by the
risk premium shock followed by market reform and the dynamics of the risk premium shock in
the absence of deregulation.48 Relative to normal times (continuos lines), the reform is more
expansionary on impact. The reason, once again, relates to the in‡ationary e¤ect of product
market reform. In normal times, the central bank responds to this in‡ationary pressure by raising
the policy rate. By contrast, when the reform occurs in the recession, aggregate demand and
in‡ation are already low. As a consequence, the response of the central bank does not o¤set the
in‡ationary pressure brought about by the reduction in barriers to entry.
       Figure 2, shows the e¤ects of a reduction in …ring costs. In contrast to product market dereg-
ulation, lowering …ring costs deepens the recession. The removal of …ring costs further depresses
economic activity because increased …ring lowers aggregate demand in the short run. Intuitively,
…ring costs protect relative unproductive workers from layo¤s. Thus, facilitating layo¤s increases
the share of unpro…table jobs that are destroyed, which further depresses aggregate demand and
output in the short run. As a result, the reform entails larger and more persistent adverse short-
run e¤ects on employment and output when implemented in a recession. Importantly, these initial
negative e¤ects do not depend on the presence of the ZLB on the policy rate. The presence of
the ZLB actually mitigates output and employment losses. This can be easily seen by plotting the
net e¤ect of the removal of …ring costs assuming that the central bank can push the policy rate in
negative territory without any limit (dotted lines in the bottom panel of Figure 2).49 As shown in
the Figure, the adjustment remains very similar to that observed in the presence of the ZLB. The
reason is that, as discussed before, the reform has mild in‡ationary e¤ects to begin with— although
the in‡ationary e¤ect is a bit more pronounced at the zero lower bound relative to normal times,
  48
     The responses to the reform at the ZLB and the reform in normal times are aligned so the impact response to
the reform at the ZLB (which happens in period 1) is aligned with the impact response to the reform in normal times
(which happens in period 0). To show transparently the di¤erences in responses in the same diagram, we are shifting
the impulse responses to the reform at the ZLB to the left by one period.
  49
     That is, we assume that initial conditions to those implied by the risk-premium shock in the presence of the ZLB,
but let the central bank freely adjust the interest rate starting from period 1 on (when …ring costs are removed).



                                                         31
re‡ecting the larger …ring of relative unproductive workers and therefore the higher wage of workers
that survive job destruction.
    Figure 3 shows the e¤ects of a reduction in the level of unemployment bene…ts. Unlike the
removal of …ring costs, a reduction in unemployment bene…ts stimulates job creation by reducing
the outside option of the workers and therefore leading to an increase in …rm surplus. Implementing
a reduction in unemployment bene…ts is more bene…cial in a recession independently of the ZLB.
Also in this case, this constraint is not central to the dynamics triggered by the labor market reform,
since transition dynamics remain essentially una¤ected in the counterfactual economy without ZLB.
Finally, Figure 4 shows that a joint reform of product and labor markets is highly stimulative in
the short-run— and more so when the ZLB is binding.50
    The results presented in Figures 1-4 show that the consequences of product and labor market
reforms in the presence of the ZLB in a model with explicit micro-level product and labor market
dynamics are very di¤erent from those implied by the reduced-form modeling of structural reforms
in Eggertsson, Ferrero, and Ra¤o (2014) and other studies. Key for the di¤erence in results is
the in‡ationary e¤ect of reforms (or the absence of any signi…cant de‡ationary pressure) once the
relevant micro-level dynamics of products and labor markets are accounted for. These dynamics are
also responsible for signi…cant di¤erences in the implications of reforms for international relative
prices and external balances: While exogenous markup cuts automatically lead to terms of trade
depreciation and an improvement in the current account, product and labor market reforms lead
to stronger terms of trade and a current account de…cit for signi…cant portions of the transition
dynamics. In the case of product market reform, for instance, this is a consequence of upward
pressure wages from increased producer entry and the optimality of external borrowing to …nance
increased business creation.
    Figure 5 shows that the dynamics of labor productivity are not qualitatively di¤erent when
market reforms are implemented at the zero lower bound. However, quantitatively, short-run
responses are larger. In the case of a reduction in barriers to entry, this happens because the reform
is more expansionary at the ZLB (implying a more pronounced increase in capital per worker). For
labor market reforms, the stronger response does not depend on the ZLB itself, but rather on the
fact that deregulation happens in a recession. In the case of …ring costs, more unpro…table matches
are destroyed when …ring restrictions are lifted in a recession, resulting in stronger productivity
  50
     In the Appendix, we study symmetric deregulation in Home and Foreign. Results are qualitatively very similar,
except for the fact that symmetric reforms do not a¤ect international relative prices and the current account.

gains. By contrast, since the cut in unemployment bene…ts is more expansionary in a recession,
labor productivity falls by more, as a larger pool of less productive matches survives job destruction.


7   Conclusions

We studied the consequences of structural reforms when the economy is in a deep recession that
has triggered the ZLB on nominal interest rates. To this end, we built a two-country, two-sector
model of a monetary union featuring endogenous producer entry, search-and-matching frictions
in the labor market, and nominal rigidities. In contrast to the existing literature, we focused on
primitive changes in market regulation, namely a reduction in regulatory costs of entry in the non-
tradable sector, employment protection legislation (…ring costs), and a decline in the generosity of
unemployment bene…ts. The main conclusion of our analysis is that while business cycle conditions
at the time of deregulation matter for the adjustment, the presence of the ZLB itself does not
induce recessionary e¤ects of market reforms. In fact, reforms can be more bene…cial when the
ZLB is binding, as observed for product market reform and joint deregulation in products and
labor markets. This result re‡ects the fact that reforms do not have de‡ationary e¤ects in the …rst
place, and some are indeed in‡ationary, at least in the short run.

    The …rm surplus corresponds to the value of the job to the …rm, Jt (z), plus savings from …ring
costs F , i.e.,        F (z)   = Jt (z) + Ft — as pointed out by Mortensen and Pissarides (2002), the outside
                       t
option for the …rm in wage negotiations is …ring the worker, paying …ring costs. The value of the
job to the …rm corresponds to the revenue generated by the match, plus its expected discounted
continuation value, net of the cost of production (the wage bill and the rental cost of capital):

      Since the sharing rule in (1) implies that ~ W

Using equation (5), we obtain:

Inserting equations (9) and (10) into the sharing rule (1), we …nally obtain:

                        wt (z) = f t (z) + Ft                (1         ) Et        t;t+1 Ft+1 g               + (1            ) $t :

The average wage w
                 ~t is then given by

                             w
                             ~t = f~t + Ft           (1            ) Et     t;t+1 Ft+1 g                 + (1          ) $t :                    (11)

      Finally, notice that in the symmetric equilibrium the worker outside option reduces to:
                                                                  h                                                    i

reported by the OECD’s 1998 “Fostering Entrepreneurship” Report and Pissarides (2003). Data
on entry fees come from Djankov, Porta, Lopez-De-Silanes, and Shleifer (2002).
        In the absence of more recent estimates, and in order to capture various product market reforms
carried out in most advanced economies since 1997, we update the Ebell and Haefke’s measure for
2013 by making use of the OECD’s barriers to entrepreneurship indicators, which are available for
the years 1998 and 2013 (see Koske, Wanner, Bitetti, and Barbiero, 2014 for details). The index,
measured on a 0-6 scale, measures “administrative burdens on start-ups”, capturing both delays
and fees.
        Our procedure is the following. First, for the year 1997, we regress the log of total entry costs
in Ebell and Haefke (2009) on the OECD indicator of administrative burdens on start-up. The
implied coe¢ cient is 0:854 with a t        stat of 4:87 corresponding to a correlation coe¢ cient of 0:78.
The constant term is       1:345. Not surprisingly, there is a very strong correlation between Ebell and
Haefke’s quantitative estimate of total entry costs and the OECD indicator.1 Next, we then plug
the numerical value of the OECD’s indicator for 2013 into this regression, obtaining an updated
estimate of Ebell and Haefke’s total entry costs for each country in 2013.
        Finally, we compute the relevant cross-country averages to calibrate the average value of reg-
ulatory entry costs. We consider a weighted average of the index values across euro area member
countries, with weights equal to the contributions of individual countries’GDPs to euro area total
GDP.

    Interestingly, there is no statistically signi…cant cross-country correlation between Ebell and Haefke’s estimate
and the other components of the OECD’s barriers to entrepreneurship indicators, such as “complexity of regulatory
procedures” and “regulatory protection of incumbents”. This clearly indicates that the “administrative burdens on
start-ups” component does indeed capture …rm entry costs.

D    Impulse Responses for the Foreign Economy

See Figures A.1-A.5. In the Foreign economy, GDP and employment temporarily fall relatively to
the initial steady state, since there are fewer resources available for domestic production as Foreign
households invest in the Home economy. Once the number of producing …rms in the deregulating
economy has increased, the reduction in red-tape implies that more resources can be devoted to
consumption and investment in physical capital. In addition, as jobs are reallocated to new entrants,
unemployment falls, further boosting aggregate demand at Home and abroad. The larger number
of available goods results in higher goods substitutability and lower markups.
