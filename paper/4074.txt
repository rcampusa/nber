     GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS AND THE RISK PREMIUM
                     ON U.S. EQUITY


                                ABSTRACT


         We document that there is a significant foreign influence on the risk
premium of U.S. assets. Using a bivariate GARCH-in-mean process for
conditional expected excess returns, we fmd that the conditional expected
excess return on U.S. stocks is positively related to the conditional covariance
of the return of these stocks with the return on a foreign index but is not
related to its own conditional variance. Further, we are unable to reject the
international version of the CAPM. Evidence is presented for different model
specifications, multiple-day returns and alternative proxies of foreign stock
returns including the Nikkei 225 Stock Average, Morgan Stanley Japan and
Morgan Stanley EAFE indices.

                             1. Introduction
     What drives the risk premium on U.S. equity? If the U.S. capital markets
are segmented from foreign markets or if U.S. assets constitute most of the
wealth traded on internationally integrated markets, the risk premium on
U.S. assets should be determined in the U.S. and should not be affected
by foreign capital markets. Until the mid-1970s, these conditions seemed
to prevail. However, since then, capital markets have apparently become
increasingly integrated internationally and the market value of U.S. assets
has become a smaller fraction of world wealth. These developments suggest
that the risk premium on U.S. assets may now be determined primarily on
world capital markets rather than on U.S. capital markets. In this paper,
we investigate this issue and find empirical evidence of a significant foreign
influence on the risk premium of U.S. assets.
     The capital asset pricing model implies that the risk of the market port-
folio is measured by the variance of its returns and that, therefore, the risk
premium for the market portfolio increases with the variance of the portfolio's
returns. Further, with risk averse investors, the addition of a mean preserving
spread to the distribution of the return of the market portfolio increases the
risk premium, so that even if the capital asset pricing model does not hold,
one would typically expect a positive relation between the risk premium and
the variance of the market portfolio. Merton (1980) estimates the relation
between the risk premium and volatility using contemporaneous variance es-
timates. French, Schwert and Stambaugh (1987) provide evidence that there
is a positive relation between the conditional expected excess returns on the
market portfolio and the conditional variance of its returns using a general-
ized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) representation
developed by Engle (1982) and Bollerslev (1986). They use daily data from
January 1928 to December 1984 for the excess returns on the market with
Standard and Poor's S&P 500 index proxying for the market portfolio.
    For most of the 8ample period studied by French, Schwert and Stam-
baugh (1987), foreign capital markets were substantially segmented from the
U.S. capital markets and their capitalization was small relative to the cap-
italization of U.S. markets. There is now substantial evidence that stock
markets are reasonably well-integrated. For instance, Cho, Eun and Sen-
bet (1986),Wheatley (1988), Korajczyk and Viallet (1989), Gultekin, Gui-
tekin and Penati (1989), Cumby (1990), Harvey (1991), Bekaert and Hodrick
(1992) and Campbell and Hamao (1992) provide evidence of integration, es—
pecially during the 1980s, using a variety of asset pricing models with month-
ly data. Further, as Figure 1 indicates, the capitalization of U.S. stocks has
become a smaller part of the capitalization of the world market portfolio of
common stocks. These two developments suggest that the S&P 500 is un-
likely to have been an adequate proxy for the world market portfolio over the
last decade.
     Using the capital asset pricing model, the evidence that stock market-
s are fairly well integrated suggests that the risk premium on the market
portfolio of U.S. assets depends on the covariance of its returns with the re-
turns on the world market portfolio. This covariance is a weighted average
of the variance of the market portfolio of U.S. assets and the covariance of
the returns on the market portfolio of U.S. assets with the market portfolio
of non-U.S. assets, where the weights are the proportions of U.S. and for-
eign stocks in the world market portfolio. Even if the capital asset pricing
model does not hold, however, this covariance may be an important deter-
minant of the risk premium on the U.S. market portfolio. For instance, in
Merton's (1973) intertemporal capital asset pricing model, the risk premium
on a portfolio is still an increasing function of the covariance of the returns
of that portfolio with the market portfolio.
      In our empirical work, we model the daily excess returns of the S&P
 500 and of a portfolio of non-U.S. assets jointly using a bivariate GARCH-in-
mean representation. We find that the conditional expected excess returns on
 the U.S. market portfolio are significantly related to the conditional covari-
 ance of the S&P 500 with Japan's Nikkei 225 index, but not significantly to
 the conditional variance of the S&P 500. We obtain a similar though weaker
 result if the market portfolio of foreign assets is approximated by the Mor-
 gan Stanley EAFE index (which is a value-weighted index comprising stocks
from Europe, Australia and the Far East) and the Morgan Stanley Japan
index. We also show that this result is robust to a number of alternative
 econometric specifications as well as different measurement intervals for the

                                       2
returns data. This result implies that the impact of foreign stock markets on
the risk premium of the U.S. market portfolio cannot be neglected.
     When we compare the restricted version of the model which corresponds
to the international version of the CAPM, we find that we cannot reject the
model at the 0.05 significance level. However, given the small number of
aa8ets used in our tests, one might argue that this significance level is too
low. At the 0.10 level, the model is rejected when the Nikkei indices are used,
but not otherwise. Further, at that level of significance, we cannot reject a
two-factor model that implies that Japanese and U.S. market risks are priced
identically across countries when the Nikkei or the EAFE indices are used.
We view this evidence as supportive of the notion of international integration
among equity markets.
     The paper proceeds as follows. The estimated model is introduced in
Section 2. Section 3 presents the main empirical results. Section 4 investi-
gates the robustness of the results to alternative econometric specifications
and returns measurement intervals. Section 5 presents some concluding re-
marks.

                              2. The Model
    We assume that:

(Al) Markets are internationally integrated.


(A2) Investors are period per period mean-variance optimizers in a common
     numeraire, which we take to be the U.S. dollar.


(A3) The aggregate relative risk aversion, A =                      W, is
     constant, where A is the i-th individual's relative risk aversion and
     W is his wealth at time i.

     Assumption (Al) implies that assets with the same risk have the same
expected excess returns irrespective of where the assets are traded. Assump-
tion (A2) ensures that the capital asset pricing model holds. The assumption

                                      3
of a common numeraire implies that there are no preferred currency habitats
for individual investors.1 Assumption (A3) implies that the risk premium
changes only when the volatility of the market portfolio changes.
     An alternative to assumption (A2) used in some of our tests is:

(A2') Investors use the currency of their home country as the numeraire.


Assumption (A2') corresponds to a world where the exchange rate reflects
changes in the relative price of goods across countries and investors consume
different baskets of goods in different countries. With this assumption, the
world market portfolio of stocks is a portfolio where each stock position is
financed in the country in which the stock is traded. Hence, the excess
returns on a stock equal the returns of that stock in its own currency net
of the returns of the risk-free asset in that currency. The interpretation of
these own-currency returns is that they are equal to dollar returns hedged
against currency risk with a hedge ratio of one — i.e., one goes short one
unit of foreign currency for each purchase of one unit of foreign currency
stock. This approach, pioneered by Solnik (1974), leads to a linear pricing
relation between expected own-currency excess returns and their conditional
covariance with the world market portfolio of own-currency excess returns.2
     With these assumptions, we have:


(1)            E(R,+1 — Ro+iI2) = )tVar(R,,t+i — Ro+1)
where E(.) is the conditional expectation operator, ig is the investors' infor-
mation set at t, R,,,+i is the return on the world market portfolio from
t to t + 1, and R4 is the risk-free rate for the same period of time.
 Var(R,+j —R+1l) is the conditional variance of the excess return on the
    1See Adler and Duina (1983) and Stulz (1983) for reviews of the literature on interna
 tional asset pricing and discussions of the role of preferred currency habitats.
    2There is no theoretical reason for the hedge ratio of one to be the minimum-variance
 hedge. When it is not, Sercu (1980) shows that the appropriate returns are those of
 self-financing portfolios of stocks hedged against exchange rate risk using the minimum-
 variance hedge. Bailey, Ng and Stula (1992) provide evidence, however, that a hedge ratio
 of one cannot be improved upon for the Nikkei 225 by using conditional minimum-variance
 hedge ratios.

world market portfolio for the period t to t + 1 given the information set f2.
With assumption (A2), all excess returns are computed in dollars, whereas
with the preferred currency habitats assumption (A2'), excess returns are
own-currency returns, so that the excess return on the market portfolio is a
weighted average of own-currency returns.
    Using the capital asset pricing model and equation (1), we have:


(2)                 E(rd+lI1Z*) =

where lower-case r denotes excess returns and Cov(rdl+l, rmi+iIit) is        the
conditional covariance of the excess return on the U.S. domestic market port-
folio with the excess return on the world market portfolio.
     The return on the world market portfolio can be written as:


(3)                          = wdgrd+1 + (1 —
where w4 is the capitalization of the U.S. market portfolio as a fraction of
world wealth at time t, rdt+1 is the excess return on the U.S. domestic market
portfolio and rff+1 is the excess return on the foreign market portfolio.
     Using equation (3), (2) can be rewritten as:


(4)   E(rai÷iIflt) = \[wdtVar(rdt+jlcl) + (1 — wd)Cov(rd+l, rji+iIIlt)]

    In this paper, we focus on equation (4). If the U.S. market portfolio
equals the world market portfolio, the weights become Wdt = 1 for all t and
equation (4) reduces to the relation examined by French, Schwert and Stam-
baugh (1987). If the returns of the U.S. market portfolio are not related to
the returns of the market portfolio of non-U.S. assets, equation (4) still differ-
s from that of French, Schwert and Stambaugh (1987) since the conditional
variance of the U.S. market portfolio is multiplied by the weight of the U.S.
market portfolio in the world market portfolio.
     With daily data from a single country, equation (4) has a straightforward
interpretation because it corresponds to a portfolio strategy that can be easily

                                        5
implemented: buy the market portfolio at the close of trading and hold it until
the next day's close of trading. With daily data from several countries, the
trading hours generally do not overlap in calendar time. Using close-to-close
returns for each country, it is not possible to implement directly a portfolio
strategy of buying the world market portfolio at the close of U.S. trading
at time t and selling it at the close of U.S. trading at time t + 1 because
the foreign markets typically close before the U.S. market. To reduce the
problem created by non-synchronous trading hours, one could use returns
measured over longer periods of time, so that the non-overlapping period
becomes a smaller fraction of the measurement interval. We choose instead
to use daily data and address the problem of non-synchronous trading hours
 directly. Our use of daily data has two motivations. First, the period for
which it is reasonable to investigate the effect of foreign stock markets on the
U.S. risk premium is reasonably short, so that our tests would lack power
with infrequently sampled data. Since existing tests of international asset
pricing models that focus on stock returns use monthly data, the use of
daily data is a contribution of this paper to the international asset pricing
literature.3 Second, the results of French, Schwert and Stambaugh (1987)
that are most supportive of the positive relation between conditional expected
excess returns and conditional variances are obtained using daily returns.
     In using daily returns, we consider an investor who makes his portfolio
decisions at the close of trading in the U.S. markets. When the investor forms
his portfolio, he uses expected returns and the variance-covariance matrix of
returns conditional on information available at that time. If we had foreign
returns computed from the close of the U.S. market to the next close of the
U.S. market, we would use these returns as part of the information set. Since
foreign returns measured over the same calendar time as U.S. returns are not
available, we have to model the joint dynamics of the U.S. and foreign returns
to reflect the non-synchroneity of trading hours. Specifically, at the close of
the U.S. market the investor knows the return on the U.S. market and the
return on the foreign market at its close earlier in the calendar day. Since
   3Engcl and Rodriguez (1989) and Giovannini and Jorion (1989) use weeldy data but
test asset pricing models using returns on foreign currencies rather than on foreign stocks.
Chang, Pinegar and Ravidiandran (1991) use daily returns in a study of the integration of
European equity markets where the problem of non-synchronous trading is not significant.


                                            6
the U.S. market closes after most foreign markets, part of the next day'8
return of the foreign market has already accrued when the investor makes
his portfolio decision. As long as contemporaneous returns on the domestic
and foreign markets are correlated, the investor can use today's U.S. return
to improve his forecast of tomorrow's foreign return. Our approach accounts
explicitly for this correlation.
     The information iii the U.S. close-to-close return today about the next
day's foreign return gives the appearance that foreign market returns are pre-
dictable using the previous day's U.S. return. This predictability is spurious,
however, since it cannot be exploited through a portfolio strategy if foreign
markets are efficient. The foreign return does not contain similar information
about the next calendar-day U.S. return since on the previous calendar day
the foreign markets closed before the U.S. market and hence the information
in the foreign returns is incorporated in the previous day U.S. return.4
     Given that the lack of synchroneity in trading hours affects our modeling
strategy, it is important to make sure that it does not affect our results.
We therefore set up two further experiments. First, we know that as the
measurement interval is lengthened, the lack of synchroneity becomes less
important. Our robustness tests indeed show that our result that there is
a significant foreign effect on the U.S. risk premium holds if we use longer
measurement intervals for the returns. Second, we demonstrate that it holds
if we use open-to-open U.S. returns and hence allow the investor to form his
expectations at the open of U.S. markets.
     In the following, we assume that the information set of investors, C, is
proxied by a set of instruments that includes only past returns of the U.S.
and the foreign portfolios for the sample period.5 We therefore propose the
parameterization:
   41f we had used the close of trading in foreign market. as the time when the investor
make. his portfolio decision instead, today's foreign return would be useful to forecast
the same calendar day U.S. return, but the U.S. return would not be useful to forecast
tomorrow's foreign return. Hence, in this case, the returns dynamics would have to be
modelled differently.
   5This is in contrast to the instrumental variables approach of Harvey (1991) that con-
ditions the market risk premium on a set of macroeconomic variables.

     where the conditional variances, hj+i and ha+i, and covariances, h1+1,
depend only on past returns. The specification for each country allows the
returns to depend on two lagged disturbances to incorporate the effects of
infrequent trading on the dynamics of the index returns.6 We also allow
the foreign returns to depend on one lagged disturbance of the domestic
returns through q5j to take into account the lack of synchroneity in trading
hours. As explained above, with our timing conventions, foreign returns
have no information for domestic returns since, on a given calendar day, the
information in foreign returns is incorporated in domestic returns before the
close of trading of domestic markets; hence, there should be no        in the
domestic returns equation.7
     An important element in the empirical implementation of the model is
the specification of the dynamics of the conditional variances and covariances
over time. We use a general specification drawn from the ARCH process
originally proposed by Engle (1982), which allows the conditional covariance
matrix to be related to its own past values and past squared disturbances.
We posit the following general process:


                         N10 H " and H ——              fhd+1h+1
                                                       h1+i hj+i

(6b)                      ff4 = EE +                 + G'4Q
   6Stoli and Whaley (1990) show how the effects of infrequent trading and bid/ask spreads
can cause stock index returns to follow an ARMA-type process. See also Muthuswamy
 (1990).
    TOur method of addressing the non-synchroneity in trading hours could be improved
in future research since we omit the covariance attributable to the unanticipated return
on the foreign market between the close of that market and the close of the U.S. market
because that return is unobservable. Instead, we implicitly assume that the true covariance
is a constant proportion of the estimated covariance. If this assumption is incorrect, we
 would expect our results to be sensitive to alternative measurement intervals, but we show
 in section 4 that they are not.

formation as at time t and 4-f1 denotes the vector of disturbances from
equations (5a).-(5b). is an upper triangular matrix of coefficients, whereas
  and Q are free matrices of coefficients. This model was originally proposed
by Baba, Engle, Kraft and Kroner (1989) (BEKK). The important feature
of this specification is that it builds in sufficient generality allowing the con-
ditional variances and covariances of the two stock markets to influence each
other and, at the same time, does not require a large number of parameters
to be estimated (11 for the bivariate system used here). Even more impor-
tantly perhaps, the BEKK process guarantees that the coefficient matrices
in the system are positive definite. To see the level of generality we gain
by implementing this specification, we can contrast it with the multivariate
ARCH model adopted by Bollerslev, Engle and Wooldridge (1988) (BEW),
where the conditional variances depend only on past squared residuals and
covariances on past products of disturbances. The important cross-market
effects, highlighted by Hamao, Masulis and Ng (1990) for the national stock
markets of the U.S., U.K. and Japan, are ignored in the BEW specification.
A more general BEW process could be specified to capture these effects but
positive semi-definiteness of the conditional covariance matrix in that system
is no longer assured. We discuss estimation results with alternative processes
in section 4.

        3. Description and Interpretation of Empirical Results
3.1 Data
     We use three indices for non-U.S. assets. The first index is the Nikkei 225
Stock Average. The data for the Nikkei 225 index is collected from the Asian
Wall Street Journal and the exchange rates used to obtain dollar returns are
collected from the Journal also. The Nikkei 225 is a price-weighted index of
stocks traded in the first section of the Tokyo stock market. For this index,
we have data from January 3, 1978 to December 31, 1989. In addition to the
Nikkei 225 index, we used two value-weighted indices published in Morgan
Stanley's Capital International Perspectives that are available from January
3, 1980 to December 31, 1989. These indices are the Morgan Stanley Japan


                                        9
index in yen and the Morgan Stanley EAFE index in dollars. We use the
indices only on calendar days when they are available in both countries and
make no distinction between single and multiple-day returns. The Morgan
Stanley Japan index is the Japanese component of EAFE and hence is a
value-weighted index. The EAFE index does not include all stocks for each
market, since it generally ignores small capitalization stocks. However, it is
widely used by practitioners as a benchmark for the performance of non-U.S.
stocks and internationally diversified index funds generally try to replicate the
performance of that portfolio. It includes no adjustment for cross-holdings in
Japan and other countries, so that it may give more weight to Japan than is
warranted, as argued by McDonald (1989) and French and Poterba (1991).
     Table 1 provides summary statistics for the data, including the cross-
correlations among the various portfolio excess returns. The U.S. index and
dollar-denominated foreign equity index excess returns are obtained using
the three-month U.S. Treasury bill yields; those for the yen-denominated
Nikkei 225 index are computed with the three-month Gensaki interest rate.
Panel A indicates that the excess returns series exhibit significant negative
skewness for the S&P 500 and the Nikkei yen excess returns and generally
positive excess kurtosis. These results suggest that the returns distribution
deviates from normality. The Kolmogorov D statistic and tests based on Be-
   and Jarque (1982) confirm this formally. The autocorrelation coefficients
are exhibited in Panel B for the raw excess returns and squared returns se-
ries. The significant positive and declining autocorrelations for the squared
series indicates some second-order dependence that the GARCH models in
this study seek to capture. Finally, the cross-correlations between the S&P
500 returns and those of the various foreign index returns are shown in Panel
C. The significant contemporaneous lead correlations from U.S. to foreign
stocks in the raw returns reflect the lack of synchronization of trading hours
for the respective markets. Equations (5a,b) of the model proposed in the
previous section attempt to control for this effect. More interestingly, the
cross-correlations computed for the squared returns series suggest significant
cross-market dependence in the volatility. Again, the dynamics of the con-
ditional covariances applying the BEKK process of equation (6) can capture
such cross-market dependence in the volatility of the returns.

                                       10
    Equations (5a,b) require computation of market weights. We obtain
these weights from Morgan Stanley's Capital International Perspectives. S-
ince the weights are published quarterly, we use the beginning of quarter
weights reported by Morgan Stanley and compute the weights within each
quarter by adjusting dynamically the beginning of quarter weights using the
realized returns on the indices. For each quarter, we extend the interpola-
tion to the beginning of the next quarter and compare the weights that result
from our method to those reported by Morgan Stanley. In this comparison,
the reported weights are always very close to the predicted weights.
3.2 Empirical Results
    Panel A of Table 2 reproduces estimates of equations (5a,b) that use,
respectively, the dollar-denominated excess returns on the Nikkei 225 index,
the yen-denominated excess returns on the Nikkei 225 index and the Morgan
Stanley Japan index and the dollar-denominated excess returns on the EAFE
index as the returns on the foreign market portfolio. The estimates are
obtained using dummy variables in the returns equations (5a)-(5b) for four
days of October 1987, namely October 16, 19, 20 and 21, since it appears
that the distribution of returns on these days differs dramatically from the
distribution of returns for the other days in our sample. The point estimates
obtained without the dummy variables for the parameters of interest are
quite similar to those reported here, but statistical inference becomes more
complicated because of the serious departures from the normality assumption.
     The estimates of the equation for U.S. returns with the dollar returns of
the Nikkei 225 as the foreign market portfolio returns show that the condi-
tional covariance of the U.S. returns with the Nikkei return has a significant
positive effect on U.S. conditional expected returns, but that the conditional
variance of the U.S. returns has no effect. This result holds whether one uses
standard t-statistics or the alternative t-statistics robust to departures from
normality suggested by Bollerslev and Wooldridge (1990). Hence, this result
provides support for the hypothesis that the U.S. risk premium is determined
on global markets during the sample period. The lack of significance of the
   5Because of the large sample size of this analysis, the appropriate criteria for statisti-
cal significance for sample statistics and estimated coefficients are unclear. We highlight
throughout the text and tables, critical values at conventional significance levels but cau-
tion the readers that a more conservative cutoff may be appropriate.


                                            11
coefficient on the variance is surprising. Since the conditional variance and co-
variance have a significant correlation (0.57 if we use the dollar-denominated
Nikkei returns), one might be tempted to attribute the lack of a significant
effect of the conditional variance to multicollinearity. ilowever, if we estimate
a univariate model for the U.S. returns for our sample period, the coefficient
on the variance is not significant either. A more plausible explanation is that,
if the returns are measured with error, the error in the returns decreases the
precision of our variance estimate more than it decreases the precision of our
covariance estimate since returns squared involve taking the square of the
error whereas products of domestic and foreign returns involve multiplying
two errors that are imperfectly correlated. The estimates obtained with the
yen-denominated excess returns of the Nikkei 225 are qualitatively similar to
those obtained with dollar-denominated returns.
     The estimates using the Morgan Stanley Japan index and EAFE as for-
eign market portfolios are consistent with those obtained using the Nikkei
225. In both equations, the covariance has a positive coefficient that is
significantly different from zero using standard i-statistics. Using robust
i-statistics, the covariance coefficient is significant at the 0.10 level for the
Morgan Stanley Japan index, but is insignificant at the same level for the
EAFE index. The point estimates of the covariance coefficients are almost
the same for the equations using the Nikkei 225 and EAFE. The variance
of the U.S. has a positive but statistically insignificant coefficient in both
equations.
    Table 2 also reports results for foreign excess returns. The results are not
completely symmetric to those for the U.S. When we use the dollar excess
returns on the Nikkei, the covariance with the U.S. returns has a positive
but insignificant effect on the expected excess returns of the index, but the
variance of the Nilckei has a significant positive coefficient. The same result
holds for the equation estimated with the yen-denominated excess returns on
the Nilckei, except that in this case the covariance has a significant positive
coefficient with the standard i-statistic and an insignificant coefficient with
the robust i-statistic. With the Morgan Stanley Japan and EAFE indices,
the variance of the foreign index has an insignificant positive coefficient; the
covariance has a negative insignificant coefficient for the EAFE but a positive

                                       12
significant coefficient for the Morgan Stanley Japan index at the 0.05 level
using the standard t-statistic and at the 0.10 level using the robust t-statistic.
      For all indices, we tested the hypothesis that the expected returns are
determined in the home country — i.e., that Japanese expected returns do not
depend on the covariance of Japanese returns with U.S. returns and that U.S.
expected returns do not depend on their covariance with Japanese returns.
Though the results are not reported, this hypothesis is easily rejected for
all indices. Consequently, irrespective of the index used to proxy for foreign
stocks, the covariance of foreign stock returns with domestic stock returns
has an important effect on the expected returns on domestic stocks.
      Table 2 also provides measures of the fraction of the total variation of
returns captured by our explanatory variables. Whereas the fraction of the
total variation explained for the U.S. returns, denoted R, is small but re-
spectable given the difficulty of forecasting daily returns, it would be virtually
negligible if we ignored the international effect presented in this paper. For
instance, if we set the coefficient on the conditional covariance equal to zero
in the U.S. returns equation when the dollar return on the Nikkei 225 is used
as the foreign return, the R? falls from 1.16% to 0.29%; in contrast, it falls to
only 0.94% if we set the coefficient on the conditional variance equal to zero
and to 0.25% if both coefficients on conditional variance and covariance equal
zero. Note that if the coefficients for the conditional variance arid covariance
are are set to zero, the R2 captures the proportion of the total variation that
is due to just the lagged moving average terms which are posited to capture
the effects of asynchronous trading of the component stocks in the domestic
and foreign market indexes. Further, the R2 for the U.S. returns equation
in this case is substantially larger than that for a simple univariate model
(0.28%). Although the fraction of the total variation explained for the foreign
returns, R, is much larger than the fraction explained for the U.S. return,
it becomes comparable to the fraction explained for the U.S. return if j is
set equal to zero, as one would expect.
      Figures 2 and 3 plot, respectively, the conditional expected excess returns
and conditional variances and covariancea for the U.S. when the foreign index
uses dollar-denominated returns on the Nikkei 225 and show that all the series
exhibit substantial variation over time. For the U.S. returns, the conditional

                                       13
daily expected excess returns have a standard deviation of 0.09% and a mean
of 0.04%, whereas the unconditional daily excess returns have a mean of
0.025% and a standard deviation of 0.97%. Further, the sample mean and
standard deviation of the daily conditional variance are, respectively, 0.94
and 0.54, whereas for the covariance they are 0.09 and 0.22. As a measure of
the economic significance of the international effect on the U.S. risk premium,
our results suggest that a doubling of the conditional covariance from its mean
value of 0.09 to 0.18 doubles the conditional expected excess return on the
U.S. portfolio from 0.04% to 0.075%. Note that a doubling of the conditional
covariance is an increase of slightly less than half the standard deviation of
the conditional covariance, indicating that such an increase is not unusual.
Similarly, a doubling of the conditional risk premium is also an increase of
slightly less than half its standard deviation.
      Panel B of Table 2 presents the estimates of the coefficients of the dynam-
ics of the covariances from equation (6). The individual coefficient estimates
are difficult to interpret but the significance of the diagonal coefficients of the
    and Q matrices suggest that the GARCH effects are pervasive and strong.
 Moreover, most of the off-diagonal coefficients are also significant. This re-
sult confirms the evidence of Hamao, Masulis and Ng (1990) that modelling
 the cross-market dependence in the conditional volatility of U.S. and foreign
 stock returns is important.
      Table 3 provides evidence on whether the coefficients on conditional
 variances and covariances of Table 2 conform to the predictions of the in-
 ternational CAPM (ICAPM). The ICAPM implies that all the /3 coefficients
of Table 3 should be equal.9 Table 3 presents estimates of the models of
Table 2 with the /3 coefficients constrained to be equal. Irrespective of the
foreign portfolio used, the world price of risk is positive and significantly
different from zero. With the ICAPM, the estimate for the price of risk cor-
responds to the representative investor's coefficient of relative risk aversion.
The estimates for this coefficient vary from 9.6 to 18.1 depending on the
foreign portfolio used. Although the estimate is high, it is not altogether
   91n footnote 7, we argue that our approach may generate measures that understate
the true covariance. If it does, our test of the ICAPM is more conservative because our
estimate of the covariance effect, /3dc, is biased upwards and hence away from the other
    coefficients.


                                          14
unreasonable in light of the literature. For instance, although greater than
the estimates obtained by Friend and Blume (1975) and Hansen and Sin-
gleton (1983), it is substantially smaller than those presented by Wheatley
(1988) and comparable to those of Harvey (1991) in tests of international
asset pricing models.
     The last column of Table 3 presents x2 statistics that compare the unre-
stricted version of the model to the restricted version. The restricted version
cannot be rejected at the 0.05 level. However, one might argue that a more
conservative approach is warranted since we have only two assets. If we use
the 0.10 significance level as our benchmark, we cannot reject the ICAPM
when the foreign portfolio is EAFE or Morgan Stanley Japan; however, we
can reject the ICAPM if the foreign portfolio is the Nikkei, whether we use a
dollar-denominated or a yen-denominated Nikkei. This limited success with
the Nikkei may reflect the fact that the Nikkei is not a value-weighted index
and hence gives more weight to small stocks. Hence, whereas our results are
supportive of the ICAPM, the lack of rejection may also reflect the limited
power of our tests.

                              4. Further Tests
     In this section, we first relate the results to earlier work. We then ex-
amine the robustness of the results concerning the international effect on the
risk premium and conclude with more tests of the international capital asset
pricing model.
4.1 Relation to Previous Work
     French, Schwert and Stambaugh (1987) relate conditional expected re-
turns on the S&P 500 index to the conditional volatility of the index using
a univariate GARCU-in-mean process. They find that conditional expected
returns are positively related to conditional volatility. Their test is not nested
in the test discussed in Section 3 since they estimate the process followed by
the S&P 500 using only U.S. data. We replicated the French, Schwert and
Starnbaugh (1987) study over our sample periods for the U.S. and Japan,
but do not present the estimates here.'° Over our sample periods, the result
 10Fench, Sdtwert and Stambaugh (1987) estimate a GARCH(1,2) process, whereas the


                                       15
obtained by French, Schwert and Stambaugh (1987) does not hold for U.S.
returns as the conditional expected returns on the U.S. market portfolio are
not significantly related to the conditional variance of the returns of that
portfolio." In contrast, however, there is evidence that the conditional ex-
pected return of the foreign indices is related to their conditional volatility.'2
These results are consistent with the results obtained in Table 2 since in that
table the coefficient of the conditional volatility of the U.S. index in the U.S.
returns equation was insignificant, whereas the coefficient on the conditional
volatility of the foreign index in the foreign returns equation was significant
for the Nikkei 225 whether denominated in yen or in dollars.
      Bollerslev, Engle and Wooldridge (1988) investigate a trivariate condi-
 tional CAPM that includes three portfolios, namely a portfolio of stocks, a
 portfolio of long-term bonds and a portfolio of short-term bonds. Their ap-
 proach is similar to ours in that they model the joint distribution of returns
 using a GARCH-in-mean process. However, they posit dynamics for the
 variance-covariance matrix of returns that allow variances and covariances to
 depend only on their past values, in contrast to the dynamics we posit which
 allow for additional cross-market dependence in variances and covariances.
 They find a positive price of covariance risk, which is a result analogous to
 our finding of a positive price of risk in the equations estimated in Table 3.
      Existing research on international asset pricing has focused mostly on
 unconditional returns. The most notable exception is Harvey (1991), who
allows for the price of risk to change over time in a pooled cross-sectional time-
series test using monthly returns on a variety of countries. He models asset
returns dynamics with instrumental variables and uses a generalized method-
of-moments estimator to test the restrictions of the international CAPM.
He finds evidence that the world price of covariance risk is not constant
and rejects the hypothesis that Japanese stocks are priced according to the
international CAPM.
estimates reproduced in this paper are obtained for a GARCH(1,1) process. None of the
conclusions of this paper are affected if this alternative specification is introduced.
  11Glosten, Jagannathan and Runlde (1989) demonstrate the instability of the relation
estimated by French, Schwert and Stambaugh (1987) for different specifications of the
conditional variance.
  12See Chan and Karolyi (1991) for similar findings on the Nikkei 225 Stock Average
index.

4.2 Robustness and Stability of the International Effect
4.2.1 Synchroneiiy
     As discussed in Section 2, the use of daily data raises the issue of lack of
synchroneity in the returns measurement intervals across countries. There is
no way of eliminating this lack of synchroneity, but by using longer measure-
ment intervals, its importance should fall since, as the interval length increas-
es, the fraction of the interval for which returns are observed on both markets
also increases. Hence, one way to evaluate the robustness of our results and
the appropriateness of our approach to deal with the non-synchroneity in
trading hours is to reestirnate our equations on longer observation intervals.
Results with the dollar-denominated Nikkei excess returns are reproduced
in Table 4 for two-day, three-day and five-day returns. It is clear that our
conclusion that the conditional U.S. expected excess returns are positively
related to the conditional covariance of the U.S. excess returns with foreign
market returns is robust to an increase in the length of the observation in-
terval. Importantly, as the returns are computed over longer periods of time,
the apparent predictability of foreign returns from U.S. returns due to the
overlapping of the measurement intervals disappears, as expected.'3
     The lack of synchroneity in trading times leads to lower estimates of
conditional covariances since the same information can be incorporated in
different indices on different calendar days. Whereas we attempt to estimate
conditional covariances that proxy for the conditional covariances that would
prevail if trading were synchronous across countries, our approach is imper-
fect since it ignores part of the covariance because of the unobservability of
foreign returns from the close of the foreign market to the close of the U.S.
When returns are measured over longer horizons, the non-overlapping part of
the returns becomes a smaller fraction of the measurement interval, so that
the conditional covariance should jncrease.14 This difference between long-
  13As the measurement interval is extended, however, one would expect the estimates
to become less precise because the number of independent observations falls. Further,
our regression framework becomes less appropriate since longer horizon returns may have
different time-series properties than shorter horizon returns. Nevertheless, in a regression
not reproduced here, we extended the measurement interval to ten day. and found that
the /3.e coefficient estimate is also statistically significant with a value of 142.8

Japanese returns depend on the measurement interval because of the lack of synchroneity

run and short-run conditional covariances does not affect our conclusion that
there is an international effect on the U.S. risk premium since that effect is
robust to increases in the measurement interval. Although the coefficient fiat
falls when returns are measured over longer intervals, this decrease is not
significant.
     Another way to reduce the effects of the lack of synchroneity in trading
hours between the two countries is to employ open-to-open U.S. returns with
close-to-close Japanese returns. Transactions data of intraday quotes on the
S&P 500 from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange were available to us for the
1984 to 1989 subperiod. In Table 4, we provide estimates of our model where
U.S. returns are computed from prices one hour after the market opening.
We use returns one hour after the opening because opening returns have
different properties from other returns since an opening price included in the
index could be a price from the previous day.'5 These estimates fully support
the conclusions drawn from the estimates that use the close-to-close returns.
Interestingly, these estimates correspond to a aubperiod that is approximately
the second half of our sample of Nikkei data. Yet, for this second half, the
coefficient for the international effect is essentially the same as for the whole
sample when we use close-to-close returns.
4.2.2 Condiiioning Information
     The model estimated in Table 2 includes lagged disturbances to take into
account the effects of non-synchronous trading of component stocks in the
index on the measurement of stock index returns. The significant positive
effect of the first lagged disturbance is consistent with our infrequent trading
motivation for the inclusion of these lagged disturbance terms.16 Ignoring this
lag structure may have the effect of spuriously increasing the importance of
the international effect. This is shown in Table 4 where we provide estimates
of a version of our model that excludes these lagged disturbances. We also
in trading hours.
  15See Lin, Engle and Ito (1991) for evidence of the importance of this distinction for the
measurement of spillover effects across markets.
  160ne would expect the foreign indices to have more infrequent trading. It is therefore
expected that the first lagged disturbance should have a greater effect on the foreign returns
equations. It is puzzling, however, that the first lagged disturbance should have a greater
effect in the foreign equation using the value-weighted Morgan Stanley index than it does
on the foreign equations using the price-weighted Nikkei 225.


                                             18
estimated the model with j set equal to zero. These estimates, though not
reproduced here, show that the international effect appears to be stronger
when j is not included. Another alternative we examined (but do not
report) was one where we rolled back the investors' conditioning information
by one day, so that c....1 replaced c in equations (5) and (6); this approach
still produced similar results. Rolling back the conditioning information set
has three purposes. First, it is an attempt to see how the results change
with changes in the information set.17 Second, it shows how the results are
affected when the spurious predictability of foreign returns due to the lack of
synchroneity in trading hours is explicitly removed. Finally, it shows that the
covariance effect found for the U.S. expected excess returns is unlikely to be
due to asynchronous trading in the S&P 500 stock index. When rolling back
the conditioning information by one calendar day, the conditional covariance
estimate does not incorporate information from the previous day and is not
likely to be affected by information that may not have been fully incorporated
into stock prices because of asynchronous trading. In summary, our results
on the existence of an international effect are not sensitive to the lag structure
included in the estimated models.
4.2.3 Day-of-the-Week Effects
     The estimates in Table 2 use trading time as unit of measurement of
returns - i.e., all returns are computed from the end of a trading period
to the end of the next trading period. In Table 4, we provide estimates of
the model where we allow different intercepts in the expected excess returns
and the variance-covariance equations for multiple calendar days because of
weekends or holidays. The results are similar - although the robust t-statistic
on the international effect falls to 1.59. However, in this case, the coefficient
on the first lagged disturbance becomes strongly significant for both countries
and the coefficient in the Nikkei equation for the lagged U.S. return increases
in value.
4.2.4 Alternative Specifications
     Multivariate GARCH is a full information maximum likelihood (FIML)
 Note that our econometric models attempt to approximate (1). These models are
approximations because we condition on an observed information set that is necessarily
coarser than fl, the true information set.



                                         19
estimation method. Although it is more efficient than conventional instru-
mental variables methods, its parameter estimates can suffer from instability
if misspecified. To investigate whether our inference about the foreign effect
is sensitive to these estimation methods, we also employ an alternative two-
pass procedure. We first estimate the model assuming constant conditional
means to generate the conditional variance and covariance series and then
regress the excess returns on the conditional variances and covariances us-
ing a seemingly unrelated regression (SUR) model. This approach leads to
similar conclusions as the GARCH-in-mean approach. In particular, for the
model with dollar-denominated Nikkei returns, using this two-pass approach,
the coefficient /3a. is 54.02 with a heteroscedasticity-consistent t-statistic of

    Since equation (6) for the dynamics of the variance-covariance matrix is
a projection equation without theoretical foundation, we also estimated our
model using alternative specifications for these dynamics. We re-estimated
the model using equation (6) without imposing the BEKK constraints on
the coefficient matrices. This unrestricted version does not ensure that the
variance-covariance matrix is positive semi-definite. With this version, the
point estimates for the variance and covariance effects on the mean returns
were similar to those from the BEKK process but less precise. This was
likely due to the larger number of parameters required for implementation.
We also estimated our model using the constant correlation model of Schwert
and Seguin (1990) and the Bollerslev, Eugle and Wooldridge (1988) process.
The coefficients are again similar to those reported in Table 2 except for the
coefficient on the conditional covariance in the U.S. returns equation which
is 174 (with standard (robust) i-statistic of 1.81 (1.40)) for the Bollerslev,
Engle and Wooldridge process and 284 (with standard (robust) t-statistic of
1.44 (1.40)) for the Schwert and Seguin model. Though these additional for-
mulations impose strong restrictions on the covariance dynamics — constant
correlation in Schwert-Seguin and no cross-market spillover effects in BEW
— the covariance effect is still shown to be important.

     The market weights used in the estimation are constructed dynamically
from quarterly observations provided by Morgan Stanley's Capital Inierna-
 tional Perspectives. We investigated the sensitivity of our results to the esti-

                                       20
mates for the market weights by re-estimating the model assuming constant
weights of 0.5. These estimates are reproduced in Table 3 and show that the
international effect holds strongly with constant market weights.
4.2.5 Residval Diagnostics
     Table 5 reports some residual diagnostic tests for the bivariate and uni-
variate models estimated in this paper. Panel A presents the cross-sectional
and time-series statistics for the scaled residuals of the bivariate models for
the U.S. and foreign excess returns. The residuals are scaled by the square
root of the conditional variance, —•          indicate that the average a-
                                             Tests
tandardized residuals are small compared to their standard deviation (using
conventional t-statistics, they would not be significantly different from zero),
suggesting that we should not be overly concerned that overfitting might lead
to a bias in our estimates of the conditional means. The significant positive
excess kurtosis and negative skewness observed for the raw returns in Table 1
are reduced considerably. However, the Kolmogorov D and Bera-Jarque test
statistics for normality still indicate significant deviations from normality,
suggesting that our focus on t-statistics robust to deviations from normali-
ty is warranted.'8 Panel C demonstrates that the cross-correlation patterns
noted in the raw returns of Table 1 are mostly absorbed by the bivariate
model. In general, only contemporaneous correlations between the foreign
and U.S. returns appear to be significantly different from zero.
4.3 Additional Asset Pricing Tests
    In Table 3, we are unable to reject the ICAPM at the 0.05 level, but can
do so at the 0.10 level for the Nikkei indices. A better way to understand
our results is to compare them to tests of simple two-factor models. One can
think of two possible such models in the context of this paper. First, it could
be that there are barriers to international investment that limit the ability
of investors to take advantage of the benefits of international diversification.
We refer to this version as the "segmented" model. Second, investors might
not use a mean-variance framework, but rather hold securities also for the
  '8Nelson (1992) and Ndson and Foster (1991a,b) provide some conditions under whidi
ARCH models may perform reasonably in estimMing and even in forecasting conditional
covariances even when some evidence of model misspecification (e.g., nonnormality in
standardized residuals) remains.


                                        21
purpose of hedging against unanticipated changes in various state variables,
which we call here the "hedging" model. In the latter case, we posit the
domestic and foreign market excess returns as factor-mimicking portfolios.
    With segmented markets, the price of risk can differ across countries. In
Table 3, we report estimates of a model that allows the price of risk to differ
across countries. In this model, the coefficients on the weighted conditional
variances and covariances are constrained to be the same within countries,
but not across countries. This model does not appear to perform better
than the ICAPM. Hence, it does not seem to be the case that the weak
performance of the ICAPM can be attributed to the existence of barriers to
international investment.
     In contrast, the hedging model's performance seems to be better than
the performance of the ICAPM. With this model, the coefficients on the
weighted domestic conditional variance (covariance) and the foreign weighted
conditional covariance (variance) are constrained to be the same. At the 0.10
level, the hedging model is rejected only when we use the Morgan Stanley
Japan index. These results suggest that more work on a multifactor hedging
model could lead to a better understanding of how risky assets are priced in
an international setting. Evidence by Cumby (1990) and Wheatley (1988) on
the Stulz (1981) international consumption asset pricing model is supportive
of this conjecture. Additional evidence is provided by Campbell and Hamao
 (1992) and Bekaert and Hodrick (1992) in their work showing that changes
in expected returns can be captured by models with more than one latent
variable.
      So far, we have interpreted our tests of the international CAPM in terms
of alternatives that posit that the risk of an asset is not measured simply by
the conditional beta of the asset's returns relative to the world market portfo-
lio. Since all our tests assume that the world relative risk aversion is constant,
 an alternative to the models studied in this section is one where the world rel-
 ative risk aversion parameter changes over time.'9 Harvey (1991) pursues this
 approach using instrumental variables in a generalized method-of-moments
  19McCurdy and Morgan (1991) employ a multivaria*e GARCH framework that allows
    a CAPM-type specification with time variation in the conditional betas. They examine
the risk premia in deviations from uncovered interest rate parity in weekly spot currency
prices.

framework. With daily data, an approach that models the dynamics for the
price of risk explicitly will be difficult to implement because the instruments
used in Harvey (1991) and related analyses are typically not observed daily.
Nevertheless, in the spirit of Harvey (1991) we investigated the hypothesis
that the price of risk changes during our sample period by allowing the price
of risk to differ in the second half of our sample from the first half when
the index uses dollar-denominated returns on the Nikkej 225. We find that
the price of risk is indeed significantly higher in the second half of the sam-
ple, suggesting that further research should extend our approach to model
explicitly the time-variation of the price of risk.

                          5. Concluding Remarks
     In this paper, we investigate the relation between the conditional ex-
pected excess returns on the S&P 500 portfolio and its conditional risk as
measured by its conditional volatility and its conditional covariance with
the returns on some index of foreign stocks. We find that the conditional
covariance of the S&P 500 returns with the returns of foreign stocks is sig-
nificantly positively related to the conditional expected excess returns of the
S&P 500 over 1978 to 1989 when the returns to foreign stocks are proxied by
the returns of the Nikkei 225 index, Japan's Morgan Stanley index or, but
less so, by the EAFE index. This result holds whether the model is tested
using dollar-denominated excess returns or the yen-denominated excess re-
turns for the Nikkei 225. In contrast, there is no significant relation between
the conditional expected excess returns on the S&P 500 and its conditional
variance. We show that the international effect is economically significant s-
ince an increase in the daily conditional covariance between U.S. and foreign
returns that corresponds to half its sample standard deviation increases the
daily U.S. risk premium by about 0.035% or slightly less than one-half of its
standard deviation.
    Our result on the existence of an international effect on the U.S. risk
premium is shown to be robust to alternative measurement intervals of the
returns and to alternative econometric specifications. In particular, this effect
holds even if we use two-, three- and five-day returns rather than daily returns


                                       23
and if we use open-to-open returns for the S&P 500 rather than close-to-
close returns. Further, our results hold if the elements of the conditional
variance-covariance matrix obtained from the GARCH approach are used
as explanatory variables in a two-pass approach using seemingly unrelated
regression models.
     We are unable to reject the international CAPM at the 0.05 level of sig-
nificance, but can reject it at the 0.10 level when the Nikkei 225 index is used
as the foreign index. It is generally the case that a two-factor model where
the domestic and foreign indices proxy for unspecified factors performs bet-
ter than the international CAPM. In particular, this two-factor model cannot
be rejected at the 0.10 level for the Nikkei indices. Our tests are therefore

     uity from 1978 to 1989. The fitted values for the conditional variance (line) and
     covariance (solid bar) of the risk premium of S&P 500 index stocks are computed
     from estimates of the bivariate GARCH model using the dollar-denominated
     Nikkei 225 index returns as the foreign market (Table 2, Panel B). Note that

Summkry Statistics for Daily U.S. and Foreign Equity Market Excess Returns (in per-
cent) from January 1978 to December 1989. The U.S. equity index is the Standard
and Poor's 500 stod index and the foreign market index is the U.S. dollar- and yen-
denominated Nikkei 225 index, the Morgan Stanley Japan index (yen-denominated)
or the Morgan Stanley EAFE (dollar-denominated) index. All dollar-denominated in-
dex returns are computed net of the three-month U.S. Treasury bill yield and the yen-
denominated index returns are computed net of the three-month Gensàki interest rate.
The returns associated with the four days October 16 to October 22 of 1987 are omitted.
The Kolmogorov-Smirnoff "D-Statistic" tests null hypothesis of normality with critical
values of 0.0256 (0.0307), 0.0281 (0.0337) and 0.0271 (0.0325) at 5% (1%) significance for
2819, 2338 and 2522 degrees of freedom, respectively. The Bera-Jarque "B-Statistic" for
normality is based on the excess skewness and kurtosis coefficients and is asymptotically
distributed x2 with two degrees of freedom with critical values at 5% (1%) significance
of 5.99 (9.21). The tests for deviations from normality for the skewness and kurtosis
statistics are based on D'Agostino, Belanger and D'Agostino (1990). Cross-correlations
are given between the S&P 500 index daily excess returns, rt, (and squared returns, r)
and those of the index shown in the table. • flags coefficients significant at the 1% level.

Tests of the International CAPM and Alternative Specifications using the Bivariate Model
of Daily Expected Excess Returns for U.S. and Foreign Equity Markets. U.S. equity returns
are given by the Standard and Poor's 500 stock index and the foreign equity market returns,
by the US. dollar- and yen-denominated Nikkei 225 index (Model 1 and 4), the Morgan
Stanley Japan index (MSJP) (Model 2) or the Morgan Stanley EAFE index (Model 3).
The restrictions associated with the ICAPM model are (3dt = Pdc = I3j = f3jc, for
"Alternative 1 - Segmented" that assumes that the prices of risk in the U.S and foreign
market differ, f3d = fl and Pjv = 1/ c, and for "Alternative 2- Hedging" that assumes a
two factor model with U.S and foreign market risk as the respective loadings, 13d,, = 13/c and
    = /3,. Only the coefficient estimates for the conditional variance and covariance terms
in the S&P 500 and foreign market excess returns equations are reported with associated
robust t-statistim computed with quasi-maximum likelihood methods in brackets and x2
values of the likelihood ratio test of the restrictions. Significance at the 5% and 10% levels
ase denoted by e and .

Residual Diagnostics for Bivariate GARCH Models for Daily U.S. and Foreign Equity
Market Excess Returns from January 1978 to December 1989. The corresponding model
estimates are from Tables 2. The U.S. equity index is the Standard and Poor's 500 stock
index and the foreign market index is the U.S. dollar- or yen-denominated Nikkei 225 index,
the Morgan Stanley Japan index or the Morgan Stanley EAFE index. The Kolmogorov-
Smirnoff "D- statistic" tests null hypothesis of normality with aitical values of 0.0256
(0.0307), 0.0281 (0.0337) and 0.0271 (0.0325) at 5% (1%) significance for 2819, 2338 and
2522 degrees of freedom, respectively. The Bera-Jarque "B- statistic" for normality is
based on the excess skewness and kurtosis coefficients and is asymptotically distributed x2
with two degrees of freedom with critical values at 5% (1%) significance of 5.99 (9.21). The
tests for deviations from normality for the skewness and kurtosis statistics are based on
D'Agoetino, Belanger and D'Agostino (1990). p denotes the autocorrelation coefficients
of order j for both the raw and squared standardized residuals. Cross-correlations are
given between the residuals from the S&P 500 index daily excess returns, €, (and squared
returns, ) and those of the index shown in the table. * flags coefficients for which tests
indicate significance at the 1% level.
