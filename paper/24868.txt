The Role of Industry, Occupation, and Location-Specific Knowledge in the Survival of New

                                          ABSTRACT

How do regions acquire the knowledge they need to diversify their economic activities? How
does the migration of workers among firms and industries contribute to the diffusion of that
knowledge? Here we measure the industry, occupation, and location specific knowledge carried
by workers from one establishment to the next using a dataset summarizing the individual work
history for an entire country. We study pioneer firms–firms operating in an industry that was not
present in a region–because the success of pioneers is the basic unit of regional economic
diversification. We find that the growth and survival of pioneers increase significantly when their
first hires are workers with experience in a related industry, and with work experience in the same
location, but not with past experience in a related occupation. We compare these results with new
firms that are not pioneers and find that industry specific knowledge is significantly more
important for pioneer than non-pioneer firms. To address endogeneity we use Bartik instruments,
which leverage national fluctuations in the demand for an activity as shocks for local labor
supply. The instrumental variable estimates support the finding that industry related knowledge is
a predictor of the survival and growth of pioneer firms. These findings expand our understanding
of the micro-mechanisms underlying regional economic diversification events.

         How do regions acquire the knowledge they need to diversify their economic activities? How does the migration
     of workers among firms and industries contribute to the diﬀusion of that knowledge? Here we measure the industry,
     occupation, and location specific knowledge carried by workers from one establishment to the next using a dataset
     summarizing the individual work history for an entire country. We study pioneer firms–firms operating in an
     industry that was not present in a region–because the success of pioneers is the basic unit of regional economic
     diversification. We find that the growth and survival of pioneers increase significantly when their first hires are
     workers with experience in a related industry, and with work experience in the same location, but not with past
     experience in a related occupation. We compare these results with new firms that are not pioneers and find
     that industry specific knowledge is significantly more important for pioneer than non-pioneer firms. To address
     endogeneity we use Bartik instruments, which leverage national fluctuations in the demand for an activity as
     shocks for local labor supply. The instrumental variable estimates support the finding that industry related
     knowledge is a predictor of the survival and growth of pioneer firms. These findings expand our understanding of
     the micro-mechanisms underlying regional economic diversification events.

Figure 2: Work histories and networks of related activities. The diagram in A shows how individual work histories are used
to infer the knowledge brought into the pioneer firm by its first hires. The color of each worker represents their occupation,
while the color of the bounding box represents the industry. The yellow worker, for example, has experience as a cargo driver,
the same occupation he was hired to perform in the pioneer firm, but comes from a very unrelated industry. The light blue
worker has experience in a diﬀerent occupation, but in a related industry. B shows the network of related industries and C
shows the network of related occupations C. Node colors correspond to the highest level of the classification for occupations
and industries. This figure only shows the most important edges for each network, selected based on a trimming algorithm
that starts with the maximum spanning tree and then adds all edges above a threshold (see SI Appendix for details).

the third year, D shows the empirical employment growth rate at the third year of firms that survived, and E shows survival
rate and growth rate as a function of industry specific knowledge only. The gray color represents situations with not enough
data points. C Shows the average Marginal Eﬀect on survival of each variable from model (6) in Table 1, for firms that started
after 2008. F Shows the predicted values for model (5) from Table 3 for firms that started in 2005, for diﬀerent levels of
industry knowledge: low, medium, and high. G is similar to F, but for diﬀerent levels of occupation knowledge. In both F
and G, low means the smallest observed value among pioneers, medium means the median of the observed values, and high
means the maximum observed value.

This section provides descriptive statistics of the spatial aggregation used in the main text, as well as the industry
and occupation classifications. More information and descriptive visualizations about Brazilian region, industries,
and occuaptions at at every level of aggregation can be found in http://legacy.dataviva.info.
   We use Brazil’s RAIS (Annual Social Security Information Report) compiled by the Ministry of Labor and Em-
ployment (MET) of Brazil between 2002 and 2013. The RAIS dataset uses the National Classification of Economic
Activities (CNAE) for industries, and the Brazilian Occupations Classificatyon (CBO) for occupations, both revised
by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE).
   Information in RAIS is provided on a yearly basis and takes December 31 as the reference date. RAIS was created
to administer and control access to unemployment insurance and other pecuniary benefices to workers [1], therefore
workers have an incentive to report correctly. Moreover, in the years leading to 2007 the MTE instituted new control
and reporting mechanisms (such as fines, and declaration through the Internet) that created strong incentives for
firms to comply with the legislation that makes RAIS mandatory. To further improve data quality and ensure
compliance, the MTE cross-tabulates registry information from many other oﬃcial sources, such as the Ministry of
Social Security, the Federal Reserve and the Secretary of Federal Revenues (tax authority). As a consequence, MTE
estimates that RAIS is annually declared by 98% to 99% of oﬃcially existing firms [1].

1.1    Microregions
Brazil is divided into 27 states, which are divided into 558 microregions, which are divided into 5570 municipalities.
The revision we use here dates back to 1990. We focus on microregions because they span two main indicators where
selected to identify microregions: productive structure and spatial interaction [2]. The former implies the analysis
of the primary productive structure based on the use of land for agriculture, structure of establishments, productive
relationships, technological level and use of capital, and the degree of diversification of farming. The definition relied
on data from diﬀerent sourced, most of them generated between 1980 and 1990.
   There are a total of 5,559 municipalities that stay throughout the whole period, and 558 microregions. Figure
1-A shows Brazil divided into microregions, and Figure 1-B shows the state of Sao Paulo divided into municipalities.
Table 1 provides basic statistics for properties of both municipalities and microregions, and Figure 2 shows the
distribution of the same properties.

1.2    Industries
Brazil classifies economic activities according to the National Classification of Economic Activites (CNAE). For
example, a retailer of appliances and stereos and video is classified as:

    • Section G: Trade

    • Division 47: Retail Trade

    • Group 475: Retailing of computer and communication equipment; equipment and household goods

    • Class 4753-9: Retail Sale Specialized in Appliances and Audio/Video Equipment

   For our analysis we use the 3 digit level (group) because at this level the industries are diﬀerent enough, while still
providing a stringent criteria for pioneer firms. Moreover, we can be less concerned about reporting errors coming
from the firms not classifying their industry correctly. We identify a major change in the industry classification
between 2005 and 2006, so our study is separated into before and after 2006.
   Figure 3 shows how workers are distributed over industries at the 2-digit level (division), and at the 1-digit level
(sections).

1.3    Occupations
The Brazilian Classification of Occupations (CBO) describes and orders occupations according to occupational
characteristics that relate to the nature of the workforce (functions, tasks and obligations, etc.) and the content of
their work (knowledge, abilities, personal attributes and other requirements required for the occupation).
   The Ministry of Labor and Employment is responsible for the management and maintenance of the Brazilian
Classification of Occupations. The Brazilian Classification of Occupations underwent an intense revision at the end

of the 1990s. Here we use the resulting new version, CBO-2002, with approximately 10 Major Groups, 47 Major
Subgroups, and 596 Basic Groups or Occupational Families. In particular, we use the 4-digit level.
   Figure 4 shows the distribution of the workforce according to their occupation at the 2-digit level and 1-digit level
(inset).

2     Networks of relatedness
2.1    Relatedness coeﬃcient
The results presented in the main text rely on a measure of relatedness between industries and occupations built
using labor mobility following [3]. The result of the method described in the main text is a weighted directed network
for each year starting on 2007 (because the mobility of workers between 2006 and 2007 is used to calculate relatedness
for 2007). Figure 5 shows the Pearson correlation for the weights across diﬀerent years. The networks are relatively
stable over time, an important property of a network that aims to capture a property inherent to the similarity
between a pair of industries.
   Figures 7 and 8 show the full network for 2008 with a label for each individual node.

2.2    Alternative relatedness coeﬃcient
Another common way of measuring relatedness between economic activities is to build a bipartite network, and project
it into one of its sides [4]. Here we use this method to calculate two alternative measures of relatedness, as robustness
checks. First, we calculate relatedness based on co-location of industries and co-location of occupations. Second
we calculate relatedness based on co-occurrence of industries in occupations and on co-occurrence of occupations in
industries.
    The co-location relatedness for industries and for occupations are calculated as:

where ηii′ is the number of occupations required by both industries i and i′ , ηi is the number of occupations
                              (t)                                                                            (t)

2.3    Pruning for visualization
                                                                                                                  (t)
All of the analysis are conducted using the whole time dependent, weighted, directed network characterized by φii′
                      (t)
for industries and ψoo′ for occupations. For visualizing the network, we follow the pruning method described in [4].
We start by building the minimum spanning tree of the weighted network to use as a skeleton, and then fill nodes
until a certain threshold. For both networks we use the same threshold of 0.67, which ensures that the average degree
of the visualization is between 3 and 4. To layout the nodes we use the Allegro layout implemented in Cytoscape [6].

2.4    Louvain clustering
We use Louvain to cluster the nodes of both networks. We run the community detection algorithm on the minimum
spanning tree associated with the network, so as to make the communities independent of the chosen threshold. We
emphasize the fact that we have not used the communities for any of our main results.
   Louvain algorithm [7] is a heuristic method for greedy modularity optimization that returns a multi-level hier-
archical scheme. The algorithm consists of two steps that are repeated iteratively. In the first step, modularity is
optimized by local changes. We chose a node and calculate the change in modularity if the node joins the community
of its immediate neighbors. If the change is positive then the modification remains, otherwise it is rolledback. Step
two aggregates the communities obtained in step one, building a new network of communities. On the first one every
node is initialized in its own community and then they are grouped only if the modularity increases, this is repeated
until the modularity reaches a local optimal. In the second phase all nodes in the same community are grouped into
nodes to repeat the first phase again. Here we use the highest level of the dendogram, with the largest communities.
Figures 7 and 8 show the result of Louvain for the minimum spanning tree, and Figure 6 shows how the results of
the Louvain algorithm converge as we approach the minimum spanning tree threshold.

3     The knowledge of new firms
3.1    Identifying pioneer firms
Pioneer firms are firms that are i) new firms, and ii) bring a new industry to their region. We operationalize these
two characteristics in the following way: i) there is no record of the company for the six years before what we consider
to be the starting year, and ii) there is no record of the industry being in the region for at least two years before the
pioneer’s starting year.
   The fact that we need to track the work histories for a pioneer’s first hires for at least two years before the company
started, imposes some constraints on the pioneers we can study. For example, we cannot study pioneers that started
on 2006 because, due to the change in industry classification between 2005 and 2006, we cannot compare the industry
experience of the first hires with the industry of the pioneer. By the same token we cannot study any pioneers from
2007. The need for tracking the work history of first hires implies that we can only study pioneers that started either
on 2005, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, or 2013.
   Together with the aforementioned restriction, we add the extra constrain that the company stays alive for at least
one year after its foundation. This condition is not necessary for the analysis, but if provides a more stringent criteria
for the entry of companies, and is there as a way to address some of the concerns we might have regarding reporting
issues. Moreover, adding this condition means that we can now not only focus on the workforce on the first year,
but on the workforce during the first two years. The survival at the second year restriction means that we have to
rule out pioneers that started on 2013. In the main text we show the results for companies that started after 2006,
and in this SM we also show the results for 2005 pioneers without the second year restriction.
   In the main text we have presented the results for the three year survival rate, which means three years after their
starting year. Since our data is right-censored, we do not know whether companies that started in 2012 survived on
their third year. This forces us to study only companies that started either on 2008, 2009, or 2010. Moreover, because
in some cases companies will skip a year without that meaning that they are dead, we only consider companies to
be dead if they fail to report for two consecutive years. Since we need to check for this last condition, this forces us
to drop companies that started in 2010.

3.2    Measures of knowledge content; industry and occupation
The main text describes the two measures of knowledge content of a firm in terms of industry knowledge Φ and
occupation knowledge Ψ of its first hires. Here we will dive into the details of how these measures were constructed.
   We define a company’s first hires as all the employees that worked in the company during the first two years of its
existence (or during only the first year for companies that started in 2005). Because the first hires can be unemployed
on the previous year, we track their work histories going back two years before the company has started. We then
compare the previous work experience with their particular position in the new company; in terms of occupation and
industry. Since a worker can have performed more than one job, in diﬀerent industries or occupations, we take the
highest similarity between the work experience and the job she is performing in the new company. For example, say
that one of the first employees of a web consulting firm founded in 2008 is a salesperson, who worked as a salesperson
in an insurance company in 2007 and as a developer in a database consulting company in 2006. This employee’s
industry knowledge is given by the similarity between database consulting and web consulting (higher), not by the
similarity between insurance and web consulting (lower). Likewise, this employee’s occupation knowledge is equal to
one, since she has prior experience as salesperson.
   Because we are using the work experience of first hires to estimate the industry and occupation knowledge of new
companies, we drop every new company that has over 75% of their workforce coming from outside the labor market.
In other words, we drop companies for which we cannot certainly asses the work experience of their first hires.

4     Regressions for survival and growth
Here we expand on the analysis conducted in the main text by exploring other specifications of the logistic regression
that explains the three year survival rate.

4.1     Interaction terms
First, we add the interaction term between industry and occupation knowledge to check whether there is a substitution
eﬀect. Table 2 shows the results including the interaction term for the three year survival rate, and Table 3 for the
three year growth rate. The coeﬃcient of the interaction term is negative and significant, implying that there
exists diminishing returns. In other words, when occupation specific knowledge is suﬃcient enough, industry specific
knowledge does not contribute as much. Figure 12 shows the average marginal eﬀect for models (6) and (7) from
Table 2. In both cases, industry knowledge remains positive and significant, providing an average 5% increase in
change of survival for each additional unit of standard deviation, even after controlling for year, industry, and region
characteristics.

4.2    Region controls
Table 4 complements our results by replacing the region fixed eﬀects with explicit controls for region characteristics
such as population, gdp per capita, average years of schooling in the region, industry knowledge available in the
region, and non-pioneer survival rate. Non-pioneer survival rate is the survival rate of non-pioneer new firms in
the region, and it is meant to capture how competitive the region is. Industry knowledge available in the region is
calculated as the average industry relatedness of the workers in the region.

4.3    Access to capital
Here we resort to five variables that capture how easy it is for companies to access loans in the year and microregion
they started. We use the number of banks at the microregion level obtained from RAIS, the Balance of Credit
operations at the state level provided by Brazil’s central bank [8], the average interest rate at the microregion level
of all the “Indirectly contracted operations” (Operações contratadas na forma indireta automática) from BNDES [9]
(the largest development bank in Brazil), and the total number of operation and the average value of each operation
funded by BNDES. Table 6 shows the results for diﬀerent specifications. We note that even though the coeﬃcients
are not significant, the three BNDES variables add to the predictive power of the model (higher McFadden and lower
AICc). In all of the specifications, the coeﬃcient of industry knowledge remains consistent.

4.4    Separating the knowledge of the top, and the knowledge of the rest
The results presented in the main text use a simple average to aggregate over the work experience of all the employees
inside a pioneer firm. Yet, this simple average has the drawback that it might be capturing the eﬀect of most
knowledgeable individual in the company. Here we explore the question of whether it is just one employee (the most
experienced one) who is driving the eﬀect, or if there is also a team level eﬀect. Table 7 separates industry knowledge
into the knowledge of individual with experience in the most related industry, and the average knowledge of all the
other workers. The coeﬃcient of the average relatedness decreases, but it remains significant, suggesting that the
observed eﬀect is not because of the most skilled employee, but rather a combination of the knowledge possessed by
the team. Table 8 shows the separation between the knowledge of the most experienced individual and the rest of
the team for the growth of firms.

4.5    Alternative operational definition of pioneers
Next, we present the results over a much more stringent definition of pioneer firms. Here, we take all firms that
are new in a region where their industry of operation was not present in the two years before, and that there were
less than 30 workers in that industry in all the neighboring regions combined. This criteria reduces significantly the
number of pioneer firms, so adding fixed eﬀects leads to over-parametrization of the model. Table 9 shows the result
of the three year survival rate, and Table 10 for the three year growth rate for this very stringent definition of pioneer
firms. The eﬀect of industry knowledge is still observable even with this very reduced number of pioneer firms.

4.6    Alternative definitions of relatedness to predict survival and growth
We use the definitions of relatedness based on co-location and complementarity, defined in this SM, as a way to
check that our results presented in the main text are not specific to the relatedness measure based on labor mobility.
The industry knowledge and occupation knowledge of each firm are calculated following Eqs. [5] and [6] from the
main text. Thus, we define the co-location industry knowledge (ΦL ), the co-location occupation knowledge (ΨL ),
the complementarity industry knowledge (ΦC ), and the complementarity occupation knowledge (ΨC ). Table 11
compares the results using all measures of relatedness for survival, and Table 12 compares the results for growth.

5     Cox Proportional Hazards Model
Here we will use the Cox Proportional Hazards model as a way to address right censoring in our data, and to extend
our analysis beyong the three year survival rate.

5.1    Firms from 2005
First, we start with the set of pioneer firms for which we have the longest survival data for; the pioneer firms that
started operating in 2005. Figure 13 shows the Kaplan-Meier curve for pioneer and non-pioneer firms that started
operating in 2005. Table 13 shows the estimates of the Cox proportional hazards model for this set of pioneer firms.
These results confirm what we found using a logistic regression. Figure 14 shows the marginal eﬀects at the mean
for model (6) from Table 13, for varying degrees of industry knowledge and occupation knowledge.

5.2                Firms after 2006
Next, we run the Cox proportional hazards model for firms that started after 2008. Figure 15 shows the Kaplan
Meier curves for low and high values of industry knowledge, occupation knowledge, average years of schooling, and
local knowledge (fraction of workers hired from the region). Table 14 shows the result for the Cox regression. The
overall results presented in the main text and in this supplementary information (Table 2) are confirmed. Figure 16

6     Bartik instruments for supply of workers
The definition of the Bartik instrument that we use in the main text relies on the measure of relatedness based on
             (t)                              (ind)
labor flow φii′ . A high positive value of Bri (t) means that a lot of the industries related to industry i that are
                                                                              (ind)
present in region r have grown at the national level. A negative value of Bri (t) means that a lot of the industries
                                                                                                            (ind)
related to industry i that are present in region r have declined at the national level. Small values of Bri (t) mean
that either the industries related to i have not experienced significant shocks, or that these industries are not present
in region r.
   There is a legitimate concern regarding potential forward and backward linkages between industry i and its related
industries. In other words, the industries related to industry i that are present in region r might lead to growth of
industry i because of an increase in demand for i or an increase in supply for i. This mechanism, however, would
lead to a positive correlation between the shock and the industry knowledge in the first stage, which is something
we do not observe. Yet, this will technically lead to a potential violation of the exclusion restriction.
   To solve this potential violation of the exclusion restriction we use the 2010 Input-Output Matrix published by
the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE) [10]. Input-Output data for Brazil is only available for
67 economic activities, a higher level of aggregation than the one we use in the main text. The lack of granularity
has the drawback that if we use this classification of 67 economic activities to define pioneer firms, we significantly
reduce the number of pioneers.
   We use the input-output information to correct the measure of relatedness we use in the Bartik instrument, such
that relatedness is now defined by labor flows after controlling for input-output. The new Bartik instrument is
defined as:

xi→i′ is the output of i going to i , x→i is the input of i, and xi→ is the output of i.
    Table 15 shows the result using the Bartik shock adjusted using input-output data for pioneers defined as in the
main text, and for pioneers defined using only the 67 sectors from the input-output data. The instrument is weak in
both cases, and the standard errors are high. Yet, the point estimate confirms the direction of the relation we report
in the main text.
