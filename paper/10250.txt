Tight Clothing: How the MFA Affects Asian Apparel Exports

                                           ABSTRACT

International trade in apparel and textiles is regulated by a system of bilateral tariffs and quotas

known as the Multifiber Arrangement or MFA. Using a time series of detailed product-level data

from the United States on the quotas and tariffs that comprise the MFA, we analyze how the MFA

affects the sources and prices of US apparel imports, with a particular focus on the effects on East

Asian exporters during the 1990s. We show that while a large fraction of US apparel is imported

under binding quotas, there are many quotas that remain unfilled. We also show that binding quotas

substantially raise import prices, suggesting both quality upgrading and rent capture by exporters.

In contrast, tariffs reduce import prices. Lastly, we argue that the substantial shift of US apparel

imports away from Asia in favor of Mexico and the Caribbean during the 1990s is only partly due

to discriminatory trade policy: the other reason is an increasing demand for timely delivery that

gives a competitive advantage to nearby exporters.

1. INTRODUCTION

      Apparel is the archetypal labor-intensive footloose manufacturing

industry. It is also very distorted by protection. This protection is unusually

opaque, as world trade in textiles and apparel is heavily influenced by a

complex system of bilateral quotas called the Multifiber Arrangement

(MFA). Our goal in this paper is to improve our understanding of the extent

and effects of the MFA, making use of a unique dataset on product-level US

import quotas. We combine the quota data with very detailed data on trade

flows, transport costs, and tariffs, and we focus on the East Asian exporters

who have traditionally supplied the bulk of US apparel imports. Our

findings include

• The MFA constrains exporters in East Asia, although many exports are

   not subject to binding quotas, especially those from China and Hong

   Kong.

• Trade liberalization during the 1990s helped East Asian exporters to

   expand their sales to the US, but hurt them relative to their competitors in

   Mexico and Asia.

• Technological change which led to an increased demand for timely

   delivery also hurt East Asia relative to Mexico and the Caribbean.




                                       1
• The MFA raised import prices and transferred many billions of dollars in

   quota rents to holders of quota licenses in East Asia and elsewhere.



2. U.S. TRADE POLICY IN APPAREL

      A variety of restrictions have long affected trade in textile and apparel

products. As early as the 1950s, the United States adopted policies intended

to limit the imports of such products. One of the broadest policies, however,

became effective in 1974. The MFA established a system of quotas,

negotiated bilaterally, that limited imports of textile and apparel products.

      Recently, efforts have been made to liberalize trade in apparel.

Participants in the Uruguay Round of trade talks under the WTO agreed to

phase out the MFA beginning in 1995. The MFA was replaced by the

Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) which put in place a system for

gradual elimination of quantitative restrictions. The ATC incorporated a

series of stages, with phase-outs occurring at the beginning of 1995, 1998,

2002, and 2005, at which time all remaining quotas will be eliminated.

Remaining quotas are progressively enlarged, using agreed-to increasing

growth rates. The agreement also established a special safeguard

mechanism for protection against surges and a monitoring body to supervise

implementation. The United States has participated in the MFA phase-out


                                       2
process. Note, however, that when the first stage of quota elimination began

in 1995, the United States was one of only four WTO members that still

maintained import restrictions under the MFA.1

       In addition to agreeing to eliminate quantitative restrictions, the

United States agreed to reduce its tariffs on textile and apparel products.

According to the Office of Textiles and Apparel (OTEXA, a division of the

U.S. Commerce Department that administers the US’s MFA quotas) tariffs

on textile and apparel products were slated to decline from a trade weighted

average of 17.2 percent ad valorem in 1994 to a trade weighted average of

15.2 percent ad valorem in 2004. The majority of these reductions will be

phased in over the 10 years.2

       Regional liberalization efforts have also affected the degree to which

quantitative restrictions constrain trade. The main regional agreements

affecting the period which we examine are the Caribbean Basin Initiative/

Caribbean Basin Economic Recovery Act (CBI/CBERA) and the North

American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).3 The CBI/CBERA programs,

  According to the WTO, the other countries were Canada, the EC, and Norway. Many
other WTO Members maintained the right to use the transitional safeguard mechanism in
the ATC. Only nine members were deemed to have integrated 100 percent at the outset.

  See OTEXA 1995.

  The Andean Trade Preference Act (ATPA) was another program that provided benefits
that, in some cases, applied to trade in apparel. The (ATPA) was signed into law on
December 4, 1991, but excluded many apparel products. More specifically, ineligible


                                          3
initially enacted in the mid-1980s, provided preferential treatment for

imports from twenty-four countries in that region.4 While apparel products

are generally not eligible for CBI/CBERA benefits, apparel assembled in the

Caribbean Basin using U.S.-origin components receives preferential

treatment in the form of easing of quotas and/or reduced duties. While these

trade preferences clearly affected imports from this region, there were no

major changes to the policy over the time period that we examine.

       Prior to the enactment of NAFTA in 1994, Mexico did not receive

trade preferences on apparel exports commensurate with those available to

the CBI countries.5 The enactment of NAFTA, however, significantly

changed the relative position of CBI countries vis à vis Mexico. Many

apparel articles not eligible for benefits under CBI/CBERA were scheduled

for a gradual reduction in duties under NAFTA. Further, provisions for

production-sharing arrangements with Mexico became more advantageous

than those for production-sharing with CBI countries. (This change in the


products included, “textile and apparel items subject to textile agreements on the date that
the ATPA took effect.” In 1996, of total apparel (SIC 238) imports from ATPA
countries, $1.2 million of $6.8 million entered duty-free, and in 1997 $1.2 million out of
$15 million entered duty-free. In 1995, ATPA countries also became eligible for 9802
benefits. Assembled apparel items ($185 million with 47 percent U.S.-content value)
accounted for almost 95 percent of the value of U.S. imports from ATPA beneficiaries
under HTS item 9802.00.80 in 2001; the other industrial group with appreciable amounts
was textile mill products ($10 million with 54 percent U.S.-content value). See
Shelburne (2002).

  Note that benefits were subject to the countries satisfying certain conditions.



                                             4
relative position of Mexico versus the CBI countries can be seen in the

change in tariff incidence by region between 1990 and 1998, as shown in

Figures 5 and 6.)

          The differential effect of these preferential agreements on

Mexico/CBI versus Asia should be kept in mind. However, there were

generally no significant changes in the treatment of CBI countries over this

time, so that NAFTA is the more important element to consider. Further, in

the section in which we discuss changes in patterns of imports from Asia

versus Mexico/CBI, the tariff and quota data should capture the effects of

the preferential agreements.



3. THE EXTENT OF PROTECTION IN APPAREL

          Given this elaborate structure of trade restrictions, it is not surprising

that textiles and apparel have often been characterized as the “bad boy” of

broader efforts to liberalize trade flows. For example, Michael Finger and

Ann Harrison (1996) write, “Although textiles and apparel account for less

than 2 percent of total employment in the U.S. economy, protecting them

against import competition accounts for 83 percent of the net cost to the U.S.

economy of all import restrictions.”

                                           5
      U.S. imports of apparel encounter both tariff and quota protection at

the border. Data on tariff rates is fairly readily available. We utilize trade

data on apparel imports, tariffs, and transport costs from CD-ROMS

purchased from the US Commerce Department. These data are reported at

the 10-digit HS level, which is the finest level of disaggregation available.

Among other things, the data include information on import values, import

quantities, tariffs, transport costs, and source country.

      The data suggest a high level of protection in this sector, at least at the

beginning of the 1990s. Figure 1 shows histograms, weighted by import

values, of tariff rates across all sources of apparel imports. In 1990 and

1991, about half of US imports paid tariffs of over 16 percent, and virtually

none came in duty-free. There has been some liberalization since the early

1990s. However, by 1998, high tariffs were much less prevalent, and about

20 percent entered nearly duty free (with tariffs of less than 2 percent).

      Information on quota incidence is more difficult to obtain than data on

tariffs. As a result, analysis evaluating the extent to which the quota system

has restricted imports to the United States has been somewhat limited.

Information on US textile and apparel quotas is maintained by the Office of

Textiles and Apparel (OTEXA) within the Commerce Department.

Working with OTEXA, we have assembled a comprehensive product-level



                                        6
time series on the U.S. MFA program. Quota levels vary by product, year,

and trading partner. We obtained records on all apparel quotas from 1990 to

1998. OTEXA uses their own import classification system to administer the

MFA, which has no simple relationship to any other US or international

system of reporting trade data. The product categories are broken down by

type of fiber (cotton, wool, silk, man-made, and other), and are fairly broad:

categories include "dresses," "sweaters," "underwear," etc.. Using this data,

we are able to examine the extent to which quotas have restricted imports of

apparel and textile.

      The most important indicator of a quota’s restrictiveness is its “fill

rate,” defined as the percentage of a quota that is used. Fill rates that are

much less than 100 percent suggest that the quota is not binding, while

higher fill rates indicate that the quota indeed keeps imports below what they

would otherwise be. Appendix Table 1 summarizes quota incidence in 1991

and 1998 by commodity.

      Figure 2 illustrates the incidence of quotas. It shows histograms of

quota fill rates across all sources of apparel imports, weighted by import

values, for each of the years in the sample. If we define a binding quota as

one with a fill rate of 90 percent or above, the figure shows that about 40

percent of US apparel imports came in under binding quotas throughout the



                                        7
1990s.6 One question of interest is whether the gradual liberalization under

the WTO has affected the incidence of quotas. Many of the required

changes in quota restrictions have been delayed until the very last phase-out

period. In the case of the United States, nearly 50 percent of the planned

phase-outs will not occur until the final tranche on January 1, 2005. 7 In

fact, according to the 1998 review of the implementation of the agreement, a

number of countries complained that a vast majority of liberalization in

terms of the value of trade would indeed not occur until the final phases of

the program. 8 This slow progress on liberalization is reflected in the fact

that there has been little change in the proportion of trade coming in under

binding quotas during this period. Nevertheless, the fact that much of the

trade is not affected by a binding quota suggests that even the current

restrictions are not as onerous as might have been expected.

       Figures 1 and 2 cover all sources of US apparel imports, and are not

necessarily indicative of the barriers facing East Asian exporters. Figure 3

shows the value of apparel imports from East Asia. China and Hong Kong


6
  Industry experts define a quota as restrictive or “constraining” if it is filled to between
85 and 90 percent. Although this level is still below the maximum allowed export limit,
complexities in the quota management system (including complex aggregates) can make
it difficult to completely fill a quota (USITC 2002). The EU defines quotas 95 percent
filled as constraining. See USITC (2002).

are the largest exporters of both constrained and unconstrained imports,

while the smaller exporters (Thailand, Singapore, Indonesia, and the

Philippines) seem to have their exports very tightly capped by MFA quotas.

      Table 1 shows the extent to which quotas have applied to U.S.

imports, and it confirms the visual impression of Figure 2: the share of US

imports coming in under a binding quota did not change much during the

1990s. It is important to remember that the 1990s were a time of booming

demand in the US, so it may be that expanding quota limits simply kept pace

with growing demand, leaving the equilibrium amount of quota-constrained

trade roughly equal. Indeed, the import-weighted average binding quota

grew by 10 percent per year over the period. Table 2 illustrates that there

was substantial liberalization for the major East Asian exporters, with China

and Hong Kong seeing their quota-constrained exports fall by more than 15

percentage points as a share of their total exports, while Taiwan’s quota-

constrained share fell by 25 percentage points. By contrast, Thailand,

Indonesia, the Philippines, and Korea all found themselves more tightly

constrained in 1998 than they were in 1991.

      Figures 2 and 3 and Tables 1 and 2 establish that aggregate US quota

coverage didn’t change much, while the big East Asian exporters saw some

liberalization. How is this possible? The answer is Mexico and the



                                      9
Caribbean. Figure 4 shows that the 1990s saw a substantial shift in apparel

import market share away from Asia and toward Mexico and the Caribbean.

This was at least partly due to tariff liberalization that favors these countries

close to the United States, as seen in Figures 5 and 6. However, as tariffs

were liberalized for Mexico and the Caribbean, Mexico became more

constrained by quotas, as illustrated in Figures 7 and 8.



3. TRADE AND THE DEMAND FOR TIMELINESS

      Trade policy in the form of NAFTA and the Caribbean Basin

Initiative (CBI) is certainly part of the reason for the market share shifts seen

in Figure 4. Another explanation, discussed in detail in Evans and Harrigan

(2003), is that an increased demand for timeliness (by which we mean a

short and reliable lag between order and delivery) has affected the pattern of

trade. In apparel retailing, the demand for timely delivery comes from

fluctuations in demand, and varies by product category. To measure the

demand for timeliness, we collected data from a major US department store

chain on the percentage of various apparel categories that are subject to

“rapid replenishment,” that is, which are re-ordered continuously throughout

the selling season. This business strategy was almost unknown in 1990 but




                                       10
was in widespread use by the end of the decade.9 Since rapid delivery is

most profitable from nearby locations, our hypothesis is that imports of

products where rapid replenishment is important have grown

disproportionately from countries near the US.

         A possible substitute for proximity is airfreight: imports that are

shipped by air from distant countries can arrive just as quickly as products

shipped by sea or land from nearby countries. Air freight has gotten much

cheaper over time (see Hummels, 2001), but it remains far more expensive

than other modes, suggesting that only products that have a high ratio of

value to weight (“light” products) can profitably be shipped by air. If

airfreight is a substitute for proximity, and if airfreight is only profitable for

light products, then we should see that light products have increasingly been

sourced from countries far from the US.

         To investigate these hypothesis, we estimated the following equation

on a single long time difference from 1991 to 1998:

          ∆mic = µi + µc + α∆τ ic +β1rd
                                      i c + β 2 vic d c                        (1)

where the µ’s are product and country fixed effects and

         ∆mic = growth in imports in product i from country c

         ∆τic = change in ad-valorem trade barriers

9
    See Abernathy et al (1999).

                                             11
      ri = percent of products in category i subject to rapid replenishment

      dc = indicator equal to 1 for countries close to the US (Mexico,

      Caribbean, Canada)

      vic = value-to-weight ratio of product i from country c in last year of

      sample. Larger values of vic correspond to lighter products.



The hypotheses are that β1 > 0 and β2 <0: products where replenishment is

important, and products that are heavy, grew more rapidly from nearby

countries. We test this hypothesis using only observations where quotas

were not binding, and the results are given in Table 3 (which is closely

related to results in Harrigan and Evans (2003); see that paper for more

details, data description, and sensitivity analysis). The proximity-

replenishment effect β1 is about one, with a t-statistic of 3. How big is this

effect? Since the range of the replenishment variable is between 0 and 67

percent, an estimated β of 1.04 implies that high-replenishment products

from nearby countries grew 1.04×67 = 70 percentage points faster than

otherwise. This is a big effect: it is more than 2.5 times faster than the mean

level of bounded growth, and almost half again as fast as median growth.

For products where replenishment is less important, with a replenishment

percentage of 25 percent, the estimates still imply a big proximity effect,


                                       12
with imports growing 26 percentage points faster from nearby countries than

more remote sources. The replenishment-proximity effect is also large

relative to the effects of protection: the estimated parameters imply that, for

high-replenishment products, proximity to the US is equivalent to a 53

percentage point reduction in tariffs, while for goods with a replenishment

percentage of 25 percent proximity is equivalent to a 20 percentage point

tariff reduction.

      The effect of weight is also large. The standard deviation of the

value-weight ratio is 230; multiplying this by the estimated β2 means that

imports of light products grew -0.132*230 = 30 percentage points more

slowly from nearby than from faraway countries.



4. THE EFFECT OF PROTECTION ON IMPORT PRICES

      We have shown that both trade policy and geography have had an

important effect on the pattern and volume of trade in apparel. We now turn

to the effect of US trade policy on the prices of apparel imports. With two

or more competing exporters, a key parameter is the degree of

substitutability in the importer’s demand between the products of the

different exporters. We consider a few simple cases here, as a guide to

empirical work.


                                       13
       The simplest model that is relevant to the MFA is one where there are

two exporters, only one of whom faces a binding quota, and whose exports

are perfect substitutes in the importer’s demand. The situation is illustrated

in Figure 9.

       The import demand curve facing two exporting countries A and B is

given by m(p). A has lower costs cA < cB, so that in the absence of trade

restrictions all imports would be from A. However, a quota has been placed

on imports from A, mA ≤ Q. As a result, the world price is determined by cost

in B, p = cB, with exporters in A earning a rent per unit equal to the cost

difference.10 The quota binds, with mA = Q and mB = m(cB)- Q .

       An interesting thing about this little model is that it implies that,

across a group of exporting countries, there need be no relationship between

unit value and a binding quota: the two countries charge the same price even

though one is bound by a quota and the other is not. Furthermore, any

change in the level of the quota will have no effect on price, as long as Q ≤

m(cB); beyond that point, B’s market share goes to zero and any further

quota relaxation leads to a fall in price as the equilibrium moves down the

demand curve.



10
  Technical point: the importer is indifferent between buying from A or B at any price, so
assume an infinitesimally lower price from A to close the model.


                                           14
      What if imports from A and B are imperfect substitutes? This case is

illustrated in the two panels of Figure 10. A relaxation of the quota

constraint on A leads to lower prices on imports from A, which in turn shifts

the demand curve facing exporters in B. Depending on the elasticities of

demand in the two markets, and the elasticity of supply in B, relative prices

of A and B exports can rise, fall, or stay the same. A useful benchmark is

one where the own-elasticity of demand is the same, while the cross

elasticity is less than the own-elasticity: in this case, the shift down in B’s

demand curve is less than the fall in the price facing A. This implies that the

equilibrium price of imports from A will fall relative to the price of imports

from B when the quota on A is relaxed. In the cross-section, then, binding

quotas will be associated with higher prices. Note however, that the

equilibrium price difference across exporters depends on many structural

parameters of demand and supply that are impossible to estimate without a

great deal of information.

      What about non-binding quotas? In most models unfilled quotas will

have no effect, and the equilibrium is the same as one with no quotas at all.

      This theoretical discussion suggests a simple reduced-form model for

the effect of quotas on import prices:




                                         15
ln pict = αi + α c + α t + β1 ln(1 + τ ict ) + β 2 ln(1 + fillrateict ) + β 3bindingict + ε ict (2)

     In equation (2), the α’s are product, country, and year fixed effects. The

     slope coefficients β measure the effects of

              τict    ad-valorem trade barriers, including tariffs and transport costs

     fillrateict      the proportion of a quota which is used. By definition, the fill

                      rate for flows not subject to a quota is zero (since the implicit

                      quota is infinite).

     bindingict       A dummy variable equal to 1 if the quota is binding.



     A drawback of (2) is that it imposes constant coefficients across products

     and years. Our data has enough cross-sectional variability to make year-by-

     year estimation feasible, so we also estimate

    ln pict = α it + α ct + β1t ln(1 + τ ict ) + β 2 t ln(1 + fillrateict ) + β 3t bindingict + ε ict (3)

     While equations (2) and (3) are non-structural, theory does give some

     suggestions about the interpretation of the slope coefficients. β1 summarizes

     how f.o.b. import prices respond to ad-valorem trade barriers, and is

     expected to be negative to the extent that the US has market power. If non-

     binding quotas don’t have any effect, β2 is likely to be zero, given that the

     effect of binding quotas is measured by β3.




                                                       16
          A problem with estimating (2) and (3) is that we do not have true

price data and must make do with unit values instead. Unit values are

constructed from the raw data by dividing the value of shipments by the

physical quantity of imports (usually measured by “dozens” in the case of

apparel). Unit values in a given category can differ across exporters even if

identical goods have identical prices everywhere, to the extent that the

composition of exports within a category differs by source country. The

theory of “quality upgrading” suggests that binding quotas induce higher

unit values, in which case β3 > 0 may measure quality differences rather than

quota rents.11

          Table 4 shows the results of estimating equations (2) and (3). We

report both OLS and weighted least squares estimates, with the weights

given by import values. We focus here on the WLS results.

          The column headed “barriers” suggests that the US does indeed have

market power in apparel, with a significantly negative elasticity of import

prices with respect to ad-valorem barriers in most years. Interestingly, the

effect seems to have declined over time, with an elasticity of -0.5 at the

beginning of the sample and only -0.06 by 1998.

of 6.3 percentage points. Between 1990 and 1996, the quota effect was on

the order of 5-10 percentage points, an effect which jumped to 24 in the

“Asia Crisis” year of 1997 before becoming slightly negative in the recovery

year of 1998. This anomalous behavior may be due to the fact that two of

the largest quota-constrained exporters, China and Hong Kong, did not

devalue in 1997, while other countries did.

       Controlling for whether or not a quota is binding, the fill rate has no

effect, as shown in the first row of Table 4. For clarity in reporting, we

excluded the fill rate as a regressor in the year-by-year regressions.12

       Our results suggest that effect of quotas on prices is a step function:

for fill rates between zero and 90 percent the effect is zero, and for fill rates

above 90 the effect is constant. This is the right specification only if quotas

bind precisely when fill rates hit 90 percent but not before or after. To check

this we estimated versions of equation (2) that included dummies for fill

rates in the intervals [80,85), [85,90), [90,95), and [95,100]. The results

suggests that quotas start to bind at fill rates of around 85 percent, and that




12
  This result is not surprising, but it does cast doubt on the results of Krishna and Tan
(1998). They find a positive effect of fill rate on import prices, but fail to control for
whether the quota is binding.

the price effect is constant between 85 percent and 100 percent.13 However,

the results from assuming that quotas bind at a fill rate of 85% are not

materially different from the results reported in Table 4.

       What do these results imply about the level of quota rents? It is

impossible to answer this question with any confidence, since our statistical

model is non-structural, but a back of the envelope calculation is instructive.

Using the overall WLS binding quota effect of 6.3 percent, and multiplying

by the aggregate quantity of quota-constrained imports between 1990 and

1998 ($106.5 billion), gives an estimate of quota rents of $6.71 billion. This

is almost surely a lower bound on the cost of the MFA for US apparel

consumers, since the elimination of quotas would likely reduce world prices.



5. CONCLUSIONS

       The 1990s had both good and bad news for East Asian apparel

exporters. Their overall exports to the US increased, at least partly due to

trade liberalization in the form of reduced tariffs and expanded quotas. But

both discriminatory trade policy (NAFTA and the CBI) and technological

change (which made proximity to the US market more valuable) conspired

13
  In particular, the coefficient on the indicator for the [80,85) interval is insignificantly
different from zero, while the other intervals are all significantly positive. In addition, an

against East Asia, leading to a loss of market share to Mexico and the

Caribbean. As trade continues to liberalize, trade policy may cease to be an

advantage for exporters near the US market, but their geographical

advantage will persist. This suggests that even when the MFA is finally

phased out, trade patterns are unlikely to return to where they were before

NAFTA and the CBI.

        The MFA continued to substantially distort trade even after the

founding of the WTO. We find that MFA quotas tightly constrained many

East Asian exporters, and led to substantially higher import prices in the US.

A rough calculation suggests that MFA quotas yielded many billions of

dollars in quota rents to holders of quota licenses.




F-test fails to reject the hypothesis that the coefficients on the [85,90), [90,95), and
[95,100] intervals are equal.
