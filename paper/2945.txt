     This    paper examines the impact of financial market imperfections on long-term produc-

tivity growth. It focuses on failures in markets for the sale of equity securities and hence on the

failure of markets which help firms diversify the risks of real investment. The paper examines

separately situations in which productivity growth is driven by learning-by-doing and where it

results   from the cumulative impact of explicit investments in technology by firms. In general. a

multiplicity   of steady-state growth paths exists with different growth rates along each path. The

particular path followed by any single economy (and hence the growth rate of that economy)

will depend significantly on policy interventions which mitigate effects of financial markets.

Introduction
     This paper investigates the impact of financial markets on long run technological develop-

ment. The classical approach to such a question centered on the role of financial markets in

determining the level of interest rates and the impact of interest rates on investments of all kinds.

including investments in research and development. With perfectly informed and competitive

financial markets, interest rates are determined by the interaction of real household savings dec'i-

sions and firm investment decisions. Thus, in the strictest classical (and new classical) tradition,

financial markets play no role in determining the rate of technological development except in so

far as they influence transactions costs in transferring funds from lender households to investor

finns. However, international and interfirm differences in productivity growth which appear to

be related to differences in institutional financial structures raise doubts about this simple classi-

cal description of the problem. Moreover, real financial markets appear to differ substantially

from the neoclassical norm, being characterized by a wide range of informational imperfec-

tions.'

     This paper, therefore, concentrates on the impact of informational imperfections markets on

investment in productivity improvements. As a typical example, it examines the consequences

of a situation in which the owner/managers of firms are better informed about their firms' future

prospects than participants in financial markets at large. Under these circumstances, as demon-

strated by Leland and Pyle [1976], Stiglitz [1982], Myers and Majiuf [1984] and Greenwald, Sti-

glitz and Weiss [1984], markets for the sale of equity shares in firms will function only imper.

fectly and firms will be constrained in the amounts of equity capital that they can raise. Since

    See Greenwald and Stiglitz (1986].
                                                       -2-

these results are familiar, the focus of the paper is on how such finance constraints are likely to

affect productivity growth. Consequently no attempt will be made to describe explicitly the
informational underpinings of the failure of equity markets. Instead, with the aim of simplifying

the analysis as far as possible, we will assume that firms are unable to raise equity in external

financial markets.2

      We also assume that owner/managers of firms are averse to bankruptcy, that production

decisions entail risks (e.g. because inputs must be paid for before output prices are known) and

that these risks cannot be eliminated by trading in futures market (e.g. because, for informational

and transactions cost reasons, futures markets are incomplete). The failures in equity markets

limit the abilities of firms to diversify the risks of their operations and hence lead to the reduc-

tion in the level of such operations as an alternative means of risk management. Since the cur-

 tailment of flim operations will limit the extent of on-the-job training and other learning effects

 as well as direct investment in productivity improvements the capital market imperfections to

 which we referred earlier will adversely affect the overall rate of productivity growth.

                                                                                for differences in the rate of
       This model, in addition, to providing a possible explanation

 productivity growth across economies also provides possible explanations for three widely

 observed empirical phenomena. First, it accounts for the apparent absence of decreasing returns
                                                                                          to be associated with
 in the process of growth (if anything higher levels of development appear

 higher rather than lower rates of growth3). Second, our model produces firm growth rates

  which, consistent with Gibrat's law, are independent of finn size. Finally, the model yields the

  widely observed cyclical fluctuations in productivity of the kind originally noted by Okun.
    2 We could equivalently assume that there are fixed, but positive, equity issue constraints. In prtice, firms
  appear to rely to a very limited extent on external equity markets (see Taggart (19831) and doing so appears to be
  costly (see Asquith and Mullins [19831).
       See, fcc example, the historical data in Romer (19861.

      The paper consists, beyond this introduction, of three parts. Section one describes the

behavior of firms and their supply decisions. Section two then embeds these firms in a general

equilibrium model in which productivity growth is determined by aggregate learning-by-doing

(similar to the specification used by Romer [1988]) and examines the properties of the resulting

growth rates. Section three is a brief conclusion.



1. Firm Behavior and Aggregate Supply


Outline of' the theory of the Firm

      In this section, we present a simple model of the behavior of a risk- (or more precisely,

bankruptcy-) averse firm, facing uncertain relative prices of the goods which it produces. The

firm begins each period with an inherited net worth, or what we refer to as its equity.4 Workers5

are paid at the beginning of the period of production. If wage payments exceed the firm's

    The term "equity" has several related but distinct meanings. The term is often used to describe the market
value of the firm's shares. This market value should be closely related to the use of the term here, but empincal
results suggesting the "q" may deviate substantially from unity imply that, at any moment, the market value of the
equity may differ substantially from the firm's "net worth." In the present model, the managers of the firm are
assumed to pay no attention to the stock market valuation. This is obviously an extreme assumption, but one which.
we suspect, fits the facts better than the alternative polar assumption usually employed, that firm behavior is
determined by the current market value of q. Since this number is highly volatile, the current market value of q
may only be loosely related to the future market value at the time an investment project is completed. This is
particularly true, given the asymmeuies of information between the firm's managers and outsiders. Is itlikely that
the firm's managers would base their business judgments more on uninformed outsider's valuation of the firm's
prospects than on their own inside information? (The observed success of the "q" model may be a consequence of
a spurious correlaiion q will be high for firms that are doing well today, and these firms will also have a high "net
worth." Our theory argues it is the latter, not the former, which largely determines firm behavior, Of course, to the
extent that outsider's and insider's views coincide, then a firm with good investment prospects will also have a high
q; but now it is not q which is driving the firm behavior, but the underlying prospects, which are reflected in q .).
     At the same time. q is not directly relevant for the very short term concerns of the firm â€” q does not affect
the firm's bankruptcy probability, though bad prospects will be reflected again both in a low q and a high
bankruptcy probability. (Good prospects may also make it less likely that the firm will be subjected to credit
rationing, a concern from which we abstract in this paper.)
      To remind the reader of the specific way in which we use the term equity, we shall, from time to time, place
the term in quotation marks.
     In this paper, we abstract from all inputs other than labor. However, we could easily incorporate other inputs
assuming that, like labor, they are paid for before output is produced.
                                              -4-
                                                                        is raised makes a differ-
"equity" it borrows the difference. Note that the form in which capital
ence to the behavior of the firm. Equity entails no fixed obligation. Debt entails an obligation to

repay a certain amount the next period. For simplicity, we will assume all loans are for one

period only. If the firm is unable to repay the loan, it goes into bankruptcy. Since all production

beyond the level which the firm can finance out of its own net worth is financed by debt, as the

firm produces more, its probability of bankruptcy increases. The level of production balances

the gains in expected profits with the costs associated with the increased probability of ban-

kruptcy.

     In this theory, the balance sheet of the firm (its net worth) as well as the uncertainty faced

by the firm (whether, in principle, diversible on the market or not) make a difference for firm

behavior.

     We now present the details of the model.


The Model

      Firms, identified by an index I = 1,...,!, will be assumed to make decisions at discrete inter-

vals r = l,...,T. At the beginning of each period, a firm inherits both a nominal level of debt.

B,L1, and a "real" level of output, q_1, from the previous period. We will assume that there is

 a one-period lag between the use (and payment) of inputs and the availability of output. Thus.

 q_1 results from production decisions made at the beginning of period tâ€”l, but becomes avail-

 able for sale only at the beginning of period:. For simplicity, we will assume also that output is

 perishable and q_1 must all be sold at the beginning of period:. We will assume that the nomi-

 nal debt, B_1, was incurred at the beginning of period tâ€”1 in order to pay for the inputs that

 were required for producing q_1. Associated with this debt is a nominal connacmal rate of

 interest R/..1 determined at that time. Thus, nominal contractual repayments owed to
                                                        -5-

debtholders by finn i on entering period r are (1 + R_1 ) B'_1.

      At the beginning of period: competitive goods markets for the sale of q/_1 open and clear.

This determines the price P at which finn i sells its inherited output, q_1. The price P also

determines the nominal "equity" position6 of firm i at the beginning of period: since

              A Nominal Equity Position of firm i at the beginning of period t


                   EP:q:_1 â€”(1+R_1)B_1                                                                      (1)

The level of A' then determines the solvency of firm i. For some level of A sufficiently low (or

negative) firm I would presumably be declared bankrupt and reorganized with appropriately

negative consequences for the managers (or owners, if owner-managed) of the firm. For simpli-

city we will assume that A1' <0 implies bankruptcy, although a non-zero (either positive or nega-

tive) threshold could have been used without fundamentally altering the implications of the

model.7

      Simultaneously with the clearance of the several goods markets at the beginning of period

t, loan and labor markets dpen and clear. These markets determine w1, the real wage8 that firms

must offer workers, and r,, the expected real return required by lenders. The expected real

return, r1, then determines the terms on which loans will be made available to individual firms,

typically a schedule9 relating R to q and A for a given expected real return and expected rate

of inflation. Combined with expectations concerning future output prices and A, these factor

prices lead managers to select a level of output, q, which, once workers have been paid, leads to
  6 For the moment we will ignore both equity sales and dividends.
    It should, however, be noted that the comparative static properties of a bankruptcy threshold below zero are
both more complicated and less clearly determinate than those of a zero or positive threshold.
    Given the average price level determined by the individual P prices, real wage levels determine also an
equilibrium nominal wage.
     See below for detailed discussion on this point

a level of debt, B, and a contractual nominal return, Re', on that debt. Thus, this burst of simul-

taneous activity at the beginning of period t produces levels of q, B and R, that firm i inherits

at the beginning of period r+l, when the entire process is repeated.

 managerial penalty) to avoid bankruptcy.
   13 In a fully dynamic model, bankruptcy occurs only when the lender refuses to lend to the borrower (or the

 borrower refuses to borrow.) That is, even if the firm cannot pay back its loans out of current proceeds. it will not
 go bankrupt unless the lender refuses to lend it the amount owed.

Strictly speaking P +1' looking forward from the beginning of period t, is a random variable.

However, in order to simplify the expositions we will assume for the moment that there is rela-

tively little uncertainty about future price levels (as opposed to the relative sectoral prices

uÃ·j )15 and, thus, that

                    =           Expected price level at the beginning of period tÃ·l               (6)

Given equation (5), the expected real return to lenders to firm i in period r is

where P1 can now be substituted for P in the expression for Ã¼. The first expression on

the right-hand side of equation (7) represents the expected real return to lendersfrom those situa-

tions in which firm i is solvent in period t +1. The second expression then represents the

expected real return to lenders from situations in which firm I is insolvent in period : +1. For

 determining the appropriate contractual rate of return, R,', we next assumethat

a, and the parameters, w (wages), P/P,'+1                    (the   expected change in the price level) and r     (the


real interest rate).

       In deciding upon a level of output, we will assume that the objectives of a firm's managers

are described by the assumption that,

       [A5] firm's select q        in   order to maximize expected real profits (i.e. total sales minus

repayment to lenders) minus an expected real cost of bankruptcy, i.e.


                                          â€” (l+i) max                                       â€” c'F(Ã¼+i).           (10)

       Equation (10) is a simple way of capturing the hypothesis that firms act to avoid ban-

kruptcy. As we shall see, this bankruptcy avoidance behavior induces a kind of risk aversion:17

similar results obtain whether these bankruptcy costs are viewed as real (managerial) reorganiza-

tion costs associated with bankruptcy or if we view firms as maximizing the expected utility of

profits with the utility function characterized by a declining marginal utility of profits and

decreasing absolute     risk aversion. 18




  17
      Strictly speaking this is true only if c'F   is   appropriately convex in q. Later we will impose conditions which
will ensure that this is true.

     We assume further that

     [A6] Bankruptcy costs increase with the level of a firm's output:

                                                    c=Cq.                                                        (ii)

This assumption is made largely for analytic reasons; similar results hold for other bankruptcy

cost functions as long as expected bankruptcy
                                                         costs are convex in q. There are, however, three

economic justifications which suggest that [A61 represents a plausible simplification. First, as
                                                                           whose loss of position, income and
firms become larger they presumably involve more managers

power in the event of insolvency is likely to increase. Bankruptcy should, therefore, be a more

serious matter for General Motors than for a local grocery store. Since q is the only scale vari-

able in the model, having bankruptcy costs increase with q,1 is the only way to capture these scale

effects. Second, a significant role of managers is choosing a level of output (in the model this is

their only role). Bankruptcy with high levels of output should reflect unfavorably on their ability

 to do this. Since bankruptcy in the model is due to low prices, a high level of output in the face

 of these low prices may, retrospectively at least, imply unusually bad judgement by managers

 and may thus be unusually costly to their future prospects.19 Third, having bankruptcy costs

 depend on q' is necessary in order to ensure that the possibility of bankruptcy is never ignored.

 If there were a fixed cost of bankruptcy independent of the level of output, then profits, which

 are increasing in output, may grow so large relative to bankruptcy costs that bankruptcy becomes

 a negligible consideration.20 Since the purpose of this paperis to investigate the economic impli-

 cations of conditions in which managers (or owners) are penalized for bad outcomes and are


                                                                                       '
       This seems also likely to be uue when firms suffer from degrees of financial distress short of bankruptcy.
        In any case, we must assume that there is an upper limit on output (or that increases sufficiently rapidly)
  and the bankruptcy costs co-efficient C is sufficientLy large that a maximum for the objective function
  These technical assumptions are discussed in Appendix I.
                                                                                                          in [A5) exists.

affected by the possibility of these penalties, assumption [A6] is a convenient way of ensuring

that these conditions are met. Moreover with the addition of fixed bankruptcy costs there are

reasonable circumstances under which the fundamental implications of the model with [A5] con-

tinue to hold (see Appendix I).21

     Given [A2] and (A4], the objective function of [A5] can be written as


                              max [q;â€” (1+r,) (w4(q,')â€”a,) â€”cIF(Ã¼+i)]                                          (12)


Under these assumptions, a firm's real output is, therefore, determined by real wages,                          real

interest rates, real equity holdings, and relative price uncertainty. The first order condition22 for

an interior maximum can now be written as

                                              1 â€”(1+r,)w,$'=p                                                   (13)



where p      is the marginal bankruptcy risk of firm i in period t, i.e.


                                             â€” F+cf(u,Ã·i)
                                              dc,'                    d.1     .                                 (14)
                                              dq                       dq

      If p   were zero, equation (13) would be the standard result that output should be increased to

the point where the marginal product (1I) equals the wage, taking into account the fact that the

wage is paid the period before the output is received (and hence in present value terms, viewed

at the time of production, wage costs are w, (1+r)). Since p is positive, the impact of ban-

kruptcy risks is to restrict output; these risks drive a wedge between expected prices (i.e. 1) and

marginal costs in the traditional sense (i.e. (1+r )w,        ').
  21 The implied restriction in [A5) to a single period horizon is a matter of exposiuonal convenience. The multi-
period maximization problem is examined in Appendix I.
     There are several restrictions that have to be imposed to ensure that the second order conditions are satisfied.
These are discussed in Appendix I.

The Determinants of Marginal Bankruptcy Risk and Individual Firm Supply

     The marginal bankruptcy risk, p,, depends, of course, on the level of output. In addition, it

is a function both of the level of "equity" of the firm as well as the subjective probability distri-

bution of the random variable Ã¼ Ã·. We can thus represent the supply function of a firm by an

equation of the form

                                          q = g (w,, r:, a; v),

where v represents a measure of the riskiness of the distribution F. It is easy to verify that

             g., <0: real wage increases depress supply;
             g,' <0: real interest rate increases depress supply

Our main concern, however, is with the effect of equity levels and uncertainty (risk) on produc-

tion. It is possible to verify


Proposition 1. The higher the level of equity, the lower the marginal bankruptcy cost (risk per-

mium) p,, and hence the higher the level of production.


Proposition 2. Increases in the degree of uncertainty result in an increase in the marginal ban-

kruptcy costs (risk premium) and hence in a lower level of investment.23

     Under the assumption that $ is linear, up to a capacity constraint, we can show that invest-

ment, as a function of the equity level a:. appears as in Figure 1. For the range within which the

constant returns assumption holds, the elasticity of supply with respect to firm equity is unity.24

      Accordingly,

      The precise meaning of increases in uncertainty and the circumstances under which Proposition 2 is valid are
discussed in Appendix L
   24 More generally, with diminishing retwns, the elasticity of supply is less than or equal to unity.
                                                       -13-

Proposition 3. A: least near the capacity level, outpiu is a concave function of equity levels.

      These three propositions are the heart of the firm level analysis: they imply that, if for

some reason, a finn's equity is reduced (e.g. because the prices at which the firm is able to sell

its goods are lower than anticipated) then, in subsequent periods, the firm's output will be

reduced.

      Moreover, our analysis suggests that for highly levered economies the output multipliers

associated with equity injections may be substantial. For example if in equilibrium, equity

represents one third of total capital (which in this circulating capital world is slightly less than

output), then with constant returns to scale a $1 increase in equity will yield $3 of increased out-

put. Note that there are a variety of ways that such equity injections may occur, unanticipated

increases in the rate of inflation (monetary policy) as well as certain pump priming activities can

result in substantial increases in the equity base of firms.

      Later, we shall show the not surprising result that losses in equity will not instantaneously

be restored, and thus the model has the immediate implication of persistence; a loss of equity at

time t results in lower output, not only at time:, but in subsequent periods as well.

      The fact that the investment function is concave means that redistributions of wealth within

the production sector may have deleterious consequences for production. Thus unanticipated

increases in prices (say of oil) may have negative effects, and, at the same time, unanticipated

decreases in prices of the same commodity may have negative effects. Propositions 2 and 3

together imply that increased uncertainty â€” both cx ante (anticipated) and cx post â€” depress

production. This will be true whether the uncertainty is due to concerns about real shocks

(changes in technology or preferences) or to concerns with the instabilities of macro-economic

policy.25
      Since these policies generally impt different sectors differentially, uncertainty about these policies leads to
uncertainty about relative prices.

     Aggregate Supply. An aggregate supply function can be derived straightforwardiy by
summing the supply functions of individual firms. For simplicity, we shall assume that all firms

have the same production functions () and face the same uncertainty (F). We can then write

aggregate output as

                                        q, =g(w,r,,a1'           ;v)

We can approximate the expression by taking a Taylor series expansion around the average level

of firm equity holdings (under our symmetry assumptions), giving us an aggregate supply func-

tion of the form

                                           q, =g(w,,r,a;v,a)

where a2 is the variance of firm equity levels. The comparative static properties of this aggre-

gale supply function will, in general, mirror those of a representative firm's output (with the

additional effect noted that an increase in the dispersion of equity ownership will generally

lower output).

      Since, in this model, output is restricted as a result of the failure in the market for sharing

 the risk of bankruptcy, it is plausible to think of higher output as implying an improvement in

 social welfare.26



 II. General Equilibrium and Productivity Growth

      In order to simplify the model as far as possible, we will deal for the moment only with a

 constant-returns-to-scale technoLogy in which


      Because increases in output are likely to have disiributicual effects, they may well not be Pareto
 imptovements.
                 We use the term "welfare enhancing" in a iather loose sense, i.e. that gainers could more than
 compensate losers.

where   n is an economy-wide productivity index. Then the supply function for an individual

since under those circumstances output is linear in firm equity and actual wage levels can be

converted to "effective" wage levels by dividing by the productivity index, n. Aggregate sup-

ply can then be written as

     Next continuing to make the model as simple as possible, we will assume that consumer

behavior can be described by the behavior of a single, infinitely-lived representative consumer.

Furthermore, we will assume that this representative consumer may borrow and lend freely at

the competitive real rate of interest, rj, and consequently faces a single lifetime budget con-

Finally, we will assume that the representative consumer has a utility function of the form


                                                      .' [r,j â€”v((                                                  (16)



where V >0 and v" >              0 and n enters       the utility function because          technological progress

increases the productivity of leisure as well as labor.

      Under these circumstances, equilibrium in the aggregate market for goods and ser.nces is

characterized by the conditions27

                                                                                                                     (17)

 must be 8.
      Note that this formula can be used to reconcile the seeming discrepancy between labor supply studies based on

situation in which s (w, ,n) can be written s (w, /        i.e. pmductivity improvement in leisure

real wages as a function of aggregate output of the form

which characterizes the dynamic behavior of the system.

     The model of learning which we have employed, though commonly used, has some suong

assumptions and properties. We have assumed in particular that learning is economy wide; there

are, in effect, one hundred percent spill-overs. Learning by doing, it has long been recognized,

gives rise to a kind of increasing returns or non-convexity, and increasing returns pose difficult

problems for equilibrium theory. The singular case inwhich this is not uuc (in the absence of

risk) is that where there are one hundred percent spill-overs.

     Also, while other forms of increasing returns pose problems for standard formulations (such

as those of Romer [1988] and Lucas [1988]) they present no difficulty for us, for two reasons.

First, risk- (or bankruptcy-) aversion implies that even with increasing returns to scale in produc-

tion, there can be more than one firm in the market in equilibrium. Secondly, our model can

easily be extended to incorporate monopolistic competition (or other forms of imperfect com-

petition).


                                                                                            -
Dynamic Behavior

     The dynamic behavior implied by equation (25) can be summarized in terms of Figure

which plots d,Ã·1(a,1 In,1) as a function of d(Ea, In,). At low "effective" equity levels (i.e.
low d,), demand for labor and wages will be low and profits correspondingly high. This will lead

to relative rapid equity accumulation from reinvested profits and relatively low levels of produc-

tivity growth (i.e. y near one). We will assume that there exists an d, low enough such that

J(d,) > d,. Then as d, rises, wages rise, profit margins fall and reinvested earnings per "effec-

       See Dasgupta and Stiglitz [1988] for an analysis of the imperfectly competitive equilibria whichresult when
spill-overs are even slightly less than one hundred percent.

uve" unit should fail. At the same time, the rate of prOdUCtivity growth increases and conse-

quendy y fails. For these reasons, I (d,) should at some point cross the 450 from above as shown

in Figure 2. The point of crossing where

                                                 d* =J(d*)

represents a steady-state equilibrium at which the "effective" equity level is constant. At each

such equilibrium (given a fixed "uncertainty" parameter v), the rate of learning-by-doing pro-

ductivity improvement is different and hence so is the growth rate of output. Thus, in conu-ast to

most growth models in which steady-states differ according to the level but not the growth rate

of output, different steady-states in this model are associated with different growth rates.

Decreasing returns to the capital accumulation process do not arise in this model as they do in

more conventional growth models.

      At the same time, cyclical disturbances in the model may have permanent effects both on

the level of output and, in some cases, on its growth rate.

      First, even with PÃ· =               in every period, deterministic cycles of multiple periodicity

may occur if the slope of the curve, I, is sufficiently highly negative when it crosses the forty-

 five degree line (see Figure 2). If these conditions are met the resulting "real" cycles bear at

 least a casual resemblance to the "wage-shock" models which have been discussed, at least

 informally, in the empirical literature.31 Prosperity in the form of rising output and firm equity

 levels leads to both rising wages, which reduces profits and internal funds flows. Thesein turn

   3Â° See Grandmont (1985] for a discussion of these cycles in a slightly different context.
      Theoretical models in which growth depends on profits, and profits depend on wages, have been formulated by
 Goodwin (1981] and Akerlof and SugLitz [19691.
      Kaldor, Marx, and Rosa Luxemberg all formulated models in which capital accumulation depended on profits.
 They seemed (implicitly) to have recognized the difference between funds that were inside thefinn and funds that
 were outside. But they had no theoretical model to motivate the distinction, and thus this line of investigation was
 dismissed, not because it had been proven empirically wrong, but because it was viewed to be simply too ad hoc.

ultimately reduce equity levels and output, which both restores profitability (as wages fall) caus-

ing the cycle to begin again.

      If I' is always greater than zero, then no such cycles are possible and convergence to the

steady-state is monotone. However, random price shocks, which lead to unexpected fluctuations

in the real value of debt obligations and hence in real equity level, will lead to output fluctua-

tions which persist over several periods. Consider, for example, an unexpectedly low level of

P+1 (i.e. Pi <P!+i). From equation (24), this will lead to an immediate and substantial drop

in equity levels away from the steady-state level, a*, (assuming that the economy started at a*)

with an associated drop in output. The economy will return to a* (and the associated "full-

employment" level output) only slowly as a result of successive positive increments to d. In

the intervening period output and learning-by-doing are reduced and hence the overall produc-

tivity level suffers a permanent set back. In this case, the growth rate eventually returns to its ori-

ginal steady-state level, but the loss in productivity improvement during the intervening period

of low output is never recovered. Thus, while the economy eventually returns to the steady

state, characterized by (a/n )*, the value of n at any date is different from what it would have

been in the absence of the disturbance. The stochastic process for the economy's output exhi-

bits, to use the fashionable term, a unit root.


Sources of Price Shocks

     There are innumerable possible ways to model the sources of these price shocks. The sim-

plest is to assume that output is sold on a large international market and international prices vary

in response to forces which are external to the economy in question. A more traditional source

of such "shocks" would be a monetary sector which determines the aggregate price level. From

this perspective, an unexpectedly low level of PÃ·1 might be associated with either an

macroeconomic shocks, whether monetary or fiscal, will have effects not only on average prices

but also on the relative prices upon which we focus in this paper.


Comparative Statics

     The model can easily be used to analyze the consequencesof a variety of changes in policy
                                                            in financial markets which assist in the
or in the environment. For example, structural changes
                                                                              â€” see Figure 2) may

increase not only the current level of output, but also the long term rate of growth of output.

 However, a detailed analysis of the steady-states of the model is most easily carried out in terms

 of a joint analysis of d (i.e. a/n) and j (i.e. q In).

      As a point of departure in doing this, we will continue to consider the case of constant

 returns to scale. Then from equation (20) above

                                                                                                 (28)
                                          f=g[qi(q),8,v]d.

 If this relationship is rewritten as

                                                                                                 (29)

                                                                              levels of relative price
 it can be described as an equity requirements equation. For any given

  uncertainty, v, and the discount factor, 3, equation (29) describes the level of equity necessary to

  support a level of production f,. The elasticity of this relationship is

                                                = 1 â€”d      .(1

since g,   <0, 4 >0 and d      > 0. This curve is plotted in Figure 3.

     Combining equations (24) and (26) yields a second steady-state relationship of the form


                                       d    'fl4(1â€”(1+6)w(4))                                               (30)


This can be thought of as a steady-state equity supply equation. It represents the steady-state

level of equity that would result from a steady-state output level tf (given a discount rate, 6). In

examining the slope of this relationship, there are three distinct effects of output changes on the

supply of equity. Along the equity supply curve,


                                   â€”
                                                    1           .-L- (l+6),                                  31

where e7 is the elasticity of the learning function with respect to output (which is negative since

y is defined as n I;Ã·i and the productivity index it grows more rapidly at higher levels of out-

put) and a, is the labor supply elasticity (which is positive since for our utility function there are

no income effects). The first term in this expression (i.e. 1) represents the direct contribution of

higher output to higher equity levels through higher profits (profit per unit of output is always

positive because bankruptcy risk holds output below the zero profit level). The second term,

a1! (lâ€”'y(1+6)), is a negative productivity growth effect; the higher the level of output the higher

 the rate of productivity growth and the harder it is to maintain existing levels of equity per effec-

 tive unit of labor (remember that d, = a I       )â€¢    The third term in equation (31) is a negative wage

 effect. Higher levels of output drive wages up which reduces profits and, hence, steady-state

 equity levels. Because these final two terms are negative,32 the elasticity of the equity supply
   32 The term   (1 â€”(1+8)t) which represents expected profits per unit of output is negative because bankruptcy
 risk implies that firms always produce at a point of positive expected profit. Also, in the relevant region of the
                                                             see Figure 2â€” and, thus, 1 -'((1+8) is greater than
 steady-slate equilibrium y(1+8) must be less than unity â€”
 zero.

curve is less than unity and may be negative. In fact, it is likely to be negatively sloped. With a

labor supply elasticity of 0.5 and interest adjusted labor costs (i.e. (l+)\l1) of 75 percent of out-

put, the final negative term in equation (31) is minus six, which significantly outweighs (by
itself) the initial positive term.

      A steady-state equilibrium occuis only where the equity demand function, equation (29),

intersects the equity supply function, equation (30). Only at this point is the steady-state level of

equity (per effective unit of labor) supplied by the corresponding steady-state level of output

(again per effective unit of labor) just equal to the steady-state level of equity necessary to sus-

tain that level of output (i.e. the equity demanded by that level of output). Analysis of the

steady-state equilibrium in terms of these two curves is useful because it helps to isolate the

consequences of various changes in the underlying parameters of the model (e.g. relative price

uncertainty).

      It is immediately clear that in the model with constant returns to scale there is a unique

steady-state equilibrium. The elasticity of the equity supply curve is less than one which is, in

turn, less than the elasticity of the equity demand curve. Thus, whenever the equity supply and

demand curves intersect, the supply cmve, being less steeply sloped, must cut the demand curve

from above and only one such intersection may exist.33

      An increase in the perceived uncertainty of future relative prices, v, will in general lead to a


     Modthcanons of the basic constant returns to scale model presented here may easily lead to multiple
equilibrium. For example, with a backward bending labor supply curved (ruled out by the simpleutility function of
equation (16), but certainly possible in practice) the equity supply curve may have an elasticity greater than one and
hence greater than that of the equity demand curve. Equivalently, with increasing returns to scale in production. the
equity required to support a given level of production might increase less than proportionately with output (since
input requirements would increase less than proportionately with output) and the equity demand curve would have
an elasticity of less than one. In both cases, multiple intersections of the equity supply and demand curves are
possible. Note also that in the increasing returns case, increasing returns in production would still lead to well
defined competitive firm output levels since bankruptcy risk would limit firm production levels.

reduction in the level of output and growth at each level of d.            If the increase in uncertainty is
permanent, then the drop in output and growth will be permanent. This is equivalent to an

upward shift in the equity requirements (demand) equation. Greater uncertainty requires that

finns have greater equity bases to support any given level of output. At the same time, the

equity supply equation is not affected. Hence (see Figure 3A), steady-state output always

declines, and as output declines so too do the rates of learning-by-doing and growth. A time

path of output (adjusted for productivity, i.e. f ) may also be inferred, if firm equity levels are

assumed to adjust only slowly to an initial uncertainty shock. In the "normal" case where the

equity supply curve slopes downward, an upward shift in the equity requirements curve leads to

a large initial drop in output which is then gradually (and partially) offset as firms accumulate

equity (see Figure 3A).

      A shift in the labor supply equation affects both the equity supply curve and the equity

requirements curve. An increase in the wage required to elicit any given labor supply will shift

the equity requirements curve up and the equity supply equation down. Thus, steady-state out-

put and growth are unambiguously reduced, while steady-state equity levels may either rise or

fall (see Figure 3B).


[IL Conclusion

      The model described above is one in which financial market imperfections create a situa-

tion where certain kinds of financial capital (in this case equity capital) act as an independent

input to the process of production and investment. Then, because this resource is generated

endogenously by the interaction of financial and real markets, output and rates of growth depend


      Steady-state equity Levels, d. may either increase or decrease depending upon whetherthe equity supply curve
 is downward or upward sloping respectively.

on these interactions. Such circumstances would explain among other phenomena:

   (1) Why high rates of anticipated inflation (usually associated with high rates of relative

         price variability) have typically been associated with deterioration in observed rates of

         productivity growth. This would be an example of the kind of uncertainty shock dis-

         cussed above.35

   (2) Why cyclical expansions are associated with increases in measured productivity. An

          unexpected expansion would lead to unexpectedly high price levels and an increase in

          firm equity (at the expense of debtholders). The increase in the level of "equity' input

          would then tend to increase the productivity of other inputs (hence, the widely observed

          Okun's Law phenomenon).36

   (3) Why firms tend to grow at proportional rates independent of their sizes (Gibrat's Law).

          Firm growth in the model is governed by equity accumulation whose proportional

          change depends on factors other than size. But if these factors are fixed, Gibrat's Law

          holds precisely.

    (4) Why there are no apparent decreasing returns to aggregate output growth. Japan has

          seemed to grow for decades, without the kind of diminishing returns that conventional

          Solow growth theory would have suggested should have set in. (For more empirical

          evidence on this, see Romer [19861).

      Unanticipated inflation affects the market directly: higher prices mean that firms pay back less in real dollars.
increasing real equity levels and output. Eventually, however, the economy returns to its old steady-state (although
at a higher than otherwise level of q and n, ).
   36 Our explanation is not inconsistent with models that attribute Okun's law to labor hoarding. Those models do
not explain why, if labor is a quasi-fixed factor and markets are competitive, firms do not produce more. We
provide an explanation, based not so much on firms' abilities to sell as on their willingness to produce. There is
another explanation, based on the hypothesis of imperfect competition, with the degree of monopoly increasing in a
recession. While we do not deny the possibility of imperfect competition (which can readily be incorporated in our
model) the explana explanations for the cyclical variability in the degree of monopoly seem to us unpersuasive. See
Hall [19881 and Stiglitz [1985].

     In our model, there are two factors offsetting the onset of diminishing returns. First, there

is the direct effect of learning by doing: the more production, the more the learning by doing.

Secondly, there is an indirect effect, as the increased productivity results in higher profitability

and equity accumulation which Ã¼anslates, in time, into increased output and productivity



     Finally, it should be noted that models in which productivity growth results from active

investments in R&D rather than passive learning-by-doing produce qualitatively similar results

to those described above. In these models, with risk averse firms (subject to decreasing absolute

risk aversion) and equity market constraints, the level of R&D investment is determined by the

level of firm equity which is determined, in turn, by the kind of dynamic process described

above.

                                                                                              (A-3)

Given (A-3), the decision problem of the representative firm can be rewritten


                             max [a(1+r)+q[l â€”(1+r)w _cF(11)])                                (A-4)


subject to (A-2) where h = (1+r )(w â€” (a /q)). The first order condition can thus be written as


                                                                                              (A-5)

                                                     q (1â€”F)

Equation (A-5) can be rewritten as

                                   q =ac(1+r)f/((1â€”F) (mâ€”cF)]                               (A-8)

where m      1 â€”   (1+r)w. The RHS of (A-8) is just a function of Ã¼, which, from (A-7), is just an

(increasing) function of q.


Solving for the Equilibrium Level of Output

     (a) We first show that, under a fairly weak condition to be given below, there exists a

bounded solution to q. To derive this condition, we first need to observe that as q increases

toward infinity, h tends toward (1+r)w and ii approaches a unique finite limit u, which solves

the equation
                                                                                 -


                                (1+r)w=(1â€”F(0))+fF(x).                                      (A-9


The last step in this argument follows from the facts that in any equilibrium with positive output

(1+r)w < 1 and that the right hand side of (A-9) increases continuously and monotonically to a

limit E (x) = 1 as iZ,, goes toward infinity. Thus, as q goes toward infinity, the probability   of


bankruptcy   F (iZ) approaches   a finite limit   F (Ã¼,) F0. In order that a maximum to the firm's

decision problem exist, it must then be the case that, at the equilibrium level of real wages and

interest rates,

                                        lâ€”(1+r)wâ€”cF0 <0.                                   (A-b)
                                                   - 30-


Otherwise the firm's objective function, (A-4), can be increased without bound. Thus, we will

assume that c is sufficiently large that (A-lO) holds and consequently that there is a finite

optimal level of output.

      (b) For a > 0, optimal output is positive (since a > 0 and 1 > (l+r )w imply positive
profits with no risk of bankruptcy for small positive q); while for a =0, optimal q =0 since,

under those circumstances, h = (1+r)w and F(iZ) = F0 for all q. Thus, if F is sufficiently

smooth, the firm's objective function is locally continuous and twice differentiable at the optimal

level of output.37


Second Order Condition

      With a constant-returns-to-scale technology, the second order condition takes the form


                                        C ,a2
                                        (lâ€”F)2q3             1F <0                                    (A-Il)


where f, is the first derivative of the density function f evaluated at the optimal bankruptcy

point At the optimal level of output, therefore,


                                                                                                      (A-12)


Note that since, in practice, bankruptcies appear to be relatively rare for moderate and large-

sized firms (i.e. they occur with probability less than one half in any decision period), firms

operate with bankruptcy levels in the lower tail of the price distribution; if that distribution is

single peaked, f' will be positive at relevant levels of output. This, in turn, means that (A- 12) is

 satisfied.


      We will ignore the possibility that two locally separate values of q produce the same opumal value of the
 firm's objective function.
                                                  - 31 -


        Note, too, that if the distribution F is characterized by an increasing hazard function (i.e.

ff1â€”F is monotonically increasing), then (A-il) is satisfied globally.


Graphical Solution and Comparative Statics

        With constant returns to scale, the marginal return to production, ignoring bankruptcy costs,

is fixed (at what we have called m), while the marginal bankruptcy cost, p, increases with q. At

any maximum, the p(q) curve cuts m from below; the discussion in the preceding paragraph

argued that normally there will be only one relevant intersection, and provided a global condi-

tion for a unique intersection (see figure 4).

        The simplicity of the structure of the first order conditions makes comparative statics

analysis relatively easy.

        First, note that since, from (A-2), ii, the bankruptcy relative price, is a function only of

a fq, p is a function only of a /q. Hence, an increase in a accompanied by an equiproportionate
increase in q leaves p unchanged: With constant returns, d tn q fd (it a = 1.

        Secondly, an increase in w reduces m (the marginal return from production, ignoring ban-

kruptcy costs), while from (A-2), at any q ,ii increases; so long as the second order condition is

satisfied, this implies that p. the marginal bankruptcy cost, is increased.38 Thus, as figure 4 illus-

trates, output is unambiguously reduced.

        Thirdly, an increase in r   reduces   m, while, from (A-2), at any q, ii increases; again, so
long as the second order condition is satisfied, this implies that p, the marginal bankruptcy costs,

 is increased, and output is reduced.


   38
        dp/dw = ef du/dw + (dp/dq)q2Ia where di/dw = (l+r)I1â€”F and (dp/dq) > 0 by the second
order condition.
                                                        - 32 -


      Finally, we examine the effect of an increase in uncertainty. This shifts the values off and

F corresponding to any set of values of the other parameters. Straightforward differentiation

shows that, at the optimum,

                                      d pIdF = c + (mâ€”cF)/(lâ€”F) >0.

At the same time

                                            d p/df = (rnâ€”cF )/f   >0.
      We focus our attention on the situation where bankruptcy probabilities (in any period) are

low. If an increase in uncertainty increases the likelihood of bad events (F andf both increase),

then p will increase, and output will be reduced. Even if F increases, but f decreases uncer-

tainty will increase p (reduce output) so long as the hazard rate is increased.39


The General Case

      The first and second order conditions for the general case (" < 0) as well as the compara-

tive static properties can easily be derived. We simply present the relevant formulae.

      (a) First order condition


                            1 â€” (1+r)w     '   = cF + qr (1+r) [a + w('q â€”
                                                        q(lâ€”F)

Note that ,'q â€” >0 since " >0 and (0) =0.

      (b) The second order condition for an interior maximum is,

                                               â€”(l+r)w4"13â€”ct0                            (A-13)
where


    Denote the change in the distribution by dy. Then we can write the total effect on p as
dp/dy = cdF/dy + (mâ€”cF)d tn (f /1â€”F}/dy. Hence, so long as the cumulative of the bad states is
increased and the hazard function is increased, p is increased.
                                                     - 33 -



                       1â€”F



                â€”    cq                     j2
                    (1â€”F)2 dq             lâ€”F

           dh       (1+r)w
                           [4)q â€”4)+a/w]
           d          q2

and the various distribution and density functions (i.e. F ,         f and f', the derivative of the density
function) are evaluated at U. A sufficient condition for this is that (A-12) holds.

     The comparative statics follow along similar lines to those presented before. If we define

m (q) as the marginal return to production, ignoring bankruptcy costs, now m (q) is a decreasing

function of q. Moreover, now, p is a function of w not only indirectly, through the effect of w

on U, but directly. Nonetheless, the basic qualitative properties remain.

     First, for a change in real equity,


                                   --=
                                   da
                                            q'
                                            a
                                                                         0                             (A-14)

where

                                                          1

                                                 1 + (w Ia )(4)'q â€”4))


With decreasing returns (a /q )(dq Ida) < I and proportional increases in equity lead to less than

proportional increases in output. In particular, note that if marginal labor requirements increase

greatly beyond some point, 4)'q â€”4) becomes large and hence becomes small. Moreover q Ã­a is

becoming smaller and smaller. Hence, dq Ida eventually becomes quite smalI.


     On the other hand, one cannot ensure that q is everywhere a concave function of a. The second derivative of
q with respect to a involves, among other things, terms in 4)", about which we have so far made no assumptions.

     For changes in wages,

where


                                       â€”

                                         a            a+w(4)'qâ€”$)


If4)"=O, then (w/q)(dq/dw)             since w4, > a. On the other hand, if marginal costs increase

very rapidly as a firm approaches its "capacity" limit (i.e. 4)" >> 4)'/q, 4)'q   >> 4)),   then near "capa-

city" (w/q)(dq/dw) > â€”1.

     For changes in real interest rates,


                            dq          q       czr+(i+r)w(4)'Iq)3 O                                 (A-16)
                            dr         i+r        a+(1+r)w4)"13
where




                                                                                            -
Thus (w Iq )(dq Idw) ((1+r )Iq )(dq Idr) and wages have a greater proportional negative impact

on real output than interest rates.

     The analysis of the effects of changes in uncertainty parallels that of our earlier discussion.

Inspection of the first order condition shows that so long as the uncertainty increases the cumula-

tive probability of bad states (F) and the hazard rate f/iâ€”F, the marginal bankruptcy cost is

increased and output is reduced.


More General Bankruptcy Cost Functions

      An obvious extension of the form of bankruptcy costs is to add a fixed component to the
                                               - 35 -


bankruptcy cost function so that it becomes

                                          C(q)=c0+c1q                                       (A-17)

The comparative static results become, in general, more ambiguous. However, there are reason-

able circumstances in which those results continue to hold.

     For the case of constant-returns-to-scale in production, as above, a necessary condition for

the existence of an optimal level of output is that

                                      I â€” (l+r)w   â€” c 1F0 <0                               (A- 18)


We will assume that (A-18) holds (and in particular that c1 > 0). With the now modified ban-

kruptcy cost function, the second order condition takes the form

                                              2c0f
                                                              <0                            (A-19)
                                            q(1â€”F)


where a and dh/dq are defined above with C(q) in its present form substituted for cq.         Since


the second term in (A-19) is positive, condition (A-12), while necessary for (A-15) to hold, is no

longer sufficient (N.B. withCRTS, the second order condition for the decision problem of the

body of the paper is â€”a. < 0).

     For an interior maximum at which (A-19) holds the impact of a change in the firm's equity

level is described by the equation

                                     dq
                                     da
                                              qa aL
                                                 a-2.i
                                                              >0                             (A-20)


where p. (c0f /q )(dii/dh )(dh Idq) and, since the second order condition requires that

a â€” 2p. > 0, a â€” i> 0.   Thus, with constant-returns-to-scale, adding a fixed bankruptcy penalty

does not alter the direction of a firm's response to an increase in equity (it remains positive), but
                                                - 36 -


it does intensify the magnitude of the firm's response (since (a â€” ji)1(a â€” 21.t)> 1). Similar
results hold for output responses to changes in real wages, real interest rates and the price distri-

bution F. Therefore, to the extent that constant returns to scale characterize a finn's production

technology â€” either because we are studying scale decisions or because we are concerned with

levels of output below capacity over which marginal costs are roughly constant -- inclusion of a

fixed bankruptcy cost does not fundamentally alter the implications of the model.


More General Utility Functions

     A final obvious extension of the basic model is to settings in which firms' managers max-

imize over a horizon which is longer than a single decision period. For analytical purposes, this

involves considering an objective function of the form


                        maxjqt                                                                 (A-21)
                         q,                                                  J


subject to (A-2), where E is a mathematical expectation, a,+t is the firm's equity level entering

period t+l and V is a valuation function of the usual sort. Formally,

                                  a,41 =fl,1q, â€” (l+?Ã·1)(w,(,â€”(2,)

where 1 +   , is the random real return to lenders.4' Thus, (A-21) can be rewritten as
                                 max E[at+t +
                                                V(a+i)]
                                                          â€”
                                                              cq,   F(Ã¼).                      (A-22)


subject to (A-2) with appropriate t subscripts on the variables.

     In examining this decision problem, the case of constant returns to scale is again the easiest

starting point. With CRTS,
     This ignores dividends. However, including them would complicate the analysis without altering its
implications fundamemtally.

which means that h*1, i'   and F (Ã¼) are independent of a1. Thus, cq*1 F (i?') is linear in a1
and the valuation function for the multiperiod decision problem is linear in a1. With constant

returns to scale, therefore, the multiperiod decision problem is qualitatively identical to a single

period problem and the extension to multipeziod decision-making is straightforward, involving

nothing more than a rescaling of the bankruptcy cost factor c.

     Unfortunately the same simplicity does not apply to the general case and here only the most

general principals can be articulated. The flavor of these is captured best by abandoning the

specific formulation of "bankruptcy" constraints since these no longer yield unambiguous results

and simply assuming that managers choose output to

                                           max E[V(a,Ã·1)]

straightforward to show that (1) risk aversion leads to a reduction in output below what a risk

neutral firm would produce and (2), if V exhibits decreasing absolute risk aversion, then greater

firm equity levels lead to greater output. Thus, if a multiperiod decision problem generates a

valuation function characterized by decreasing absolute risk aversion, then in general we should

expect the results of the model (with respect to equity levels and output) to apply without

change.
