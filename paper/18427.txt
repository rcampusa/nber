                                              ABSTRACT

This paper examines the effects of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation’s (RFC) loan and preferred
stock programs on bank failure rates in Michigan during the period 1932-1934, which includes the
important Michigan banking crisis of early 1933 and its aftermath. Using a new database on Michigan
banks, we employ probit and survival duration analysis to examine the effectiveness of the RFC’s
loan program (the policy tool employed before March 1933) and the RFC’s preferred stock purchases
(the policy tool employed after March 1933) on bank failure rates.

Our estimates treat the receipt of RFC assistance as an endogenous variable. We are able to identify
apparently valid and powerful instruments (predictors of RFC assistance that are not directly related
to failure risk) for analyzing the effects of RFC assistance on bank survival. We find that the loan program
had no statistically significant effect on the failure rates of banks during the crisis; point estimates
are sometimes positive, sometimes negative, and never estimated precisely. This finding is consistent
with the view that the effectiveness of debt assistance was undermined by some combination of increasing
the indebtedness of financial institutions and subordinating bank depositors. We find that RFC’s purchases
of preferred stock – which did not increase indebtedness or subordinate depositors – increased the
chances that a bank would survive the financial crisis.

We also perform a parallel analysis of the effects of RFC preferred stock assistance on the loan supply
of surviving banks. We find that RFC assistance not only contributed to loan supply by reducing failure
risk; conditional on bank survival, RFC assistance is associated with significantly higher lending by
recipient banks from 1931 to 1935.

I. Introduction: RFC Assistance to Banks During the Depression

       This paper examines the effects of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation’s

(RFC) loan and preferred stock programs on bank failure rates of Michigan banks during

the period 1932-1934, which includes the important Michigan banking crisis of early

1933. Using a new database collected from primary sources, we employ probit and

survival duration models to examine the effectiveness of the government’s loan program

and preferred stock purchases on bank survival and failure rates, and on loan growth of

surviving banks. We study Michigan banks because the failure to stem Michigan’s

statewide banking crisis has been viewed by some historians of the Depression as a

critical precipitator of the national financial crisis of 1933 (Kennedy 1973).      The

prevalence of bank failures in Michigan during the period 1932-1934 provides a rich data

set to examine the determinants of failure, and the potential salutary effects of

government assistance.

       The Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) was a government-sponsored

enterprise founded to stem bank failures and reduce the economic costs of financial

disintermediation. The RFC was originally established to lend funds to troubled firms.

However, beginning in March 1933, the Corporation shifted from lending to banks to

directly recapitalized banks by purchasing their preferred stock. The program disbursed

approximately $200 billion in current U.S. dollars (Lohr 2008). When the RFC ceased

operations in the early 1950s, the government-sponsored entity sold its preferred stock

and recovered the funds provided by taxpayers.
                                                                                                             4


         Herbert Hoover established the RFC on February 2, 1932.1                           The RFC was

originally established to stimulate the economy by increasing liquidity in the financial

system by loaning funds to troubled financial institutions. The RFC was an agency of the

executive branch of the federal government that had the ability to increase its lending

capacity and oversight powers by executive order. Its operations did not depend on

Congressional approval (Mason 2003).

         During the Great Depression, the RFC conducted four major aid programs: a loan

program for financial institutions, a preferred stock program for financial institutions, a

railroad loan program, and a commercial and industrial loan program.2 The loan program

for financial institutions was the first program initiated by the RFC, and it was largely

replaced by a preferred stock program; there were few RFC loans made to banks after

March 1933, with the exception of loans made to assist the liquidation of failed banks.

         While the RFC’s charter permitted the Corporation to make loans with maturities

of up to three years, most loans had maturities of less than six months. The threat of non-

renewal was perceived as giving the RFC necessary influence over bank management

practices. The RFC also demanded high-quality and liquid collateral for its loans, charged

an interest rate higher than the rates charged on Federal Reserve loans, and required

recipient banks to limit the salary of employees for the life of the loan.
1
  This history of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation is based on Mason (2001b).
2
  The RFC’s railroad loan program, like its bank loan program, was part of the original RFC Act.
However, unlike its loans to banks, the RFC’s railroad loans did not need to be fully secured. The RFC
also lent to railroads at below market rates. As a result of these lax lending polices, the RFC’s railroad loan
program was abused, and funds were used for the benefit of railroad company insiders (Mason 2001b).
          The commercial and industrial loan program was the final economic stimulation program
undertaken by the RFC during the Great Depression. Because the banks had ceased lending, the RFC made
loans directly to businesses. The RFC encouraged banks to purchase the right to participate in commercial
and industrial loans instead of originating the loans themselves in order to stimulate private sector lending.
          However, during the Great Depression, consumers were not increasing their demand for goods or
services. As a result, no businesses needed to invest in additional capacity. The commercial and industrial
loan program therefore had little impact on the economy.
                                                                                        5


       The short duration, strict collateralization rules, and high interest of RFC loans

may have protected the RFC from loss, but it also may have limited the effectiveness of

RFC lending. Banks that received such assistance became more indebted as a

consequence of it, and were not given much additional time to restore market confidence

in their solvency. Because the RFC demanded high-quality collateral, the RFC’s loans

also effectively stripped banks of their best assets, thereby effectively subordinating

depositors – who retained general claims on the remaining assets of the bank, an asset

pool of lower quality than RFC collateral. Increased leverage, short maturity, and the

subordination of depositors increased the riskiness of recipient banks’ deposits, and may

have encouraged depositor runs, as many critics of the RFC lending program contended

(Olson 1977, Mason 2001a). The strict terms of RFC lending and the control the RFC

exercised over bank management also allegedly discouraged financial institutions from

using the RFC’s loan program. According to Olson (1972), the RFC’s loan conditions

were generally perceived as bringing “more problems than solutions.” In Olson’s (1972,

p. 177) view, RFC loans “helped only those basically sound enterprises that needed

temporary liquidity.”         James (1938) corroborates this view: “High collateral

requirements forced [banks] to isolate their most liquid assets as security for RFC loans.

In April 1932, for example, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation loaned the Reno

National Bank over $1,100,000, but in the process took as collateral over $3,000,000 of

the bank’s best securities.    This in itself left the bank unable to meet any future

emergency demands for funds by depositors.” The only econometric analysis of the loan

program’s effectiveness, based on the failure experience of banks in the Chicago Federal
                                                                                            6


Reserve District, suggests that the decision to borrow from the RFC did not prevent bank

failures, and may have contributed to the risk of failure (Mason 2001a).

           To correct the perceived flaws of the loan program, the RFC moved from a policy

designed primarily to increase short-term liquidity to one that reduced the default risk of

deposits by increasing the capital of assisted banks. On March 9, 1933, Congress passed

the Emergency Banking Relief Act, altering the original mandate of the RFC to permit

the government-sponsored entity to purchase preferred stock in financial institutions.3

RFC assistance was not available to all banks; only to those that were deemed sufficiently

likely to survive as the result of receiving the assistance. Statistical analysis by Mason

(2001a) of Chicago Fed District recipients indicates that the banks that issued preferred

stock to the RFC were of middling risk compared to other banks at the time they received

assistance.

           RFC preferred stock was junior to deposits and other debts, but senior to common

stock upon liquidation of a bank. After the issuance of the RFC’s preferred stock,

common stock dividends were strictly limited, and the RFC undertook additional

measures to ensure that banks accumulated additional capital and did not abuse

government protection (Upham and Lamke 1934, Cho 1953).                 RFC preferred stock

carried voting rights that gave it the power to institute changes that would increase the

solvency and profitability of a bank. The bank’s earnings were placed in a retirement

fund that would be used to buy back the RFC’s preferred stock.

           The RFC’s rules and control rights over financial institutions that participated in

the preferred stock program seem to have discouraged some banks from participating.

Furthermore, banks also expressed concern that participating in the aid program would

make them seem weak, causing depositors and shareholders to lose confidence and

withdraw their funds from banks. As a result, widespread participation in the preferred

stock program occurred only when the FDIC began backing some of the deposits in

solvent banks in 1934. For large banks, FDIC insurance limits meant that only a small

proportion of their deposits were insured, but for small banks in rural areas, FDIC

coverage insured a much larger proportion of deposits.

        Insurance coverage was offered only after many insolvent banks were closed in

1933, leaving the remaining banks to be insured by the FDIC and assisted by the RFC.4

Deeply insolvent banks were closed; marginal banks were assisted and insured, and

clearly solvent banks were insured without assistance.

        Managers of relatively strong and weak banks alike sold preferred stock to the

RFC, purportedly to protect the identities of the institutions that were too weak to join the

FDIC without additional investment. As a result, the RFC eventually owned more than

one-third of the capital of American banks (Mason 2001b). Econometric analysis of

Chicago Fed District banks suggests that recapitalizing the banks with preferred stock

helped to stabilize the banking sector, although the program did not increase lending by

those banks (Mason 2001a).

        The ambitious programs and immense resources of the RFC subjected the agency

to political pressure and public scrutiny. State and federal politicians, recognizing the

benefits of RFC aid, often pressured the government-sponsored enterprise to grant


4
  According to Jesse Jones, the chairman of the RFC, more than 5,000 banks which had previously claimed
to be solvent “required considerable added capital to make them [sufficiently] sound” to join the FDIC
(Jones and Pforzheimer, 1951, p. 27). Jones personally appealed to the managers of all banks to join the
RFC’s stock program “so that depositors would not be induced to switch out of …banks when their names
were published” (p. 26-27). Thanks to the preferred stock program, the weaker banks were adequately
recapitalized and all but 141 of approximately 14,500 American banks joined the FDIC in 1934 (Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation).

assistance to their constituents.           Concerns about RFC accountability ultimately led

Congress to require the publication of the names of its aid beneficiaries.

         Econometric analysis of the identities and characteristics of the recipients of aid

distributed by the RFC have not been able to identify evidence that the Corporation was

not swayed by political influence in its lending policies, where political influence is

defined as systematic biases related to political partisanship, Congressional committees

and the like (Mason 2003).5 The potential for the manipulation of the RFC by Congress

or the Administration was mitigated by three main factors. First, the loans made by the

RFC to financial institutions had to be fully and adequately secured.6 This restriction was

also incorporated into the RFC’s credit and capital programs, which ensured that aid

recipients were good candidates for recovery.                  Second, the RFC was funded as a

government-owned corporation with an initial appropriation from Congress and capital

subsidies from the Treasury. The managers of the RFC relied upon this capital base rather

than regular Congressional appropriations, which freed the RFC’s managers from having

to concern themselves about ongoing political pressure from Congress. Finally, RFC aid

decisions were made at the regional level; each region’s field office was largely

independent from the others and appears to have been largely immune to political

influences from Washington. Field offices were given a large degree of autonomy over

assistance decisions, but also were held accountable to the central office if their decisions

adversely affected RFC earnings (Delaney 1954).

5
  This study does not test for the personal influence of particular bankers on the allocation of RFC funding.
Not surprisingly, given the extent of RFC lending, some of the banks that received RFC assistance were
associated with politically influential individuals, who were also connected to the RFC, including Jesse
Jones and Charles Dawes. Whether the likelihood of assistance was affected by such personal connections
remains unexplored empirically. Doing so would require the mapping of the personal and business
connections of bank officers and board members, which is beyond the scope of this paper.
6
  The RFC did not specify the level of collateral that was necessary and only its staff could evaluate
whether a bank had sufficient assets to secure a loan (Mason 2001b).
                                                                                        9


       Mason (2001a) and Calomiris and Mason (2004) conduct in-depth analyses of the

operations of the RFC in the Chicago Federal Reserve District, distinguishing between

the effects of RFC loans and preferred stock purchases on Chicago Federal Reserve

member banks. The analysis suggests that as the RFC assumed greater default risk, its

aid programs more successfully limited bank failures. RFC loans did not lower bank

failure rates. RFC loans, like Fed discounting, was designed to deal with illiquidity

problems, not shocks that threatened bank solvency. In contrast, the preferred stock

program helped prevent banks from failing because they channeled resources to banks

(subsidized injections of capital) that reduced insolvency risk. Mason suggests that

marginally solvent banks receiving preferred stock assistance could operate more

efficiently and regain strength as a result of government infusions of capital stock.

       While these findings are important and suggestive, it is not clear whether they

apply to other regions of the country, which suffered different histories of bank distress

during the Great Depression. Chicago’s deepest moment of crisis was its panic of June

1932, long before the nationwide panic that gripped the banking system in March of 1933

(Calomiris and Mason 1997, 2003a). In this study, we examine whether similar

consequences of RFC assistance can be discerned for Michigan banks. The timing and

extent of Michigan banking distress perhaps most closely tracked the sudden and

widespread panic that gripped the U.S. in early 1933, and therefore, provides an

important further test of the effectiveness of RFC preferred stock assistance in reducing

the costs of banking distress in 1933 and its aftermath.

II. Michigan Banks and the Nationwide Panic of 1933

        The Great Depression saw the worst waves of banking distress that had gripped

the country since the late 1830s. Calomiris and Mason (2003a) review the history, and

causal influences, relating to the waves of failures that occurred from 1930 to 1933. From

November 1932 to February 1933, banking distress accelerated, and systemwide banking

crises gripped Nevada, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, Tennessee, Ohio, Arkansas,

Alabama, Missouri, Maryland, Louisiana, and Michigan. Calomiris and Mason (2003a)

show that the nationwide panic of early 1933 differed from prior waves of bank failure;7

unlike prior episodes of distress, the probability of failure rose dramatically in early 1933,

not only for banks with weak fundamentals, but for all banks.

        The banking crisis in Michigan in February 1933 was of particular importance;

indeed, Kennedy (1973) describes the Michigan banking crisis as a “prelude to the

national banking disaster three weeks thereafter.” The turmoil experienced in Michigan,

the home of the American automobile industry, also highlights the devastating effects of

banking crises on the national economy.

        In Detroit, significant amounts of money began to flow out of the largest banks

with the onset of the Great Depression (Awalt 1969). The Detroit Bankers Company

Group and the Union Guardian Group, the two major local bank holding companies, were

under additional pressure because of their banks’ heavy investment in local real estate

(New York Times 1933a).8           Between 1930 and February 1933, approximately $250

  The Detroit Banks Company Group held the First National Bank of Detroit, Peoples’ Wayne County
Bank, Detroit Trust Company, eight suburban banks, and a local investment company, the First Detroit
Company. The Union Guardian Group, also called the Ford Group, held the National Bank of Commerce,
                                                                                                           11


million was withdrawn from the First National Bank of Detroit; its local competitors, the

Union Guardian Trust Company and the Guardian National Bank of Detroit, also

sustained massive withdrawals. By January 1933, these banks were losing between $2.5

million and $3 million in deposits each week (Awalt 1969).

         These banks not only were large Detroit banks, they were at the center of the

largest two banking groups in Michigan. In Michigan, two holding companies – the

Guardian Detroit Union Group, and First National People's Wayne Group – controlled 56

banks (35 and 21, respectively), including the First National Bank of Detroit, Union

Guardian Trust Company, and Guardian National Bank of Detroit. As of December 1929,

the two banking groups accounted for $1.1 billion of the $1.2 billion in loans and

investments that were housed within group and chain banks in Michigan.9 In 1929,

Michigan banks affiliated with groups or chains represented 15.9 percent of all Michigan

banks, and 54.4 percent of the loans and investments of Michigan banks.10 The problems

of the Detroit banks, therefore, had broader potential ramifications elsewhere in

Michigan.11




Guardian Union Trust Company, and other local banks (Awalt 1969, 350). First National Bank had book
assets of $485,846,627 and 146 branch offices outside of its main office in Detroit at the time of the crisis;
the Guardian Union Group held book assets of $432,797,434, nine bank components in Detroit and 11 bank
branches in other Michigan cities (New York Times 1933b).
9
  Group and chain banks were banks controlled by a centralized governance system, either related to a bank
holding company, a main bank, or individual stock holders. US House of Representatives (1930) identifies
the number and size of groups and chains in the United States as of December 1929, but it does not list the
banks that belonged to chains or groups.

   Federal Reserve Board (1943), p. 312.
11
   In our empirical work we considered trying to take account of a bank’s position in a group or chain,
either as a leader of a group or chain, or as a member of one, to see whether leadership of a chain or
membership in one might have affected the probability of receiving RFC assistance, or the probability of
failure. The only important group or chain leaders, however, were the banks in Detroit that were
reorganized in early 1933, and therefore, are not part of our sample. Furthermore, we could not locate a
reliable source for identifying members of groups or chains. Bank encyclopedias (like Polks) do sometimes
refer to group and chain connections, but it is not clear whether this is done consistently.
                                                                                                       12


        To meet the demands of its depositors, the Guardian Trust Company requested

additional funds from the RFC. Henry Ford had already attempted to bolster the bank’s

liquidity with a $7 million deposit. With deposits of approximately $32.5 million in the

Guardian Banks and an additional $18 million in the Detroit Bankers’ group, Ford had a

strong personal incentive to assist the local financial institutions (Awalt 1969). However,

Ford’s infusion of cash was not enough to sustain the Guardian Trust Company, and the

bank requested an additional $60 million from the RFC, which was already lending to a

number of local banks (New York Times 1933a; New York Times 1933c).

        As the RFC considered the application of the Guardian Trust Company, Michigan

Senator James Couzens realized that the bank lacked sufficient collateral to justify a

standard loan (New York Times 1933a).12 Couzens asked Henry Ford to grant the

government a lien on his $7 million deposit, subordinating his claim to that of the RFC.

Ford rejected this plan and an alternative plan that would have required him to sign a

personal note for the difference between the bank’s collateral and the amount to be

loaned by the RFC. Contemporary sources indicate that the Ford family and company

had already advanced local banks $12 million and considered further efforts to save the

banks futile (Awalt 1969). Angered by the increasing pressure from government officials

to personally recapitalize the struggling banks, Ford threatened to withdraw $25 million

from the system at the first opportunity. Because it was feared that such a withdrawal

would cause a panic and threaten the survival of the local banks, Francis Awalt, acting




12
  Couzens and Ford were former business partners in the Ford Motor Company. Couzens was also the
chairman of the Senate committee responsible for investigating the RFC’s loans, so his concerns about the
need for proper collateralization were sufficient cause to block the Union Guardian Trust Company’s aid
package (New York Times 1933a).
                                                                                       13


Comptroller of the Currency at the US Treasury, felt compelled to prevent the national

banks of Detroit from opening (Awalt 1969).

       While Awalt recognized the need to keep all Michigan banks closed, his authority

was limited to national banks. Thus, federal officials conferred with Michigan Governor

William A. Comstock, who declared a statewide bank holiday on February 14, 1933. The

holiday was originally intended to last eight days (Awalt 1969). However, the complex

problems plaguing the financial system prompted officials to extend the holiday until

March 6 (Awalt 1969).

       On February 18, soon after the Michigan bank holiday was declared, news

circulated of a potential merger of the Guardian Trust Company and the Central Hanover

Bank and Trust Company of New York. Supposedly, “local pride” motivated Detroit

bankers to reject the assistance of the New York banks, and local rivalries supposedly

prevented the mergers of Detroit banks (New York Times 1933d).

       On February 24, Henry Ford and his son Edsel, a Chairman of the Union

Guardian Trust Company, offered to provide capital for two new banks to help liquidate

the assets of the distressed banks. The aid of the Ford family was offered on the

condition that they could select the new bank directors and officers (Awalt 1969).

Initially, it seemed that the Ford offer, accompanied by an additional $20 million from

New York bankers and an RFC pledge of $54 million, would allow depositors to access

at least 35 percent of their deposits immediately (Los Angeles Times 1933). However, the

New York bankers withdrew their offer of assistance because of concerns that they might

not have clear legal claim to the failing banks’ assets. The Ford family then withdrew its

contribution, and the bailout plan failed (New York Times 1933e). The failure of the
                                                                                                             14


bailout plan helped to precipitate a panic across Michigan, which contributed to the panic

gripping the rest of the country (Mason 2003, Butkiewicz 1995).

           The effects of the financial crisis were felt acutely in the real economy during the

weeks between the initial crisis in Detroit and President Roosevelt’s inauguration.

Detroit was threatened with a milk shortage and grocers were unable to sell food since

they could not cash checks (New York Times 1933f; New York Times 1933g). Twenty-

eight thousand local families supported by the Detroit Public Welfare Department were

unable to use their aid checks from the city’s accounts with the Guardian Group and First

National; Wayne County, Michigan was unable to support 10,000 ill and insane patients

because its deposits in the bank groups were unavailable (New York Times 1933g). In

late February, the Detroit Clearing House Association considered issuing scrip 13 to

provide a medium of exchange during the banking emergency (New York Times 1933g).

           The situation in Michigan and the concurrent exposure of allegedly disreputable

business practices among New York bankers exacerbated financial instability across the

country. The instability of the Detroit banking system worried officials in Washington,

as the public withdrew deposits from banks nationwide. Over 5,500 banks with deposits

totaling $3.4 billion had temporarily closed by March 3. New York banks lost $200

million in gold and $150 million in currency; Chicago also lost $100 million in gold the

same day (Awalt 1969). The Federal Reserve banks admitted “they could not support

member banks indefinitely, especially those drained by the troubles in Michigan,

Maryland, and Ohio” (Kennedy 1973).                      However, outgoing President Hoover was

unwilling to declare a national bank holiday, so comptroller Awalt and other government

officials pressured the governors of several states to declare state banking holidays and

institute banking restrictions. On March 6, the first business day following President

Roosevelt’s inauguration, he declared a national bank holiday to try to stem the panic.

         On March 9, Congress passed the Emergency Banking Relief Act drafted by

Roosevelt and his advisors. The Act granted the federal government power over the

banking system.14 Under this act, the RFC would directly capitalize banks by purchasing

preferred stock.

         The Emergency Banking Act of 1933 is widely regarded as having helped to

resolve the banking crisis. During the national holiday, government officials confirmed

the solvency of national banks, which were gradually reopened to their depositors

beginning March 13 (although many banks would remain suspended for a much longer

time, and some banks never were able to reopen their doors).15 Roosevelt’s innovative

banking plan and first “fireside chat” soothed depositors to such an extent that when

banks reopened, deposits actually exceeded withdrawals. Five thousand three hundred

eighty-seven of the Federal Reserve’s 6,694 member banks reopened by the end of

March; 7,654 of 11,455 state institutions also reopened during that time. By June, 91

percent of deposits in Federal Reserve member banks were available to the public.

Confidence in the banking system encouraged stock market values to increase; the values

of government bonds, corporate bonds and commodities also increased (Kennedy 1973).

         After successfully reopening the first set of banks, Roosevelt’s administration

addressed the long-term capital needs of the banking system. Through investments made



14
   The Act also contained provisions for reorganizing national banks and issuing preferred stock for banks.
It formalized lending by the Federal Reserve to banks, and created a Presidential discretionary fund of
$2,000,000 to help carry out the Act.
15
   The 1933 Act created the concept of bank “conservatorship,” which was a way station between a normal
state of affairs and receivership. Many banks that received assistance from the RFC in 1933 were in
conservatorship.
                                                                                                        16


by local businessmen and the RFC, the government engineered the direct recapitalization

of certain weak banks.           The RFC invested more than $1.2 billion in over 6,000

institutions during its 18 years of operations.16 Ultimately, the agency lost only $13.7

million and only 206 of the banks that received RFC preferred stock investments were

later forced to close (Kennedy 1973).17 The subsidies received by banks (and the implicit

taxpayer costs of RFC assistance) should be measured using ex ante costs (the cost

savings enjoyed by banks by virtue of their access to government assistance), not the ex

post losses.18 Nonetheless, the limited losses are indicative of the care with which RFC

funds were allocated.

          In Detroit, the RFC orchestrated a “Spokane sale” of the assets of the banks.19

General Motors and the RFC announced the creation of a new bank on March 21. Half

the capital for this new corporation was provided by the RFC, which received preferred

stock. The other half of the necessary capital was provided by local interests, including

General Motors and Chrysler, which were granted common stock in the company (New

York Times 1933c). The RFC supervised the management of this new bank, the National

Bank of Detroit.

        The National Bank of Detroit immediately took control of the assets and liabilities

of the Guardian group and the National group. On April 24, the National Bank of Detroit

17
   Equivalent to approximately $227 million in the year 2008 (Officer and Williamson, 2009).
18
   This approach to measuring cost is now widely recognized. For example, the Emergency Economic
Stabilization Act of 2008, which was the empowering legislation for the Troubled Asset Relief Program
(TARP), requires the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB)
to measure subsidies by including the cost of market risk when estimating the budgetary cost of TARP.
19
   “Spokane sales” were used to dissolve banks that provided valuable services to the community but whose
assets covered less than half of their debt. Conservators arranged the sale of “desirable assets in bulk…to
an existing bank or a bank newly organized for that purpose,” and creditors were immediately paid from
the revenue generated by the sale (Kennedy 1973). After the sale and allocation of the proceeds, the old
banks could be dissolved.
                                                                                     17


distributed 30 percent of its holdings to the old depositors and began liquidating the

assets of the Guardian and National groups in May. The efficiency of the RFC’s “Detroit

plan” spurred numerous applications for reorganization in other communities. In total,

the RFC and Treasury Department authorized 257 similar relief operations.         These

rehabilitations were significant aspects of the repair begun with the passage of the

Emergency Banking Act, which allowed the banking system to be rebuilt on stronger

foundations following the banking crisis of 1933.



III. Data Construction and Summary Statistics

       The purpose of this analysis is to measure the effect of the RFC’s loan and

preferred stock programs on bank failure rates, after controlling for other factors. The

models use a cross-sectional set of bank-level data describing RFC loans and preferred

stock investments in each bank, local economic conditions, individual bank financial

characteristics, and the incidence and timing of bank failure.

       Individual bank financial data come from the Federal Reserve member bank

Reports of Condition and Income. For our period, regulators of state nonmember banks

did not publish comparable and detailed data on individual banks’ balance sheets, or

earnings and expenses. Bank-level data for Fed member banks are available in the

Reports of Condition and Income of the Federal Reserve, which were preserved only in

part for our period (Mason 2001a, 1996). This means that our sample of banks is

restricted to Federal Reserve member banks, and that the dates at which we observe

financial information about all Fed member banks is restricted (we will rely on annual

data observed in the December 1931 call report). Federal Reserve banks include all
                                                                                       18


national banks and some (typically, the largest) state-chartered banks, which provides

some institutional diversity in the sample. Our sample is roughly equally divided between

national banks and state-chartered Fed member banks.

       We collected detailed data on the individual characteristics of Michigan banks, as

well as the characteristics of Michigan counties in which the banks operated. The

database includes county-specific data on various aspects of the economic environment,

as well as bank-specific data on bank balance sheet and income statement characteristics,

dates of bank failure, the number of bank correspondent relationships of various kinds

(which link the subject bank to banks operating elsewhere in the country), and the history

of loans and preferred stock assistance each bank received from the RFC. Previous

studies have identified bank and county characteristics that have been shown to be

important either in forecasting failure risk or in determining access to RFC assistance,

and those earlier studies informed our selection of variables for this study. We also

include additional variables that have not been identified in earlier studies. The list of

variables we employ are defined in Table 1, and the summary statistics for these variables

are reported in Table 2.

       Many Michigan banks relied on RFC loans prior to March 1933, and Michigan

banks also made substantial and early use of the RFC’s preferred stock program. As a

result, Michigan banks provide a rich data set to examine the impact of RFC assistance.

As shown in Table 3, of the 209 Michigan Fed member banks in our sample as of

December 1931 (not all of which are included in our regression specifications due to

some missing observations), 92 received RFC loans from March 1932 through February

1933. Of the 195 banks in the sample as of March 1933, 11 received preferred stock
                                                                                        19


assistance in 1933 and another 43 received preferred stock assistance in 1934. (Three

banks in the sample also received RFC loans after March 1933, but these are not included

in Table 3 or in our regression analysis for the later period, as discussed further below.)

Figure 1 provides a more detailed picture of the timing of the receipt of RFC loans and

preferred stock assistance by Michigan banks in our sample.

       As we have seen, the RFC played a central role in the reorganization of Detroit

banking, through its assistance to the newly formed National Bank of Detroit. That

observation, however, is not included in our database, because RFC assistance was

provided in a special form as part of asset liquidation and the creation of a new bank. The

predecessor and successor banks were separate entities. Our sample, in contrast, analyzes

the effects of RFC loans and preferred stock assistance to open banks. Of course, given

the potentially important stabilizing consequences of RFC assistance for the National

Bank of Detroit, it is important to recognize that its omission from our sample

unavoidably understates the systemic contribution of the RFC to Michigan banking.

       The bank failure data for the national banks are taken from the Comptroller of the

Currency’s Annual Report. The Rand-McNally Bankers’ Directory provides the failure

data for state banks, supplemented in one case by an observation reported by the RFC.

For the purposes of the analysis, receiverships and voluntary liquidations are treated as

bank failures. Suspension and “conservatorship” are not treated as failure events. (Recall

that all Michigan banks suspended in February of 1933, as required by law, and many

banks received RFC assistance as part of their “conservatorship” to enable them to
                                                                                                       20


reopen.) Fifty seven of the banks in our sample failed, 7 of which received RFC loans and

4 of which received RFC preferred stock assistance.20

         County-level data for most characteristics are taken from the Inter-university

Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR 2001) database. Additionally, we

rely on Fishback and Kantor (2003) for county data on New Deal disbursements and

loans.    We collected data on each bank’s correspondent relationships (number of

correspondents in New York, Chicago, and elsewhere) from the Polk’s Bankers’

Encyclopedia.21

         RFC loans and preferred stock purchases were hand-coded from the monthly

Reports of Activities of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation.22 The Reports include

the amount of each loan and preferred stock purchase. Many banks received multiple

loans or infusions of capital in the form of preferred stock. According to Mason (2001a),

32 percent of banks in the United States received more than one loan from the RFC and

12 percent borrowed from the government-sponsored entity more than twice. Previous

studies have examined the average amount of each loan or preferred stock purchase by

dividing the amount of each by the number of loans or preferred stock purchases

(Friedman and Schwartz, 1963; Butkiewicz, 1995; Keehn and Smiley 1988, 1993).

However, because so many banks received several loans or preferred stock purchases, the

averages of RFC outlays may be biased downward.


20
   In Table 3, only 3 RFC recipients are shown as failures, owing to the nature of the timing described in
the table, but one of the RFC preferred stock assistance recipients in 1933 failed in 1934.
21
   Almost all of the correspondent information was taken from the September 1931 issue of Polk’s. In two
cases, the subject bank was not listed in the September 1931 issue, and in those two cases we obtained
correspondent information from the March 1932 issue.
22
   These reports were published when Congress was in session after fall 1932. The reports were reproduced
in the Congressional Serial Set and, until 1933, in the Commercial and Financial Chronicle. The Archive
of the Clerk of the House of Representatives preserved the reports submitted while Congress was in recess
and remains the only source for these reports.
                                                                                       21


        Typically, a bank receiving one RFC loan received subsequent loans, as the loans

were rolled over. This was not the case for preferred stock, which was typically received

only once (all of our Michigan recipients received preferred stock assistance only once

during the period March 1933-December 1934). In our study, we identify the date at

which the bank received its first loan or its first preferred stock injection.

        In measuring the effects of RFC preferred stock assistance we only include

assistance received prior to the end of December 1934. We are aware that three banks in

our sample received RFC preferred stock assistance in 1935, but failure risk was virtually

nil in 1935 and 1936, so we do not consider assistance received during these years.

        Our analysis treats the period January 1932-February 1933 separately from the

period March 1933-December 1934. February 1933 is a natural dividing line for a

separate two-period analysis of RFC assistance policies’ effects in Michigan for two

reasons. First, RFC policy changed from lending to preferred stock purchases in March

1933. Second, Michigan banks suspended in February 1933, and reopened from March

1933 through early February as part of the RFC/FDIC process of sorting institutions into

the healthy (which could reopen without assistance, the curably sick (which received

preferred stock assistance), and the dead (which were closed). In our regression analysis,

therefore, the effects of RFC loans are estimated for the early failure period, while the

effects of RFC stock purchases are estimated for the later period. As Table 3 shows,

failure rates were higher for the later period; from January 1932 through February 1933,
                                                                                                           22


17 Michigan banks out of the 209 present as of December 1931 failed, while for the later

period 40 out of 195 banks present as of March 1933 failed.23

         Table 4 presents simple characteristic comparisons – analogous to those discussed

in Calomiris and Mason (1997) for Chicago banks in the 1930s – across bank failure

cohorts. Here we compare four groups of banks: those that failed in the early period

(January 1932-February 1933), those that failed in the first part of the later period (March

1933-December 1933) during which many suspended banks were either closed or

reopened, those that failed in the second part of the later period (January 1934-December

1934), and those that survived beyond December 1934.

         The first characteristic we compare across these four groups is their exogenous ex

ante failure risk. To capture exogenous ex ante failure risk we estimate a simple probit

model of failure risk for the early period. The column labeled “Predicted failure” in Table

4 reports the estimated probability of failure from a probit model that is identical to the

one reported in the first column of Table 5, except that RFC assistance is not included as

an explanatory variable in the regression specification used to construct the predicted

failure probabilities reported in Table 4. Clearly, and not surprisingly given the way

predicted failure probabilities are constructed, the banks that failed in the period January

1932-February 1933 display the highest mean probability of failure (30.9%). Predicted

failure risk is lower for the other three sub-groups, and declines over time (from a mean

of 7.3% for the banks that failed March-December 1933 to 6.2% for those that failed in

1934). Survivors had an average predicted failure risk of 3.9%.



23
  Again, only 3 RFC recipients are shown as failures during Period 3 in Table 3, owing to the nature of the
timing described in the table, but one of the RFC preferred stock assistance recipients in 1933 also failed in
1934.
                                                                                        23


       Table 4 also examines differences across the four cohorts in the structure of bank

liabilities as of December 1931 and related differences in bank funding costs for 1931. As

in Calomiris and Mason (1997), the differences are striking, and confirm that banks at

greater risk of failure tended to experience a contraction in their demand deposits held by

the public and in the deposits owed to other banks, and an expansion in their “Borrowed

money” (a shorthand for bills payable and rediscounts as a proportion of total bank debt).

In other words, as the market perceived banks to be at greater risk of default, demand

deposits contracted and were replaced in part by higher-cost risky funding. That higher

cost is reflected in the column labeled “Cost of funds” (defined as the total interest

expense for 1931 divided by total debt). The cost of funds so defined averaged 4% for

Michigan banks that ended up failing in the period January 1932-February 1933. For

other banks, their average cost of funds in 1931 was roughly half as high.

       The data reported in Tables 3 and 4 show that the connections between the receipt

of RFC assistance and failure risk are potentially complex and must be analyzed

carefully. As Table 3 indicates, roughly equal numbers of Michigan banks received or did

not receive RFC loans in the early period, and the failure rate for the two groups was

similar (9/94 and 8/118). This does not necessarily imply anything about the

effectiveness of RFC loans in reducing failure risk, since the ex ante risk characteristics

of recipients were not necessarily the same as those of non-recipients. Indeed, as Table 4

indicates, failed banks (which had higher ex ante failure risk) were more likely to receive

RFC loans than banks that failed later or that survived. Similarly, only 4 out of 54

preferred stock issuing banks failed in the period March 1933-December 1934, compared

to 23 out of 184 failures for non-recipients during 1933 and 13 out of 118 failures for
                                                                                         24


banks that received no preferred stock assistance at any time in 1933 or 1934. Before

reaching conclusions about the effectiveness of RFC preferred stock assistance, however,

one must control for differences in the riskiness of banks targeted for assistance, and

model the relationship between exogenous variation in RFC assistance and the

consequences of that assistance for bank failure risk.



IV. Regression Methods and Empirical Results

       To analyze the relationship between RFC assistance of both types and bank

failure risk we construct various regression models. We begin with simple probit and

survival duration modeling of the consequences of RFC assistance. Loans are the form of

RFC assistance in the early period and preferred stock purchases are the form of

assistance in the later period. In these simple models, we consider the probability of

failure over the specified period (in the probits) or the continuous survival duration

hazard during the period as a function of the receipt of RFC assistance and various

controls that capture the failure risk of the banks (based on 1931 bank characteristics and

county characteristics). In the simple probit and survival models, reported in Tables 5 and

6, RFC assistance takes a value of 1 if the bank receives assistance during the period and

zero otherwise. In the case of the simple survival duration models, reported in Table 6,

the receipt of assistance is related to the timing of subsequent failure (if any) within the

period. In Table 5, we only examine failures within the relevant periods (ending in

December 1934), while in Table 6 we utilize information about failure risk – which

influences the shape of the survival duration function – through December 1936.
                                                                                           25


       When constructing a model of survival hazard, one has to choose the functional

form of the survival function. We found that the choice between a log-logistic and a log

normal functional forms did not affect our estimation results. For the sake of consistency,

we report results for log normal specifications in Table 6 because using that approach

permits us to perform subsequent estimation – which takes account of the endogeneity of

RFC assistance – using bivariate tobit, joint maximum likelihood estimation (MLE)

modeling, as we discuss further below.

       The simple probit and survival models control for bank risk characteristics, but

these estimates may still be biased due to the endogeneity of assistance to bank

characteristics. In order to control for potential endogeneity bias, in subsequent

regressions reported in Tables 7-10 we model the effects of RFC assistance using various

regression procedures in which the first step forecasts the receipt of assistance and the

second step estimates the effect of exogenous variation in assistance. The various two-

stage regression procedures we employ require the identification of “instruments” as well

as “controls.” Controls are variables that potentially affect both the probability of

receiving RFC assistance and the probability of failure. Instruments are variables that are

assumed to affect the probability of failure only (or at least primarily) through their effect

on the probability of receiving assistance.

       Probit models, which address the censoring and structural problems that arise in

OLS estimation, do not address “the differences in time in which each person is at risk of

experiencing the event” (Jenkins 2005).       The statistical techniques used in survival

analysis were developed to address “the sequential nature of the data, and are able to

handle censoring and incorporate time-varying covariates” (Jenkins 2005). As a result,
                                                                                                       26


survival analysis allows us to incorporate the most information in our study of the

relationship between RFC aid policies and bank failure rates. In the case of the bank

survival times in this data set, duration is measured in days. Coefficients in the probit and

survival models in Tables 5 and 6 should have opposite sign, as one measures the effect

on failure risk, and the other measures the effect on the number of days of survival. We

use a log-normal survival model.                 This differs slightly from the log-logistic

parameterization taken by Calomiris and Mason (2003a), but coefficient estimates are

nearly identical under either version, and the log normal structure facilitates MLE

estimation (when addressing the endogeneity of assistance) using a bivariate tobit on the

logarithm of survival days.

        The bank characteristics selected as determinants of failure (controls) have been

widely analyzed in the literature (Alston et al. 1994; Calomiris and Mason 1997, 2003a;

Cole and Gunter 1995). Each bank characteristic is included at its value as of December

31, 1931.24 Net worth/total assets should be associated with lower failure risk. The

riskier or less liquid a bank’s assets, the greater its risk of failure.                Bonds, stocks,

securities owned, and loans and discounts are defined as risky and relatively “illiquid

assets,” and loans and discounts are distinguished from other illiquid assets, since they

are likely to be particularly illiquid and risky. Paper eligible for rediscount at the Federal

Reserve indicates lower credit risk assets which can produce greater liquidity (from Fed

lending) and thus should be associated with a decreased risk of bank failure. “Real estate

owned” indicates the level of foreclosed and nonperforming assets on the balance sheet

of the bank, and should be associated with higher failure risk. Because interest and

might better describe their effect on the likelihood of failure and bank failure rates.

discount rates should be higher for riskier borrowers, the proportion of interest and

discount income relative to earnings has sometimes proven to be a useful predictor of

failure risk. Higher interest rate risk on liabilities compensate bank depositors and other

debtholders for bearing higher expected default risk and thus should be associated with

higher predicted failure rates. Recoveries, which may capture a sudden recovery in bank

asset values following a macroeconomic downturn, may also be positively associated

with failure risk.25 Larger bank size has been found to be associated with lower failure

risk, reflecting potential gains from loan diversification or lower risks associated with

locations in which banks are larger (bigger cities). National banks faced stricter limits on

real estate lending than state-chartered bank and a different supervisory regime. We also

include a county characteristic that Calomiris and Mason (2003a) identified as an

important predictor of bank failure risk: the “Crop income share” in the county in 1930.

This variable is meant to capture the extent to which banks are exposed to agricultural

loan risk, which for the nation as a whole, was associated with greater risk of bank

failure.

           Given that these various controls are correlated, we do not expect all of them to

prove significant in our regression specifications; nevertheless, because our main interest

in including these variables is to control for differences in bank characteristics, we

include them in our “Full” specifications reported in the various tables. We also report

“Parsimonious” specifications that include a smaller list of variables that tend to prove

significant in some of the reported specifications.

  Mason (2001a) notes, “recoveries may be positively associated with failure risk, if they capture a
rebound in bank asset values following a trough.”
                                                                                         28


       Our list of potential instruments – variables that are employed as exogenous

determinants of RFC assistance that are not directly related to bank failure risk – includes

attributes of the bank and the county that could have affected the supply or demand for

RFC assistance for reasons unrelated to bank failure risk. The correspondent relationships

of banks indicate the extent to which the bank was important within the national network

of banking. It is possible that the RFC was more likely to approve assistance for banks

that were regionally or nationally important. To capture this, we collected data on the

number of correspondent relationships of each bank, and separately counted the number

of correspondents in New York, Chicago, and elsewhere.

       We regard correspondent relationships of Michigan banks as obvious candidates

for valid instruments because they capture the extent to which problems suffered by

Michigan banks might have threatened to spread elsewhere through the cashing in of

Michigan banks’ deposits held in other banks. Furthermore, Michigan banks’

correspondent relationships should be orthogonal to the default risk of Michigan banks;

they capture a one-directional liquidity risk that Michigan banks posed for other banks,

not the liquidity risks of Michigan banks themselves (which we capture with other

control variables in our default risk regressions).

       For purposes of estimation, we divided relationships according to whether they

involved money center banks in New York and Chicago, or other banks. For the same

reason, we included the “Net due to banks over total assets” of each subject bank; it is

possible that banks that were large creditors or debtors to other banks may have been

regarded as more important by the RFC. Although we report results below only for “Net

due to banks” we also experimented with including “Due to banks” and “Due from
                                                                                          29


banks” separately, but these never proved significant. Similarly, we included an indicator

variable for whether the bank was labeled an “Other reserve city bank” by the Fed.

       As additional possible instruments, we also included county characteristics that

might have affected RFC lending propensity: the size of the population in the county

(larger counties may be more politically or economically important), the unemployment

rate in the county in 1930, the proportion of suspended deposits in 1931 (deposits of

failed banks), two measures of the extent to which the county received other forms of

potentially relevant federal government assistance (the proportion of relief expenditures

received by the county, and the proportion of government lending to the county that was

related to the mortgage market), and the manufacturing employment share of the county.

This latter variable – in the presence of the aforementioned control variable for crop

income share – should not be directly relevant as a measure of bank default risk; rather,

we included manufacturing employment as an indicator of the potential political or

economic importance of the county.



Simple Probits and Survival Duration Models

       In the simple probit models reported in Table 5, the illiquid asset ratio and the

proportion of funding from bills payable and rediscounts proved to be the most robust

and significant predictors of failure risk for both periods. In the later period, real estate

owned and net worth also prove significant in the probits. Somewhat surprisingly, the

national bank indicator variable has a positive sign in the probits, although it is

challenging to interpret any partial correlation of a control variable given the correlations

among control variables. Differences over time in the relevance of various covariates
                                                                                           30


should be interpreted with caution. The fact that a characteristic was relevant for

predicting failure in the early period may make it less relevant in the later period, because

failed banks drop out of the sample used for estimation in the later period.

        In the probit models reported in Table 5, RFC loans in the early period are

negatively but insignificantly related to bank failure. Preferred stock purchases in the

later period, in contrast, are negatively and significantly related to bank failure. These

findings are consistent with the results of Mason (2001a), and with the hypothesized

difference between the ineffectiveness of RFC loans (which increased bank indebtedness

and subordinated depositors) and the effectiveness of RFC preferred stock assistance

(which did not increase debt and did not subordinate depositors).

        As in the probit analysis, illiquid assets tends to hasten failure (especially in the

early period), real estate owned also hastens failure (in the later period), the proportion of

funding in bills payable and rediscounts is associated with faster predicted failure, higher

net worth prolongs failure (significantly so in the later period), and national banks (ceteris

paribus) tend to fail faster than state member banks, ceteris paribus (in the later period).

Also, as in the probit models, loan assistance in the early period has an insignificant

positive effect in prolonging failure, while preferred stock assistance has a positive and

statistically significant effect on prolonging failure.



Controlling for the Endogeneity of RFC Assistance

        Because the likelihood of receiving RFC assistance is likely endogenous to the

condition and circumstances of banks, there is a potential problem of endogeneity bias in
                                                                                        31


the estimates reported in Tables 5 and 6. To deal with this, we employ additional

regression methods, using the instruments defined above.

       In the context of the probit models, our approach to dealing with endogeneity

follows Wooldridge (2002). This entails a three-stage process. First, we run a probit on

the RFC indicator variable using controls and instruments to predict the probability of

receiving RFC assistance. Next, we run a two-stage least squares model using the

predicted values from the probit regression as the sole instrument.

       The first-stage probit model is reported in Table 7. In addition to the significance

of the some of the controls, we find that some of our instruments prove significant in

predicting RFC assistance. The number of correspondent relationships robustly predicts

RFC preferred stock assistance in the later period, and interestingly, correspondent

connections to New York and Chicago enter positively in predicting assistance while

total correspondent connections (including other locations) enter negatively; the

implication is that only connections to money center banks had net positive effects on the

probability of receiving RFC assistance. Corroborating that finding is the fact that a

reserve city bank designation is also associated with a greater (marginally significant)

likelihood of receiving assistance in the later period. County characteristics also prove

useful as instruments. The proportion of employment in manufacturing is positively

associated with RFC preferred stock assistance in the later period. Not all the county

characteristics are easy to explain. Population size of the county has opposite, and

significant, effects in the two sub-periods. A higher 1930 unemployment rate tends to

decrease the probability of RFC assistance in both periods, but only in the full

specifications. While this last finding may seem strange, one possible interpretation
                                                                                          32


revolves around the importance of agricultural distress for unemployment in the early

years of the Depression. This may simply be an indication that the RFC avoided assisting

banks that were hit by severe agriculture-related problems in 1921-1930.

       Table 8 reports the effects of instrumented RFC assistance on failure risk. Both

versions of the model find that instrumented RFC assistance reduces failure risk in the

later period. Although the Wooldridge (2002) approach for modeling the effect of

instrumented RFC assistance on failure is inefficient compared to a bivariate probit, there

are two reasons to use this approach rather than a bivariate probit. First, because of our

small sample, the distribution of the error term in the first-stage probit is two-peaked (see

Figure 2 (a)), and this makes it difficult for the bivariate probit model to converge.

Second, the Wooldridge method permits us to compute various diagnostic statistics for

our instruments; in contrast, we are unaware of any established statistical tests for the

validity of instruments in the context of a bivariate probit model.

       With respect to the power of our instruments, as we have noted, several of the

instruments prove significant in the first-stage regressions. In the context of the

Wooldridge (2002) approach, however, one can develop other tests of the validity and

power of instruments, which are reported at the bottom of Table 8. These tests indicate

that the power of the instruments is greater in the full version of the model.

       To deal with potential endogeneity problems in our survival modeling, we

employed a bivariate tobit model, which exploits the fact that tobit is the appropriate

functional form for estimating a log normal survival model. Thus, the dependent

variables in Tables 9 and 10 should be interpreted, respectively, as the natural logarithm

of days until receipt of RFC assistance and the days until failure. When comparing first-
                                                                                          33


stage regression coefficients in Tables 7 and 9, coefficients on regressors should be of

opposite sign. First-stage results in Table 9 are quite similar to those reported in Table 7.

Some of the instruments gain significance in Table 9; in particular, mortgage loan

assistance, which was not significant in Table 7, enters positively and somewhat

significantly in Table 9.

       Second-stage survival duration regressions are reported in Table 10. Coefficients

on regressors should have opposite signs as those in Table 8, with the exception of the

coefficient on the “Log of days to RFC assistance.” That coefficient should, and does,

have a negative sign for the later period in Table 10. This coefficient measures the effect

on survival of the delay in receiving RFC assistance (the dependent variable in Table 9).

The Log of days to RFC assistance is statistically significant, and confirms the result of

Table 6. We only report results for three specifications in Table 10 because the results for

the parsimonious survival model for the late period did not converge. This lack of

convergence reflected a similar problem to the lack of convergence of the bivariate

probit. In the early period survival models and in the full late-period model, convergence

was not a problem, apparently because the error term had a less pronounced two-peaked

shape (as shown in Figure 2 (b)).



RFC Preferred Stock Effects on Lending By Survivors

       Finally, we investigate whether, conditional on survival, the receipt of RFC

preferred stock over the period March 1933 through December 1934 increased the supply

of loans and discounts for the period December 1931 through December 1935. We

emphasize that our analysis understates the overall effect of RFC assistance on loan
                                                                                          34


supply. Presumably, an important part of the effect of RFC assistance on loan supply

resulted from mitigating the risk of bank failure, thereby increasing the supply of loans.

Here we necessarily abstract from that important effect because we constrain the sample

to banks that survived through December 1935 (the only ones for which lending is

observed).

        Furthermore, we emphasize that the effect of RFC preferred stock assistance on

the loan supply of surviving banks, in theory, could be either positive or negative. On the

one hand, the receipt of preferred stock assistance, per se, reduced insolvency risk and

should have encouraged banks to lend more. On the other hand, the RFC required

recipient banks to retain earnings and increase their capital ratios. The strings attached to

RFC assistance could have caused recipients to reduce loan supply relative to surviving

banks that did not receive assistance.

        We report two alternative approaches to estimating the effect of RFC assistance

on the lending by surviving banks. First, in Tables 11 and 12, we report results from the

three-stage procedure suggested by Wooldridge (2002), described above. That is, we run

a probit model for this sample (analogous to the regressions reported in Table 7),

estimating the probability of receiving RFC preferred stock assistance for this sample.

Those first-stage results are reported in Table 11, for both a full and parsimonious

specification. Table 12 reports the two-stage least squares results for the loan growth

regression, which uses the predicted values from Table 11 as the sole instrument. The

dependent variable in Table 12 is bank loan growth from December 1931 to December

1935.
                                                                                          35


       It is important to emphasize that this exercise is performed on a constrained

sample of bank survivors. Results in Table 11 consequently are quite different from those

in Table 7. FERA assistance now comes in significant in the first-stage regression, as

does the manufacturing employment share, but not the numbers of correspondents or the

reserve city bank indicator.

       It is also important to emphasize that we would expect that FERA assistance and

the manufacturing employment share may be correlated with loan demand, and thus, it is

not obvious on an a priori basis that these are valid instruments for a second-stage

regression of loan growth. We report various tests of instrument power at the bottom of

Table 12. They confirm that the instruments are powerful for the full model, but not as

much for the parsimonious model (for example, the Cragg-Donald Wald F statistic is

4.30, which is far below the Stock-Yogo 10% critical value of 16.38).

       The second approach we employ to measuring loan-supply effects uses MLE

estimation, reported in Tables 13 and 14. We run the first stage alternatively as a probit or

a tobit and the second stage as an OLS. We were not able to estimate the full probit

model, once again, because of convergence problems, and so only three versions of the

results are reported in the two tables. In any case, we regard the full tobit results as

preferable, owing to the superiority of the continuous functional form, and to the greater

power of the instruments in the full model.

       The reason we report the MLE alternative to the Wooldridge approach is that it is

possible that its greater efficiency from correctly specified functional forms will improve

the power of the instruments and the implied statistical significance of the estimates of

the effects of RFC assistance. Indeed, this is what we find. The coefficient estimates in
                                                                                         36


the first row of Table 14 increase in magnitude and significance in the MLE estimation

compared to those in Table 12, including for the parsimonious specification, for which

the validity of the instruments is clearer. We conclude that the apparently low power of

instruments in the parsimonious specification of Table 12 reflects the inefficiency of the

Wooldridge procedure relative to MLE. We conclude that RFC preferred stock assistance

substantially increased the loan supply of recipient banks, even after conditioning on their

survival. The estimated coefficient magnitudes of the effect of RFC assistance on loan

growth reported in Table 14 are large. For example, according to the parsimonious probit

specification, surviving RFC recipients display loan growth over the period that is 93%

higher than surviving non-recipients.



V. Conclusion

       The operations of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in Michigan during the

Great Depression provide an opportunity to investigate the effects of government loan

and preferred stock programs on distressed financial institutions during a time of

substantial failure risk. Our time period – January 1932 through December 1934 – covers

an early period in which bank failures occurred in a scattered time pattern during which

the RFC made loans to assist banks, and a later period in which failures were

concentrated in time and coincided with regional and national panics during which the

RFC purchased banks’ preferred stock to assist them.

       The empirical analysis suggests that collateralized short-term loans from the RFC

made bank failure no less likely, and possibly made it more likely, while direct

recapitalizations in the form of preferred stock injections increased the likelihood of bank
                                                                                        37


survival. The preferred stock program owed its success to several factors: (1) It did not

burden the bank with increased debt, increased liquidity risk, or collateral requirements

that subordinated the claims of depositors, (2) the RFC was selective, and apparently

chose viable cases, not basket cases, when granting assistance, and (3) the RFC

implemented effective measures to ensure that government assistance was not abused by

banks receiving assistance. These results suggest that during a banking crisis, effective

assistance requires the government to assume a significant share of the risk of bank

failure.

           Our results are robust to controlling for potential endogeneity bias by modeling

the determinants of RFC assistance alongside the determinants of failure. In doing so we

are able to identify several instruments that predict RFC assistance, including the

importance of the subject bank to the national network of banks. Michigan banks with a

greater number of correspondent relationships with money-center banks, or which were

“other reserve city” banks, were more likely to receive assistance than other banks.

Furthermore, banks located in counties with a greater proportion of manufacturing

employment, and with other harder to interpret county attributes, also were more likely to

receive assistance.

           We also explore the links between RFC assistance and loan supply. The sizes of

estimates effects on loan growth over the period 1931 to 1935 are large, even after

conditioning on bank survival.

           Our results reinforce the conclusions of earlier work on the effects of RFC

assistance in Illinois by Mason (1996, 2001a, 2001b, 2003) and Calomiris and Mason

(2004). That comparison is important because Illinois banks’ experience differed from
                                                                                        38


Michigan’s later and more severe banking problems. Furthermore, our empirical

estimation techniques improve upon the list of instruments and the econometric

efficiency of earlier estimates, which accounts for the fact that we are able to find large

and statistically significant effects of RFC preferred stock assistance not only on bank

failure risk but also on the loan supply of surviving banks. Earlier research for Illinois

had found positive and insignificant loan-supply effects; our estimated effects on loan

supply are larger and statistically significant.

      (a) Deviance residual of RFC assistance dummy (full model, probit)




 (b) Generalized residual of log of days to RFC assistance (full model, tobit)
Yellow bins are the histogram of the errors. Tan curve is the kernel fitted density function of the residuals: the
probit residual is the deviance residual after probit; the tobit residuals are the generalized residuals derived
according to Gourieroux et al (1987). The red curve is the normal density function.
