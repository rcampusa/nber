    This    paper examines the effects of restrictions on international

financial markets. We analyze a general equilibrium, rational expectations

model of a two—country world in    which well-functioning international
financial   markets preit trade in all state—contingent   securities except

insofar as governments restrict these markets. The restrictions we examine

take the form of taxes or quantitative controls on purchases of foreign

currency and on the income from foreign assets. State—contingent financial

markets allow households to allocate wealth optimally across states so that

the imposition of exchange and capital controls has, roughly speaking, only

substitution effects but no wealth effect. These restrictions reduce

international trade in goods and lower ex—post welfare in   the   country   in
which they are imposed. Nominal prices and exchange rate are nonmonotonic
functions of these restrictions.

       This paper analyzes the effects on prices and resource allocation of

 taxes and quantitative restrictions on international financial transactions.

 We employ a general-equilibrium rational-expectations model of two-country

 world economy to examine the connections between the effects of these taxes

 or quantitative restrictions and portfolio allocation on international

 financial markets. We study these issues in a model with complete asset

markets, some of which may he restricted or taxed by governments. A key

theme of the paper is that prospective changes in government policies affect

portfolio allocations in such a way that, if these prospective policy changes

subsequently occur, their effects on prices and resource allocation can be

radically different than if financial markets had been seriously limited.

       We examine the effects of controls or taxation on purchases of foreign

currency--which we call exchange controls-—and controls or differential

taxation on the income from foreign interest-bearing assets--which we call

           controls   We show that the effects of exchange and capital controls

depend critically on the availability of international financial markets in

ways that have been largely overlooked. The results of the paper can also be

applied to dual exchange rates (which amount to taxes on foreign-exchange

transactions that depend upon the source or use of the foreign currency).

       The effects of government policies in economic models are usually

obtained by treating government policy as a parameter of the model and using

comparative statics. However, Lucas (i976) explained that this gives no

useful information' about the effects of policy. Lucas argued that policies

such   as th investment tax credit should he treated as outcomes of the nodel
                                                                              2



of policy. That model may include stochastic elements, or a deterministic

feedback rule from other variables that are themselves stochastic. Then

government policy will be modeled as a stochastic process. (Future

government policies could be perfectly predictable, although this would

preclude the economist from examining the effects of unforeseen changes in

policy. )   The effects of changes in policy, then, should be determined by

examining the effects of alternative realizations of that stochastic process.

    The method of comparative statics allows the economist to compare two

distinct economies, each with a different level of an exogenous variable.

Economists frequently use this method to try to determine the effects (in

real time) of a change in an exogenous variable within a single economy.

These are, however, two very different questions: within a single economy,

knowledge that an exogenous variable      change In the future often alters

the behavior of households and firms in ways that lead an actual change in

the exogenous variable to have effects that differ from the comparative

statics results. This point is fairly general, and does not require

expectations to be formed rationally. However, if expectations are rational

and well—developed financial markets are available, the point becomes

particularly important (as this paper will show).

    Lucas applied this point to exogenous changes In government policy, such

as the investment tax credit and income-supplementing transfer payments.

Future government policies are usually uncertain, sometimes because of

randomness In the results of the political process or uncertainty about the

future behavior of the Individuals or party in power. Uncertainty about

future government policies may be related to the inability of governments to
                                                                            3



commit themselves currently to future policies. Cooley, LeRoy and Raymon

(1984a, b) have developed Lucas point and argued that the effects of

government policies should always be examined by treating policies as the

outcome of a model. If that model is stochastic, i.e.. if changes in policy

are not perfectly predictable, then future values of policy variables should

be modeled as drawings from the probability distribution that actually

characterized future policies.1 Cooley, LeRoy, and Raymon have applied this

method of "rational-expectations policy evaluation" to changes in money

growth and inflation. Sims (1982, 1985) has also made this argument, and has

suggested that it eliminates one common criticism of VAR models. Sargent

(1984) also discusses this argument and its implications for normative

economics. Other applicattons (not always explicit) include work on

balance-of—payment crises (Flood and Garber 1983), and optimal taxation over

time (Lucas and Stokey, 1983, Persson and Svensson, 1984).

    This argument has received little attention in international economics.

But when rational-expectations policy evaluation is applied to a model of the

International economy, the effects of policies are found to depend critically

on International financial markets. Uncertainty about future government

policy affects the portfolio-allocation decisions of households and

(simultaneously) asset prices and returns. The attempt by households to

hedge against adverse policies (of their own or the other government) causes

actual policies to have effects on prices and resource allocation that differ

from the effects obtained if no asset markets were available for such hedging

behavior. With well-developed asset markets, the implications about the

effects of government policies derived from stochastic models--that
                                                                            4


explicitly treat future policies as random variables—-may differ

substantially from comparative—statics implications of nonstochastic models.

    Stockman and Dellas (1985) used rational-expectations policy evaluation

to examine the effects of tariffs. The current paper applies the method to

taxation of (or controls on) financial markets. Our analysis makes use of

the relation between financial markets and goods markets implied by a

transactions demand for money with domestic currency used for domestic

transactions and foreign money for foreign transactions. (The foreign money

may actually be used only by importers who then resell the good on domestic

markets for domestic money.) Because the transactions demand for money

creates a link between income fro. financial assets and purchases of goods,

taxation of Income from financial assets is similar to taxation of the goods

that are purchased with the Income from those assets (just as income taxes

and consumption taxes are related, wtih a differential effect only on

savings). This analogy with the tariff problem makes it useful to outline

the results on tariffs before proceeding to exchange controls and capital

controls.

    Stockman and Dellas examined a very simple two-country world equilibrium

barter model in which (exogenous) tariff policy Involves some uncertainty and

in which there are complete International capital markets. The paper

presented an example in which the effect of tariffs on consumption Is the

opposite from the usual 'textbook" analysis. That usual analysis shows that

a small tariff (given the behavior of the other country) can improve welfare

by raising consumption of the exportable even if consumption of the

Importable falls. For a sufficiently small tariff, the wealth effect (from
                                                                              0


an improvement in the terms of trade) creates a larger increse in welfare

than the loss from the substitution effect (associated with a distortion in

the internal relative price). The usual model implicitly relies on one of

two assumptions. Either households (and firms) expect the exisitng tariff

rates to remain permanently In effect with probability one (so that

comparative statics is appropriate), despite the fact that the economist then

goes on to examine the effect of a change In the tariff rate (so that

expectations, which placed a zero probability on this event, were

irrational). Or rio International capital markets are available to household

and firms (in which case, it turns out, expectations may not matter).    If

people know that the existing tariff structure will remain unchanged with

some probability, but may also change with some positive probability, and if

there are some international financial markets, then people will use these

markets to attempt to diversify the risk associated with possible changes in

policies. (Households need not have direct access to international financial

markets; diversification can be accompanied indirectly with firms as

financial intermediaries.) If international financial markets permit trade

in assets whose returns are affected by changes in policies (which, one

presumes, most returns will be), then the effects of those policies will be

altered.   In the presence of complete international financial markets, some

effects of a small tariff are reversed.   In an endowment model, with

additively—separable utility, complete asset markets, and two countries with

equal wealth and identical tastes, a small domestic tariff--that would

unambiguously raise domestic consumption of exportables and improve domestic

welfare In the absence of international financial markets--unambiguously
                                                                             6



reduces domestic consumption of importables and has no effect at all on

consumption of exportables. The tariff unambiguously lowers ex—post utility.

This result is obtained irrespective of the size of the tariff. The

difference arises not from any peculiar aspect of the model but because

households treat future government policy as uncertain and use asset markets

to try to insure against adverse events.   Intuitively, households spread

income optimally across states of the world. When asset markets are

complete, there is no wealth effect when a tariff is changed. The only

remaining effect of a tariff change is the substitution effect, which reduces

consumption of the good on which the tariff is imposed.

    While International financial markets have expanded greatly in the past

decades, governments frequently impose taxes and quantitative restrictions on

these markets, and effectively tax earnings from foreign assets at different

rates than earnings from doemstic assets. The effects of these taxes and

restrictions—-in the forms of foreign exchange controls, capital controls,

dual exchange rates--has been the subject of much recent work, e.g., Flood

(1978). Cumby (1984). Obstfeld (1984), Adams and Greenwood (1985), Mussa

(1985), and Greenwood and Kimbrough (1985a, b). Adams and Greenwood

demonstrated an equivalence between dual exchange rates and capital controls

while Greenwood and Kimbrough showed that there is an equivalence between

exchange controls and taxes or controls on trade, and examined the effects of

fiscal policy in the presence of capital and exchange controls.

    We limit ourselves in this paper to a positive (rather than normative)

analysis, and we treat government policies as exogenous. Our model is

written In terms of taxes, but quantitative restrictions can replace taxes in
                                                                              7



the analysis by choosing restrictions that are equivalent to taxes on a

state-by—state basis.



II. Optimization Problems of      Representative   Households and Firms

    We will examine a model with two countries, each with a representative

risk-averse household that consumes two perishable goods, X and V. These

goods are endowed to (supplied perfectly Inelastically in) the two countries

we assume that there is complete specialization in endowments and that these

endowments are fixed over time.2 Trade occurs because of different

endowments and/or different tastes across countries. By convention, the

domestic country exports X. We assume that all households are price-takers

who maximize discounted expected utility over an infinite horizon.

    There are two moneys, M and N, which are introduced with cash--in-advance

constraints; we also assume that sellers' currencies are used for all
                3
transactions.       These constraints require purchases of goods each period to

be financed with money held by households prior to receipt of income from

current sales of goods (or dividends paid by firms from current receipts).

See Stockman (1980), Lucas (1980, 1982), Ilelpman (1981). Helpman and Razin

(1982, 1984), Svensson (1985a), or Stockman and Svensson (1985) for further

discussion.

    There are complete (or at least Pareto—efficient) international asset

markets except for the restriction that assets may not pay Interest (or

principal) or dividends directly as goods: they may only pay moneys (or

other assets).      If assets were permitted to pay Interest as physical goods,

then households could engage In complete contingent contracting that would
                                                                              8

eliminate   any need for subsequent transactions; without transactions, there

cannot be a transactions demand for money, and there would be no monetary

equilibrium. We will use the term "quasi—complete" to describe our

assumption on asset markets.      It is the same assumption that is used in many

of the papers just cited.

    "Firms"   are   defined as the recipients of the endowments In each country.

As there are quasi—complete asset markets, shares of firms may be traded; we

normalize the number of shares in domestic (foreign) firms at one (per

capita, using the world population).

    During each period households visit asset markets where assets are

traded, interest or dividend payments are made, and taxes are paid or

transfers received. Households, who leave asset markets with portfolios that

include money to finance subsequent expenditures, then visit goods markets

and purchase goods using money carried over from asset markets. The process

then repeats itself, with firms paying as dividends (at subsequent asset

markets) there money receipts from previous sales of goods.4 (One can think

of households as buying goods from vending machines——firms——that require

money; the money then sits in machines—-at the firms—-until they are emptied

at the time goods—markets close.)

    Money supplies of each country are assumed to be fixed (and normalized at

unity). The only government policy here is the proportional taxation of

foreign currency and receipts of foreign currency from other sources, such as

sales of goods abroad, dividends from foreign equities, and interest (and

principal) from other foreign assets.5 Government policies are partly

'anticipated" in the sense that households have rational expectations and
                                                                            9


know the model and the true probability distributions that govern policies.

The actual pattern of taxes over time arises from the equilibrium of a

political system that is not explicitly modeled here. The political

equilibrium each period is subject to some uncertainty, in that housholds are

not able to predict perfectly future policies. Households are assumed,

however, to have rational expectations regarding the formation of' policy and

the exogenous productivity shocks. The model permits policies to be

correlated in any way over time and across countries. in order to avoid the

additional notation (with little Interesting economics) associated with

corner solutions for some assets, the government is assumed to set the same

tax rate on all acquisitions of foreign currency, regardless of the source.

These tax rates may change over time, and will be treated here as exogenous.

(See comments in footnote I regarding endogenous government policies.)

Domestic (foreign) government revenue from taxes is assumed to be refunded

through lump—sum transfers to domestic (foreign) residents.

    The representative household in the home country maximizes discounted

expected utility of consumption of the two goods, over an infinite horizon.

      Domestic households have initial assets A0. The initial assets of

foreign and domestic households must sum to the values of equities and

      The domestic household is also constrained in its purchases of goods by

where p and q are nominal prices (in domestic and foreign currencies) of the

goods X and Y. These require purchases of each good at date t to be financed

by money on hand at the close of asset markets at date t.

      A domestic firm is endowed with              which it sells at date t; it therefore

earns p(s) to pay as dividends during asset markets at t÷l. A fraction H

of these dividends are received by the representative domestic household,

which owns H equities in domestic firms. Households also receive money

payments from other assets, receive 1up—sum refunds of tax revenues, and

(possibly) carry over unspent money from previous goods-markets. So

that the exchange rate In state s at date t is

       There is an analogous optimization problem for the representative

household in the foreign country. The utility function of the foreign

household may differ from that of the domestic household, though we assume

rates of time-preference are the same. Using (4) to eliminate x(st) and

Lagrange multipliers. The multipliers, in turn, are determined through the

budget constraints and transversallty conditions, and are functions of the

distribution of wealth between the two countries.                              It Is convenient to choose

a normalization so that the domestic multiplier Is unity.10 Then, loosely

currency are associated with lower domestic consumption of foreign goods and

lower, unchanged, or greater consumption of domestic goods as a weighted sum

of U12 and U12 is greater than, equal to, or less than zero. This contrasts

with the more commonargument that taxation of foreign—currency acquisitions

will have some expenditure-switching effects that will increase consumption

of exportables (irrespective of the sign of U12); that effect is present here

only if U12 is negative. Furthermore, ex post utility is generally decreased

by these taxes on acquisitions of foreign currency, since

which is negative unless U12 and U12 are negative and very large.

       Note that only current taxes on foreign—currency acquisitions affect

current consumptions. This is a result of an intertemporally separable

utility function and of the absence of rea1 investment in the model.                In a

more general model that relaxed these features, the conditional probability

distribution of future taxes (given current taxes) would also affect current

allocations and trade.

    These results differ substantially from those obtained In models without

contingent assets or in which households are assumed to ignore the

possibility of changes in government policies. Without these features,

higher domestic taxes on foreign-currency acquisitions not only lead domestic

households to substitute away from foreign currency into domestic currency

and other assets, but affects the distribution of wealth. Substitution out
                                                                               16


of foreign currency reduces the demand for the foreign good and lowers its

relative price. This redistributes wealth from owners of foreign firms to

owners of domestic firms. If equities are traded internationally, the effect

on domestic versus foreign wealth depends upon portfolio shares. In a model

like ours without any production shocks, ownership of equities would be

indeterminate if households ignored potential changes in government policies,

so the wealth effects of a change in taxes would be I ndeterminate. (This

illustrates a problem with models in which households do not take into

account potential changes in government policies when they allocate their

portfolios. In general, potential changes In policies will affect these

portfolio decisions as In our model.) If It Is assumed that equities are all

held domestically (e.g., because they cannot be traded) then the higher tax

raises domestic wealth and lowers foreign wealth •   The higher domestic tax,

then, would raise domestic consumption of X even with separable utility, and,

if the tax is small enough, would raise domestic utility (through an argument

somewhat like that for an optimal tariff).   In our model, in contrast,

utility would fall.

    The effects of exchange controls and capital controls on nominal prices

and the exchange rate can be determined from the other necessary conditions

and equilibrium conditions. Notice that the equilibrium allocations derived

in the previous section are Independent of the behavior of nominal prices.
                                    *
Given these allocations, and given A , which depends upon the international

distribution of wealth at date zero, we have a system of equations consisting

of (7g. h, I. j) for every date t and state s, in the variables m(s).

n(s).the multipliers from the finance constraints .i and   LI,   and the prices

necessary conditions for the foreign optimization problem; the endogenous

variables in those equations are m(s) n(s), the foreign multipliers p

and v      and the prices                     and (s). Finally, we have the equilibrium

conditions for each money, which can be written as



                  =       -               -

The nominal exchange rate is determined from (14) once the nominal prices p

and q are determined

       We have been able to say something more about nominal prices only for a

special case of (a) a two-period version of the model, and (b) ex ante

symmetry of the two countries. The symmetry assumption means that the two

countries have equal initial assets and equal endowments,                 = . that   they

have symmetric tastes in the sense that


                              *
(15)        U(x, y) = U (y, x)



for all x, y, that foreign and domestic taxes at date zero are equal, and

that foreign and domestic tax rates are interchangeable in the probability

distribution function over future                  tax   rates, i.e.
                                                                               18

The assumption (15) permIts tastes to differ across countries, but If

domestic households have a preference, in any sense of the word, for one of

the two goods, then foreign households have the same preference for the other

good. The assumption (16) means that the conditional probability

distribution of domestic taxes (given foreign taxes) is identical to the

conditional distribution of foreign taxes (given domestic taxes).

        With these assumptions, the two countries are fully symmetric. For any

state of the world s there is another state      with equal probability such

       The symmetry conditions imply that (7g. h) are identical to their foreign

counterparts. En this special case they can be written, using (13) and (16),

as




            U1(x0, y0)
             1-     -     = /3EU1(x1. y1) + p

(20)

           U2(x0, y0)
           _________  = /3E(J2(x1, y1) + V.



Also, we have


           pm=0, p>0, m>O
           &'n=O, z'O, n>O

Once we solve for m and n, prices are given by (13).

       Symmetry implies that foreign and domestic prices are equal. Nominal

prices are trivially equal to unity in the second period (which is what makes

this two—period example easy). The level of nominal prices in the first

period depends upon the level of current taxation of foreign-currency

acquisitions (which, by the symmetry assumptions, is equal in the two

countries). There are two critical levels of taxation that depend only on

tastes, production, and the probability distribution of future taxes. These

critical values have the properties that, (1) if actual current taxes are

below the first (lowest) critical level, nominal prices are less than unity
                                                                                                20



and rising in the level of taxation; (2) If taxes are above the first

critical level but below the second critical level, nominal prices are unity

(this corresponds to unit velocity of money with output and the money

supplies normalized to unity); and (3) if taxes are above the second critical

level, nominal prices are again smaller than unity and falling in the level

of taxes. The nonmonotonic behavior of prices (as taxes vary) reflects the

anticipatory behavior of households, who may wish to accumulate foreign

currency in anticipation of taxes on future foreign—currency acquisitions.

      Divide the two equations in (20). Assume there are tax rate

 such that i.'       =n    =   0, and           such that m =   p     0. Then


                                                                        I)

                     r1.
if r <                0 and n >          0:     current taxes are sufficiently low that it is

worthwhile to acquire foreign currency now, In anticipation of possible

exchange and capital controls in the future. But higher levels of taxes

reduce the acquisition of foreign currency by domestic residents (and

acquisition of domestic currency for foreigners) and therefore raise nominal

prices.

      Ef current taxes exceed                    but are smaller than r2, then prices are unity

(I.e., velocity is unity). If current taxes exceed                           then it Is not
                                                                                 21



worthwhile to acquire foreign currency, but it is worthwhile to acquire and

hold domestic currency. Velocity is less than unity. High current taxes

reduce domestic consumption of the foreign good and lead domestic households

to try to substitute into current domestic goods and future goods. Foreign

households, similarly, try to substitute out of domestic Into foreign goods

and future goods. The current relative price of foreign and domestic goods

Is unaffected, but the attempt by all households to substitute Into future

goods drives down the interest rate. When r < r2, m > 0 and prices are less

than one. Higher taxes raise m and reduce nominal prices.

    All of this discussion was conducted under the assumption that        > 0.

In fact, it Is possible that r, '2 < 0.   (If foreign and domestic tastes are

identical, then    must be positive.) The same arguments apply, but some of

the cases are then irrelevant.

    The effect of a change in taxes on the exchange rate depends upon its

effect on nominal prices and on the terms of trade.   If    < T <    in   our

two-period example, then an increase in r has no effect on nominal prices p

and q, as noted above. Then (14) implies that domestic currency appreciates

or depreciates as (J1(xt.                       rises or falls. This

magnitude can go either way, depending upon concavity of U and LI12; the

currency is more likely to appreciate the more Inelastic the demands. More

generally, the effect of a change in taxes on the exchange rate will also

depend, through (14), on its effect on nominal prices.



IV. Conclusions

    Exchange controls an capital controls have been widespread; as Greenwood

and Kimbrough (1985) note, 86 of ll EMF-inember countries had exchange
                                                                            22


controls at some time during the l97883 period. While the controls take

many forms, many of them are similar to those we have assumed in this paper

or could be analyzed in a similar way. Our assumption of complete markets is

very special, but international financial markets are becoming increasingly

sophisticated. Numerous assets can provide payments that are contingent upon

various disturbances, including government policies to tax or quantitatively

control asset markets. Some of these assets are traded on organized

exchanges: besides stocks, bonds, and Eurodeposits (which, being nominal

assets, have payoffs that are contingent on the price level), there are

forward contracts, futures contracts, currency options, futures options, and

now CPI-W futures In the U.S. Other assets, such as swaps, are not traded on

organized exchanges but can offer virtually any contingent payoff. Finally,

assets such as equities In multinational corporations or In firms that sell

abroad or use imported inputs, can also provide payoffs that are contingent

on International economic policies. This paper has examined the effects of

restrictions or taxes on these markets. While taxes or quantitative controls

on acquisitions of foreign currency can be used by a government to improve

its terms of trade and reduce imports, the policies are not successful at

shifting demand to domestic goods or Improving welfare. These conclusions

are analogous to the conclusions about the effects of direct trade

restrictions In the presence of International financial markets.

    'See Lucas (1976), e.g., his Investment example, and Cooley, LeRoy, and

Raymon (1984a, b). Also see Sims (1982) and Sargent (1984).    It should also

be noted that policy is treated as exogenous in this example only for

simplicity. More generally, policy changes could be endogenous:    if the

model of policy—determination is deterministic, then households would have

perfect foresight on actual policy In a rational expectations model; if the

model of policy—determination involves some uncertainty (or limited

information to households), then households would treat this uncertainty

exactly as they treat uncertainty from technology shocks, etc., by treating

actual policy as the outcome of a stochastic process (as in the examples in

this proposal).



    2Stochastlc endowments can be added easily to the model.

Nonspeclalization and production can be incorporated into the real part of

the model as In Stockman, 1985b; the cash-in-advance constraints must also be

modified with incomplete specialization, as e.g., domestic money can be used

to purchase both goods.



    3me use of buyerst currencies is examined in Helpman and Razln, 1984,

and in Stockman and Dellas, 1984. The cash-In-advance model of money is

sometimes useful for introducing a transactions demand for money into a

model. It does not answer the question of what Is used as money or which of

several alternative moneys are chosen for some purpose. Instead, the answers
                                                                           24


to these important questions are solved by assumption. While this is not

fully satisfactory, it does allow us to go on to other questions, in the hope

that, in most cases, the neglect of the problem of what is chosen as money Is

unimportant. Other models of money face similar problems, and generally

resort to assumptions about which money enters a utility function or

production function, or which assets come in which denominations, etc. Note

that the cash-In-advance model can be formulated so that the two moneys are

perfect substitutes (so that a Kareken—Wallace type of result would follow,

by allowing either good to be purchased with either money); that formulation

is not used here, however. Also note that the cash-in—advance model is

consistent with variable velocity, and velocity is endogenous in our model.

Also see Svensson (1985a, b) and Stockman and Svensson (1985).



    4The dating of time periods is completely arbitrary and makes no

difference to the results. Also, as Svensson (1985a) has shown, asset

trading can occur continuously in cash—in—advance models. Goods—markets are

assumed to be open only at certain times; this plays the same role as

explicit transactions costs in a Baumol-Tobin model and generates a positive

demand for money.



    5Taxatlon on income from domestic assets can be introduced easily, and Is

neglected for simplicity. We have defined exchange controls as taxes or

quantitative controls on purchases of foreign currency an capital controls as

differential taxation on Income form foreign assets. In our model, there Is

a tax at rate r on all acquisitions of foreign currency, regardless of
                                                                                  25


whether the foreign currency is purchased outright or obtained as interest or

dividends on foreign assets. That is,     capital   controls (taxation on income

from foreign equities) and exchange controls are imposed at the same rate.

This prevents corner solutions or arbitrage opportunities. Alternative

terminolgy for the controls we Investigate would be "currency controls,"

because taxes are determined by the currency that is acquired.



    6                                                                   *
     This    assumption is slightly stronger than concavity of U and U ,    but
reduces to the concavity assumption If foreign and domestic households are

identical.




    7me taxes on acquisitions of foreign currency may be equivalently

thought of as paid to the government in units of domestic currency or in

units of foreign currency.     In the former case, households must acquire on

foreign exchange markets the domestic currency needed to pay the tax; In the

latter case, the government acquires domestic currency by selling the foreign

currency. In either case, the lump—sum refund of tax revenue to households

is paid in domestic currency.



        is unnecesary in our model for households to alter their portfolios

of equities over time, so we do not put time subscripts on H and K.         Recall

that equity supplies are each unity.



        complete description of the state is actually (St. sf1. s2. . . .

but is it simple to verify that all period—t allocations and prices are

functions of s alone—--see. e.g., (9).
                                                                                                           26


          10This normalization is permitted because all prices in (3) were

 "accounting" prices with units yet to be chosen. The normalization of money

 supplies to unity, mentioned in the previous section, amounts to choosing

 units to measure those moneys.



      The assumption mentioned below (1) is sufficient to ensure                                  >   0.


          12We have not been able to derive simple, interpretable necessary

 conditions for (12) to be negative. If the two countries are symmetric

 ante (as in the discussion at the end of this section) then U2 >                             1   (because
                                                                                         1

IT > 1).          (12) is obviously negative if U12 >                   0, 012 > 0.     Suppose instead
that 012 <        0,    tJ12 <   0.       (12) can be rewritten as




      dO         AU1U2 02             *        *            **                02
                          {      [U       -
                                              012
                                                    +   A   T (Ufl- 012)] +
                                                                                   - l)(Ul2

The second of the two terms on the right is then negative. Sufficient

conditions for (12) to be negative are then that                          011 - 012 < 0 and
      —            0.
           012


      130ur results in (1O)-(12) can be used to calculate the approximate

covarlances of consumption and taxes implied by the model for any arbirtary

(stationary) probability distribution on taxes, along the lines of Svensson

(1985) and Stockinan and Svensson (1985). For example, the covarlance of
and        is approximately
