                                           ABSTRACT

Relative wages vary considerably across regions of the United Kingdom, with skill-abundant regions
exhibiting lower skill premia than skill-scarce regions. This paper shows that the location of
economic activity is correlated with the variation in relative wages. U.K. regions with low skill
premia produce different sets of manufacturing industries than regions with high skill premia.
Relative wages are also linked to subsequent economic development: over time, increases in the
employment share of skill-intensive industries are greater in regions with lower initial skill premia.
Both results suggest firms adjust production across and within regions in response to relative wage
differences.

1.       Introduction

    Relative wages vary considerably across regions of the United Kingdom,
with skill-abundant regions exhibiting lower skill premia than skill-scarce
regions. Adjusted for worker quality, the skill premium in London (in
the South East region) is less than 2/3rds that in Northumberland (in the
Northern region). This paper shows that this variation in relative wages
has important implications for the location of economic activity.
    We start by presenting evidence that skill premia vary widely across
U.K. regions and that these diﬀerences persist over a long time interval.
We then report two major results. First, U.K. regions with low skill premia
produce diﬀerent sets of manufacturing industries than regions with high
skill premia. Second, relative wages are linked to subsequent economic de-
velopment: over time, increases in the employment share of skill-intensive
industries as well as in the skill-intensity of production are greater in re-
gions with lower initial skill premia. Both responses suggest firms adjust
production across and within regions in response to wage diﬀerences.
    The existence of relative wage variation within the U.K. is consistent
with the general equilibrium Heckscher-Ohlin model, which has the relative
wages and product mix of suﬃciently disparate regions varying with relative
factor endowments. In equilibrium, regions that are abundant in skilled
workers oﬀer low skill premia. As a result, skill-abundant regions are
attractive locations for skill-intensive industries. The purpose of this paper
is to test the strength of this attraction. U.K. relative wage variation is
inconsistent with standard multiple factor economic geography models that
predict a positive relationship between skill premia and skill abundance as
a result of agglomeration externalities.
    Our estimates of relative wage diﬀerences exploit a new methodology
introduced by Bernard and Schott (2003) that controls for unobserved vari-
ation in factor quality and production technology across geographic areas.
We confirm earlier research by Bernard et. al (2003) that uncovers sig-
nificant diﬀerences in skill premia and production patterns across U.K.
regions.1 In this paper we examine the structure of U.K. wages and pro-

(2000,2001), Duranton and Monastiriotis (2002), HM Treasury (2001), Jackman and
Savouri (1991), and Venables and Rice (2003).

duction across a longer time interval and find no convergence of skill premia
from the 1970s to the 1990s. We also present new evidence on the dynamic
response of industries to persistent variation in regional skill premia.
    Using data on regions within a country allows us to investigate the link
between wage variation and industrial structure while controlling for many
of the unobservables present in comparable cross-country analyses. These
unobservables include diﬀerences in how workers are educated and trained
as well as how goods are produced. Our U.K. data tracks production of 209
four-digit manufacturing industries across 63 counties and Scottish Regions
over two decades. These data provide far greater resolution of economic
activity than traditionally-used datasets.2
    Understanding the relationship between relative wages and industrial
structure is critical for a wide range of public policy debates.3 One in-
terpretation of our results is that industries move towards workers more
readily than workers move towards industries. As a result, regional devel-
opment assistance designed to introduce new, skill-intensive industries to
faltering, skill-scarce regions may be less successful than policies designed
to boost skill-scarce regions’ skilled labor pools.
    The paper is structured as follows. Section 2 tests for relative wage
equality across U.K. regions and examines the link between industrial struc-
ture and relative wages. Section 3 how industries have responded to initial
diﬀerences in relative wages across regions. Section 4 concludes.

2.       Production Structure and Relative Wages

    The general equilibrium Heckscher-Ohlin model sets up a systematic re-
lationship between regional production structure and relative factor prices.
Figure 1 illustrates the producer equilibrium graphically using a Lerner
(1952) diagram.
    For simplicity, we consider an example with two factors of production
(skilled labor, N , and unskilled labor, P ) and three industries (relatively
high skill Computers, relatively low-skill Textiles, and intermediate Ma-
chinery). The same arguments apply with arbitrary numbers of industries
     2
     Existing U.K. research largely focuses on the 10 Administrative Regions of Great
Britain and substantially more aggregate industrial classifications.

     See, for example, Cabinet Oﬃce (1999) and HM Treasury (2001).

and factors of production (Leamer 1987). The endowments of skilled and
unskilled labor of regions A and B are respectively EA and EB . Production
technologies are characterized by the industries’ unit value isoquants and,
for simplicity and without loss of generality, the figure is drawn for the case
of Leontief or fixed unit input requirement technologies. The analysis is
directly analogous for technologies with unit input requirements that vary
with relative factor prices.
     Even if regions face common commodity prices and have identical tech-
nologies, suﬃciently large diﬀerences in endowments induce specialization
in diﬀerent mixes of industries with diﬀerent equilibrium relative factor
prices. Skill-abundant region A produces skill-intensive Computers and
Machinery, while skill-scarce region B specializes in Machinery and Tex-
tiles. Each region lies within a diﬀerent cone of diversification, where the
word ‘cone’ refers to the set of endowment vectors that select the same set
of industries. In the equilibrium depicted in the figure, there is an over-
lap of regional product mix because both regions produce the moderately
skill-intenisve Machinery. If production technologies were characterized
by variable unit input requirements (not shown in the figure), this over-
lap industry would be produced more skill intensively in A and less skill
intensively in B.
     The relative wage of skilled workers is lower in the skill-abundant abun-
dant region so that, as one looks across regions in diﬀerent cones of diver-
sification, the relative wage of skilled workers falls discretely with regional
skill-abundance. Thus, diﬀerences in relative factor prices are associated
with systematic diﬀerences in production structure across regions. This is
a general equilibrium relationship between two endogenous variables, which
we examine further in the empirical analysis below.

2.1.   Relative Wages and Relative Wage Bills
    The theory described in the previous section focuses on the price paid
to identical workers in each region. In practice, both the quality and com-
position of workers may vary substantially across regions even within skill
categories.4 In this section, we briefly review an empirical methodology for
   4
     There is a long tradition in the international trade literature emphasizing this idea,
see in particular Leontief (1953) and Trefler (1993).

testing relative wage diﬀerences, introduced by Bernard and Schott (2003),
that is robust to unobserved variation in factor quality and composition.
    Assuming that the production technology is constant returns to scale in
quality-adjusted skilled workers (N ), unskilled workers (P ) and capital (K),
and assuming that firms minimize costs, the relative demand for observed
                               e ) and unskilled workers (Pe) is:
quantities of skilled workers (N

                            Nerj  θPrj ∂Brj /∂wrN
                                 = N                                        (1)
                            Perj  θrj ∂Brj /∂wrP

where θzrj is the unobserved quality of factor z in industry j of region r;
Brj = Arj Γj (wrN , wrP , wrK ) is the unit cost function; wrz denotes the price
of quality-adjusted factor z in region r; and Arj is a Hicks-neutral region-
industry technology diﬀerence.
    Under the null hypothesis that quality-adjusted relative wages are the
same across regions, observed relative wages vary solely because of unob-
served diﬀerences in factor quality:

                                    =                                       (2)

where a tilde (~) above a variable again denotes an observed value and
where, without loss of generality, we have chosen region s as the benchmark
for measuring factor quality (θzsj = 1).
    Multiplying observed relative wages and observed relative employments
in equations (1) and (2), the terms in unobserved factor quality cancel.
Under the null hypothesis that quality-adjusted relative wages are equalized
across regions, relative unit factor input requirements are the same, and we
obtain the prediction that observed relative wage bills are equalized across
regions:
                                    N             N
                            ^ rj
                           wagebill          ^ sj
                                            wagebill
                                    P
                                        =         P
                                                                            (3)
                            ^ rj
                           wagebill          ^ sj
                                            wagebill
   Under the alternative hypothesis that quality-adjusted relative wages
diﬀer across regions by a proportion γ rs 6= 1, observed relative wages vary
because of both unobserved diﬀerences in factor quality and diﬀerences in
          Relative Wage Variation and Industry Location                      6


quality-adjusted relative wages. Relative unit factor input requirements
also typically vary and we obtain the prediction that, under the alternative
hypothesis, observed relative wage bills generally diﬀer across regions:
                                 N                  N
                          ^ rj
                         wagebill              ^ sj
                                              wagebill
                                 P
                                     = ηrsj         P
                                                                           (4)
                          ^ rj
                         wagebill              ^ sj
                                              wagebill

where η rsj is a function of the diﬀerence in quality-adjusted relative wages
(γ rs ) and the diﬀerence in unit factor input requirements.
     Unobserved variation in factor quality means that one cannot determine
the existence and magnitude of relative wage diﬀerences from an analysis of
wage data alone. However, by exploiting information on the relative wage
bills of skilled and unskilled workers, one can control for unobserved factor
quality. Finding that η rsj 6= 1 is suﬃcient to reject the null hypothesis
that quality-adjusted relative wages are equalized across regions.

2.2.   Relative Wages Across Regions
    Normalizing the wage bill of skilled workers relative to unskilled workers
in all regions r by the relative wage bill in a base region s and taking logs,
one obtains the following empirical specification:
                          µ        ¶ X
                            RW Brj
                       ln             =      αsr dr + εrsj                 (5)
                            RW Bsj        r

where RW B = wagebillN /wagebillP ; dr are a set of region dummies; αsr
are the coeﬃcients on the region dummies where s is the base region; and
εrsj is a stochastic error.
    Finding that the coeﬃcients on the region dummies are jointly statis-
tically significantly diﬀerent from zero is suﬃcient to reject the null hy-
pothesis. Under the assumption that the production technology takes
the constant elasticity of substitution (CES) form with elasticity σ j =
1/(1 − ρj ), the diﬀerences in relative wage bills across regions in equation
(4) can be written as an explicit function of γ rs and the CES parame-
ter ρj : η rsj = (γ rs )ρj /(ρj −1) . Assuming that the elasticity of substitu-
tion is the same across industries, and choosing a value for this elasticity,
one may extract from the estimated coeﬃcients on the regional dummies
            Relative Wage Variation and Industry Location                               7


the estimated
        ³       unobserved
                       ´    diﬀerences in quality-adjusted relative wages:
  s            ρ/(ρ−1)
αr = ln (γ rs )         .
    Existing estimates of the elasticity of substitution between skilled and
unskilled workers in the labor literature (see, in particular Katz and Autor
1999 and Katz and Murphy 1992) suggest a value of σ > 1, which corre-
sponds to 0 < ρ < 1. Hence, a positive estimated value of the coeﬃcient on
the regional dummies, αsr = ln((γ rs )ρ/(ρ−1) ), corresponds to a lower relative
wage of skilled workers in region r than in the base region s (γ rs < 1).
    This approach thus provides a method for testing for relative wage bill
diﬀerences and estimating their magnitude that is robust to unobserved
variation in factor quality. Bernard et. al. (2003) demonstrate how the
methodology reviewed here is consistent with very general production envi-
ronments, including imperfect competition, increasing returns to scale, and
diﬀerences in factor composition as well as quality.

2.3.   Data Description
    To test for diﬀerences in relative wages across regions and their impli-
cations for industrial structure we need information on employment and
wages by industry and region over a long time interval. We use data from
the Annual Respondents Database (ARD) sample of manufacturing estab-
lishments from 1976 to 1993.5 We supplement this data with the more
limited information available for the population of manufacturing plants
for the period 1980 to 1993.6 Each establishment and plant can be associ-
ated with one of 209 four-digit U.K. 1980 Standard Industrial Classification
(SIC) industries and can be located in one of 10 broad Administrative Re-
gions and one of 63 more finely detailed Counties and Scottish Regions
enumerated in Table 1. Following standard practice, we measure skilled
    5
      ARD establishments correspond roughly to a ‘line of business.’ The ARD sample
includes the population of larger establishments and a sample of smaller establishments
(typically, those with less than 100 employees). We explored controlling for the existence
of only a sample of smaller establishments in a variety of ways (eg weighting observations
by sampling probabilities, estimating for the population of larger establishments only).
None of these experiments changed the qualitiative pattern of results. For further
discussion of the ARD data, see for example Griﬃth (1999).
    6
      At the plant-level, only information on employment, industry, location and ownership
is reported. 1980 is the first year where both county of location and employment are
available for plants.

and unskilled by non-production and production workers respectively. A
key advantage of our methodology is that it explicitly controls for unob-
served region-industry variation in the quality and composition of these
worker categories.
    We construct industry-region measures of total payments to each type of
worker as well as total employment. To abstract from high frequency time-
series fluctuations, we average the annual data over three-year time periods.
Finally, we exclude all industries classified as ‘other manufacturing’ since
these are explicitly heterogeneous categories and may include diﬀerent sub-
industries in diﬀerent regions. This leaves 185 industries in the sample.

2.4.   Baseline Relative Wage Bill Estimates
    We begin by estimating quality-adjusted relative wage diﬀerences across
U.K. regions using the relative wage bill specification in equation (5). In
our baseline results, we choose the U.K. as a whole as the base region,
excluding the own region from the definition of the U.K. as a whole.
    Table 2 presents estimation results for Administrative Regions during
the six three-year time periods from 1976 to 1993. We observe a consistent
pattern of results over time. There is typically one rejection above zero at
conventional levels of statistical significance (the South-East of England)
and four rejections below zero (Yorkshire and Humberside, Northern, Wales
and Scotland). An exception is 1988-90, a period of recession, when the
two Midlands regions and the North-West also reject below zero.7
    Figure 2 displays the evolution of the estimated coeﬃcients on the re-
gional dummies over time. Three aspects of the results stand out. First,
the gap between the relative skilled wage bill in the South-East and the
U.K. as a whole grows steadily larger over time. Second, the negative im-
pact of the 1988-90 recession on the Midlands regions and the North-West
is again apparent. Finally, the relative skilled wage bill in the Northern
Region (the North East) falls gradually relative to the U.K. as a whole from
the late 1970s to mid-1980s.
    As discussed above, for plausible values of the elasticity of substitution
between skilled and unskilled workers, a positive estimated coeﬃcient on
   7
    This suggests that unskilled worker wages fell relative to the UK in these regions
during the recession.
          Relative Wage Variation and Industry Location                    9


the regional dummies corresponds to a relative wage of skilled workers lower
than in the base region. Thus, the quality-adjusted relative wage of skilled
workers in the South-East has fallen over time, while the relative wage of
skilled workers in the Northern region rose from the late 1970s to mid-1980s.
    Table 3 summarizes estimation results for counties, where we again
observe a systematic pattern across time periods. Positive and statisti-
cally significant coeﬃcients on the regional dummies are concentrated in
the South East, with some evidence of this low relative skilled wage cone
spreading out over time, as Wiltshire joins the South-Eastern counties from
1985 to 1987 onwards. Negative and statistically significant coeﬃcients on
the regional dummies are disproportionately concentrated outside of the
South East in the North and West of the United Kingdom (in the North-
ern, Scotland and Wales Administrative Regions). Figure 3 shows the
geographic pattern of estimated coeﬃcients for the initial period.
    Equation (5) may also be estimated using a particular region, rather
than the U.K. as a whole, as the base region s. Table 4 summarizes the
results of estimating equation (5) when all regions are used as the base
region. Approximately 50% of bilateral Administrative Region pairs reject
the equalization of relative factor prices at the 10% level, while 25% of
bilateral county pairs reject at this level of statistical significance.
    The rejection of relative factor price equalization is not driven by the
South East alone - across all time periods in Table 4, each Administrative
Region rejects with an average of six other regions and a minimum of two.
Table 5 examines the number of bilateral rejections by base region, where
we again observe a systematic pattern across time periods, with the South
East and Northern regions producing the highest number of rejections.
    The results in this section show that skill premia are lower in the part
of the U.K. that is relatively well-endowed with skilled workers, i.e. the
South East. This finding is consistent with a multi-cone Heckscher-Ohlin
view of the U.K. Our results are hard to reconcile with multiple factor
models from the new economic geography literature which would predict
higher relative wages for skilled workers in skill-abundant areas. We turn
now to the predictions of the model on the relationship between industrial
structure and relative wages.

2.5.   Relative Wages and Production Structure
    Having estimated significant diﬀerences in relative wages diﬀerences
across regions, we now examine whether this variation is systematically
related to production structure by regressing:

                     Zrs = β 0 + β 1 |α̂sr | + β 2 Ir + β 3 Is + urs               (6)

where Zrs is a measure of the similarity in industrial structure of regions r
and s, discussed further below; α̂sr are the estimated bilateral relative wage
bill diﬀerences from equation (5); and urs is a stochastic error.8 We include
as controls the total number of industries produced by region r and s, Ir
and Is , to capture the idea that, other things equal, two regions which each
produce in a large number of industries are likely to have more industries
in common.

2.6.   Bilateral Wage Bill Diﬀerences and Production Overlap
    Table 6 investigates whether the magnitude of the estimated diﬀer-
ences in relative wage bills (capturing diﬀerences in quality-adjusted rela-
tive wages) is systematically related to industrial structure in line with the
predictions of general equilibrium trade theory. In view of the small num-
ber of Administrative Regions, we concentrate on the estimation results
using counties.
    Equation (6) is estimated using two alternative measures of regions’
similarity in terms of industrial structure. The first is a measure of in-
dustry overlap that is based on the number of industries that are present
in both regions. By looking at whether or not an industry exists at all
within each region, we focus on the theoretically consistent idea of complete
specialization. This measure, Irs , is a count of the number of industries
common to both region r and region s. In the notation of equation (6),
Zrs = Irs . Similarity of industrial structure across regions is increasing in
this measure.
    The second measure of industrial similarity exploits information not
just on whether an industry exists in each region but also on its level of
economic activity. This measure is widely used in the empirical geography
   8
    The econometric estimates so far have only exploited information on industries that
exist in both regions r and s.

literature (see, in particular, Krugman 1991), and is the sum of the absolute
diﬀerences in industry ³  shares of manufacturing
                                      ´           employment in the two re-
                  P        Lrj    Lsj
gions, so Zrs = j abs Lr − Ls . The industry share measure takes the
value zero if regions r and s have exactly the same industrial structure and
attains a maximum value of 2 when the regions’ employment structures are
such that they have no industries at all in common. Similarity of industrial
structure across regions is decreasing in this measure. In calculating both
measures of industrial similarity we make use of the population data from
the ARD from 1980 to 1993, again taking averages over three year periods,
(two years for the initial period).
    We pool the cross-sections of industrial similarity measures and esti-
mated relative wage bill diﬀerences over time, including a full set of time
dummies to control for macroeconomic shocks and abstract from secular
trends in the two variables. Columns (1) and (3) of Table 6 present our
baseline estimates of equation (6) for the two measures of industrial simi-
larity.
    Using industry overlap as the dependent variable, we find a negative
and statistically significant coeﬃcient on the estimated relative wage bill
diﬀerences. This result is consistent with the hypothesis that regions with
bigger diﬀerences in relative wages for skilled and unskilled workers share
fewer industries. Using the industry share measure, we obtain a positive
and statistically significant coeﬃcient, again as predicted by the theory.
Region pairs with greater diﬀerences in relative wages are indeed less similar
in terms of industrial structure.
    In Columns (2) and (4) we include region-pair dummies so that the
relationship between industrial similarity and relative wages is identified
solely from the time-series variation in the data. Again as predicted by
the theory, we find that regions that experienced diverging relative wages
became less similar in terms of industrial structure.
    This section has provided strong evidence in favor of the hypothesis
that regional industrial structure in the United Kingdom is consistent with
a multiple cone general equilibrium trade model. Relative wages are signif-
icantly diﬀerent across regions, with lower relative skilled wages in regions
with more skilled workers. In addition, regions with disparate relative
wages have disparate industrial structures, with fewer industries in com-
mon and less similar industry shares. In the next section, we consider
             Relative Wage Variation and Industry Location                       12


whether industries have responded to these diﬀerences in terms of their
geographic location and use of factors.

3.       Changing Industrial Structure and Initial Wage Diﬀerences

3.1.      Between and Within Industry Responses
    The results from the previous section suggest that regional relative wage
diﬀerences have persisted, i.e. that they have not been unwound by labor
migration or industrial relocation. In this section, we ask whether indus-
tries have responded to the observed relative wage diﬀerences over long
horizons.9 Other things equal, we would expect regions with lower initial
relative wages of skilled workers to experience greater increases in the share
of skill-intensive industries in employment as firms choose to match their
factor needs with advantageous relative factor prices. This hypothesis re-
lates to between-industry changes in employment shares over time, which
we examine with the following empirical specification:
                     µ N¶                            µ N¶
                      L                     UK        L
               ∆0,T           = δ 0 + δ 1 α̂r0 + δ 2        + ωr           (7)
                       L r                             L r0
where ∆ is the diﬀerence operator; T is the length of period over which the
diﬀerence is taken; LN denotes employment in skill-intensive industries, de-
fined as those with an average wage bill of non-production workers relative
to production workers in the top one third of the distribution; L denotes
employment; and α̂U   K
                    r0 are the initial period estimates of relative wage bill
diﬀerences with the U.K. as a whole taken as the base region.
    The initial share of employment in skill-intensive industries is included
as a control in the regression to allow for mean reversion and convergence
eﬀects. Since a positive estimated value of the coeﬃcient α̂U  K
                                                             r0 corresponds
to a relative wage of skilled workers in region r lower than in the U.K. as
a whole, theory leads us to expect a positive and statistically significant
value of δ 1 .
    Besides changes in the composition of industries, we might also expect
changes in the factor usage within industries across regions. Firms lo-
cated in regions with lower relative wages of skilled workers may increase
     9
    We recognize that sunk costs of relocation may prevent firms and industries from
adjusting in the short run so we use the longest horizon available in our data.

the intensity with which they use skilled workers by more than the same
industry located in regions where skilled wages are relatively high. This
hypothesis relates to within-industry changes in skill-intensity over time,
which we examine using the following regression:
                      Ã              !
                         wagebillNrj
                 ∆0,T                  = η j + λ1 α̂U K
                                                    r0 + ν rj           (8)
                         wagebillPrj

where η j is an industry fixed eﬀect and α̂U  K
                                            r0 are again the initial period
estimates of relative wage bill diﬀerences with the U.K. as a whole taken
as the base region. Since a positive estimated value of the coeﬃcient α̂U  r0
                                                                              K

corresponds to a lower relative wage of skilled workers in region r, theory
also leads us to expect a positive and statistically significant value of λ1 .

3.2.   Empirical Results
    First, we examine changes in industrial structure between skill-scarce
and skill-intensive industries. Estimates of equation (7) are reported in
Table 7 where we include the initial employment share of skill-intensive
industries to control for mean reversion and convergence eﬀects. As pre-
dicted by theory, we find a positive and significant relationship. Counties
with the lowest initial relative wages of skilled workers (the highest esti-
mated diﬀerence in relative wage bills) experience the greatest increases in
the share of skill-intensive industries in employment after controlling for
the share of skill-intensive industries in the initial period.
    Second, we examine whether within industries, we observe factor inten-
sity systematically responding to variation in the relative wage of skilled
workers. Table 8 reports the results of estimating equation (8), regress-
ing the change in the region-industry relative wage bill of skilled workers
on the initial estimated diﬀerence in relative wage bills. Our preferred
specification in Column (2) includes industry dummies, so that we iden-
tify from within-industry variation across regions. We find that industries
in regions with the lowest initial relative wages of skilled workers experi-
ence the greatest increases in the ratio of the skilled to unskilled wage bill.
These changes can be interpreted as product mix adjustments. In response
to persistent low skill premia, firms may choose to reallocate production
away from labor-intensive goods and towards skill-intensive goods within
          Relative Wage Variation and Industry Location                     14


industries. This disaggregate change parallels the industry reallocation
highlighted in Table 7.
    The results from this section provide additional evidence of the impor-
tance of relative wages in shaping industrial structure across regions within
the U.K.. Initial diﬀerences in relative skilled wages are associated with
subsequent changes in the composition of industries and in their use of in-
puts. Regions with low relative wages for skilled labor see employment
increases in skill-intensive industries and an increased use of skill within
industries.

4.   Conclusions

    We present evidence of a strong relationship between regional produc-
tion structure and relative wages. Using finely detailed industry and region
data, we report statistically significant and economically large relative wage
diﬀerences across regions within the United Kingdom. In accordance with
the predictions of general equilibrium trade theory, we demonstrate that
pairs of regions with larger estimated diﬀerences in relative wages are less
similar in industrial structure.
    We also find that both industry location and industry skill intensity
respond systematically to persistent relative wage diﬀerences over time.
Regions with lower skill premia experienced greater increases in the share
of skill-intensive industries in employment and larger rises in the intensity
with which skilled workers are used within industries. These dynamic
responses suggest firms reallocate production of skill-intensive industries
and products towards regions whose relative factor prices best match their
factor needs.
    Our findings emphasize the way in which industrial structure and rela-
tive wages are jointly and endogenously determined in general equilibrium.
The analysis has a number of implications for the recent policy debate
about regional variation in economic performance within the United King-
dom. One interpretation of our results is that industries move towards
workers more readily than workers move towards industries. As a result,
regional development assistance designed to introduce new, skill-intensive
industries to faltering, skill-scarce regions may be less successful than poli-
cies designed to boost skill-scarce regions’ skilled labor pools. Regional
          Relative Wage Variation and Industry Location                  15


policies intended to promote industry relocation must take into account
how closely industry factor intensities and region endowments match.
    Variation in industrial composition across regions also implies asym-
metric exposure to common external shocks. For example, workers in re-
gions specializing in low-skill industries will be more adversely aﬀected by
declines in the price of unskilled goods on world markets than workers in
regions where these goods are not produced (who simply enjoy a terms of
trade gain). Evidence of asymmetry within the U.K. relates to a broader
debate about the impact of the European Monetary Union and the extent
to which individual regions within a country are more similar than regions
across countries.
