                     ARE JAPANESE STOCK PRICES TOO HIGH?


                                  ABSTRACT


     The difference between reported price-earnings ratios in the United
States and Japan is not as puzzling as it appears at first glance. Nearly
half the disparity is caused by differences in accounting practices with
respect to consolidation of earnings from subsidiaries and depreciation of
fixed assets. If Japanese firms used U.S. accounting rules, we estimate that
the P/E ratio for the Tokyo Stock Exchange would have been 32.1, not the
reported 54.3, at the end of 1988. Accounting differences are unable,
however, to explain the sharp rise in the Japanese stock market during the
mid-1980s. Changes in required returns on equities, or in investor expecta-
tions of future growth for Japanese firms, must be invoked to explain this
phenomenon. Real interest rates declined during the period of rapid price
increase, but there is little evidence that growth expectations became more
optimistic. The real interest rate changes do not, however, appear large
enough to fully account for the change in stock prices.

    Japanese equities trade at a higher earnings multiple than shares in any

other major equity market. At the end of 1989, the price-earnings ratio for

the Nomura Research Institute (NRI) 350, a broad index of Japanese nonfinan-

cial firms, was 53.7. The comparable ratio for the Standard and Poor's

Industrial index of Anerican stocks was 15.0, and the average P/E ratio for

all nations except Japan in the Morgan Stanley-Capital International database

was 13.6.

     The large difference between price-earnings ratios in Japan and other

markets is a recent phenomenon. In the early 1970s, Japanese P/E ratios were

below p/Es in the United States. Between 1973 and 1985, Japanese P/Es were

approximately twice those of the United States. Most of the recent divergence

between the two P/Es occurred in 1986, when the Japanese ratio doubled from

29.4 to 58.6 while the U.S. P/E increased by only 20%, from 15.4 to 18.7.

     The developments of the last decade in the Tokyo stock market have led

many analysts to ask if high Japanese price-earnings ratios are consistent

with much lower P/Es in other nations. Differences could be attributed to

differential accounting practices and tax rules which complicate the interna-

tional comparison of P/Es, or to divergences in required returns or expected

earnings growth. This paper examines the most important differences between

U.S. and Japanese financial accounting practices and tries to "correct"

Japanese P/Es for comparison with U.S. values. We then ask whether the rapid

growth in share values during the 1980s can be traced to fundamentals such as

falling investor discount rates or increased growth expectations.

     This paper is divided into five sections. The first presents a stylized

overview of the U.S. and Japanese equity markets. We report the price-

earnings and dividend-price ratios in both countries, as well as information

on the size of each equity market, the volume of trade, and the composition of

shareownership. The second section relates the rise in Japanese share prices
to the equally dramatic increase in land values. The escalation of Japanese

land prices is simply another manifestation of recently-rising price-earnings

multiples for assets in Japan relative to those elsewhere. Our analysis

focuses on stock market valuation because available data on common stocks are

far better than data on the cash flows from land and other real assets.

     Section three explores the influence of accounting differences on the

disparity between the price-earnings ratios of the two countries. We show

that several factors make Japanese price-earnings ratios systematically higher

than their U.S. counterparts, but none of these factors can account for the

recent increase in Japanese P/E ratios. Section four examines differences in

required after-tax returns and expected growth rates in the two countries. We

first calibrate the changes in discount factors and growth expectations that

would be needed to explain the recent increase in Japanese share values. We

then consider various proxies for actual changes in required returns and

growth expectations. We find that rather extreme assumptions would be needed

to explain the post-1985 increase in Japanese share prices. There is a brief

conclusion.


1. Overvew of Japanese and U.S. Eguity Markets

     The relative importance of the Japanese and U.S. equity markets has

shifted dramatically during the last two decades, the result of rapid growth

in Japanese share prices and depreciation of the dollar. This section

provides background information on these markets.


1.1 Market Size

     The widely cited data from Morgan Stanley-Capital International (MSCI)

Persoectives and other data sources imply that the Japanese equity market was

55% larger than the U.S. market at the end of 1988. However, these data


                                       2
provide a misleading measure of relative market capitalization for two

reasons. First, the U.S. data include only shares listed on the New York

Stock Exchange (NYSE), thereby capturing less than 85% of the market value of

listed U.S. shares.)   A second and more important problem is that the

reported market values are not adjusted for intercorporate share ownership,

which causes double-counting of corporate shares. Because such cross-owner-

ship is much more prevalent in Japan than in the United States, the size of

the Japanese equity market is significantly overstated.2

     An example illustrates the potential difficulty. Consider an economy

with two firms, A and B, each with assets worth $100. If each firm relies

exclusively on equity financing and there is no intercorporate ownership, the

total value of traded equity will be $200. Suppose firm B now issues $50 in

new shares and uses the proceeds to purchase one half of the equity in firm A.

This transaction increases the market value of B to $150 ($100 in physical

assets and $50 in shares of A), without affecting the market value of A.

Although the value of the underlying productive assets remains unchanged at

$200, the intercorporate purchase of stock raises the aarent value of the

market to $250.




 1The market value of equity listed on the NYSE was $2088.7 billion in 1987,
while the value of equity listed on the American Stock Exchange and other
regional exchanges was $68.6 billion. Shares of domestic corporations
(excluding mutual funds) traded in the NASDAQ over-the-counter market were
valued at $325.5 billion [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Statistical
Bulletin (1988) and National Association of Securities Dealers Yearbook
(1988)]. The over-the-counter market is less important in Japan. For
example, in 1986 the volume of shares traded on the First Section of the Tokyo
Stock Exchange was 772 times the volume in the Tokyo OTC market [Japan
Securities Research Institute (1988)].

  2MacDonald (1989) illustrates this point with calculations for a set of
particular .Japanese companies.

                                       3
      The apparent market value overstates the value of the firms' underlying

assets because half of A's assets are included in the equity of both firm A

and firm B. One can eliminate this double-counting and get an accurate

estimate of the underlying asset value by measuring only the value of equity

held outside the corporate sector. In our example, the public holds $50 of A

and $150 of B, so the value of shares held outside the corporate sector is

$200, the value of the underlying assets. More generally, the value of the

equity held outside the corporate sector is

(1)                  VOutside â€”   (ls)*VTotal
where s is the fraction of the stock held by firms and VTotal is the total

value of equity, including corporate crossholdings.

      Table 1 reports data on the aggregate ownership of traded shares in both

the United States and Japan.3 In the United States, individuals hold about

half of the outstanding equity either directly or through mutual funds.

Intercorporate equity holdings account for only one seventh of total equity.

This fraction excludes holdings by defined-benefit pension plans. The assets

of these plans are arguably assets of the shareholders; including them as

corporate cross-holdings would raise the intercorporate ownership to over

twenty percent. Insurance companies, with holdings for both insurance

operations and pension plans, own 23.9% of the market. The remaining equity




 3The weights for the U.S. in Table 2 differ from the equity ownership weights
in the Flow of Funds for two reasons. First, intercorporate shareholdings are
"netted out" of the Flow of Funds, so nonfinancial firms appear with no equity
holdings except a small stake in mutual funds. Following Tn (1971), we use
IRS data on the ratio of dividends paid by U.S. corporations to domestic
dividends received by u.s. corporations to estimate intercorporate holdings.
Second, the Flow of Funds data on equity include stock in closely held
corporations, worth $600 billion in 1987. Since we are concerned with
marketable securities, we exclude this component. We assume that all closely
held corporations are owned directly by individuals in removing this class of
equity from the Flow of Funds aggregates.

                                        4
holdings are diverse, Slightly more than 6% of the equity is held by foreig-

n-

ers and a similar fraction held by state and local government pension funds.

     Corporations of various kinds hold nearly two thirds of the equity in

Japan. These holdings includes nonfinancial corporations (30%), banks (20%),

and insurance companies (17%). Direct individual holdings account for only

one fifth of the market value of the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE). Moreover,

the fraction of the Japanese market held by individuals has declined through

time, from nearly 60% at the beginning of the 1950s to only 20% today.

     Table 2 presents a detailed example of cross-ownership, the case of the

Toyota Motor Company. Toyota owns more than 40% of four other firms on the

TSE First Section, and at least five percent of twenty-two other companies.

Most of these firms supply Toyota with inputs. In turn, several banks own

nearly 30% of Toyota's stock. For many other firms, especially those which,

unlike Toyota, are part of loosely-affiliated corporate groups, the degree of

intercorporate holding is substantially greater.4

     Table 3 presents both unadjusted and corrected measures of stock market

value in the U.S. and Japan. The first two columns report unadjusted data,

drawn from MSCI. Columns three and four report the value of Japanese and U.S.

equity markets adjusted for intercorporate holdings. The adjustments have a

surprising effect: even at the end of 1988, the market value of the outside

equity in the Japanese market was smaller than that in the United States. Our

adjusted values stand in striking contrast to the Morgan Stanley data. The

market values reported by MSCI in December 1988 (1989) imply that the world

equity shares of Japan and the United States are 44% (39.6%) and 29% (30.6%).



 4Hoshi, Kashyap, and Scharfstein (1989) discuss the linkages among firms in
these groups and how it affects their financial behavior.

                                       S
Our adjusted data reverse this ranking: the U.S. accounts for 35.9% of the

world equity portfolio, and Japan for 28.7%, at the end of 1988,   For 1989,

the comparable fractions are 37.7% and 25.0%. These findings suggest that

portfolio allocation rules based on the most widely used measures of market

value, the MSCI indices, significantly overstate the importance of Japanese

relative to U.S. equities.


1.2 Valuation, Trading, and Leverage Trends

     Table 4 presents price-earnings ratios and dividend-price ratios for the

NRI 350 index of nonfinancial Japanese firms and for the S&P Industrial index

of nonfinancial American firms.5 The disparity between Japanese and U.S. P/E

ratios is apparent. Between 1974 and 1984, the Japanese P/E was about twice

the U.S. P/E. During 1986, however, the Japanese P/E ratio doubled from 29.4

to 58.6, while the U.S. ratio increased by 21%, from 15.4 to 18.7. There also

are large differences between the recent Japanese and American dividend/price

ratios. The dividend yields are comparable in 1970, with values of 3.9% in

Japan and 3.3% in the U.S. The U.S. dividend yield exhibits no particular

trend over the 1970-88 period. In contrast, the Japanese dividend yield

declines systematically. The dividend yields at the end of 1988 are 3.0% in




 5We use the NRI 350 because other major indices of the Japanese market have
limitations for our purposes. The aggregate P/E ratio for the First Section
of the TSE includes financial finns, for which accounting issues are more
complex than they are for nonfinancials. The MSCI indices also include
financials. In addition they include consolidated earnings for some firms,
and unconsolidated earnings for others. The average P/E ratio reported in the
Daiwa Analysts Guide is the ratio of the average price and average earnings
based on number of shares outstanding, not value, so it is less representative
of the value-weighted market than the NM measure. The TSE, MSCI, and Daiwa
P/E ratios were 58.3, 52.7, and 82.4 at the end of 1987. The comparable ratio
for the NM 350 was 50.4. while some measures of aggregate Japanese P/Es were
affected when the Nippon Telephone and Telegraph Company went public in 1987
with a price/earnings ratio of 285, this firm is not included in the NRI 350
index.

                                      6
the U.S. and 0.6% in Japan.

     Turnover rates, measured as the value of shares traded as a fraction of

market capitalization, are similar on the NYSE and the TSE. Turnover rates

for 1986-88 are .672, .806, and .687 in Tokyo and .624, .852, and .582 in New

York. (See the 1988 TSE Fact Book and the 1988 NYSE Fact Book.) Thus, in two

of the last three years of our sample, the turnover rate is higher in Tokyo

than in New York.

     Foreigners were net sellers of Japanese stocks during the period of most

rapid price appreciation. Foreign equity ownership of U.S. stocks increased

during both the 1970s and the 1980s, from 3.7% of the market in 1970 to 7.2%

in 1988. Foreign holdings of Japanese stock also increased between the mid-

1970s and the early l980s, growing from less than 2.7% in 1978 to 8.8% in

1984. Since then, foreigners have been net sellers of Japanese equities. By

1988 foreign holdings of Japanese equities (4.8%) were only 55% of their

previous peak value. This may reflect the perception outside Japan that

Japanese equities have been overpriced throughout the mid-l980s. This

sentiment may also be reflected in the heavy    trading   activity in recently-

introduced put options on the Japanese market ]Norris (1990)], which doubled

in value during their first few weeks of trading despite relatively small

changes in the value of the underlying index.

     Some have argued that the large stock returns and high P/E ratios in

Japan are the result of high debt-equity ratios. This explanation is incon-

sistent with the debt-equity ratios reported in Table 4. These ratios are

book debt divided by the market value of equity. In Japan, where most debt is

short-term, the differential between market and book values for debt is small.

The divergence could be larger for the United States. The American debt-

equity ratios exhibit no particular trend, varying between .48 (1972) and 1.04


                                        7
(1974). In contrast, Japanese debt-equity ratios decline during the sample

period, from 1.63 in 1970 and 2.23 in 1972, to .36 in 1988. Jhile Japanese

debt-equity ratios are substantially higher than their U.S. counterparts

during the 1970s, they are significantly below U.S. debt-equity ratios during

the critical 1986-88 period.


2. Javanese Share Prices and Land Values

     Although the price-earnings ratio for Japanese shares exceeds that for

equities traded on other markets, several recent studies [Daiwa (1989),

Hayashi and Inoue (1990), Hoshi and Kayshap (1990), and Japan Securities

Research Institute (1989)] have reported that Tobin's (1969) "q", the ratio of

the market value of Japanese firms to the replacement cost of their assets, is

less than or equal to unity. The recent increase in Japanese equity values

coincides with a rapid increase in Japanese land prices. Table S presents

data on the composition of physical assets for U.S. and Japanese nonfinancial

corporations at the end of 1984 and the end of 1987. Land accounts for more

than half of the tangible assets of Japanese firms, compared with just over

twelve percent for U.S. corporations. Moreover, the value of Japanese

corporate land holdings nearly doubled between 1984 and 1987, and prices have

increased further since then.

     The observation that land prices have risen in tandem with stock prices

does not explain why assets trade at higher multiples of their earnings in

Japan than in other places, or why this multiple increased during the mid-

1980s. Recent data on office space rents and land prices in major metropoli-

tan areas display the pattern of high price-earnings multiples that one

observes in the Japanese stock market. For example, although the price of

residential land in Tokyo is 150 times that in New York City, the monthly rent



                                       8
on new commercial office space in Tokyo is only four times that in New York

[Boone and Sachs (1989)]. Rationalizing these patterns requires either

differences in discount rates, or investor expectations that at some future

date rents in Tokyo will rise substantially relative to those in New York.

     The time series movements of value-rent ratios and price-earnings ratios

are similar. Although land prices have increased significantly in the last

few years, rents have not. As with equities, the recent changes in land

prices are more difficult to explain than the high level of prices. Ito

(1988) identifies several reasons why land prices in Japan should be high

relative to those in other nations: the tax system places very low burdens on

land, especially in agricultural uses; higher population density makes the

marginal product of land higher than that in many other developed nations; and

the archaic system of land use precludes space-efficient development of high-

rise office buildings and similar structures. None of these factors, however,

seems to have changed during the last decade.

     Rather than analyze land values, where data on cash flows and rentals are

difficult to obtain, we focus on the valuation of equities. A successful

explanation for high P/E ratios is also likely to explain the rapid growth in

land prices and the current high price-rental ratio.


3. U.s. and JaDanese Accountina Differences and PIE Ratios

     Many explanations of the difference between Japanese and American price-

earnings ratios focus on differences between Japanese and American accounting

conventions. Even if accounting considerations can explain the historical

difference between U.S. and Japanese PIE ratios, two factors make them

unlikely to explain the dramatic growth of this difference during recent

years. First, recent changes in Generally Accepted Accounting Practices



                                       9
(CAAP) in Japan have reduced che accounting disparities between Japanese and

American firms [Aron (1981, 1988)]. Second, as Figure 1 shows, the growth in

the Japanese P/E ratio from 29.4 in 1985 to 54.3 in 1988 was dominated by

rising stock prices, rather than by falling earnings. The real price per

share tracks the price-earnings ratio reasonably well: it was roughly constant

from 1970 to 1980, grew gradually during the next five years, and increased

more rapidly in the last three years, with capital gains of 44% in 1986, 9% in

1987, and 41% in 1988. in contrast, real earnings per share were roughly

constant over the 1970-88 period. A 28% decline in earnings per share in 1986

contributed to doubling the PIE ratio during that year, but the PIE remained

above 50.0 in 1987 and 1988 despite annual earnings growth of 26% and 30%.

     Even if differences in accounting conventions cannot explain the recent

divergence between Japanese and American PiE ratios, they may explain the

smaller historical disparity in these ratios. Three accounting practices are

particularly important: (i) differences in reporting consolidated versus

parent-company earnings; (ii) differences in "reserve accounts" that permit

Japanese firms to deduct significant amounts from reported earnings as advance

funding for future expenses; and (iii) differences in depreciation practices.

This section discusses each of these differences in turn, and concludes with a

brief analysis of the divergence between accounting and economic profits in

Japan and the United States.


3.1 Consolidation and Intercorporate Ownership

     Consolidated earnings, which include the net income of subsidiaries and

of firms in which the parent holds more than 20% of the outstanding equity,

are the dominant measure of earnings in the United States. In contrast,

unconsolidated earnings are the dominant measure in Japan. Unconsolidated



                                      10
earnings are the basis for most Japanese market analyses, and they are used in

the denominator of most common Japanese PIE ratios -   - including   the NRI index

reported here. Since unconsolidated earnings reflect the dividends received

from subsidiaries but not their undistributed profits, this leads to a

systematic upward bias in PIE ratios for Japan relative to those in the U.S.

For Toyota Motor Company, the cross-holding example presented    in Table 2, the

firm's consolidated earnings exceed its unconsolidated (parent) earnings by an

average of 32% per year during the 1986-ES period.

     These differential practices can be viewed in two ways. One holds that

Japanese earnings are under-reported because they fail to include the un-

distributed earnings of subsidiaries. This perspective leads to a correction

based on the ratio of consolidated to unconsolidated earnings, as in Aron

(1988). The principal drawback of this strategy is that Japanese firms have

substantial discretion regarding their consolidated earnings reports, so some

earnings may escape consolidation.6

     A second approach to this problem, in the spirit of our    earlier adjust-

                                                                          ratios
ment for double-counting of equity holdings, estimates price-earning

under the assumption of no cross-holding. Variants of this approach are used

by Ando and Auerbach (1990) and Ueda (1990). The premise of this approach is

 that parent (unconsolidated) earnings are overstated by intercorporate

 dividend receipts, but prices are overstated by even more because they

 capitalize future intercorporate dividends as well as undistributed earnings




  6Since 1984, Japanese GAAP has required firms to report a measure of con-
 solidated income that includes the earnings of subsidiaries in which the
 parent owns more than 20% of the outstanding equity.   Subsidiaries in which
 the parent holds a smaller stake, as well as those which sum to less than 10%
 of consolidated net income, sales, or assets, may still be excluded.   Although
                                                                  used in most
 firms report consolidated earnings, parent company earnings are
 Japanese P/S calculations.

ment factor ws .669.             The cross-holding adjustment therefore reduces the

reported P/E        ratio    from 54.3    to   36.3. The impact of cross-holdings on the P/E

each calendar year. The S6IP              ratio
                                    divides earnings for each calendar year by
year-end prices. For the NRI 350, the Nomura Research Institute forecasts
vhat earnings will, be in the current fiscal year, which typically .nds in
March, and divides these forecasts by December prices. This biases the
Japanese P/E ratio downward relative to the U.S. ratio when earnings are
rising.

ratio grows through time. This largely reflects an increase in the degree of

cross-holding during the last decade.


3.2 Accounting for Special Reserves

      The Japanese tax code allows firms to set aside funds each year in

reserves against future contingencies including product returns, repairs,

payments on guarantees, losses due to doubtful accounts, and payment of

retirement benefits. Japanese workers retire when they are roughly sixty

years old, and their employer typically provides a large one-time retirement

payment. This payment can equal several times the employee's annual salary.

Japanese tax law permits firms to create a reserve equal to 40% of the amount

workers would receive if the firm were liquidated, and all workers retired, at

the close of the fiscal year.

      Japanese accounting practices require conformity between tax returns and

financial statements. Thus, when Japanese firms use special reserves to

reduce their taxable income, they reduce their accounting earnings as well.

The net effect of contributing before-tax income to these reserves is a

reduction in reported earnings relative to what they would be in the U.S.

      Aron (1988) suggests a procedure for undoing the effect of reserve

contributions on reported earnings. He calculates the net contribution firms

made to reserve accounts and notes that without such contributions, after-tax

earnings would increase

(3)         Eadi -   Ereport
                               â€” (1   -
                                          f)*(Net   Reserve Contribution),

where    is the corporate tax rate. Shoven and Tachibanaki (1987) and Aron

(1988) estimate the combined marginal tax rate from national corporate income

tax, enterprise tax, and local inhabitants tax at between 50 and 55%. We use

a value of r â€” .52 for 1988, with lower levels in earlier periods correspond-



                                               13
ing to lower statutory rates on corporate income. We use Arons estimate that

reserve contributions average approximately four percent of net income for

large Japanese firms over the entire 1975-88 period. The resulting adjustment

factor, shown in the fourth column of Table 6, has a small effect on the

reported price-earnings ratio.


3.3 Depreciation Accounting

     The last major difference between the accounting practices of U.S. and

Japanese firms concerns depreciation. In the U.S., the possibility of using

one set of accounting rules for tax purposes and another for financial

reporting leads most firms -- 75% according to Schieneman's (1986) citation of

the tuserican Institute of Certified Public Accountants -   - to   choose accelerat-

ed depreciation for the former and straight-line depreciation for the latter.

This reduces current taxable income relative to reported earnings.

     Japanese firms, which must use the same depreciation policy for tax and

financial reporting purposes, typically choose tax minimization over the

maximization of reported earnings. Virtually all fins use double-declining

balance depreciation. Since the typical Japanese fin depreciates its assets

more quickly than the typical American firm, Japanese depreciation charges are

higher when assets are relatively new and lower when they are old. Since most

Japanese firms are growing rapidly, they will have a preponderance of young

assets with depreciation deductions in excess of those of comparable U.S.

firms. Reported earnings will therefore be lower for Japanese fins.

     Several studies, including Aron (1988), have tried to correct reported

earnings for different depreciation rules by assuming that the ratio of

depreciation to cash earnings should be identical for U.S. and Japanese firms.

Since different depreciation rates are not the only reason for differences in



                                       14
the amount of depreciation claimed by U.S. and Japanese firms, however, this

assumption is likely to correct more than just accounting practices. For

example, Japanese firms are more capital-intensive than U.S. firms, so this

adjustment is likely to overstate the true earnings of Japanese firms.

     Exact comparison of the depreciation claims of U.S. and Japanese firms

would require detailed information on the asset mix and investment history of

firms in both nations, information which is not readily available. We

therefore employ two alternative procedures for generating comparable depreci-

ation claims for U.S. and Japanese firms. The first provides an upper bound

on the possible differences between firms in the two countries, while the

second is a more reasonable estimate of the depreciation-induced earnings

differential.

     Our upper bound procedure, which we label Method I, computes the straight

line depreciation which Japanese firms would have reported if all their assets

had been placed in service during the last year. Under the Japanese tax code,

the annual double-declining balance (DDE) depreciation rate is given by

                                 6â€”1- 11/L
where L is the asset life in years.8 This rate is approximately equal to

2/L. For example, if L is eight, the 0DB depreciation rate is 25%; if L is

20, 8 is 10.9%. By comparison, the annual straight-line depreciation is l/L

times the original depreciable value. If an asset's estimated salvage value

is zero, the initial depreciable basis is the same for accelerated and

straight-line depreciation. Thus, the DDE depreciation is approximately twice



 81f this depreciation rate were used over the life of the asset, the depreci-
ated value would be ten percent of the original value after L years. However,
since the double-declining balance rate is applied to the asset's current book
value, at some point the annual deduction from straight-line depreciation on
the asset's remaining book value will exceed the DDE deduction. The firm may
switch to straight-line depreciation at that time.

                                      15
the straight-line depreciation when an asset is first placed in service. Our

upper bound estimate of excess depreciation is therefore half of the reported

DDE depreciation charge, D/2.     If   this    adjustment were correct, then during

periods when accounting depreciation was below tax depreciation, there would

be an increase in the deferred tax account of r*(D/2). The resulting Method I

adjustment to earnings is therefore an increase of (l.r)*D/2. This adjustment

is about the same magnitude as Aron's (1988) adjustment using the ratio of

depreciation to cash flow.

     To estimate the importance of the depreciation correction we use the

parent-company accounting reports in the Diawa Analysts Guide, which presents

information on the financial accounts and balance sheets for virtually all

nonfinancial firms listed on the First Section of the TSE. For these firms,

the ratio of (Ereport +    (1- .52)*D/2)/Ereport is 1.52 in 1987. Earnings would
therefore be 52% higher under this extreme assumption about the size of the

depreciation adjustment. We use this ratio to correct each year's earnings

for the NRI 350.     The resulting adjusted P/E ratio is shown      in   column   six   of

Table 6. For example, in 1988 the Japanese P/E declines from 36.3 after the

cross-holding correction to 232, still well above the U.S. P/E ratio.

     The foregoing method of converting accelerated to straight-line deprecia-

tion is appropriate if all Japanese assets were placed in service during the

previous year. Under more realistic assumptions, however, this estimate

overstates the actual difference between DDB and straight-line depreciation

because it ignores the fact that, while the depreciable basis for the straight

line calculation remains constant, the basis for the DDB calculation declines

as the asset ages.

     Our second method of estimating the depreciation-induced understatement

of income, Method II, attempts a more sophisticated correction for the


                                              16
difference in depreciable basis between double-declining balance and straight-

line depreciation. We assume that firms have homogeneous assets with identi-

cal economic depreciation rates (6), and that their time path of investment is

described by exponential growth at rate g, which we estimate from the ten-year

growth rate of nominal business investment in the national income accounts.

For such firms, the current DDB depreciation charge per dollar of current

investment is 26 5' g526s ds â€” 261(26 + g). We estimate 6 as one-half

the ratio of current depreciation charges to the value of depreciable assets,

since for Japanese firms using double declining balance methods the instan-

taneous depreciation rate will be approximately twice the economic rate. We

then define L'(8) as the tax lifetime associated with an asset depreciating at

rate 6. We assume L' is the age at which one-half of the asset will be         eroded

[L'(6) â€”   (ln   2)16]. If depreciation consists of random failures, this

assumption implies that half of all assets live beyond their stated lifetimes.

Using L'(6) we then compute the depreciation per dollar of current        investment

under the straight-line assumption; this is f e5 ds/L' â€” (1
                                                                      -




Our correction factor for the under-reporting of depreciation is therefore

given by (lr)*[l - (1        -
                                 egL')*(26+g)/26gL].
     We present the ratio of reported earnings to adjusted earnings in the

seventh column     of   Table 6.   The results suggest more modest changes than those

 implied by the earlier depreciation correction. The earnings adjustment

factor (the ratio of reported to adjusted earnings) is now greater than .90 in

each of the years we examine. This adjustment procedure, which is more

plausible than simply halving the depreciation charges, yields adjusted P/E

 ratios of more than thirty for the last three years.

      The price-to-cash-earnings (P/CE) ratios reported by MSCI provide

 additional perspective on the impact of the different depreciation methods


                                             17
used by U.S. and Japanese firms. Since cash earnings are defined as the sum

of reported earnings plus depreciation, they are unaffected by a company's

choice of depreciation method. The U.S. P/CE ratio (not reported) exhibits no

particular trend during 1973-88 and equals 6.5 at the end of 1988. Similarly,

the Japanese price-to-cash-earnings ratio follows no particular pattern

between 1973 and 1982, varying between 5.0 (1974) and 7.7 (1976). It grows

systematically, however, during the last six years of the sample. The ratio

is 9.0 in 1985, 14.4 in 1986, 14.7 in 1987, and 17.2 in 19S8. Like the

adjusted price-earnings ratios in Table 6, recent Japanese price-to-cash-

earnings ratios are unusually high.


3.4 Adjusted American PIE Ratios

     The adjustments for depreciation and reserves described above attempt to

make reported earnings of Japanese firms comparable to those of U.S. firms.

The adjustment for intercorporate holdings, however, converts Japanese

earnings to a base case with no intercorporate ownership. Thus, we must also

adjust the P/E ratio of the S&P Industrials to remove the effects of U.S.

intercorporate holdings. The last two co1unns of Table 6 present the unad-

justed S&P P/E ratio and the adjusted series using the procedure we applied to

the Japanese data. Since intercorporate holdings in the U.S. are smaller than

those in Japan. the adjusted P/E ratio (11.7 in 1988) is much closer to the

unadjusted value (12.9).

     Although accounting adjustments reduce the differences between Japanese

and American P/E ratios, they do not eliminate them, particularly during the

critical 1986-88 period. For example, the adjustedU.S. PIE ratio is 11.7 at

the end of 1988. The comparable estimates for Japan are 23.2 using deprecia-

tion-adjustment Method 1 and 32.1 using Method 2.   Moreover, both of the



                                      18
adjusted ratios almost double during 1986. Accounting-based hypotheses can

explain much of the difference between U.S.    and Japanese P/Es before 1986,   but

they cannot explain the doubling of Japanese ratios in 1986 nor the high

levels since then.


3.5 Accounting versus Economic Earnings

     The foregoing discussion focused on the comparability of accountin

earnings in the U.S. and Japan. Accounting earnings may not reflect the true

economic earnings that underlie firm value. Deviations between economic and

accounting profits cause reported price-earnings ratios in different nations

to diverge, and changes through time in this deviation could lead to divergent

movements in P/E ratios across nations.

     Inflation is the principal source of differences between accounting and

economic earnings. First, because depreciation is calculated using the

historical cost of physical assets, true depreciation costs are understated

and profits are overstated in high inflation periods.      Second, the failure to

distinguish between the real and nominal cost of debt understates earnings

during periods of high inflation. Although the economic cost of borrowing is

measured by the real interest rate, reported earnings reflect nominal interest

charges. The higher debt-equity ratios of Japanese than U.S. firms during

much of our sample period makes this overstatement more important for Japanese

than for U.S. earnings. Third, inflation induces spurious profits for goods

held in inventory or for assets which are sold. Nominal appreciation of

inventories is recorded as a profit, even though the firm receives no real

gains. Similar problems arise if the firm sells appreciated assets, since

accounting profits will show the nominal rather than the real capital gain.




                                          19
     Ando and Auerbach (1988) study the differences between accounting and

economic earnings in Japan and the United States due to the distortions

described above. For the high-inflation period 1967-83, the average reported

earnings/price ratio for their sample of Japanese firms was .065, while that

for their U.S. sample was .094. After correcting earnings for inflation-

induced errors, they find a "corrected" E/P ratio of .092 in Japan and .085 in

the United States. Because of differences in leverage between U.S. and

Japanese firms and differences in depreciation rates, inflation ed to

overstatement of U.S. earnings but understatement of economic earnings for

Japanese firms.

     Inflation during the   decades   before 1985 caused Japanese P/E ratios to be

higher than they would have been if accountants measured economic earnings,

and had the opposite effect in the United States. While this may further

explain the historical disparity in the level of P/E ratios across countries,

it makes it more difficult to explain the changes since 1985. The slowing of

inflation, which reduced the disparity between accounting and economic

earnings, should have reduced measured Japanese P/E ratios and raised their

U.S. counterparts. This effect is strengthened by the fact that Japanese

inflation rates declined faster than U.S. inflation rates during the period

after 1984. Rather than explaining recent events, the disparity between

economic and accounting earnings therefore magnifies the P/E puzzle.



4. Recuired Returns and Exmected Growth: Jaman and the U.S.

     The apparent inability of accounting factors to explain why adjusted

Japanese price-earnings ratios are high in relation to historical values and

in relation to current U.S. P/Es leads us to consider two alternative explana-

tions. First, growth opportunities in Japan may account for a larger fraction


                                          20
of firm value than they did in the past and than they do in the U.S. Second,

the required return on equity in Japan may be low relative to its historical

value and relative to the current U.S. rate. This section examines these

explanations for the Japanese stock market boom of the mid-1980's.


4.1 Growth and Required Returns in Infinite and Finite-Horizon Models

      Miller and Modigliani (1961), in their classic paper on share valuation,

offer a convenient framework for considering the effect of expected growth and

required returns on price-earnings ratios. In their model, the discount rate

r is constant and firms can invest a fraction k of each period's earnings in

projects that have a perpetual supernormal return of r*. If the firms pay Out

their remaining earnings as dividends, earnings grow at the rate g â€”     kr*   while

the supernormal investment opportunities are available.

      Under the extreme assumption that the supernormal opportunities are

available forever, Miller and Modigliani show that the value of the price-

earnings ratio is given by

(4)             P/E â€”   (l-k)P/D   â€”   (lk)/(r.kr*)   â€”   (1-k)/(r-g).
with the more realistic assumption that the perpetual supernormal investment

opportunities are only available for the next T years, they approximate the

price-earnings ratio as

(5)             P/E â€”   [1 + kT(r* -    r)}/r â€”   [1 + T(g -   kr)]/r.
      In Table 7 we use these relations, along with the 1985 and 1986 adjusted

P/E ratios, to estimate the implied growth rate g for various required returns

r. Under the extreme assumption that Japanese firms will always be able to

invest their retained earnings in supernormal investment opportunities

(infinite T), the estimated value of r-g in the first panel of Table 7 falls

from 2.25% in 1985 to 1.37% in 1986. This implied change, coupled with the



                                            21
large increase in Japanese asset values and P/Es that occurred over this

period, illustrates the non-linearity of equation (6). When the P/E ratio is

large, the implied value of r-g is small and subject to large percentage

changes with relatively small absolute changes. Thus, if we are willing to

assume that supernormal investment opportunities will always be available in

Japan, the doubling of P/Es in 1986 can be explained by a less than one

percentage point decline in the required return or by a similar increase in

the (parpetual) growth rate.

     The results for ten and twenty-five years of supernormal growth oppor-

tunities illustrate that the foregoing calculations are sensitive to the

assumption that new opportunities are available forever. Using a long-term

growth forecast of about 4.5% per year (which is comparable to the reported

expectations of Japanese growth for 1985 discussed below) and a horizon of 10

years, the estimates in the lower panel of Table 7 imply that the required

return on Japanese equity was about six percent at the end of 1985. If the

required return remained at six percent, the doubling of the adjusted P/E

ratio from 1985 to 1986 implies a ten percentage point increase in the

expected annual growth rate, to 14.48% per year for the next ten years.

Alternatively, one can hold the expected growth rate fixed at 4.5%. In this

case, equation (5) implies that the required return in Japan fell from about

six percent in 1985 to 3.55% in 1986.

     If the supernormal growth opportunities in Japan were expected to persist

for twenty-five years, the implied changes i.n r and g from 1985 to 1986 are

smaller, but they are still substantial. For example, if the expected growth

rate is assumed to be 4.5% in both 1985 and 1986, the implied required return

falls from 6.5% to 4.5%. This decline is more than twice the change implied

by the perpetual growth model.


                                        22
     With the assusiption that supernormal profits are not available forever,

the doubling of Japanese P/Es in 1986 requires a substantial reduction in

required returns, a substantial reduction in expected growth rates, or both.

Neither growth expectations nor required returns can be measured explicitly,

but in the next two subsections we provide some suggestive evidence on the

movements in these variables during the mid-1980s.


4.2 Evidence on Changing Growth Expectations

     Long-term growth forecasts made by econometric forecasting firms provide

some guidance regarding investors' growth expectations. Table 8 presents

long-term forecasts of growth made by Data Resources, Inc., a major U.S.

forecasting firm. Although these forecasts are for real GNF, not corporate

earnings, they provide evidence on the pattern of growth expectations during

the 1980s. There is a small decline in the ten-year forecasts for the U.S.

between 1984 (2.9%) and 1988 (2.3%). The ten-year growth rates forecast for

Japan are surprisingly constant, varying between 4.3% in 1985 and 3.9% in

1988. DRI's five-year forecasts for Japan display somewhat greater volatil-

ity, declining from 4.0% in 1985 to 3.3% in 1987, and then rising to 3.9% in

1988. Five-year forecasts from the Japan Center for Economic Research (4.6%

in 1985, 3.0% in 1986, 3.8% in 1987, and 3.2% in 1988) also suggest that

growth expectations in Japan declined from 1985 to 1986.

     These growth forecasts do not support the view that accelerating growth

expectations in Japan are responsible for the 1986 rise in share values. If

anything, the expected growth rate for the next decade declined. Jhile some

might argue that equity values depend on growth forecasts over periods longer

than a decade, revisions in longer-term growth prospects are not likely to

explain the observed price changes. As the horizon grows, forecasts of



                                      23
significantly more rapid growth in one economy than in another become less

reliable and less plausible. Recent empirical findings [see Barro (1989)]

suggest that national growth rates exhibit mean reversion. It is also

difficult to imagine the type of news which investors could have received

which would affect growth prospects more than a decade into the future without

changing near-term growth forecasts. Thus, there is little reason to believe

that changes in expected growth can explain the recent increase in Japanese

stock prices.


4.3 Required Returns

     The framework presented above demonstrates that P/E ratios depend on both

required equity returns and expected growth rates, Unfortunately, measuring

required returns is even more difficult than calibrating growth expectations.

Ex ante expected returns are not observable, and neither the risk premium on

equities nor the required return on riskiess assets can be estimated precisely

from historical data on asset returns (see Merton (1980)].

     Before considering the recent changes in some proxies for required

returns, it is useful to consider the theoretical issue of whether differences

between required returns in the U.S. and Japanese equity markets are consis-

tent with capital market equilibrium. Given the increasing integration of

world financial markets, required returns in each market are linked to those

in other markets. The linkage between U.S. and Japanese financial markets has

grown significantly during the last decade. Prior to 1980, and to a lesser

extent between 1980 and 1986, Japanese investors faced capital controls which

limited their ability to invest in other markets. Since 1986, however,

explicit barriers to capital mobility into and Out of Japan have been minimal.

Recent studies [see Ito (1990) for a survey] suggest that short-term riskiess



                                      24
interest rates in Japan are now determined by world market conditions. Whether

markets for long-term assets such as corporate equities are equally well

integrated remains an open issue.

     Required equity returns in the U.S. and Japan could differ for at least

three reasons. First, investors may expect systematic long-term changes in

real exchange rates. Frankel (1989) presents evidence of "country effects" in

real interest rates, and argues that these are the result of expected currency

  venents. From this perspective, real interest rates and required equity

returns which are lower in Japan than in the U.S. would be Consistent with

expectations that, after adjusting for inflation, the yen will appreciate

against the dollar.

     There is little evidence, however, that investors expected real yen

appreciation in the late 1980g. There are two   competing   interpretations of

the behavior of real exchange rates. One view, supported by evidence in

Rogalski and Vjnso (1977), Roll (1979), and Adler and Lehmann (1983), says

that real exchange rates are essentially random walks. The alternative view,

which is supported by evidence in Frankel (1989) and Cutler, Poterba, and

Summers (1990), says that real exchange rates are mean reverting. Neither

view would have predicted the yen to appreciate in the 1986-88 period.

     A second possibility is that perceived risks associated with cross-border

equity investments allow substantial disparities between expected returns in

different markets. Despite large cross-border capital flows during the l980s,

most corporate equity is still held in the country of issue [see French and

Poterba (1990)). In 1988, foreign investors held only 6.5% of the U.S. stock

market and 4.3% of the Japanese market. The cross-border equity flows to date

may therefore be insufficient to equate expected returns. This argument is




                                      25
consistent with frequent claims that Japan's high saving rate has reduced

required returns on Japanese assets relative to similar assets in the U.S.

     Third, taxation could lead to differences in required returns demanded by

U.S. and Japanese investors. If capital markets are not perfectly integrated,

differences in local tax rates can cause differences in the pretax returns

demanded by investors in each market. In addition, some investors face

different tax burdens on foreign and domestic securities which make them

imperfect substitutes. For example, U.S. pension funds cannoc reclaim the 2O

dividend   withholding tax which Japan levies on dividend payments to foreign

investors. Similar problems may affect some Japanese investors since the U.S.

also requires 20% withholding on dividends remitted abroad.

     The foregoing considerations make it impossible to determine on a priori

grounds whether there are differences between the expected returns on long-

term assets in Japanese and U.S. capital markets.    1.Je therefore consider the

available empirical evidence on long-term real interest rates in the two

nations in an effort to evaluate required returns on riskless assets: we do

not attempt to measure the equity risk premium.

     Nominal interest rates in both Japan and the United States declined sig-

nificantly between 1985 and 1988. Table 8 reports the nominal rates on both

U.S. and Japanese ten-year government bonds during 1980-88. Japanese long-

term rates declined by 150 basis points from 1985 to 1988, a factor which is

often cited [for example by Takagi (1989)] as influential in the rise in

equity and land prices. However, the significant increase in Japanese prices

and price/earnings ratios (or price/rent ratios) during this period must be

explained by changes in real, not nominal interest rates.

     Macroeconomic forecasts of long-term Japanese inflation rates suggest

that real interest rates also declined in the mid-l980s. The sixth and


                                        26
seventh columns of Table 8 report estimates of real yields calculated by

subtracting Data Resources' long-term forecast of annual inflation from the

contemporaneous nominal yield on government bonds. These estimates suggest

that the real Japanese interest rate declined from 4.1% in 1985 to 2.9% i

1986. Similar estimates based on the five-year inflation forecast of the

Japan Center for Economic Research suggest a real interest rate of 4.4% in

1985 and 3.1% in 1986, a decline of about 125 basis points during the year

when P/E ratios doubled.

     There is an even larger decline in real interest rates in the U.S. DRI's

ten-year inflation forecasts imply that the real yield on U.S. government

bonds fell from 4.4% in 1985 to 2.6% in 1986, a drop of 280 basis points.

The real interest rates in Table 8 also show that, prior to the removal of

capital controls in the mid-l980s, estimated real long-term interest rates in

Japan were more than 150 basis points lower than those in the U.S.

     The substantial changes in crude measures of required returns on long-

term riskiess assets suggest that required returns on corporate equities also

declined, both in Japan and the United States, during the 1985-86 period. The

key questions are whether the decline in required returns is consistent with a

much smaller increase in U.S. than Japanese prices and P/E ratios given the

substantially larger decline in the U.S. rate, and whether the decline in

required returns in Japan is large enough to explain the Japanese P/E rise.

     Several factors might explain why U.S. prices and price/earnings ratios

increased less than their Japanese counterparts. First, the relation linking

prices to required returns and expected growth rates is not linear. Since the

U.S. P/Es began at a lower level, the same absolute change in required returns

should have a larger effect in Japan than in the U.S.




                                      27
       Second, the rise in U.S. PIE ratios may have been blunted by tax changes

in 1986. These changes lowered marginal tax rates on interest and dividend

income for top-bracket individual investors from 70% to 28%. Part of the

reduction in the tax burden on dividends, however, was offset by an increase

in capital gains tax rates. For individual investors the net effect of the

tax changes should have been a substitution toward debt and away from equity.

       In contrast, for an important class of Japanese investors, tax changes

dr.ng the    id-l9SOs   reduced   after-tax   returns on debt relative to those   on

common stock. Before     1987, Japanese individual investors were able to avoid

taxation on interest through a system of Maruyu        accounts.   Each individual

could receive tax-exempt interest on up to 14 million yen in assets, or

roughly $112,000 ($448,000 for a family of four). These limits did not affect

the many households who evaded taxation by establishing multiple accounts [see

Nagano (1988)), and by the mid-l980's, nearly 70% of Japan's personal savings

were exempt from taxation [Japan Securities Research Institute (1988)].

       The Maruyu system was largely eliminated by the 1987 Japanese tax reform.

Prime Minister Nakasone appointed an Advisory Tax Commission in September

1985. In April 1986 the commission made an interim report suggesting aboli-

tion   of Maruyu accounts, and legislation was introduced to the Japanese
parliament   in early 1987 and passed in September. Since the abolition of

these accounts for most investors on April         1, 1988, households face a 20% tax
on all interest income. These Japanese tax changes should have induced a

substitution from debt to equity among some Japanese investors, possibly

raising stock prices.9




 9These tax changes did not affect the institutional shareholders who con-
stitute a significant part of Japanese equity holdings.

                                              28
     Although these factors might explain why Japanese stock prices and P/Es

increased by more than their U.S. counterparts, movements in required returns

seem unable to explain why Japanese P/Es doubled in 1986. The behavior of

long-term government bonds yields suggests that real riskless rates fell by

about 1.25 percentage points during 1985-86. We are unaware of any evidence

to suggest that equity risk premiums also fell during this period. In the

Miller-Modigliani growth model, if supernormal investment opportunities were

expected to persist for 25 years and earnings were expected to grow by 45%

per year, a 1.25% decline in the required return implies that the adjusted P/E

should have increased from 18.2 in 1985 to 27.7 in 1986. This implied value

is much lower than our actual adjusted estimate of 35.7 for 1986.

     The behavior of Japanese real interest rates in early 1990 also suggests

that movements in required returns were not the only factor driving up

Japanese stock prices and price/earnings ratios in 1985-86. Real interest

rates increased by approximately 1.0% in January 1990. If the argument that

movements of this magnitude were central in pushing up share prices is

correct, prices should have fallen more sharply in the 1990 episode than they

have at this writing.


S. Conclusions

     The dramatic difference between reported price-earnings ratios in the

United States and Japan is not as puzzling as it appears at first glance.

Roughly half of the discrepancy is caused by differences in the accounting

practices of the two countries. If Japanese firms used U.S. accounting

practices, we estimate that the P/E ratio for the Tokyo Stock Exchange would

have dropped from its reported value of 54.3 to 32.1 at the end of 1988.

Accounting differences explain much of the persistent disparity between U.S.



                                      29
and Japanese price-earnings ratios, but they appear unable to explain the

doubling of Japanese P/E ratios in 1986, from 29.4 to 58.6.

     Because Japanese stocks traded at high earnings multiples prior to the

recent run-up, relatively small changes in either discount rates or growth

expectations could lead to large changes in prices. We find no evidence of

upward revisions in expected growth rates for the Japanese economy during this

period. There is evidence of a substantial drop in required riskiess returns

betan 1985 and 1966. but the decline appears to be too small to expa.n P/E

movements as large as the actual changes.

Notes: The U.S. long-term growth forecasts are from the winter issues of Data
Resources, Inc.'s Lone Term Review. For example, the 1980 forecast is from the
winter 1980-81 issue. Japanese growth forecasts are from various issues of the
Data Resources/Nikkei Jaoanese Review. Nominal yields are for the Nikkei
Long-Term Government Bond Index and the Moody's 10-year Government Bond Index.
The "real" yields are calculated by subtracting DRI's long-term inflation
forecast from the contemporaneous nominal yield.
