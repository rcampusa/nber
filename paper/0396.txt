                                  ABSTRACT




      The authors beam with the hypothesis that parental contacts
play a major role in finding jobs for youth. This hypothesis is
tested with a iixlel of youth tploynent that includes characteristics
of other family manbers in addition to a large set of control
variables. Particular attention is paid to parental characteristics
that right indicate a parent's ability to assist the youth in
finding a job, including occupation, industry and education. The
effects of such variables are aenerally not siqnificant and do not
support the    initial hyoothesis. Hcver, the     'p1oynnt probability
of a youth is significantly affected by the presence of rp1oyed
siblings, indicating the presence of sate intrafarnily effects.

I. Introduction

        Youth unemployment can be decomposed into two principal compo-

nents. One of these arises from the high turnover of young people.

As Baily and Tobin have written: "Much teenage unemployment, it is

often observed, comes from dissatisfaction with the available job

options, a gap between expectations or aspirations and the realities

of low wages and poor working conditions. One consequence is high

turnover. Even when jobs are available, therefore, unemployment is
        ,l
high.

        The second component arises from the shortage of jobs. As Clark

and Summers point out, "The substantial cyclic response to changes

in aggregate demand suggests that a shortage of job opportunities

characterizes the youth labor market."2 This second component is,

of course, larger during recessions. The data used in this study,

described in the next section, refer to 1975 and the early part of

1976, when unemployment was still quite high. The unemployment rate

for the whole civilian labor force was above 7 percent throughout this

period and rates for young workers (16 to 19 years old) were above

18 percent. The component representing demand deficiency at current

wage rates, rather than turnover, must therefore have been sub-

stantial.

     The existence of demand deficiency unemployment of youth has

an implication that we seek to test: If there is a shortage of jobs

for young workers at prevailing wages, then there must be one or

more nonprice rationing mechanisms that determine which young people

get the available jobs. Our special hypothesis is that the family

of the young person furnishes such a mechanism; those young people

get jobs whose parents or siblings have jobs, particularly jobs in

which they can influence hiring decisions. Some support for this

view can be found in earlier studies of the labor—force participation

of young people. Bowen and Finegan, who found that after controlling

for other forces the labor—force participation of married women falls

with husband's income, were surprised to find that the adjusted

labor—force participation rate of males 14 to 17 in school in urban

areas in 1960 rose through the range of other family income between

$4,000 and $11,000. In seeking to explain this, they wrote "We suspect

that art of the explanation turns on the comparative advantage that

youngsters in these families have in finding part—time jobs. For one

thing, their parents are more frequently able to help, mainly as a

result of their business and social contacts."3 Robert Lerman found

significant effects of parent's occupation on the employment of youth,

using dummy variables for broad occupational categories. In particular,

he found that having a parent who is a white collar worker, either

salaried or self—employed, or a farm manager significzlAtly increases

 the probability of employment relative to having one who is a low—level

'blue collar worker.4

     It should be noted that giving assistance in finding work is

clearly not the only way in which family members can influence the

employment prospects of young people. Much education takes place in

the home so that youths who have well—educated parents and who have

been exposed to books and to serious discussion while growing up may

have advantages in finding and holding jobs over other youths with

the same axunt of formal schooling. Moreover, fanilles have expecta-

tions about how their members should behave. Young people whose

families expect them to go to work for whatever reason (cultural,

religious, or economic) are more likely to be employed than young

people whose families do not have this expectation. We shall refer

to such expectations as a work ethic.

     It follows that a variety of variables measuring different aspects

of the family and its members might have some discernable effect

on estimates of employment probabilities. In addition to family income,

these could include education, occupation, and location.   (The work

ethic might be stronger in some regions or areas than in others).

     We set out to test the hypothesis that parental contacts assist

youth In finding jobs. Our results show no significant effects of

parental characteristics on youth employment. We do, however, find

significant effects of the employment status of siblings, which Indicates

the presence of some sort of intrafamily interactions.

 II. The Data Set


      The results presented in this paper are from the cross—sectional

 data set called the "Survey of Income and Education", collected in

 the spring of 1976 (April through July). The full sample is a national

 stratified probability sample of households in which 151,000 house-

 holds were interviewed. This makes the sample roughly three times

 the size of the Current Population Survey. The interview includes

 most of the information available from CPS interviews, plus a good

 deal of additional detail on sources of 1975 income and on education.

     We have analyzed data for men and women aged 17 to 20 living in

nonf arm households where they are the children of the head. This ex-

cludes those young people who have moved out of their parents' house-

hold to live by themselves or establish their own families. The group

that was 17 to 20 in 1976 was 16 to 19 in 1975, and one of our depen-

dent variables measures work experience in 1975. Using the ages 17

to 20 in 1976 rather than 16 to 19 also gives us a less unequal division

of the sample between those in school and those not in school.

     'The distinction made here between those in school and those not

in school is based on whether or not the person had attended school

since February, 1976. The alternative of using major activity in the

survey reference week Is only viable for those observations collected

in April and May, since many June and July observations were collected

during school vacations.

     The regressions presented in the next section are based on a data

file we have created that merges observations on the young person with

observations on household Income and individual data on other members

of the household 16 years of age and older. This individual data includes

sex, age ,scholing status, employment status and relationship to the
                                                                         —5


young person. Additional data is used on the head of household

(one of the youth's parents), including industry, occupation and

years of education. These, it was felt, could help to measure the

likelihood of the parent having contacts that would help the youth

get a job.

III. Regression Results

     We have been persuaded by the work of Clark and Summers, among

others, that for young people the distinction between being unemployed

and being out of the labor force is not always meaningful, since the

boundary between these states is so blurred. Accordingly, we use

several measures of employment as our dependent variables. The two

measures shown here are:   (a) estimated total hours worked last year

(the product of weeks worked and usual hours per week) and (b) a

dichotomous variable taking the value of one if the teenager was

employed in the survey reference week. We also used weeks worked last

year and a dichotomous variable indicating unemployment in the survey

reference week as dependent variables, but the results are not presented

here. The regressions using weeks worked give similar results to

those using total hours worked but the fits are not quite as good.

The regressions using unemployment fit very poorly for in school youth.

For out of school youth all significant coefficients in the employment

regression have the opposite sign in the unemployment regression,

though the fit is again poor.

     Each model was estimated separately for males and females in and

out of school. We chose to treat the decision to attend school as

given, rather than as jointly endogenous with the decision to work, in

order to simplify estimation. The means for many variables differ

substantially across the subsets, especially for the dependent variables.
                                                                         —6



The differences are most striking between in and out of school youth,

with out of school youth showing stronger ties to the labor force:

over one—third more employment and unemployment and twice as many hours

worked last year as in school youth. The coefficnts obtained in the

separate estimations are also quite different for in and out of school

youth, ruling out any attempt to capture the effects of school attendance

with a dummy variable. The split between male and female shows less

conclusive differences, although the effects of some of the control

variables (notably marriage ) do vary substantially between groups.

     Table 1 gives the means and standard deviations of all variables

for each of the four subsets used. Table 2 shows our estimates of the

determinants of estimated hours worked last year. We used a tobit

technique to allow for the presence of people did not work in 1975

and hence have zero hours observed. Table 3 shows the corresponding

estimates of the determinants of employment in the reference week,

using a probit technique to allow for the dichotomous nature of the

dependent variable. Tables 2A and 3A simply involve rescaling the tobit

and probit coefficients to correspond to ordinary least squares co-

efficients for easier interpretation.

     In general, we get significant effects (at the 5 percent level)

for variables measuring schooling, race, being in a female—headed

household, and being in a poverty area. We also estimate significant

effects for the employment status of siblings, but generally not for

the employment status of the head.

Schooling

     Since we are dealing with people whose schooling has often not

been completed, we measure years of school completed relative to the

mean for all people of the same   age   in the main SIE sample. The variable
                                                                   —7


"Education gap 1" measures the number of years above the overall

mean for those who are above. "Education gap 2" measures the

number of years below the overall mean for those below. Having less

education than the average of one's age group lowers employment signi-

ficantly In all eight regressions.

     The three negative signs on "Education gap 1" in Table 2 seem

to be an anomaly arising because those people with more education than

their age group had a greater than average probability of being in

school last year. In Table 3, where the schooling status and dependent

variables both refer to the same year, the signs on "Education gap 1"

are all positive.

Income

     A second set of variables explored measures family Income. The

one used here, other family income, is the income of the household in

1975 minus the earnings of the young person whose behavior is being

measured. This has no significant effect on employment in the reference

week. For those in school its effect on total hours worked last year

is mixed, while it is significnatly positive for those who are not in

school.In earlier work we used a number of additional variables

indicating whether the household received income in 1975 from various

kinds of transfer payments. At some stages of our work, a few of these

variables showed significant negative effects on some measures of youth

employment. However, they did not remain significant in the presence

of the other variables included in the final model.

Geographical variables

    A third set of variables deals with various geographic aspects of

the labor market. The data set places observations in one of nine

regions of the country. We have included a set of eight regional dummy

variables in all regressions as control variables, and there are always
                                                                     —8


some significnat differences in youth employment by region. Variables

indicating whether or not the household lived in an SMSA or in the

central city of an SMSA were not significant. The final model includes

a dummy variable taking the value of one if the household lives in an

area designated by the Census Bureau as a poverty area. In our sample

12 to 13 percent of youth in school and 17 to 18 percent of youth not

in school lived in such areas. This variable has an effect that is

consistently negative and usually clearly significant. For youths in

school of both sexes, living in a poverty area reduces the probability

of employment by 10 percent, other things equal. Since other family

income and race appear in the regressions, this should probably be

interpreted as measuring the availability of job opportunities in the

locality.5

       We also tried using a variable measuring the total unemployment

rate in the SMSA for SMSA's that could be identified in the data set.

The unemployment rate was taken from a published external source

(Department of Labor estimates for May,l976) and merged into the data

set. Only about one—third of our observations were in areas for which

we could use this information. The variable did not have a significant

effect even in regressions confined to observations for which the

variable could be used. We might have gotten better results by generating

unemployment rates by area for spring 1976 from our own data set.

However, this would have required processing data on all households;

we have used only households including youth.
Race

       We have used two variables to identify youth by race, dummy

variables identifying blacks and Hispanics. Both are consistently


5An alternative explanation for this result lies in environmental
 characteristics common to poverty areas other than lack of jobs,
 such as low quality education and limited motivation.
                                                                      —9


  negative and usually significant with the effect of being black

  being generally substantially larger than that of being Hispanic.

  For regressions whose dependent variable is "employed last week",

  being black lowers the probability of employment by 17 to 25 percent

 even after controlling for schooling, other family income, and

 location in a poverty area. For youth not in school, in Table 2,

 negative coefficients on the variable identifying blacks are about

 one—half the size of the mean of the dependent variable. With other

 measured variables equal, we estimate that black youth not in school

 worked half as many hours in 1975 as white youth. We also duplicated

 our analysis with regressions run using only observations on blacks.

 The results (not reported here) tend to be similar, with less con-

 sistency of coefficients between subsamples and lower significance

 levels, probably due to the large reduction in sample size.

     We have tried using a variable measuring whether or not the

principal language spoken in the household is English; this is less

successful than the variable identifying Hispanics.

Family influences

     When we started our research, we expected to find powerful

influences of the position of t1head of the household on the employ-

ment status of youth living at home. The effects we find are much

weaker than we expected. Living in a household with a female head

has a negative effect in seven of eight regressions, and a significant

one in four. Living in a household with a self—employed male head

generally has a positive effect, but this is significant only once

at the 5 percent level and twice at the 10 percent level for employment

and hours worked last year. The effect on unemployment is consistently

negative and generally significant.
                                                            —10


      Sets of dummy variables identifying male heads who were not

employed and the major industry or occupation of the employed male

heads performed very poorly. So did an index of three—digit occupa-

tions scaled by median income in the occupation in 1969. Education

of the male head was tried and entered with a negative sign ——   that
is, it acted like an index of permanent income rather than a measure

of access to jobs.

     Our second set of variables measuring family effects identifies

the employment status of siblings between the ages of 16 and 24 who

are in the household, using a set of eight dummy variables. Within

this large set, there are four subsets, for older brother, older

sister, younger brother, and younger sister.6 In each of these subsets,

there are two dummy variables, e.g. "older brother not employed" and

"older brother employed;" the base or omitted variable of the subset

is "no older brother living at home." If the person to whom the in-

dependent variable refers has more than one sibling between the ages

of 16 and 24 living at home, there may be entries of 1 rather than 0

in more than one of these dummy categories. For a person with two

older brothers, for example, one employed and one not employed, both

dummies in the older brother subset take the value 1.

     Employment decisions within the household are presumably made

simultaneously, and our single equation model does not permit us to

analyze the simultaneity. If we have an observation on a youth named

John who is employed and he has an older brother named Fred who is also

employed, we detect the associations, but we cannot tell whether John

found Fred a job, Fred found John a job, or both were subject to

some common parental or environmental influence that increased the


      scheme of classifying siblings by sex and birth—order was suggested
 by the work of Claudia Goldin on the employment of youth in Philadelphia
 in 1880.
                                                                         —11


 probability of their being employed. It should also be noted that if

 both of them are between 17 and 20, observations for both will appear

 somewhere In our regressions with many (though not all) of the independent

 variables being identical. However, the scheme should permit us to

 separate the effects of job contacts 'and the family's work ethic from

 Income effects by examining the signs of the coefficients.    The income

 effect of Fred's working on the probability that John will work is

 presumably negative.
        As   shown in Tables 2 ar 3, the positive association of   auploy-
ment   status anong siblings is very strong. For males in school, having
an atploy&1 sibling significantly increases the dependent variable
in seven of eight cases in the two tab1es.tavin a siblin8 not employed
 significantly decreases the dependent variable in all eight cases.
 For fen1es and males not in school the effects are not always signi-
 ficant, though the signs are alirost always the same. Sane of the
 effects for females are also quite large. For
                                                   example, other measured
variables held constant, having a younger brother employed increases
the chances of a female in school being employed by 15 percent, or
increases her estimated hours worked last year by '87 relative to a
mean of 400.
     The differences in coefficients for siblings of different sexes
may support the interpretation that the sibling variables reflect
information networks in the labor market, rather than local job
availability or parental influenoe. Because many occupations or
industries still employ workers predominantly of one sex, a youth may
be better able to help a sibling of the same sex find work. The dif-
ferences in coefficients may also arise from stronger derronstration
effects or closer personal relationships between siblings of the same
sex.
       The pattern of differences in coefficients Is clearest
                                                              for
Youth not in rhnn1 fr. P1-. ')     _-
 sister employed increases estimaled hours last year by 173 hours,        —12

 but the effect of a younger brother employed is only 21. For a

 male, having a younger brother employed increases estimated hours

 last year by 178, but the effect of a younger sister employed is

 only 80. In both cases the larger figure is clearly significant

 at the 5 percent level and the smaller is not.

        One further refinement of the sibling dummies was used, splitting

 each dummy into two dummies for the sibling being in and out of school.

 Besides giving an unwieldy number of coefficients to interpret,

 the expanded set of dummies showed few differences in coefficients

 based on school status. Thus we chose to use only those sibling

 dummies presented here in the final model.

        As rcientjoned above, these results can only be viewed as suggestive

because the family's work ethic is not distinguishable from its job

contacts. One possible area for future research would involve comparing

the detailed occupation and industry of each youth with those of his

parents or siblings. A high correlation could indicate the presence of

helpful contacts made by relatives on the job. Another approach could

be to examine some other data sets to check for consistency of the basic

results and to add further explanatory variables, such as the presence

of reading materials during childhood, that could capture more of the

unobserved part of family background. In this regard one could consult

data sets that ask how the respondent found his job (or why he in

particular was hired after applying).

       One final alternate approach requires a different estimation technique,

presented by Gray Chamberlain.7 This would use analysis of covariance,

with each set of siblings representing a different group for comparing

the within—group to the between—group variation. Some complications

result from the different numbers of observations across groups and the

need to use non—linear estimation, but it would allow one to control for

unobserved family characteristics.

     Any of these approaches would shed more light on what role, if

any, a family plays in the employment of its youth.
