The Micro and Macro of Disappearing Routine Jobs: A Flows Approach

                                              ABSTRACT

The U.S. labor market has become increasingly polarized since the 1980s, with the share of employment
in middle-wage occupations shrinking over time. This job polarization process has been associated
with the disappearance of per capita employment in occupations focused on routine tasks. We use
matched individual-level data from the CPS to study labor market flows into and out of routine occupations
and determine how this disappearance has played out at the “micro” and “macro” levels. At the macro
level, we determine which changes in transition rates account for the disappearance of routine employment
since the 1980s. We find that changes in three transition rate categories are of primary importance:
(i) that from unemployment to employment in routine occupations, (ii) that from labor force non-participation
to routine employment, and (iii) that from routine employment to non-participation. At the micro level,
we study how these transition rates have changed since job polarization, and the extent to which these
changes are accounted for by changes in demographic composition or changes in the behavior of individuals
with particular demographic characteristics. We find that the preponderance of changes is due to the
propensity of individuals to make such transitions, and relatively little due to demographics. Moreover,
we find that changes in the transition propensities of the young are of primary importance in accounting
for the fall in routine employment.

1     Introduction
During recent decades, labor markets in the United States and other developed countries have become
increasingly polarized: the share of employment in middle-wage jobs has declined, while employment
in both high- and low-wage jobs has increased. This “hollowing out” of the middle of the wage
distribution has been linked to the declining share of employment in occupations with a high content
of routine tasks – those activities that can be performed by following a well-defined set of procedures
(see, for instance, Autor et al. (2006), Goos and Manning (2007), Goos et al. (2009) and Acemoglu
and Autor (2011)). In fact, not only has the share of employment in routine jobs fallen over time, but
so has the level of per capita employment in such occupations.1
   In spite of the growing literature on polarization, relatively little is known regarding the process
by which routine occupations have declined, both in terms of how this employment is disappearing,
and who the disappearance is affecting at the microeconomic level. In this paper, we use matched
individual-level data from the monthly Current Population Survey (CPS) to analyze transitions into
and out of employment in routine occupations. At the aggregate or “macro” level, we determine which
changes in transition rates, and at which points in time, account for the disappearance of routine
employment since the 1980s. At the “micro” level, we study how these key transition rates have
changed, and the extent to which these are accounted for by changes in demographic composition or
in the behavior of individuals with particular demographic characteristics.
    Characterizing the process by which routine employment is disappearing serves as an important
guide in formalizing and evaluating theories of job polarization. It is equally important to the un-
derstanding of the changing labor market opportunities faced by different demographic groups, and
in assessing policy implications. For example, the appropriate policy response would potentially be
different if the decline of routine occupations is accounted for by changes in the occupational choices
of labor market entrants than if it is due to increasing exit rates out of the labor force of prime-aged
workers from routine employment.
    In Section 2 we describe how we use data from the matched CPS to construct nationally repre-
sentative flows into and out of routine employment at a monthly frequency from 1976 to 2012. Our
approach involves classifying sampled individuals in each month according to their labor market status
(employed, unemployed, or not in the labor force) and their current or most recent occupational group
(non-routine cognitive, routine cognitive, routine manual or non-routine manual, discussed in detail
below), and tracking their transitions over time.
    We first investigate which changes in transition rates are key in accounting for the decline of
per capita routine employment. We perform a series of counterfactual experiments in Section 3 to
determine how much of the fall would have been prevented if particular transition rates had remained
at the levels observed prior to the onset of polarization.2
    These results indicate that the bulk of the disappearance of routine employment is accounted for
   1 Autor et al. (2003) and the subsequent literature discuss how technological progress has substituted for labor in

routine tasks. See also Firpo et al. (2011), Goos et al. (2010), and the references therein regarding the role of outsourcing
and offshoring in job polarization.
   2 Our counterfactual analysis is similar in spirit to the literature analyzing the role of job finding rates and job

separation rates in accounting for unemployment volatility over the business cycle (e.g. Hall (2006), Shimer (2012)
and Elsby et al. (2009)). The main difference is that we analyze long-run changes in employment levels, distinguishing
between employment in different occupational groups.



                                                             1
by three changes. The first is a fall in transition rates from unemployment to employment in routine
occupations. This includes falls in both “return” job finding rates—for the unemployed with most
recent employment in a routine job—and “switching” job finding rates—for the unemployed with
most recent employment in a non-routine job. The second important change is a fall in transition
rates from labor force non-participation to routine employment. The third is a rise in transition rates
from routine employment to non-participation. Changes in the finding rates into routine employment
(the first and second factors) are important in accounting for the decline both leading into the Great
Recession and, especially, thereafter. Changes in the separation rate from routine employment to
non-participation are important prior to 2007. Together, changes in these three sets of transition rates
account for nearly two-thirds of the long-run decline in routine employment.
   Our second contribution involves a detailed, micro-level analysis of the key changes in transition
rates across the pre- and post-job polarization eras. We ask whether the observed changes can be
attributed to changes in the demographic composition of individuals in the relevant labor market states,
or to changes in the transition propensities of individuals with given demographic characteristics. Our
analysis in Section 4 involves the estimation of standard Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions in order to
isolate these two effects.
    The results indicate that the changes are primarily accounted for by changes in transition propen-
sities, rather than changes in composition. Conditional on demographic characteristics, we observe
falls in the propensity to transition into routine manual employment from both unemployment and
non-participation. In addition, there has been a rise in the propensity to transition out of routine
manual employment to non-participation. These propensity changes have been particularly acute for
males, the young, and those with low levels of education.
   For routine cognitive occupations, we observe similar changes in propensities: falls in the propensity
to transition into employment from unemployment and non-participation, and rises in the propensity
to transition out of employment to non-participation, conditional on demographic characteristics. The
fall in the propensity to transition from unemployment to routine cognitive employment is particularly
strong for whites, females, the prime-aged, and those with higher levels of education. The rise in the
propensity to transition to non-participation from routine cognitive employment is strongest for men
and the young.
   Finally, we revisit our counterfactual exercises in greater detail in Section 5. The changes in key
transition rates identified in Section 3 are driven by demographic change and changes in propensities.
Our final contribution is to disentangle the relative importance of these channels in the aggregate. We
find that change in the demographic composition of the U.S. population can account for at most 30% of
the total long-run decline in per capita routine manual employment, and less than 10% of the decline
in per capita routine cognitive employment. By contrast, we find that changes in the propensity
to transition from unemployment and non-participation into routine employment and, to a lesser
extent, from routine employment to non-participation are primarily responsible for the disappearance
of routine jobs. In particular, changes in the transition propensities of the young are of greatest
importance.
   As stated above, very little attention has been paid to the labor market dynamics underlying the




                                                   2
phenomenon of job polarization.3 Two recent papers are related to our analysis. Foote and Ryan
(2014) analyze worker flows in the context of polarization, distinguishing between routine workers
employed in different industries. The goal of their paper differs from ours in that they are interested
in understanding the cyclical properties of these flows rather than their relationship with the long-
term decline in routine employment per capita. Meanwhile, Smith (2013) describes the evolution over
time of a number of transition rates into and out of routine employment and performs steady-state
counterfactuals to analyze the importance of different transition rates in accounting for the decline of
routine employment. Our analysis differs from his in a number of ways. First, our regression analysis
and Oaxaca-Blinder decompositions allow us to determine not only the extent of transition rate change
over time, but also how this change is decomposed into demographic change and propensity change, as
well as which demographic groups have experienced the largest changes in transition rates. Second, we
distinguish between routine manual and routine cognitive occupations which, as we discuss below, are
very heterogeneous in terms of their demographic composition and their evolution over time. Third,
while Smith (2013) focuses on transitions between unemployment and employment, we specifically
analyze transitions into and out of the labor force, which we find to be key in accounting for the
decline in routine employment. Fourth, by using data from the 1970s, we are able to analyze how
transition rates have change relative to their levels prior to the onset of job polarization. Finally, our
detailed counterfactuals allow us to disentangle the role of demographic change and propensity change
in accounting for the decline of routine employment.


2     Data
We use matched monthly data from the Current Population Survey (CPS), the main source of labor
market statistics in the United States. The data spans the period from January 1976 until December
2012. We restrict the sample to individuals aged 16 to 75. We make use of the fact that the CPS is a
rotating sample: households included in the survey are sampled for four consecutive months, then leave
the sample for eight months before returning for another four months. Given this sampling structure,
up to 75% of households are potentially matched across consecutive months. In practice, the fraction
of households matched is lower (around 70% on average), primarily due to the fact that the CPS
is an address-based survey, and therefore households that move to a new address are not followed.
Also, in certain months the CPS made changes to household identifiers, making it impossible to match
individuals across these modifications.4 Details regarding the algorithm used to match individuals
across months can be found in Nekarda (2009).
    The main advantage of the CPS is its large sample size, and that it is designed to be representative
of the entire US population at each point in time. A second advantage is its high frequency, allowing
for the observation of individual-level transitions across labor market states at a monthly frequency.
A final, and important, advantage is its time coverage, spanning periods both prior to the onset of job
polarization and afterward (as we discuss further below).5
   3 Evidence based on changes at the local labor market level, rather than on individual-level worker flows, is provided

by Autor and Dorn (2009) and Autor et al. (2013). Cortes (2014) uses panel data to analyze the occupational mobility
patterns of workers switching out of routine jobs.
   4 This occurs in January 1978, July 1985, October 1985, January 1994, June 1995 and September 1995.
   5 By contrast, while the Panel Study of Income Dynamics tracks individuals over a longer time period, its sample size




                                                           3
    In using the CPS, the main challenge is the major survey redesign implemented in 1994, inducing
certain data discontinuities. In addition to this, the occupation coding system used in the survey has
changed approximately every ten years, which provides additional minor challenges. We discuss each
of these issues in more detail below. The remainder of this section describes how we use the CPS
data to classify individuals according to their labor force status and occupation, and how we construct
transition rates across different labor market states. These data are then used to analyze the proximate
causes for the disappearance of routine employment.


2.1     Labor Force and Occupation Categories
We use the information in the CPS to categorize all individuals in the sample according to their
labor force status—employed, unemployed, or not in the labor force—and their current or most recent
occupation. The CPS records employed workers’ description of their current occupation in their main
job, and also unemployed workers’ description of their occupation in their most recent job (if they have
ever worked before). The individual’s description is then assigned a 3-digit occupation code.6 While
the CPS records occupational data for employed and unemployed workers, this is not the case for those
who are classified as being out of the labor force.7 We are therefore constrained in our analysis to
consider only one labor force non-participation category that does not distinguish based on previous
occupation.
    Following the recent literature (e.g., Acemoglu and Autor (2011), Autor and Dorn (2013), Cortes
(2014), Jaimovich and Siu (2012)), we consider four broad occupational groups; we do this by delineat-
ing occupations along two dimensions of the characteristics of tasks performed on the job: “cognitive”
versus “manual,” and “routine” versus “non-routine.” The distinction between cognitive and manual
occupations is straightforward, characterized by differences in the extent of mental versus physical
activity. The distinction between routine and non-routine jobs is based on the work of Autor et al.
(2003). If the tasks involved can be summarized as a set of specific activities accomplished by fol-
lowing well-defined instructions and procedures, the occupation is considered routine. If instead the
job involves a variety of tasks, requiring flexibility, problem-solving, or human interaction skills, the
occupation is non-routine. As such, the four occupational groupings are: non-routine cognitive, routine
cognitive, routine manual and non-routine manual.
    To illustrate the nature of these groupings, using the 2010 Standard Occupational Classification
and Coding Structure’s “high-level aggregation,” non-routine cognitive occupations are Management,
Business, Science, and Arts Occupations; routine cognitive are Sales and Office Occupations; routine
manual are Construction and Maintenance Occupations, and Production, Transportation, and Material
Moving Occupations; and non-routine manual are Service Occupations.8 The occupation codes used
is much smaller (making it problematic for the analysis of transitions across detailed occupational/labor market states)
and available only at the annual or bi-annual frequency. While the Survey of Income and Program Participation is at
a monthly frequency and has, in certain waves, sample sizes comparable to the CPS, it begins after the onset of job
polarization making it impossible to analyze changes in flows before and after job polarization.
   6 For matched individuals who are unemployed and have a missing occupation code, we impute their previous month’s

occupation code, if it is available. We make the imputation for several consecutive months, if necessary. Throughout the
paper, we exclude observations for employed workers within the occupations of Farming, Fishing, Forestry and Military.
   7 The exception is when they are in the ‘outgoing rotation group’ (i.e., in their fourth or eight month in the sample)

but this information is not useful as we cannot match these individuals to the following month.

by the CPS have changed over time, specifically in 1983, 1992, 2003 and 2011, transitioning between
the 1970, 1980, 1990, 2000, and 2010 classification systems. In order to maintain consistency through
the time coverage of our data, we map each 3-digit occupation code across the five classification systems
used by the BLS since 1976 into the four occupation categories; details of the mapping are in Appendix
Table A.1.9
    Given this, we classify each individual in each month in the sample into one of ten mutually
exclusive categories: employed in one of the four occupation groups, unemployed with previous job
in one of the four occupation groups, unemployed with no previous occupation, or not in the labor
force. For future reference we refer to these ten groups as follows. N LF denotes individuals who are
not in the labor force. EN RC, ERC, ERM , and EN RM denote those currently employed in non-
routine cognitive, routine cognitive, routine manual, and non-routine manual occupations, respectively.
U N RC, U RC, U RM , and U N RM denote those currently unemployed whose last job was in each
occupational group. Finally, U X denotes people currently unemployed for whom we do not observe
their most recent occupation (for example because they have no previous work experience).
    The average monthly fraction of the sample in each of the categories for the periods before and
after 1990 is presented in Table 1.10 Table 2 presents descriptive statistics for the full sample, each of
the four employment groups, and for non-participants. As is evident, there is important heterogeneity
across occupations in demographic composition. For instance, there is a clear relationship between the
occupation groups and skills as measured by education: the level of education is highest in non-routine
cognitive occupations, and lowest in non-routine manual ones. Routine occupations tend to employ
middle-skilled workers (high school graduates and those with some college education). Similarly, there
is clear heterogeneity in gender composition: while routine cognitive occupations are predominantly
female, routine manual ones are predominantly male.
    Figure 1 displays the time series of each of the four stocks of per capita employment in our monthly
CPS sample. Despite our best effort to define consistent occupational groups, there is an obvious
discontinuity in 1983 with the introduction of the 1980 occupation codes.11 The discontinuity re-
allocates employment from the non-routine cognitive group to routine cognitive. In spite of this, the
figure illustrates the obvious rise in per capita non-routine employment.
    The dynamics of routine manual and routine cognitive employment are quite different. Per capita
employment in routine manual occupations begins to disappear in the early 1980s. The business cycle
dimension discussed in Jaimovich and Siu (2012) is evident: employment in these occupations falls
   9 In the November 2013 version of this paper, we categorized occupations using the crosswalk of Autor and Dorn

(2013), itself an adaptation of Meyer and Osborne (2005). This methodology converts all of the 3-digit occupation codes
from the 1970, 1980, 1990, and 2000 systems to a common coding system. We developed our own crosswalk to convert the
2010 codes. The common codes are then aggregated into the four broad categories. The results from that methodology
are largely unchanged relative to the current one; we refer the reader to the previous version of our paper for details.
However, using the Autor and Dorn (2013) crosswalk generates noticeable discontinuities in the non-routine cognitive
and routine cognitive groups between the 1990 and 2000 classification systems; these discontinuities are avoided by the
current methodology.
  10 We choose 1990 as a natural split since it divides our 1976-2012 sample period in half. Moreover, as we discuss

below, post-1990 is roughly the period when polarization forces are observed for both routine cognitive and routine
manual occupations.
  11 Because of the major changes instituted between the 1970 and 1980 classification systems, this discontinuity is a

feature of all categorization methodologies that assign 3-digit level codes to one of the occupation groups. See, for
instance, the discussion of the Autor and Dorn (2013) methodology in the November 2013 version of this paper, and
also Jaimovich and Siu (2012) for further discussion.

during recessions, and fails to recover during the subsequent expansion periods. This is true of all
episodes in the sample period: the back-to-back recession of 1980/82, the recessions of 1991 and 2001,
and the recent Great Recession. By contrast, per capita employment in routine cognitive occupations
grows through the 1980s, before reversing in the early 1990s. Its decline and lack of recovery are evident
following the 1991 and 2001 recessions. This pattern is repeated in a dramatic manner beginning in
2007: a sharp disappearance in the Great Recession with no recovery since. Our analysis focuses on
the factors contributing to the fall in the two categories of routine employment, taking into account
the differences in timing.


2.2     Construction of Transition Rates
We use information on the labor force status and occupation at the individual level to construct monthly
transition rates across the ten labor market states. Specifically, we compute the date t transition rate
between labor market state A and state B as the number of individuals switching from A at date t to
B at date t + 1, divided by the number of individuals in state A that we are able to match between
dates t and t + 1.12 This generates a 10 × 10 matrix of transition rates, ρt , for each month t in our
sample. This matrix can be split into sub matrices as follows:
  12 That is, individuals who leave the sample between t and t + 1 (outgoing rotation group, attritioners) are excluded

from the computation of transition rates. Each matched individual is weighted in our computation using the CPS sample
weights in month t.

   The evolution of the stock of individuals in each of the ten labor market states is governed by the
following law of motion:

                                        Stockst+1 = ρt ∗ Stockst                                              (2)

where Stockst = [EN RCt ERCt ERMt EN RMt U N RCt U RCt U RMt U N RMt U Xt N LFt ] is
the vector of the fraction of working age population in each labor market state. To understand the dy-
namics implied by equation (2), consider the evolution of employment in routine-manual occupations.
The change in this stock across two months depends on the “inflows” of individuals—from unem-
ployment, out of the labor force, and employment in other occupations—relative to the “outflows” to
unemployment, non-participation, and employment in other occupations. Equation (2) summarizes
these inflows and outflows by the size of each of the stocks and the corresponding transition rates
between them.
   To understand the evolution of ERC and ERM , we focus on the changes in the matrix of tran-
sition rates, ρt . This allows us to determine which types of transitions are particularly important in
accounting for the decline in routine employment observed in recent decades. We do this by performing
a number of counterfactual experiments discussed in the next section.
   Before proceeding to the counterfactual experiments, it is important to determine whether the law
of motion provides a good approximation of the stocks, measured cross-sectionally. This may not be the
  13 The fifth column represents transitions into the unemployment category with unknown previous occupations. All

entries in this column are equal to zero.

case as equation (2) relies only on an initial measure of stocks and iterates forward using the subsequent
transition rates. Due to entry and exit from the sample (given the rotating nature of the sample, as
well as attrition), the transition rates computed from matched individuals may not necessarily replicate
the stocks. Figure 2 plots the fraction of the population employed in each occupation group, and those
out of the labor force from 1976:1 to 2012:12. The stocks measured from all individuals are the blue,
solid lines; the estimates based on equation (2) are the green, hatched line.14
    As is evident from the figure, data derived from transition rates in the matched CPS sample tend
to underestimate the fraction of employed workers, and overestimate the fraction out of the labor
force.15 By the end of our sample period, the labor force non-participation rate is overestimated by
approximately two percentage points. Interestingly, we find that the gap in employment is due entirely
to an underestimation of the fraction of people working in non-routine occupations; the employment
rate in routine occupations is estimated quite accurately.16 Overall, a comparison of the series depicted
in Figure 2 indicates that the stocks based on the law of motion follow similar long-run paths to those
based on the full data, especially for routine employment. This rationalizes our approach of focusing
on transition rates derived from labor market flows in order to understand the long-run disappearance
of routine jobs.
   As previously discussed, the main data challenge that arises in analyzing the evolution of transition
rates is the discontinuity induced by the CPS survey redesign. In 1994, the CPS switched to a
method of dependent interviewing, whereby information collected in the previous month’s interview
is imported into the current interview to ease respondent burden and improve data quality. For
occupation data, interviewers asked whether the interviewee had the same job as in the previous month;
if the answer was yes, the individual would automatically receive the same occupation code. Dependent
coding substantially reduced the occurrence of spurious transitions across occupations at the monthly
frequency (see Kambourov and Manovskii (2013) and Moscarini and Thomsson (2007)). As a result,
this generates a discrete break in the transition rates across occupations for those reporting employment
in consecutive months. This fall in the rate of “job-to-job” occupational mobility is evident, even at the
very course, 4-group level of disaggregation that we study. In addition, the CPS redesign also induces a
discontinuity in the measured monthly transition rates between non-participation and unemployment.
In the analysis below, we are cautious when considering changes over time that involve transition rates
featuring these discontinuities. Nonetheless, Figure 2 indicates that even with these discontinuities
in 1994, the use of estimated transition rates in the law of motion generate stocks that replicate the
dynamics of the true stocks remarkably well.
  14 For months where we have missing transition rate data because of the change in the CPS sample identifiers or because

of changes in the occupational coding system, we keep the transition rates as missing, leaving stocks as constant.
  15 We note that “margin error,” as documented by Frazis et al. (2005) and others, generates a qualitatively similar

discrepancy when stocks are constructed by adding and subtracting gross flows in matched CPS data. Discrepancies
generated by margin error accumulate over time. By contrast, our procedure does not suffer from margin error as the
discrepancy does not accumulate. We note that one important difference in our procedure (relative to the cumulative
addition of gross inflows and outflows) is that we iterate on transition rates defined only for individuals who are matched
across consecutive months. As such, our procedure essentially imputes to those who leave the sample the same transition
probabilities as those who remain.
  16 Another interesting finding (not shown) is that there is no evidence of differential rates of attrition across labor force

categories.

3     The key changes in aggregate transition rates
In this section, we investigate which changes in transition rates play the most important role in
accounting for the decline in per capita routine employment in the past 30 years. We do this through
a number of counterfactual experiments where we isolate the effect of certain transition rates on the
evolution of routine employment.
    It is worth emphasizing why we perform these counterfactual experiments rather than simply
looking at the change in transition rates over time. What matters for the evolution of the stock of
routine employment are the inflows and outflows to and from this labor market state. These inflows
and outflows are themselves a product of the transition rates and the stocks of all the different labor
market states. Thus, a relatively large change in a transition rate might have little quantitative effect
on routine employment if the transition rate is small to begin with, or if the source stock is small
(e.g., one of the unemployment categories). On the other hand, a transition rate change which, by
itself, is small could have a substantial impact on routine employment if the source group is large (e.g.,
labor force non-participants). By performing counterfactual experiments we are able to determine the
quantitative importance of particular transition rates in accounting for the disappearance of routine
employment.
    As a first step, given that transition rates such as job finding rates and separation rates vary
significantly over the business cycle, we divide the time series into recessionary phases (based on
NBER peak to trough dates) and non-recessionary phases (which include all other months in the
sample). Table 3 lists the 11 individual phases in our sample, from 1976 to 2012. We denote the five
recessions as R1 through R5, and the six expansion phases as E1 through E6.

                         2007m12-2009m6 (R5)                 2009m7-2012m12 (E6)
                        Notes: The phase numbers as referred to throughout the text
                        are given in parentheses.

    We then calculate the average of each transition rate during each phase. These average transition
rates are used in our counterfactual analysis. Specifically, we replace the average value of particular
transition rates during the post-polarization period with the average value from the appropriate pre-
job polarization phases. The advantage of using average values for the counterfactuals is that they
represent a better “summary statistic” for the transition rates within a phase, relative to choosing an
arbitrary monthly value from the same phase.
    Figure 3 plots the evolution of the stocks of routine employment (cognitive, manual, and total)
when using the phase-by-phase averages of the transition rates (for each of the 11 phases) in the law
of motion from equation (2), instead of their monthly values.17 We call these the stocks based on
 17 Due   to the January 1994 redesign of the CPS and the discontinuities that this induces in certain transition rates,


                                                           11
          Figure 3: Stocks Based on Law of Motion using Monthly Rates and Phase Averages




average rates. The figure also plots the stocks based on the true monthly rates which were shown in
Figure 2. The two data series differ to the extent that the average transition rates fail to capture
changes in transition rates within a phase. Evidently, the stocks based on average rates provide a
good approximation of the data; eliminating the high frequency movements in transition rates does
not obscure the dynamics underlying the long run decline in routine employment.
    For routine manual occupations, the forces of job polarization become evident beginning around
1980. Per capita routine manual employment declines from a pre-1980 peak of 20.24 percent of the
population to 12.15 in 2012:12, representing a fall of 40%. As discussed in Section 2, job polarization
does not become evident in routine cognitive occupations until around 1990. From the 1990s peak of
18.24 percent of the population, employment falls to 14.83 percent in 2012:12. As a result, per capita
employment in all routine occupations falls from a peak value of 36.14 to 26.97 in 2012:12, a fall of
9.17 percentage points. This 9.17/36.14 ≈ 25% decline is what we seek to explain.
    In our counterfactual experiments, we allow all of the average transition rates to evolve phase-by-
phase as observed in the data except for certain ones that are held constant at their pre-polarization
averages. To ensure that the transition rates out of any given labor market state sum to one, the
difference between the observed and the counterfactual transition rate is allocated to the corresponding
diagonal element of the (10 × 10) transition matrix ρ.18 A switching rate is considered to be important
the averages for phase E4 used in this section are calculated over the period 1994:1 to 2001:2.
  18 As an example, suppose we consider an experiment where the N LF → ERM rate is lowered by x relative to the

data. Then the non-transition rate N LF → N LF is raised by x, so that the sum of all rates out of N LF remains equal
to one. Our results are robust to an alternative method, where instead of allocating the difference between the observed



                                                          12
in accounting for the fall in routine employment if, by holding it constant at pre-polarization levels, a
substantial fraction of the fall is mitigated.19 When analyzing the results we focus on the fall in per
capita routine employment at two key points in time: (i) early 2007, just prior to the Great Recession,
and (ii) the expansionary period up to the end of 2012. Implicit in these choices is the fact that
transition rates during recessions are not of primary importance in accounting for the 30 year decline
in routine employment. Because recessions are short events, it is the behavior of transition rates during
expansions that dictate long-run dynamics.
    In principle, there are 90 counterfactual experiments to consider, one for each of the off-diagonal
transition rates in the matrix ρ. Unsurprisingly, not all of these have quantitatively relevant impacts
on the evolution of routine employment. For instance, rates that do not directly govern flows in or out
of routine employment (e.g., N LF → EN RC, EN RM → U N RM ) have only indirect effects, via the
source pools of individuals that may eventually transition into routine employment; we find that—in
isolation—these have negligible effects. As such, our findings focus on transition rates that correspond
directly to inflows and outflows to and from routine employment. Moreover, for the sake of brevity,
we do not report results for all of these direct transition rates, and discuss only those of quantitative
importance.20
    In choosing the time period we consider to be representative of the pre-polarization era, we account
for the difference in timing of when routine cognitive and routine manual employment begin to decline.
We consider the expansion of the late-1970s and the recession in 1980 as the pre-polarization phases
for routine manual occupations. In the counterfactual experiments where we hold inflow (outflow)
rates to (from) ERM fixed, we replace: (i) their average value during recessions R2 through R5 with
the average for R1, and (ii) their average value during expansions E2 through E6 with the average for
E1. For routine cognitive, we consider R2 and E3 to be the benchmark, pre-polarization phases, and
run counterfactuals on phases R3 through R5 and E4 through E6.


3.1     The role of inflows to routine employment
Inflows from unemployment

In our first experiment we set the transition rates from all categories of unemployment into employment
in a routine occupation at their pre-job polarization levels. This entails holding a total of 10 transition
rates constant: from unemployment with previous job in each of the four occupational categories, and
from unemployment with unknown or no previous occupation, into employment in either a routine
manual or routine cognitive occupation. All other transition rates are allowed to evolve phase-by-
phase as they do in the data.
    To visualize the relationship between the benchmark and counterfactual transition rate series,
and the counterfactual transition rates to the diagonal of the transition matrix, we allocate this difference proportionally
across the remaining 9 transition rates out of the source labor market state being considered. As an example, consider
again the experiment where the N LF → ERM rate is lowered by x. Then the transition rates out of N LF towards
all other categories (including to itself) are adjusted so that overall they are raised by x but their relative magnitudes
remain the same.
  19 Shimer (2012) performs a similar style of counterfactuals to determine the contribution of various transition rates

to fluctuations in the unemployment rate.
  20 Because of the issues with measurement error before 1994 in the job-to-job transitions rates across occupations

(discussed in Section 2.2), we do not consider these here. We revisit this in the counterfactuals of Section 5.

Figures 4 and 5 plot these ten transition rates. The benchmark series, in solid blue lines, evolve
according to the averages observed in the data. The counterfactual series, in hatched green lines, use
the averages from the pre-polarization phases during all subsequent recessions and expansions.
   Figure 4 clearly illustrates the declining transition rate from U N RC, U N RM , and U X into routine
manual employment over time, relative to the pre-polarization period. The decline in the transition
rate for the unemployed with previous routine job (U RC and U RM ) is also evident from the 2002
expansion (E5) onward. In Figure 5, declines in the transition rate to ERC from all unemployment
groups are evident from the end of the Great Recession, and from U N RC and U RC from E5 onward.
Figure 5 also reveals that during the 1990s transition rates from U RM , U N RM , and U X into ERC
were actually higher than they were in the 1980s; this is also true of the 2000s for U RM → ERC and
U N RM → ERC.
    The resulting counterfactual series for routine employment are displayed in Figure 6. The coun-
terfactual experiment mitigates the fall in routine manual employment from 1980 onward. Per capita
routine manual employment falls to 15.58 percent of the population in 2007 (as opposed to 14.94 in
the actual data), and 14.20 in 2012 (as opposed to 12.15). Hence, holding the various U → ERM
rates—the so called “job finding rates” into routine manual employment—at pre-polarization levels
mitigates 12% and 26% of the fall in the two time periods, respectively.
   In the case of routine cognitive occupations, the counterfactual actually predicts lower employment
during the boom of the 1990s (E4) relative to the 1980s (E3). This, of course, is due to the fact that



                                                  16
the actual transition rates from U RM , U N RM , and U X into ERC during this period were higher.
By 2007, the counterfactual series falls to 17.10, essentially the same level as the actual data; prior to
the Great Recession, U → ERC rates explain none of the overall decline. However, in the subsequent
expansion period, counterfactual routine cognitive employment falls only to 16.12 (instead of 14.83 in
the data). Hence, job finding rates into ERC account for a sizeable 38% of the total decline, due to
the counterfactual’s ability to mitigate the continued fall since the end of the Great Recession.
   As a result, had the transition rates from U → ER (both manual and cognitive) not changed
from their pre-polarization values, routine employment would have remained higher. This is especially
true from 2002 onward. Overall, holding the inflow rates from unemployment at their pre-polarization
levels mitigates 17% of the fall in routine employment up to 2007, and 37% of the fall up to the end
of 2012.
   Of the 10 transition rates considered in this experiment, two are of disproportionate importance in
terms of the quantitative results. These are the rates at which unemployed workers who previously held
routine jobs “return” to employment in a routine occupation: the U RM → ERM and U RC → ERC
rates. Of the total mitigating effect generated by this counterfactual, approximately 50% is due to
these two transition rates alone. The remaining effect is due to the other eight transition rates and
their interaction with these “return job finding rates” to routine employment. As such, our analysis
in latter parts of this paper pays particular attention to these transition rates.

Inflows from non-participation

Our next experiment sets the transition rates from labor force non-participation to routine employment
at their pre-job polarization levels. All other transition rates (including the inflows from unemploy-
ment) are allowed to evolve phase-by-phase as they do in the data. Figure 7 displays the results. For
routine manual occupations, this counterfactual mitigates the per capita employment decline through-
out the post-polarization period. The effect is particularly evident from the expansion E5 onward.
The counterfactual series for ERM falls to 15.41 in 2007, and 13.62 in 2012. Hence, this experiment
mitigates 9% and 18% of the fall in routine manual employment in the two periods, respectively.
   For routine cognitive occupations, the N LF → ERC rate was actually higher during the 1990s and
2000s expansion, relative to the 1980s. As such, the counterfactual predicts lower per capita routine
cognitive employment during this period. However, since the end of the Great Recession, the transition
rate from non-participation to routine cognitive employment has been much lower compared to the
pre-polarization period. As a result, counterfactual routine cognitive employment falls only to 15.98
by the end of 2012. Hence, changes in the N LF → ERC rate account for 33% of the total per capita
employment decline in routine cognitive occupations, concentrated exclusively in the period since 2009.
   Overall, the counterfactual for total per capita routine employment falls to 32.22 by 2007, and 29.59
by the end of the sample period. Thus, had the non-participation to routine employment transition
rates not changed from their pre-polarization values, the fall of routine employment from its pre-1980
peak would have been mitigated by 5% and 29%, in each of the time periods respectively.

ployment at their pre-polarization levels




3.2    The role of outflows from routine employment
Outflows towards non-participation

We next consider the transition rates from routine employment to labor force non-participation. As
Figure 8 indicates, this counterfactual has a modest effect on the decline in per capita routine employ-
ment. For routine manual occupations, the counterfactual series falls from a pre-1980 peak of 20.24 to
15.28 in 2007, then again to 12.33 by the end of 2012. Hence, holding the ERM → N LF transition
rate at pre-polarization values mitigates 7% and 2% of the fall, respectively.
   For routine cognitive occupations, the counterfactual time series falls to 14.66 by the end of the
time period, below the actual level of 14.83. This is because outflows to non-participation have actually
been lower since 2007 than prior to polarization. Hence, the change in the ERC → N LF explains none
of the decline observed over the whole time period. However, the counterfactual falls only to 17.22
by 2007. Hence, prior to the Great Recession, the employment to non-participation rate accounts for
14% of the decline in ERC.
   Overall, holding the outflow to non-participation rates constant at their pre-polarization values
has essentially no effect on the decline in per capita routine employment after the Great Recession.
However, this experiment does indicate that changes in these transition rates are relevant in accounting
for the decline prior to the recession. From the pre-1980 peak to 2007, approximately 12% of the decline
in routine employment is accounted for by such changes.

Employment at their pre-polarization levels




3.3     Summary
The results from the various counterfactual experiments are summarized in Table 4. In short, we find
that, on their own, changes in the transition rates from: (i) unemployment to routine employment,
U → ER (in particular, the return job finding rates, U RM → ERM and U RC → ERC), (ii) labor
force non-participation to routine employment, N LF → ER, and (iii) routine employment to non-
participation, ER → N LF , account for the bulk of the disappearance of routine employment. Changes
in the “finding rates” into routine employment—factors (i) and (ii)—are important for the decline both
leading into the Great Recession and, especially, thereafter. By contrast, changes in the “separation
rate” from routine employment to non-participation matter prior to 2007.21
   To further explore the quantitative role of these changes, we conduct a comprehensive counterfactual
in Figure 9 in which we simultaneously hold all of these key transition rates to their pre-polarization
values. From a pre-1980 peak of 36.14, the counterfactual series falls to 33.42 in 2007, and to 32.82
in 2012. Relative to the actual time series for per capita routine employment, holding these transition
rates fixed mitigates 34% of the decline leading into the Great Recession, and 64% of the decline to
the end of the sample.
  21 Moreover, changes in the separation rate from routine employment to unemployment were found to have essentially

no quantitative impact on the dynamics of per capita routine employment. For brevity, those results have not been
presented.

4     Decomposition of transition rate changes
The previous section identifies changes in three sets of transition rates that account for a substantial
fraction of the disappearance of per capita routine employment. Two of these rates reflect the prob-
ability that individuals transit into employment in routine occupations: one from the state of labor
force non-participation, and the other from unemployment. The other reflects the probability that
individuals transit from routine employment into non-participation.
    It is well known that the probability of switching between particular labor market categories varies
significantly across demographic groups. For example, young individuals are more likely to transit
from unemployment to employment relative to those who are older. Changes in the demographic
composition of the population could therefore be responsible, to some extent, for the changes over
time in the transition rates into and out of routine employment.
    In this section we determine the extent to which the observed changes in the key transition rates
since the era of job polarization can be attributed to: (i) changes in the demographic composition of
individuals in various labor market/occupation categories, and (ii) changes in the propensities to make
certain transitions for individuals from particular demographic groups.
    Disentangling these two forces allows us to argue whether the changes in the key transition rates
are attributable to forces responsible for job polarization. For example, if transition rate changes were
due principally to the aging of the U.S. population, one might argue that polarization is a natural
consequence of demographic change.22 By contrast, if the changes are due principally to changes in
propensities and vary across routine and non-routine occupations, a stronger case can be made for the
role of job polarization forces. Our analysis also allows us to determine which demographic groups
have experienced the most pronounced changes in transition rates.
    We proceed as follows. Let ρAB
                                it be a dummy variable defined at the individual level for all indi-
viduals who are in labor market state A in period t. This dummy is equal to 1 if individual i switches
from state A to state B between month t and month t + 1, and equal to zero otherwise. Consider the
following linear probability model for ρAB
                                        it :


                                                 ρAB    A
                                                  it = Xit β + it .                                                 (3)

       A
Here, Xit comprises a set of standard demographic variables available in the CPS, as well as controls
for seasonality. The demographic variables we include are age (dummy variables for 6 age bins: 16-24,
25-34, . . . , 55-64, and 65+), education (dummies for less than high school, high school diploma or some
post-secondary, and college graduate), gender, race (white versus other), and marital status (married
versus other).
    We estimate equation (3) for each of the transition rates in the matrix ρ from equation (1), focusing
primarily on the set of transition rates identified in Section 3 as being quantitatively important in
accounting for the decline of per capita routine employment. We perform the estimation separately
for each of the 11 recession and expansion phases listed in Table 3. This means that the estimated
  22 Of course, such an argument is only valid for demographic composition changes that are orthogonal to changes in

the labor market. Along other dimensions the argument is less clear cut; for instance, it could be argued that increasing
educational attainment has been driven to some extent by the desire of individuals to attain non-routine cognitive jobs
as opposed to routine ones. Such issues cannot be settled simply within this empirical framework.



                                                           21
vector of coefficients β is allowed to vary across different phases of the business cycle and over time.
By analyzing the changes in the estimated coefficients, we determine which demographic groups have
experienced the largest changes in transition propensities.
   Next, we perform a standard Oaxaca-Blinder (OB) decomposition of the transition rates. Con-
sider two different time periods denoted period 0 and period 1. For example, period 0 could be the
expansionary period of the late 1970s, and period 1 the expansionary period of the 2000s. We use the
estimated coefficients, β,
                        b for each period, along with information on the evolution of the demographic
variables in X A , to decompose the change in the average transition rate across the two periods as:


                                         A   A 
                           ρAB
                            0  − ρ AB
                                   1  =  X 0 βb0 − X 1 βb1
                                         A      A
                                                          A           
                                      = X 0 − X 1 βb0 + X 1     βb0 − βb1                              (4)

   The change in the transition rate across periods 0 and 1 (on the left-hand side of the equation)
can be decomposed into two parts. The first, given by the first term in equation (4), is the component
that can be attributed to changes in the demographic composition of individuals in labor market state
A across periods 0 and 1. The second part can be attributed to changes in the vector of coefficients
β.
b This reflects changes in the propensities to transition from state A to B for particular demographic
groups. We thus decompose transition rate changes from the pre- to the post-polarization era into
changes that are “explained” or “unexplained” by observables.
   We perform the OB decomposition in equation (4) to analyze changes across comparable phases of
the cycle, such as pre-polarization versus post-polarization recessions, or pre-polarization versus post-
polarization expansions. In what follows, we do not discuss the results of the exercise for recessions: the
transition rates that we focus on do not feature much in the way of systematic change across different
recessions. Moreover, as discussed previously, because recessions are short events (lasting, on average,
11 months during our sample period), it is the behavior of transition rates during expansionary phases
that dictate the long-run dynamics of the labor market stocks of interest.
   As discussed in Section 3, we consider the relevant pre-polarization expansion period for routine
manual employment to be represented by the late 1970s, specifically phase E1. For all of the transition
rates into or out of routine manual employment, our OB decomposition analyzes the change in each
subsequent expansion relative to E1. For routine cognitive employment, we consider the relevant pre-
polarization expansion period to be given by the mid-to-late 1980s, phase E3. Therefore, in our OB
decomposition for transition rates into or out of routine cognitive employment, we consider E3 to be
our baseline period 0, as denoted in equation (4).
   Before proceeding to the results, we illustrate the fit of our linear probability regression model. We
use the results from the estimation of equation (3) to construct fitted values of the series of transition
rates across each pair of labor market states. We use these fitted values in the law of motion in equation
(2) to construct the implied stocks of each labor market state over time. These are presented in Figure
10 for the four employment groups, along with the stocks built with the observed monthly transition
rates as shown in Figure 2. The fact that the two series track each other remarkably well indicates
that our regression specification generates a good fit to the data.

4.1     Routine Manual Employment
Inflows from Unemployment

As discussed in Section 3, one of the key transition rates accounting for the decline in routine oc-
cupations is the rate at which unemployed workers transition to routine employment (U → ER).
Quantitatively, the most important of these is the rate at which unemployed individuals who previ-
ously held routine jobs transition back to a routine job (U R → ER), which we refer to as the “return
job finding rate.” We begin by analyzing the change in this transition rate for routine manual workers
since job polarization.
    Table 5 presents results from the estimation of equation (3) for routine manual occupations, sepa-
rately for each expansion period between 1976 and 2012. In all of our regression specifications, the ex-
cluded group is 45-54 year old, single, white females, with high school diplomas or some post-secondary
education (but less than a college degree).23 The first column presents results for the pre-polarization
period of 1976m1-1979m12; the remaining four columns are for the subsequent post-polarization ex-
pansions.
    Comparing the first and last column illustrates how the influence of various covariates on the
return job finding rate has changed from the late 1970s to the period following the Great Recession.
The estimated constant terms indicate that the monthly U RM → ERM transition probability has
  23 Our regressions also include a full set of monthly dummies to control for seasonality, which we do not report here.

Hence, our excluded group are technically individuals with the demographic characteristics detailed above, observed in
the month of January.

decreased by 7.56 percentage points for the excluded demographic group. Inspecting the change for
the remaining variables indicates that the fall in transition propensity was experienced broadly across
essentially all demographic groups. The change has been especially strong for males (whose transition
probability has fallen 2.47 percentage points more than their female counterparts) and 16-24 year olds
(1.14 p.p. more than 45-54 year olds). Comparing the pre-polarization period with the remaining
post-polarization expansions (of the 1980s, 1990s, and early 2000s), we see that the U RM → ERM
transition probability actually rose for the excluded group. Hence, the fall in the return job finding rate
experienced in the aggregate is not due to individuals of those demographic characteristics. Instead,
the fall in transition propensity is found among men, high school dropouts, and especially the young
(16-24 year olds).
   Table 6 summarizes the results of the OB decomposition for the return job finding rate for routine
manual occupations. As mentioned above, we take the expansion period of the 1970s as the baseline,
pre-polarization period and compare subsequent expansions to it. We present the total difference in
the average transition rate across periods, as well as the effect owing to “explained” factors (namely,
changes in demographic composition) and “unexplained” factors (changes in propensities). For brevity,
we do not present the detailed decomposition results for all explanatory variables, but instead, report

results for selected covariates.24
    As is obvious from the rightmost column, there has been a precipitous fall in the U RM → ERM
rate since the end of the Great Recession. Since July of 2009, the monthly return job finding rate has
averaged 13.87%. This compares to an average rate of 23.12% in the expansion of the late-1970s. The
sharp decline in the return job finding rate is one of the key contributors to the lack of recovery in
routine manual employment since the end of the recession.
    The fall is due entirely to unexplained factors; demographic change alone actually predicts a rise
in the return job finding rate. Specifically, the explained effect implies that, if transition propensities
(conditional on demographics) had remained at their 1970s levels, the return job finding rate would
have increased by 0.58 percentage points, given the compositional change in the pool of unemployed
routine manual workers. This is driven by increases in the fraction of the U RM who are male and
with the middle level of educational attainment (as shown in Table 5, both of these categories are
more likely to transition to ERM , relative to females and those with either high or low education,
respectively).
    By contrast, the total unexplained effect implies that changes in transition propensities imply a
fall in the return job finding rate of almost 10%. The effect of the constant is that attributable to the
change in the conditional transition probability for the excluded group; as discussed above, this has
fallen by more than 7 percentage points. The effect due to the male dummy variable implies that the
change in transition probability for this group has contributed an additional 2% fall.25
    The fall in the return job finding rate since 2009 is not unique to routine manual occupations,
and is shared by all occupation groups. However, as we discuss below in Subsection 4.4, the fall is
much larger for routine occupations relative to non-routine ones. That is, the Great Recession and its
aftermath had a disproportionately large effect on routine employment, greatly accelerating the job
polarization process.
    Even prior to the Great Recession, Table 6 indicates that the average U RM → ERM transition rate
has fallen in all expansion periods relative the late 1970s. These differences are large and statistically
significant at the 1% level. Again, these falls occurred despite compositional changes (the increasing
fraction of males and middle-educated workers among the unemployed routine manual) predicting
a rise. Hence, the fall in return job finding rates is driven entirely by changes in propensity in all
expansions since the onset of job polarization. As discussed in relation to Table 5, the fall in transition
propensity is particularly acute for the youngest age group (16-24 year olds), and those with high
school or some post-secondary education.
    Next we consider the changes in transition rates from unemployment for those previously working in
a non-routine occupation, into routine manual employment: U N RC → ERM and U N RM → ERM .
We refer to these as “switching job finding rates.” For brevity, we do not present the results of these
linear probability regressions and OB decompositions, and instead summarize as follows. As with the
U RM return job finding rates, the switching job finding rates into routine manual employment display
large falls following the Great Recession. This again indicates the important impact the recession had
  24 The full detailed decomposition is available from the authors upon request.
  25 As discussed above, the fall in the estimated coefficient for 16-24 year olds would imply an additional negative effect
in the OB decomposition. But taken together, all ages aside from the excluded group of 45-54 year olds generate a
positive unexplained effect.

on the recent evolution of routine employment.
   However, even prior to 2007, important changes occurred. As can be seen in Figure 4, both the
U N RC → ERM and U N RM → ERM rates experienced significant declines throughout the polariza-
tion era. The changes in U N RC → ERM are largely explained, owing to aging and rising educational
attainment of unemployed non-routine cognitive workers (older and more educated individuals are less
likely to switch into a routine manual jobs). By contrast, the fall in the U N RM → ERM is almost
entirely due to unexplained changes: the fall in propensity is concentrated among the young (16-24
years old), the middle-educated, and males.
   Finally and importantly, this fall in switching job finding rates into ERM was not exhibited in
transition rates for unemployed routine manual workers switching into employment in non-routine
occupations. We discuss this in detail in Subsection 4.5.

Inflows from Non-participation

Next, we consider the change in transition rates from labor force non-participation to routine manual
employment (N LF → ERM ) since the onset of job polarization. As discussed in Section 3, changes
in these transition rates account for about 29% of the total decline in per capita routine employment.
   For brevity, we present the estimation results for the linear probability model, equation (3), in
the Appendix, and provide a summary here as follows. The fall in the N LF → ERM rate in every
post-polarization expansion relative to the late 1970s is not experienced by all demographic groups.
This is evident from the change in the estimated constant term; for the excluded group, the transition
probability has remained essentially the same over time. Hence, the fall is concentrated in specific
demographic groups. The fall in the transition rate to routine manual employment is particularly
strong for low-educated, young (16-24 year old), and male labor force non-participants.
   Table 7 summarizes the results of the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition for the N LF → ERM tran-
sition rate. Again, we take the expansion period of the 1970s as the pre-polarization baseline period.
As is obvious, there has been a precipitous fall in the N LF → ERM rate since the end of the Great
Recession. The steep decline in this employment “finding rate” (out of non-participation) is one of the
key contributors to the lack of recovery in routine manual employment since the recession. However,
even prior to the Great Recession, we see that the average N LF → ERM transition rate is lower in
all periods since the late-1970s.
   We find that the unexplained effect consistently predicts a decline, across all expansion periods.
That is, the propensity to make the N LF → ERM transition is significantly lower. This effect is
generated by propensity changes among males, the young, high school dropouts, and singles. These
negative unexplained changes are offset by changes in the composition of labor force non-participants.
Specifically, the rising proportion of males and, to a lesser extent, singles in non-participation predicts
a rise in the N LF → ERM rate (since these individuals, relative to females and marrieds, have a
higher probability of transiting to routine manual employment).

Outflows Towards Non-Participation

Finally, we investigate the change in transition rates from employment in routine manual occupations
to labor force non-participation (ERM → N LF ). For brevity, we present the estimation results

for the linear probability regression in the Appendix, and simply provide a summary here. Not all
demographic groups have seen a rise in the ERM → N LF rate since the onset of job polarization.
However, significant increases are observed for the young (16-24 year olds), the married, as well as
among males and high school dropouts.
   Table 8 summarizes the decomposition results for this transition rate. In contrast to the “finding
rates” discussed above, there is no distinct break in the ERM → N LF rate since the end of the Great
Recession. Instead, we see an increase beginning after the 2001 recession, continuing through the end
of the sample period.
   This rise in the labor force exit rate for employed routine manual workers has occurred despite
compositional changes that predict the opposite. Two explained factors are particularly pronounced
in this case. The first is the rising education levels of routine manual workers, as increased schooling is
associated with higher labor force attachment. Second, the shifting age composition of routine manual
workers, away from the young (16-24 year olds) toward prime ages (35-54 year olds), similarly predicts
a lower ERM → N LF rate.
    Hence, the observed rise in the exit rate towards non-participation is due entirely to unexplained
factors. Indeed, increased exit propensities are observed in all four expansion periods since job polar-



                                                     29
ization. This propensity effect is particularly strong for males and those who are married.

Summary

To summarize, we find important changes in the transition rates into and out of routine manual
employment. Relative to their pre-job polarization benchmarks, the finding rates into employment –
from both unemployment and non-participation – have fallen since the 1980s. These falls are especially
pronounced in the years since the Great Recession. These changes in the U RM → ERM and N LF →
ERM rates have prevailed, despite demographic change that predicts both to have risen in the past
30 years. Hence, the fall in finding rates is entirely due to changes in propensities that have more than
offset these explained factors.
   The rise in the exit rate from routine manual employment to non-participation began in the 2000s,
with no marked break following the Great Recession. This rise in the exit rate occurred despite
demographic change predicting the opposite implying that, again, the observed change is due entirely
to changes in propensities that have more than offset explained factors.


4.2    Routine Cognitive Employment
Inflows from Unemployment

In this subsection, we analyze the change in the transition rates from unemployment to routine cognitive
employment. We begin with the return job finding rate, U RC → ERC. Table 9 presents results from
the estimation of equation (3) for routine cognitive occupations. As before, the excluded group is
45-54 year old, single, white females, with high school diplomas or some post-secondary education
(but less than a college degree). The first column presents results for the pre-polarization period of
1982m12-1990m6; the remaining columns are for the subsequent post-polarization expansions.
   Comparing the first and last column, there has been a precipitous fall in the return job finding
rate into routine cognitive employment since the Great Recession. The estimated constant terms
indicate a fall of 10.71 percentage points for the excluded group. From the change in the remaining
variables, the fall in U RC → ERC rate was experienced broadly across all demographic groups, but
has been especially strong for females (3.51 p.p. greater than their male counterparts), whites, those
with higher levels of education, and to a lesser extent, the prime-aged (45-54 year olds). Comparing
the pre-polarization period with the remaining post-polarization expansions (of the 1990s and early
2000s), we see similar changes as since the Great Recession, though less quantitatively pronounced.
   Table 10 summarizes the results for the OB decomposition. In all three post-polarization expan-
sions, the average return job finding rate for unemployed routine cognitive workers is lower than in the
expansion of the 1980s; this change is especially pronounced and statistically significant beginning in
the early-2000s.
   The composition effect predicts a fall in all three periods. This is due primarily to a rise in the
share of males and non-whites in the unemployment pool (both groups experience lower transition
probabilities to routine cognitive employment compared to females and whites, respectively). From
the expansionary period of the 2000s onward, the fall in the return job finding rate is driven by both
explained and unexplained factors, with the latter being more important. The unexplained component

predicts falls in the U RC → ERC propensity for essentially all demographic groups. This propensity
effect is strongest for whites, females, the highly educated, and prime-aged.
   Next we consider changes in switching job finding rates, from non-routine unemployment into
routine cognitive employment: U N RC → ERC and U N RM → ERC. Again, for brevity, we do not
present the results of these decompositions in detail, and instead summarize as follows. As can be seen
in Figure 5, the U N RC → ERC transition rate has experienced significant declines throughout the
polarization era. The falls in this switching job finding rate are unexplained by demographics, and are
particularly strong among females and singles. By contrast, the U N RM → ERC rate rose during job
polarization, due both to explained and unexplained factors. Rising post-secondary education rates
among the unemployed non-routine manual accounts for the explained effect; rising propensities of the
young and non-whites to switch from U N RM → ERC account for the unexplained effects.

Inflows from Non-participation

For brevity, we do not present the regression results for the N LF → ERC rate, and make them
available upon request. Table 11 summarizes the results of the OB decomposition for the transition
rate from labor force non-participation to routine cognitive employment.
   As with N LF → ERM , the N LF → ERC rate displays a sharp decline following the Great
Recession. This change is entirely accounted for by a fall in the propensity of all individuals to find
employment in routine cognitive jobs. The effect was particularly pronounced for the young (16-24

year olds) and whites. As with routine manual occupations, this unexplained change is a key factor
for the malaise in routine cognitive employment since 2009.
   Prior to the Great Recession, N LF → ERC rates exhibit modest increases relative to the pre-
polarization period of the 1980s. This increase is due to explained factors; important changes include
rising educational attainment and the increasing share of 16-24 year olds in the non-participant pool.
During the expansions of the 1990s and early-2000s, these compositional changes mask unexplained
factors that predict declines in the transition to routine cognitive employment. Hence, since job
polarization, there have been consistent falls in the propensity to transition from N LF to ERC.

Outflows Towards Non-Participation

Finally, Table 12 summarizes the results for the transition rate from routine cognitive employment
to labor force non-participation; as above, we do not present the results of the linear probability
regressions for brevity, and make them available upon request. As is evident, there is little change in
the ERC → N LF transition rate across pre- and post-polarization periods. Moreover, whether the
rate increases or decreases is not consistent across post-polarization expansions.
   However, what is consistent across periods is the fact that explained and unexplained factors
operate in opposite directions. Demographic changes predict that the exit rate from routine cognitive
employment to non-participation should have fallen. This is due primarily to rising education and
the rising share of males amongst routine cognitive workers. By contrast, propensity changes predict


                                                        34
increased exit from the labor force among routine cognitive workers. This change is particularly strong
for males and the young (16-24 year olds).

Summary

To summarize, the return job finding rate into routine cognitive employment fell in each post-polarization
expansion relative to the pre-polarization 1980s benchmark. This fall is driven primarily by unexplained
factors, with propensity changes strongest for whites, females, the highly educated, and prime-aged.
The finding rate from non-participation to routine cognitive employment also fell following the Great
Recession. Propensity change accounts for this, and predicts a decrease in the N LF → ERC rate
throughout the job polarization era. Finally, propensity change also predicts an increase in the exit
rate from routine cognitive employment to non-participation in each post-polarization expansion; this
is driven by the effect of males and the young.


4.3     Contrast with Transition Rates for Non-Routine Workers
Our analysis identifies a number of important changes in the transition patterns in and out of routine
occupations that are key in accounting for the long run decline of per capita routine employment. This
subsection discusses the extent to which these changes are unique to routine occupations by contrasting
them with non-routine occupations. For brevity, we present the results for the OB decomposition
analysis in Appendix A, and highlight the key findings here.26 We focus on the period prior to the
Great Recession in this section, and analyze the patterns for the most recent expansion period in
Subsection 4.4.
    We begin with entry rates into employment from unemployment and non-participation. As dis-
cussed above, the post-polarization era has featured sharp falls in the return job finding rate from
unemployment for both routine cognitive and routine manual occupations. These falls are driven pri-
marily be propensity changes, as opposed to simply changes in demographic composition. By contrast,
both the U N RC → EN RC and U N RM → EN RM transition rate have increased since job polariza-
tion, notably during the expansions of the 1990s and early-2000s. The rise in return job finding rates
into non-routine jobs is due to an increased propensity.
    The N LF → EN RC transition rate has also increased in the post-polarization era; this is true even
for the period since the Great Recession. This increase in the entry rate into non-routine cognitive
employment is driven by unexplained factors, as opposed to change in demographics. Prior to the
Great Recession, the N LF → EN RM rate is essentially unchanged relative to the period prior to job
polarization. However, this lack of change masks an increase in propensity to transition to non-routine
manual employment. This unexplained effect is offset by the opposing explained effect, stemming
primarily from the increased educational attainment amongst labor force non-participants. These
increases in propensity to transition into non-routine employment contrast starkly with the fall in
propensity to transition from non-participation into routine employment.
    Finally, we discuss briefly the outflow rates from non-routine employment towards non-participation.
The EN RC → N LF transition rate exhibits no consistent pattern of change relative to the pre-
  26 The full decomposition results, as well as estimation results of equation (3) for the non-routine transition rates, are

available from the authors upon request.

polarization period. Moreover, the changes are quantitatively small. By contrast, the EN RM → N LF
rate has fallen since job polarization. These changes are large and statistically significant, owing to both
explained and unexplained factors. Indeed, this decreased tendency to transition to non-participation
is the primary factor accounting for the rise in non-routine manual employment. Again, this change
contrasts sharply with the rise in the ERC → N LF and ERM → N LF rates, and especially the rise
in the propensities to exit from routine employment.


4.4    Finding Rates since the Great Recession
As is clear from the previous results, much of the long-run decline in per capita routine employment can
be attributed to the lack of recovery in the four years since the end of the Great Recession. Moreover,
as indicated in Section 3 along with the decomposition results above, this decline can be attributed
largely to the fall in finding rates into routine employment, from both unemployment and labor force
non-participation since 2009. In this subsection, we make clear that the failure of these finding rates
to recover since the recession is quantitatively unique to routine occupations. That is, while all finding
rates at the occupational level have fallen, the effect is much more pronounced for routine cognitive
and routine manual occupations. Hence, the malaise in aggregate employment and “jobless recovery”
observed since the Great Recession is disproportionately due to the disappearance of routine jobs.
   To demonstrate this, Panel A of Table 13 presents return job finding rates for all four occupational
groups: U RM → ERM , U RC → ERC, U N RM → EN RM , and U N RC → EN RC. The first
row presents these rates for the benchmark, pre-polarization expansion; the second row presents the
return job finding rates for the 2009-2012 expansion period. The return job finding rates into routine
employment have fallen precipitously since the end of the Great Recession, by approximately 8 or 9
percentage points. These compare to modest return job finding rate declines of around 3 percentage
points for either of the non-routine occupation groups. Hence, while return job finding rates in all
occupations have fared poorly since 2009, the large declines observed for routine jobs are not simply
attributable to economy-wide forces. The stark difference across routine and non-routine occupations
points to the importance of job polarization forces.
   Panel B of Table 13 presents changes in switching job finding rates, from the pre-polarization
expansion to the past four years. Because of the large number of switching job finding rates—3 per
occupation group (e.g., U N RC → ERM , U N RC → ERC, U N RC → EN RM ) times 4 occupation
groups—we simplify our analysis as follows. We consider job finding rates for unemployed individuals
from each non-routine occupation group into employment in either routine occupation (cognitive or
manual), and vice-versa.
  Consider, the switching job finding rate for the unemployed with previous employment in a non-
routine manual job to employment in a routine (cognitive or manual) occupation, U N RM → ER,
displayed in the first column. Comparing across expansion periods, this transition rate has fallen by
3.97%. This fall is even greater, at 5.34%, for the rate at which unemployed non-routine cognitive
workers switch into routine employment. In fact, these are larger than the falls of approximately 3
percent in their return job finding rates into non-routine jobs from Panel A. Hence, the fall in the
“total” job finding rate for the unemployed non-routine (into employment of any occupation) since the
end of the Great Recession is disproportionately due to the reduced rate at which these workers find

employment in routine occupations.
    This contrasts with the change in the switching job finding rates for the unemployed with previous
employment in routine jobs. Across the pre-polarization period and the period since the Great Reces-
sion, for both U RM or U RC, the transition rate into non-routine employment has fallen much less,
in the range of 1 percent. This contrasts dramatically with the declines in the return job finding rates
into routine employment displayed in Panel A. Again, the observed falls in the “total” job finding rate
for unemployed routine workers is disproportionately due to the reduced rate at which these workers
find routine employment. The findings of Panel B underscore our emphasis on job polarization forces,
and the disappearance of routine jobs, in understanding aggregate employment dynamics since the end
of the Great Recession.
    Panel C presents transition rates from non-participation into employment for all four occupational
groups. The fall in the finding rates from non-participation into employment since the Great Recession
is not shared by all occupation groups. In fact, the transition rate from non-participation into non-
routine cognitive employment has risen in the recent period. Thus, the declines in finding rates
for routine jobs since 2009 are not simply attributable to recessionary, economy-wide forces. Job
polarization has led to much more pronounced effects on routine employment since the Great Recession.


4.5     Further Analysis of the Transition Rates
As documented above, unemployed workers previously employed in routine jobs have experienced sharp
declines in the rate at which they return to employment in routine occupations. Here, we investigate
the implication of this change in the return job finding rates to routine employment. Specifically, we de-
termine whether these falls have been offset by increased transition rates into non-routine employment,
or simply led to longer periods of non-employment.27
    Figure 11 displays the changes in the job finding rates from routine unemployment observed between
the pre-polarization expansion, and each subsequent expansion since job polarization. We consider
transition rates into each occupational group (return and switching job finding rates), as well as the
rate into employment of any occupation (the total job finding rate). Since occupational switching takes
time, with potential intervening spells of non-participation, Figure 11 displays changes in 12-month
job finding rates (i.e., transitions from unemployment at date t to employment at date t + 12).28
    Changes in the transition rates from U RM are in the top panel, changes for U RC in the bottom.
Comparing the pre-polarization expansion with the period since the Great Recession, declines in the
12-month U RM → ERM rate were accompanied by declines in the switching job finding rate into all
other occupation groups (though these were of much smaller magnitude). Hence, unemployed routine
manual workers have experienced a pronounced fall in job finding probability into any occupation.
Similarly, unemployed routine cognitive workers have experienced a larger fall in their total job finding
  27 As discussed in Section 2, the CPS redesign of 1994 induced discontinuities in the measured transition rates between

unemployment and non-participation in the labor force. As such, we are unable to determine whether changes in return
job finding rates have led to longer spells of unemployment or increased transition to non-participation separately.
  28 We can observe transition rates up to a 15-month horizon; however we prefer to consider the 12-month horizon as

this affords approximately four times as many observations (individuals in their first four months-in-sample, rather than
only individuals in their first month-in-sample). Moreover, because we are interested in changes during business cycle
expansions, we do not consider 12-month transition rate observations which straddle both booms and recessions. For
reference, we include the analogous figure for monthly job finding rate changes in Appendix A.

rate compared to their return job finding rate, following the Great Recession. This, however, masks a
slight increase in the 12-month U RC → EN RC rate since 2009, when compared to the pre-polarization
benchmark.
    Prior to the Great Recession, falls in the U RM → ERM rate were offset by higher switching rates
in the 1980s, 1990s, and early-2000s expansions. This can be seen by the near zero change in the total
job finding rate from U RM in the top panel. This increased occupational switching for unemployed
routine manual workers, however, did not go into high-wage, non-routine cognitive jobs. Instead, U RM
workers switched primarily into routine cognitive work, and also into non-routine manual occupations.
    Similarly, falls in the return job finding rate for the unemployed routine cognitive were largely offset
by higher switching rates prior to the Great Recession. This is particularly evident in the U RC →
EN RC rate, though increased switching into non-routine manual occupations was also observed.
Hence, to the extent that non-routine cognitive occupations represent higher wage jobs relative to the
other occupation groups, unemployed routine cognitive workers have fared better than routine manual
workers in the job polarization era.
    To summarize, since the Great Recession, falls in return job finding rates have been accompanied
by longer spells of non-employment for unemployed routine workers. Prior to this, falls in return
job finding rates during the job polarization era have been largely offset by increased occupational
switching. Unemployed routine manual workers switched primarily into routine cognitive occupations,
while unemployed routine cognitive workers have switched primarily into non-routine cognitive jobs.


5     Demographics or Propensities: Detailed Counterfactuals
In this section, we investigate the role of demographic change and changes in transition propensities
in accounting for the disappearance of per capita routine employment. We consider two types of
counterfactual experiments. In the first, the demographic composition of the U.S. population is held
constant at pre-polarization levels while the transition rates of each demographic group are allowed to
evolve over time as observed in the data. In the second, we allow for aggregate demographic change
but hold certain demographic group-specific transition rates constant at their pre-polarization levels.
    Recall that in Section 4 the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition results suggested that the changes in
the key transition rates were mainly due to changes in propensities rather than changes in explained
factors. However, note that in the Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition the term attributed to demographics
is given by:                                                   
                                                   A        A
                                                  X0 − X1           βb0
                                                                                             A
                                                                                                   
This is the difference between the observed aggregate transition rate in period 0,          X 0 βb0 , and the
counterfactual transition rate that would be observed if we use
                                                              the transition

                                                                A
0 and the observed demographic composition of period 1, X 1 β0 . This ignores the fact that, if
transition propensities had remained at their period 0 levels, the demographic composition of labor
market state A in period 1 would potentially differ dramatically from that observed in the data. To
address this, the experiments in this section allow the counterfactual demographic composition within
each labor market state to evolve in a manner consistent with the transition rates being used.
    We proceed as follows. In each period we divide the sample into a total of 144 bins according to


                                                       40
the demographic characteristics of: gender (2 groups), age (6 groups), education (3 groups), race (2
groups) and marital status (2 groups). We then calculate the time series of transition rates across
the ten labor market states for each demographic bin; this is equivalent to the matrix ρt in equation
(1), except computed at the demographic group-specific level, as opposed to at the aggregate level
considered in Sections 2 and 3. For each of the 144 demographic groups, we track their distribution
across the ten states over time using either true or counterfactual transition rates by applying a law-
of-motion analogous to equation (2). This gives us the labor market evolution for each demographic
group that is consistent with the transition rates being considered.
   Next, in order to account for demographic change observed in the U.S. population (e.g. rising
educational attainment, population aging), we apply the following re-weighting procedure. At each
point in time we assign a weight to each demographic group that is equal to their share in the population
as observed in the data. This re-weighting of demographic groups ensures that we accurately match the
aggregate demographic composition in each period, while simultaneously ensuring that the distribution
of each demographic group across the ten labor market states is determined endogenously.29
   Figure 12 displays the various series for per capita employment in routine occupations constructed
using the observed demographic group-specific transition rates, along with our re-weighting procedure.
It also displays the series for routine employment based on the aggregate law-of-motion as shown in
Figure 2. One might be worried that the fact that we have a very large number of demographic bins
leads to noisy group-specific transition rates. However, the fact that the two series track each other
very closely implies that our procedure works well in replicating aggregate dynamics. The series that
use the demographic-specific rates represent our benchmark throughout this section of the paper.


5.1     The overall role of demographics
Our first counterfactual experiments analyze the role of demographic change in the U.S. population in
accounting for the decline of routine employment. We do this by allowing each demographic group’s
transition rates to evolve as they do in the data, but hold the relative size of each demographic
group constant at its pre-polarization level. Any decline in routine employment mitigated by the
counterfactual is therefore due to demographic change.
   Due to the fact that routine manual (ERM ) and routine cognitive (ERC) employment peak at
different times, we perform slightly different counterfactuals for each of the two series. In the left
panel of Figure 13 we plot the benchmark stocks of ERM in the solid blue line; the counterfactual
holding aggregate demographics constant at their 1976:1 levels (allowing transition rates to evolve as
they do in the data) is plotted in the hatched green line. The two series have been smoothed to remove
seasonality.
   If demographic composition had remained constant at pre-polarization levels, routine manual em-
ployment would have risen further leading up to the 1980 recession. Following the peak, ERM would
  29 An analogous interpretation of our re-weighting approach would be in terms of entry and exit from the sample, by

assuming that entry and exit occurs proportionately to the size of each labor market state for individuals within each
demographic bin. That is, if the size of a particular group is increasing, we assume that these additional workers are
distributed across the ten states in the same way as the incumbents from that group. Hence, entry and exit does not
change the labor force composition within a given demographic group. However, different entry and exit rates across
demographic groups change the relative size of each group in the population, thus changing the composition across the
ten labor market states in the aggregate.

have fallen to 16.61 per cent of the population (rather than 14.83) by early 2007, and to 14.24 by the
end of 2012 (rather than 12.02). Thus, relative to the pre-1980 peak of 20.36, holding demographics
constant mitigates about 32% of the fall up to early 2007, and about 27% of the fall up to the end
of 2012. Hence, demographic change in the U.S. population—principally in terms educational compo-
sition and age structure—explains a small, though not insignificant, portion of the decline in routine
manual employment. The remainder is accounted for by changes in demographic-specific transition
rates.
    For routine cognitive employment, given that it peaks at a later date, we perform a counterfactual
where we hold the relative size of each demographic bin constant at their 1989:12 levels. The right
panel of Figure 13 plots the benchmark and counterfactual stocks of ERC. As is clear from the figure,
holding demographics constant at pre-polarization levels has little effect on the fall of routine cognitive
employment. By the end of 2012 the counterfactual ERC reaches 14.77 per cent of the population
(rather than 14.48), thus mitigating less than 7% of the total fall. We can conclude that changes in
group-specific transition rates account for the vast majority of the total fall in ERC.


5.2      The role of inflows to routine employment
Inflows from unemployment

Following the same logic as in Section 3, our next experiment holds constant the transition rates from
all categories of unemployment into routine employment, for each of the 144 demographic bins, at
their pre-job polarization levels.30 As is the case in the remaining counterfactuals, all other transition
rates and the demographic composition of the population evolve as observed in the data. Note that
there are two key differences relative to the analysis in Subsection 3.1. First, when holding transition
propensities at their pre-polarization levels, we do this individually for each demographic group, rather
than at the aggregate level; thus aggregate transition rates will change over time because of changes in
the demographic composition in each labor market state. Second, we allow for aggregate demographic
change by using the re-weighting procedure outlined above.
    The results for this counterfactual experiment are displayed in Figure 14. Holding the inflow
propensities from unemployment constant at their pre-polarization levels does not mitigate the fall in
routine employment prior to the Great Recession, but does mitigate approximately 16% of the fall to
the end of 2012. Looking separately at the two types of routine employment, unemployment to routine
employment propensities account for about 10% of the fall in routine manual occupations, and 17% of
the fall in routine cognitive occupations.

Inflows from non-participation

Figure 15 displays the counterfactual experiment where the transition propensities from non-participation
into routine employment are held constant at their pre-job polarization levels for all demographic
  30 As in Section 3, whenever we hold a particular transition rate to its pre-job polarization level, this entails holding it

at the phase average for phases R1 and E1 (R2 and E3) in subsequent recessions and expansions, respectively, for ERM
(ERC). As in Section 3, we adjust the diagonal elements (i.e. the “staying” rates) in our counterfactuals to ensure that
transition rates from a given source add up to one.




                                                             43

groups. This experiment leads to a stronger recovery of routine manual and, especially, routine cog-
nitive employment after the 2001 recession. It also generates a slight recovery following the Great
Recession, as opposed to continued decline observed in the data. Overall, 18% of the fall up to early
2007, and 29% of the fall up to the end of 2012 is mitigated. As such, changes in N LF → ER
propensities play an important role in the disappearance of routine employment.


5.3    The role of outflows from routine employment to non-participation
The next experiment holds the demographic group-specific transition propensities from routine em-
ployment to labor force non-participation constant at their pre-job polarization levels. Again, all other
transition rates and demographic composition evolve as they do in the data.
   As displayed in Figure 16, this transition propensity is particularly important before the onset of
the Great Recession. Of the fall in routine employment experienced up to 2007, 36% is mitigated by
holding these propensities constant. The role of this channel in more recent years is smaller, mitigating
7% of the fall to the end of the sample. This is due entirely to its effect on routine manual employment,
as the counterfactual series for ERC is essentially indistinguishable from the actual series by 2012.


5.4    Other switching rates
Our final experiment investigates the role of direct transitions across occupations for workers who
report being employed from one month to the next, so called “job-to-job” transition rates across


                                                   44
Figure 15: Routine Employment - Inflow Rates from Non-Participation to Routine Employment at
their pre-polarization levels




occupational groups. Unfortunately, due to the 1994 redesign of the CPS and the discontinuities
induced in the measurement of such transitions, we only investigate the role of these propensity changes
for a much shorter time frame. For this experiment, we hold the job-to-job transition propensities across
occupation groups constant for all demographic groups at their values during the earliest post-redesign
phase, namely the 1994:1-2001:2 expansion.
   As such, this experiment investigates the role of changes in occupational mobility from the 2001
recession onward in accounting for the decline in routine employment. The results are plotted in
Figure 17. Changes in occupational mobility rates since the 1990s play a small role in the fall in
routine employment after the Great Recession: the counterfactual mitigates 12% of the decline to the
end of 2012.


5.5    Summary
The results from the counterfactual experiments in this section are summarized in Table 14.31 In
short, we find that changes in the demographic composition of the US population can account for
approximately 30% of the fall in routine manual employment and less than 10% of the fall in routine
cognitive employment. The remainder of the fall is due to changes in transition propensities, and their
interaction with demographic change. Transition propensities between employment and labor force
  31 As in Section 3, we find that changes in the separation rate from routine employment to unemployment have

essentially no quantitative impact on the decline in routine employment and do not report them here.

non-participation, in both directions, are important in accounting for the dynamics of routine employ-
ment up to 2007. Starting in the Great Recession, the inflow propensities from non-participation and
unemployment become the key determinants of the decline, and lack of recovery, of routine employ-
ment.
   To illustrate the overall importance of these key propensity channels, we conduct a comprehensive
counterfactual experiment in which we simultaneously hold all of the key transition propensities at
their pre-polarization values. The results are plotted in Figure 18. Relative to the benchmark time
series of per capita routine employment, holding these transition propensities fixed mitigates 35% of
the decline leading into the Great Recession, and 50% of the decline to the end of the sample.


5.6     Further details on counterfactual results
Which are the “key” demographic groups?

In this subsection, we provide further analysis on the results of the counterfactual exercises presented
above. We first ask: of all demographic groups considered in the counterfactual analysis, whose
propensity change is most important in accounting for the decline of per capita routine employment?
To investigate this, we recompute the comprehensive counterfactual, this time holding constant only
the transition rates for specific demographic groups. For instance, to isolate the role of transition
propensities for males, we hold constant only those for the 77 (out of 144) demographic bins belonging
to men. For brevity, we perform this exercise along three dimensions: (i) gender (male, female), (ii)

education (less than high school, high school diploma or some college, college graduates), and (iii) age
(16-34 year olds, 35-54 year olds, over 55).
   Figure 19 illustrates our principal finding. The blue solid line displays the benchmark time series for
routine employment. The green hatched line repeats the counterfactual series from Figure 18, in which
the key transition propensities for all demographic groups are held at pre-polarization levels. The red
hatched line displays the counterfactual when only the transition propensities for 16-34 year olds are
held constant. As is evident, much of the mitigating effect of the full counterfactual exercise is achieved
by the counterfactual performed only with the propensities of the young. In analysis not presented
here for brevity (and available from the authors upon request), we find that this is due primarily to
the fact that 16-34 year olds have experienced disproportionately large changes in transition rates; this
is especially true for the return job finding rates from unemployment (U R → ER) and finding rates
from non-participation (N LF → ER) into routine employment.
   Finally, though we do not depict this in Figure 19, we find that much of the mitigating effect of the
full counterfactual on ERM is achieved by a counterfactual performed only with the propensities of
males. Similarly, much of the effect of the full counterfactual on ERC is achieved by a counterfactual
performed only with the propensities of females. These final two results are, perhaps, not surprising
given the evidence reported in Table 2. Specifically, routine manual occupations are predominantly
male occupations, and routine cognitive occupations are predominantly female.

Understanding the differences with the aggregate counterfactuals

Finally, we note that the fraction of the long-run decline in routine employment accounted for by the
key transition propensites, as summarized in Table 14, is smaller than that accounted for by the same
transition rates in Section 3, and summarized in Table 4.
    To understand the source of this difference, recall that in Section 5, the sample of individuals is
divided into 144 bins according to demographic characteristics (age, eduation, gender, marital status,
race). As such, the aggregate switching rate from labor market state A to state B is given by:

                                                      144
                                                      X
                                            ρAB
                                             t    =         sA   AB
                                                             tj ρtj                                      (5)
                                                      j=1


where sA                                                           AB
       tj is the share of demographic group j within state A, and ρtj is the transition rate for
demographic group j between states A and B.
    In Section 3, aggregate transition rates are held at their pre-polarization levels in the counterfactual
experiments. In terms of equation (5), this can be interpreted as replacing both the demographic com-
position (i.e., the shares, sA                                               AB
                             tj ) and the group- specific transition rates (ρtj ) with their pre-polarization
values. By contrast, in Section 5, when holding transition propensities at their pre-polarization levels,
we do this individually for each demographic group. The counterfactual values of the aggregate tran-
sition rate, ρAB
              t , then vary over time because of changes in the demographic composition, i.e., changes
in sA
    tj .
    To visualize this, Appendix Figure A.2 plots the key transition rates identified as accounting for


                                                      49
the bulk of the fall in routine employment. For each transition rate, we plot (i) the benchmark series,
which corresponds to the phase averages as observed in the data, (ii) the counterfactual transition
rates used in Section 3, and (iii) the implied counterfactual transition rates from Section 5.
    To summarize briefly, Appendix Figure A.2 shows that in the counterfactuals of Section 5, outflow
rates from routine employment to non-participation are lower than in Section 3, while inflow rates from
non-participation to routine employment are slightly higher. This explains why, in comparing Tables
4 and 14, these labor market transitions account for a larger fraction of the fall in routine employment
in Section 5.
    However, the return job finding rates from routine unemployment are lower in the Section 5 coun-
terfactuals compared to Section 3. The quantitative effect of the return job finding rate dominates,
implying that transition propensities account for less of the fall in routine employment when com-
pared to transition rates overall. The difference in the counterfactual return job finding rates between
Sections 3 and 5 are due to the difference in the implied composition of the unemployment pool.
    For the return job finding rate into routine manual jobs, the key difference in demographic com-
position is the reduction in the share of white males, 16-35 year olds, with less than college education
in the Section 5 counterfactuals. This group accounted for about a third of the pool of unemployed
routine manual workers in the pre-polarization era, and its share almost halved (to 17%) by the final
phase in the sample. Importantly, such individuals had an average return job finding rate of 32% com-
pared to an average of 11% for unemployed routine manual workers from other demographic groups.
For the return job finding rate into routine cognitive employment, the key difference is the fall in the
share of white females, 16-35 years old, with less than college education. This group accounted for
approximately 30% of the routine cognitive unemployment pool in the pre-polarization era, and halved
to 15% by the final phase in the sample. Moreover, this group had an average return job finding rate of
18% compared to an average of 8% for unemployed routine cognitive workers from other demographic
groups.
    To summarize, the results of Section 5 attribute less importance to changes in transition propen-
sities, relative to the importance attributed to transition rates in Section 3. This is because the coun-
terfactual exercises performed with transition propensities allow for demographic change—specifically,
for the increased educational attainment and aging observed in the U.S. population.


6     Conclusions
In this paper, we use matched individual-level data from the monthly Current Population Survey
(CPS) to analyze transitions into and out of employment in routine occupations at the “micro” and
“macro” levels. At the macro level, we find that changes in three transition rate categories are of
primary importance in accounting for the disappearance of per capita routine employment. The first
is a fall in transition rates from unemployment to routine employment. This includes falls in both
“return” job finding rates and “switching” job finding rates, with the former being quantitatively most
important. The second change is a fall in transition rates from labor force non-participation to routine
employment. The third is a rise in transition rates from routine employment to non-participation.
Changes in the finding rates into routine employment (the first and second factors) are important in



                                                   50
accounting for the decline both leading into the Great Recession and, especially, thereafter. Changes
in the separation rate from routine employment to non-participation matter primarily prior to 2007.
   At the “micro” level, we study how these transition rates have changed across the pre- and post-job
polarization eras, and the extent to which these changes are accounted for by changes in demograph-
ics or by changes in the behavior of individuals with particular demographic characteristics. Using
a Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition analysis, we find that the changes are primarily accounted for by
changes in transition propensities. With respect to entry and exit rates to and from routine manual
employment, changes in propensities have been particularly acute for males, the young, and those with
lower levels of education. With respect to the fall in the propensity to switch from unemployment to
routine cognitive employment, this is particularly strong for females, the prime-aged, and those with
higher levels of education. In terms of the rise in the propensity to transition out of the labor force
from routine cognitive employment, the effect is strongest for men and the young.
   Our final contribution is to quantify the relative importance of demographic change and transition
propensity changes in accounting for the disappearance of routine employment. We find that demo-
graphic composition change in the U.S. population can account for at most 30% of the fall in per capita
routine manual employment, and less than 10% of the fall in per capita routine cognitive employment.
As such, the primary factor in the decline of routine employment is propensity change, that is, change
in demographic-group specific transition rates. Moreover, we find that it is the change in transition
propensities of the young that are of primary importance.
   The results in this paper provide a much richer picture of the way in which polarization has
occurred over recent decades. Our findings suggest that changes in the occupational choices of young
workers play a prominent role in accounting for the decline of routine employment. A further empirical
analysis of these changes and their implications for entry wages and future career progression would
be an interesting direction for future research.
