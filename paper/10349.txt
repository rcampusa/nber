Do Foreign Students Crowd Out Native Students from Graduate Programs?

JEL No. I2

                                            ABSTRACT

This paper examines how the growth in the number of foreign students enrolled in graduate
programs affects native enrollment in those programs. Although there is little evidence of a
crowdout effect for the typical native student, the impact of foreign students on native educational
outcomes differs dramatically across ethnic groups, and is particularly adverse for white native men.
There is a strong negative correlation between increases in the number of foreign students enrolled
at a particular university and the number of white native men in that university's graduate program.
This crowdout effect is strongest at the most elite institutions.

               DO FOREIGN STUDENTS CROWD OUT NATIVE STUDENTS
                         FROM GRADUATE PROGRAMS?

I. Introduction

        The Immigration and Nationality Act provides two types of “nonimmigrant” (i.e., non-

permanent) visas for persons wishing to study in the United States. The “F-1” visa is for

academic studies, and the “M-1” visa is for vocational studies. The number of visas issued to

foreign students increased greatly in recent decades. In 1980, 155.0 thousand foreigners were

granted temporary visas to study in the United States. By 2000, the number of student visas

totaled 315.4 thousand, with the bulk of the visas (98.0 percent) being granted to persons

enrolled in academic programs.

        As a result of the increasing number of visas granted to foreign students, the share of

nonresident aliens enrolled in graduate programs in the United States rose from 5.5 percent in

1976 to 12.4 percent in 1999. This increase had a particularly large impact on graduate

enrollment in the sciences. By 1999-2000, nonresident aliens received 38.2 percent of all

doctorates awarded in the physical sciences, 52.1 percent in engineering, 26.6 percent in the life

sciences, and 22.8 percent in the social sciences (U.S. Department of Education, 2002, Tables

208, 275).

        Remarkably, there has been practically no research analyzing the costs and benefits of

foreign students. We know almost nothing about their impact on the higher education system,

their impact on the U.S. labor market, and their impact on the economies of the source

countries.1 This paper investigates how the rapid growth in the number of foreign students

enrolled in graduate programs affected native enrollment in those programs. If the number of

slots in graduate programs were fixed, any increase in the number of foreign students would

crowd out natives who would presumably have filled those positions. Even if the graduate

programs were expanding, an increase in the supply of foreign students might sufficiently alter

incentives for natives to pursue some programs, particularly if many foreign students stay in the

United States and reduce economic opportunities in some occupations.

        On aggregate, the empirical analysis reported in this paper shows that there is little

evidence of a crowdout effect for the typical native. This result, however, masks sizable

differences in the impact of foreign students across ethnic groups and between native men and

women. In fact, there is a strong negative correlation between increases in the number of foreign

students enrolled at a particular university and the number of white native men enrolled in that

university’s graduate program. The study thus suggests that the growth in foreign student

enrollment has indeed altered the educational opportunities available to white native men.




II. The Crowdout Effect

        A university’s decision to admit additional foreign students to its graduate program

obviously depends on many factors, including the relative quality of the applicants, the

possibility that foreign students pay for a higher fraction of their education, the widespread

adoption of the axiom that “diversity” is beneficial in a university setting, and the relative


         1 A few studies examine how foreign-born teaching assistants affect the educational outcomes experienced
by native-born undergraduates; see, for instance, Jacobs and Friedman (1988), Borjas (2000), and Fleisher,
Hashimoto, and Weinberg (2003). Hoxby (1998) and Betts (1998) present the only studies that explicitly focus on
measuring the impact of immigrants on the high school completion rates or enrollment rates in undergraduate
programs of native students. Borjas (2002) summarizes some of the available evidence and details the research
questions that would lie at the core of any cost-benefit evaluation of the foreign student program.
                                                  4

marginal products of the foreign and native students as employees of the university (since many

graduate students typically work as research assistants or teaching assistants). Some of these

factors may imply that, other things being equal, admission officers would prefer to admit a

foreign student over a native-born applicant.

       The admission and eventual enrollment of foreign students alters the educational

opportunities available to qualified natives in two distinct ways. First, it may be the case that the

number of slots available in a particular graduate program is fixed in the short run. The

enrollment of an additional foreign student would then necessarily imply that one fewer native

student would be enrolled. This is the simplest and clearest case of a crowdout effect. Even if the

university were expanding and admitting more foreign and more native students, there may still

be a crowdout effect in the sense that native enrollment would have risen faster if the university

had not increased its supply of foreign students. In the empirical analysis reported below, I adopt

the conservative definition of a crowdout effect that requires native enrollment to actually fall

(rather than not rise as much as it would have risen otherwise) when the number of foreign

students increases.

       The entry of foreign students can alter the educational decisions made by native students

in another, less direct, way. In particular, an increase in the number of enrolled foreign students

may affect the incentives that natives have to pursue some educational programs. Suppose, for

instance, that many of the foreign students enrolled in a particular program (e.g., computer

science) remain in the United States after graduation. One would then expect that wages in these

computer-related occupations would fall and those occupations would become relatively less
                                                           5

attractive to natives.2 The foreign students may still choose to enter those low-paying jobs

because their career decisions are mainly guided by the fact that the student visa is perceived as

providing an entry ticket into the United States, so that they would be comparing the low U.S.

wage in a computer-related occupation with the even lower wage that would be available if they

remained in the source countries. In contrast, native students have many more career choices,

and would shy away from applying to those educational programs where foreign students cluster.

In the long run, this behavioral response would again imply that an increase in the enrollment of

foreign students in a particular program would reduce the number of natives enrolled in that

program.3

         There is one important distinction between the two types of crowdout effects discussed

above. The first crowdout effect is specific to a particular university—and indicates how native

enrollment in that institution changes as the number of foreign students enrolled in that

institution increases. The second crowdout effect results from an economy-wide behavioral

response that effectively inhibits natives from pursuing particular educational programs in all

universities (or perhaps from pursuing a graduate education altogether if the labor supply

increase resulting from the foreign student program is sufficiently large in all fields). The

empirical analysis presented below nets out these economy-wide fluctuations and examines the

shifts that occur in native enrollment within a particular university as the size of the foreign

student population increases. The study, therefore, will isolate the institution-specific type of

crowdout effect.


         2 Borjas (2003) presents the most recent evidence on the wage impact of immigration in the U.S. labor
market. He finds that an immigration-induced 10 percent increase in the number of workers belonging to a particular
skill group lowers the wage of that group by 3 to 4 percent.

         3  Freeman et al (2001) describe how the major shifts in the bioscience job market, shifts that are partly due
to the influx of foreign students, alter the incentives for pursuing careers in that sector.

III. Data

         Since 1986, the Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System (IPEDS) has collected

detailed information on enrollment, employment, and finances in institutions of higher education.

Each institution reports the number of persons enrolled in particular programs both at the

undergraduate and graduate levels, including the gender and race of students, as well as the

number of nonresident aliens (which, for simplicity, I will refer to as “foreign students”). The

educational institution also reports detailed information on expenditures in various categories

relevant to the higher education sector (e.g., instruction and research). Prior to 1986, the same

type of information was collected by the Higher Education General Information System

(HEGIS), a precursor of the IPEDS data. My empirical analysis uses enrollment information

provided by both of these surveys.

         My analysis focuses on enrollment trends in graduate programs. These enrollment

statistics do not include students who attend professional schools.4 Further, the analysis is

restricted to higher education institutions in the United States that are accredited at the college

level by the U.S. Department of Education and that are legally authorized to offer at least a one-

year program of study creditable to a degree.5

         My empirical study of enrollment trends uses the cross-sections observed in 1978, 1982,

1986, 1990, 1994, and 1998. In each of these cross-sections, I calculate the total number of

graduate students enrolled in each institution, regardless of whether they are enrolled full-time or


        4 In the IPEDS file, professional students include students enrolled in professional programs in schools of
law, medicine, and dentistry, but do not include students attending business or engineering schools. The business
and engineering students are classified as graduate students, and are therefore included in the analysis that follows.
                                                          7

part-time. The choice of the timing of the cross-section snapshots is due to two factors. Prior to

the 1990s, the IPEDS surveys were not conducted annually, and some of the available cross-

sections do not contain any information on the number of foreign students enrolled in the

institution. Further, the four-year gap across cross-sections implies that there is a significant

turnover in the graduate student population of a particular institution from survey to survey,

minimizing the problems that would arise if many students were double-counted because they

appeared in several surveys.6 Because the IPEDS contains only limited information on field of

study, I restrict the analysis to the size of the entire graduate program at a particular institution.

         Table 1 summarizes the enrollment trends for various groups of students. The number of

foreign students more than doubled between 1978 and 1998, from 79.4 thousand to 194.3

thousand. There has also been a sizable increase in the number of native-born graduate students.

In 1978, there were 1.2 million native graduates students, and this number increased to 1.4

million in 1990, and to 1.6 million in 1998. It turns out, however, that all of this growth occurred

among native women. In contrast, the number of male native-born students hovered around 600

thousand throughout the entire period.

         One particular group of natives—white men—will play a significant role in the analysis

reported below. They are the only native group that had a lower enrollment in graduate programs

at the end of the period than at the beginning. In particular, there were 556.0 thousand white

native men enrolled in graduate programs in 1978. This statistic fell to 539 thousand in 1990, and




         5
         Operationally, this sample restriction limits the study to institutions that have a valid Federal Interagency
Committee on Education (FICE) code.

         6  Alternatively, I could have analyzed enrollment trends for first-time graduate students (an enrollment
statistic that is also reported in the IPEDS). These data, however, seem to contain significant measurement errors,
particularly in the earlier surveys.
                                                      8

to 509 thousand in 1998. Note, however, that graduate enrollment for this group did not decline

monotonically throughout the period.




IV. Estimating Crowdout Effects

        Let Nit denote the number of native graduate students enrolled in university i at time t,

and let Fit denote the respective number of foreign students. Much of the statistical evidence

reported in this paper is obtained by stacking the enrollment data obtained from the HEGIS and

IPEDS across universities and surveys and estimating the regression model:



(1)             Nit = θ Fit + si + πt + εit,



where si is a vector of fixed effects indicating the university; and πt is a vector of fixed effects

indicating the time period. The university fixed effects absorb any university-specific factors that

may determine the size of native enrollment. The period fixed effects absorb any time-specific

factors that determine the size of the native population interested in pursuing a graduate

education at a particular point in time. Throughout the analysis, the regression will be weighted

by the total enrollment of the graduate program in a particular university at a particular point in

time (or Nit + Fit). Further, the standard errors are clustered by university to adjust for possible

serial correlation within a particular institution.

        Under some conditions, the magnitude of the coefficient θ provides information about the

crowdout effect suggested by the enrollment data. In particular, θ measures what happens to

native enrollment within a particular university when that institution decides to enroll one more

foreign student. If the estimate of θ were zero, for example, the data would indicate that the
                                                 9

enrollment of an additional foreign student simply expands the size of the university and has no

effect on its pre-existing (native) enrollment. If the estimate of θ were −1, there would be a one-

to-one crowdout effect. The total number of students enrolled in the university’s graduate

program is constant, and each additional foreign student displaces a native student who

presumably would have otherwise enrolled. Of course, θ may also be positive, perhaps even

exceeding one. Over time, some universities have expanded, and the coefficient θ measures how

this expansion affected the relative enrollment of native and foreign students.

        The top panel of Table 2 reports the coefficient θ estimated from various specifications of

the model. Each coefficient reported in the table is estimated from a different regression model,

where the dependent variable is the number of native graduate students in a particular race-

gender group. Consider the first regression coefficient reported in the table, where the dependent

variable is the total number of natives (both men and women) enrolled in school i at time t and

the independent variable gives the total number of foreign students enrolled in that school at that

time. The estimated coefficient is .046 (with a standard error of .279), indicating that an

additional foreign student, at the margin, had no impact on the number of natives enrolled at that

institution.

        This aggregate correlation, however, masks a great deal of dispersion, particularly in

terms of the impact of foreign students on the enrollment of natives who differ in their gender

and ethnic background. Most important, Table 2 documents the existence of a significant

negative correlation between foreign students and the enrollment of white native men. For this

group, the coefficient is -.418 (.139). This negative coefficient does not indicate that graduate

enrollment for this group was declining at every university. That potential trend is absorbed by

the period fixed effects included in the regression model. Instead, the estimated coefficient
                                                          10

indicates that the enrollment of white native men fell most in those schools that had larger

increases in the number of foreign students enrolled. In short, the evidence suggests a significant

institution-specific crowdout effect of foreign students on the enrollment of white men.7

         The raw data underlying this result can be easily illustrated. Figure 1 presents the scatter

diagram that relates the 1978-98 change in the enrollment of white native men to the respective

change in the number of foreign students enrolled at a particular university. Each point in the

scatter diagram, therefore, represents enrollment changes that occurred at a school over the

period. It is clear that the enrollment of white native men fell most steeply in those schools that

had the largest increases in foreign student enrollment.

         Because graduate education for both foreign and native students is highly subsidized by

U.S. taxpayers (Winston 1999), it is important to determine if the crowdout effect differs

between public and private institutions. The bottom two panels of Table 2 report some of the

regression coefficients estimated in each of the two sectors. Although the crowdout effect on

white native men is negative and significant in both sectors, it is substantially larger in private

universities. Moreover, the regression for white native women suggests that they may be

crowded out of private institutions as well. In fact, the coefficient for total white native

enrollment in the private sector is -.856 (.428), suggesting a one-to-one displacement of white

natives as foreign student enrollment increases.8




         7The estimated crowdout effects would be even stronger if the enrollment data also included enrollment in
professional programs. In particular, the estimated coefficient for native white men would be -.576 (.145).

         8 It is worth stressing that the potential crowdout effect of foreign students on white native men isolates a
unique relationship that is not found when one contrasts the enrollment trends of white native men with other
groups. A regression of the enrollment of white native men on the number of foreign students and the number of
white native women (as well as institution and period fixed effects) indicates that an increase in the number of
                                                          11


    Crowdout and School Quality

         Any policy evaluation of a potential crowdout effect will depend on the constraints that

the enrollment of foreign students imposes on the educational access available to natives. As a

result, it is important to examine how the crowdout effect varies across institutions that differ in

the quality of their graduate programs.

         To assign a quality ranking to a particular institution, I used the data on instructional

expenditures reported in the IPEDS files. I calculated the average per-student instructional

expenditures for the survey years 1990-1993.9 The averaging of the expenditure data over the

four years helps to minimize the problem of both measurement error and short-run fluctuations in

instructional expenditures. I divided the population of institutions into 50 quantiles. There are

approximately 1,100 institutions in my data extract, so that each quantile of the distribution

contains around 22 schools. The top two quantiles of this distribution contain the list of “usual

suspects,” including Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Columbia, and the California Institute of

Technology.

         Figure 2 presents the cumulative probability distributions for the stock of foreign and

native students (as of 1998) along the quality spectrum. Native enrollment is much more evenly

distributed across the spectrum than is foreign enrollment. For instance, 48.0 percent of natives

are enrolled in schools in the bottom 30 quantiles of the quality distribution, as compared to only

22.8 percent of foreign students.


foreign students reduces the enrollment of white native men, but an increase in the number of white native women
does not. The estimated coefficients are -.539 (.109) and .496 (.060), respectively.

          9 The denominator includes all undergraduate and graduate students, regardless of whether they are
enrolled part-time or full-time. The expenditure data was deflated using the CPI-U series. I restricted the set of
institutions to those that reported an average per-student expenditure of less than $100,000 (eliminating mainly
medical, law, and theological schools from the data). The data on instructional expenditures is not available for
approximately 20 percent of the institutions. These institutions are omitted from the analysis reported in this
subsection.
                                                  12

       Equally important, there is an important difference in how enrollment grew for foreign

and native students across the various quantiles. Figure 3 shows that native enrollment between

1978 and 1998 grew fastest at the lower-quality institutions, while foreign enrollment grew

fastest at the higher-quality institutions. The figure also suggests that the crowdout effect of

foreign students on white native men isolates a unique relationship that is not found when one

contrasts the enrollment trends of white native men with other groups. The 1980s and 1990s

witnessed not only a large increase in foreign enrollment, but also a large increase in the number

of native women enrolled in graduate programs. Figure 3 shows that native women are much

more evenly scattered across the quality spectrum, so that the growth of women occurred in the

same types of institutions where the enrollment of white native men grew most (or decreased

least). In short, there is no evidence that the increase in the supply of native women in graduate

programs crowded out native white men.

       Table 3 reports the coefficient θ from regression models estimated separately in sets of

institutions of roughly similar quality. The correlation between the enrollment of white native

men and foreign students is slightly positive for the lower-quality schools (.188, with a standard

error of .281), turns zero for schools in the middle of the quality distribution (-.038, with a

standard error of .140), and becomes negative for schools at the top of the distribution (-.493,

with a standard error of .167). In fact, the coefficient is most negative when the regression model

is estimated in the subset of elite institutions in the 50th quantile. The crowdout effect for white

native men is then -.605 (.253). In fact, the table suggests that there may also be a crowdout

effect for white native women at these elite institutions.
                                                        13


   Reverse Causality

       An alternative interpretation of the negative sign of the coefficient θ is that universities

increased their enrollment of foreign graduate students because they faced a substantial decline

in the number of (qualified) white native men who wished to enroll in their graduate programs.

The decline in the number of white native men could be due to changing demographics: there

may have been a substantial decline in the size of the population of white native men who are

college graduates. One problem with this hypothesis is that the period fixed effects included in

the regression model already control for such demographic trends. Moreover, the actual

demographic trends are not consistent with this hypothesis. The pool of potential graduate

students among white native men rose dramatically between 1970 and 1980 (as the baby

boomers reached their 20s), but declined by only about 200 thousand persons since then, with

almost all of the decline occurring between 1980 and 1990. In contrast, the number of native

white men enrolled in graduate programs has hovered between 500 and 550 thousand throughout

the past two decades.10

       Alternatively, one could argue that white native men simply do not longer wish to pursue

careers that require a graduate education. This counterfactual resembles the often-heard

argument that “immigrants do jobs that natives do not want to do” in the U.S. labor market. If

one takes this set of arguments seriously, it would seem to imply that there are few jobs that

natives do want to do. The argument is used to justify why immigrants do not compete with low-

skill workers, such as gardeners and taxi drivers—since natives do not want to perform those

presumably menial jobs. It is also used to justify why increased immigration of high-tech

workers is needed to alleviate presumed labor shortages in the high-tech sector—since natives do


       10   See also the related evidence presented by Groen and Rizzo (2003).
                                                  14

not want to be software programmers. And, in this context, it would be used to explain why

immigrants do not crowd out natives from graduate programs, since white native men no longer

wish to attend graduate school.

       It is unlikely that this is a valid conjecture. After all, the greatest declines in the

enrollment of white native men occurred at high-quality institutions. Surely all potential graduate

students—regardless of their race—would prefer to attend those institutions that provide the best

job opportunities after graduation. Of course, it is possible that it is the most qualified white

native men who no longer wish to attend graduate school, so that graduate programs have a

shortage of qualified applicants and are forced to fill in the existing slots with foreign applicants.

Moreover, note that the number of white native women attending elite institutions was adversely

affected by the growing enrollment of foreign students—despite the very large increase in the

number of women enrolling in graduate programs.




V. Summary and Implications

       The evidence presented in this paper documents a strong negative correlation between the

enrollment of white native men in graduate programs and the enrollment of foreign students.

Those educational institutions that experienced the largest increases in foreign enrollment are

also the institutions that experienced the steepest drops in the enrollment of white native men.

The evidence is consistent with the hypothesis that foreign students limit the opportunities

available to white native men in graduate education, particularly at the most elite institutions.

       It is worth stressing that the potential crowdout effect of foreign students on the

enrollment of white native men may not signal a suboptimal allocation of resources in the

graduate education sector. The implications of the finding depend crucially on three related
                                                 15

issues. First, what happens to the displaced white native men? Second, what happens to the

foreign students after they complete their education? Finally, what are the costs and benefits that

foreign students impart on universities and on the U.S. economy?

       The first of these questions is difficult to answer, as we simply do not know the career

choices made by the displaced white men (and it is difficult to imagine a simple way of

measuring this counterfactual). Did these men move on to lower-quality graduate programs, or

did many of them decide to forego a graduate education altogether? Moreover, any cost-benefit

analysis requires information on how these men would have fared had they attended the graduate

program of their choice.

       We could potentially learn more about the career choices and contributions made by the

foreign students after they complete their graduate education. Over 50 percent of foreign students

who received their doctorates in the 1990s stayed in the United States (Finn 2000). What is the

nature of the selection that determines the population of stayers?

       Finally, foreign students impart many other costs and benefits. They pay tuition, and

these tuition revenues—if they were to exceed the actual cost of providing an education—could

be an additional source of economic benefit. But the pricing of higher education in the United

States is highly distorted in both private and public institutions, with the typical tuition payment

not being sufficiently large to cover the actual cost of an education. If immigration policy is

supposed to benefit the native population, it may be difficult to justify a subsidy system that

limits educational opportunities for many native students unless the economic gains from foreign

students are very large. Although we do not know the size of these gains, it is well documented

that foreign doctorates who reside in the United States contribute disproportionately to the

advancement of science (Stephan and Levin 2001). At the same time, however, existing
                                                 16

calculations of the economic benefits from immigration tend to suggest that the net benefit that

accrues to the native-born population is small (Borjas, 1995; Johnson, 1998).

       In sum, although the rapid growth of the foreign student program in the past two decades

has altered the higher education sector in significant ways, there is still much to learn before we

can objectively assess the costs and benefits of this important shift in the parameters of U.S.

immigration policy.
