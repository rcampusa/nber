                                         ABSTRACT

We examine whether sentiment influences aggregate demand by studying the relationship
between the Michigan Survey expectations concerning national output growth and future
economic activity at the state level. We instrument for local sentiments with political outcomes,
positing that agents in states with a higher share of congressmen from the political party of the
sitting President will be more optimistic. This instrument is strong in the first stage, and our
results confirm a positive relationship between sentiments and future state economic activity that
is robust to a battery of sensitivity tests.

1. Introduction
        There is some evidence of a contemporaneous correlation between measures of consumer

sentiment and economic activity. The headline University of Michigan Index of Consumer

Sentiment (ICS) has been shown to be closely correlated with growth in personal consumption

expenditures over the postwar period [Carroll, et al (1994)]. This observed correlation in the

data can be interpreted in different ways. It is possible that sentiments only reflect knowledge

about current or future economic fundamentals. Some of the empirical literature has therefore

concentrated on testing the restrictions that predict a causal link between sentiment changes and

economic activity. Along these lines, there is also some evidence that sentiment measures

unexplained by economic fundamentals are associated with spending shocks [e.g. Oh and

Waldman (1990), Carroll, et al (1994), Starr (2012)]. However, the contribution of sentiment

shocks “unrelated” to other measures of fundamentals has been found to be only temporary [e.g.

Starr (2012)] and small [e.g. Ludvigson (2004)]. 1

         Nonetheless, some theories suggest that shifts in consumer sentiments, like positive

shocks to expectations concerning future output or future output growth, can indeed be “self-

fulfilling,” and therefore constitute multiple rational expectations equilibria. Indeed these

sentiment-driven, self-fulfilling rational expectations equilibria can arise in various models of

endogenous growth, in models of real business cycles with external effects, in models with

collateral or borrowing constraints, or in search models with aggregate demand externalities, as

well as in OLG models. Stochastic sentiments or sunspots can randomize locally over a

continuum of rational expectations equilibria converging to an indeterminate steady state, or


1
 Most of these studies concentrate on the implications of sentiment changes on consumption. Permanent income
theories however suggest that agents should spread the impact of improved economic prospects on their
consumption over the course of their lifetime. Observed responses over longer time horizons may also be difficult
to identify as new shocks emerge and fundamentals respond to changes caused by sentiment shocks.

                                                       1
alternatively across distinct multiple steady states. 23 Alternatively, even if the fundamentals-

based equilibrium is unique, information frictions and incomplete markets can give rise to

distinct sentiment driven stochastic rational expectations equilibria. 4

         Barsky and Sims (2012) distinguish between “animal spirits” shocks and news or

information shocks using a VAR framework. 5 They only consider “animal spirits” shocks that

are “erroneous” or irrational, and explicitly exclude sunspot shocks that are self-fulfilling under

rational expectations. They argue that such animal spirits shocks unrelated to fundamentals are

likely to have an immediate but transitory impact on economic activity. Therefore positive

shocks to animal spirits are likely to look like positive aggregate demand shocks in the short run,

but eventually will peter out if they are not followed by real increases in productivity. Using this

assumption as an identification strategy in their VARs, they find that unexplained innovations to

consumer confidence are the result of slowly building news about “apparently permanent”

current and future economic fundamentals, rather than emanating from changes in “animal

spirits” or self-fulfilling expectation shifts that can drive the economy across multiple equilibria

or across multiple steady states.

 See for example Benhabib and Farmer (1999), Benhabib, Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2000, 2001), Benhabib and
Wang (2013), Howitt and McAfee (1988), and Kaplan and Menzio (2013)].

3
  Self-fulfilling changes in consumer sentiment have also been identified in the literature in a number of alternative
ways, as self-fulfilling prophecies [e.g. Azariadis (1981), Farmer (1999), herding [e.g. Blanchard (2016)], and animal
spirits [e.g. Keynes (1936) and Akerlof and Shiller (2010)]. Here, unless indicated otherwise, we use changes in
sentiments to describe changes in beliefs unrelated to fundamentals.4 See for example Shell (1977) and Cass and
Shell (1983), Maskin and Tirole (1987), Aumann, Peck and Shell (1988), and more recently Angeletos and La’O
(2013)], and Benhabib, et al (2015).

                                                          2
       This interpretation is based on the assumption that sentiment shocks or expectation

shocks that do not reflect news about fundamentals only have temporary effects in equilibrium.

However many economic models generate persistent stochastic fluctuations under rational

expectations, driven by sunspot randomizations over multiple equilibria, or by correlated

stochastic equilibria driven by sentiment or expectation shocks. Furthermore, the stochastic

properties of such self-fulfilling equilibria depend, at least in part, on the stochastic processes

driving the sunspots or sentiment shocks, in addition to model-specific internal propagation

mechanisms for such shocks. The sentiment shocks themselves can be driven by general Markov

processes with arbitrary degrees of persistence. Indeed, the fluctuations induced by sentiments

can take the form of randomizations over multiple equilibrium paths around a locally

indeterminate steady state, or alternatively of stochastic fluctuations across multiple steady

states, all under full rational expectations. Depending on the model, these fluctuations can be in

either levels or in growth rates.

       In this paper, however, we do not focus on stochastic properties of sentiments

themselves, which could be highly persistent, or alternatively could be temporary or i.i.d. Instead

we focus on the empirical question as to whether consumer sentiments directly influence output

levels over certain time horizons. It is of course quite possible that sentiment shocks that affect

output growth rates are indeed temporary, and our analysis does not exclude this possibility.

What we demonstrate instead is that sentiment or consumer confidence shocks at the state level

do have a measurable impact on state outputs and consumptions, certainly at one year horizons,

and possibly over longer horizons.

       We concentrate on U.S. state economic activity as the focus of our analysis. We examine

the responses of overall state economic activity to changes in sentiment about national economic

                                                   3
conditions. Our identification strategy relies on the notion that changes in local sentiment about

national economic prospects are likely to induce local changes in consumption and investment

expenditures. As both consumption and investment expenditures are in play, a focus on

aggregate demand and overall economic activity seems useful. Moreover, the output response is

useful as a guide to the implications of sentiment shocks for optimal stabilization policy.

       The use of state data also allows us to condition for aggregate shocks, facilitating the

identification of the direct impact of sentiment changes on economic activity at the state level.

       We use Michigan Surveys (2016) questions concerning national economic conditions.

Our base specification uses the question, “Looking ahead, which would you say is more likely --

that in the country as a whole we'll have continuous good times during the next 5 years or so, or

that we will have periods of widespread unemployment or depression, or what?” Our maintained

hypothesis is that states are sufficiently small that attitudes about the local economy will not

distort the response about national economic conditions. Given this assumption, our cross-

sectional treatment should isolate the impact of differences in sentiment across states on future

differences in state economic activity.

       While sentiment data is available at the county level, it seems plausible that substantive

leakage is likely to occur across county lines. This is of course a compromise, as leakages across

state lines are also likely to take place, but they are much less likely to be prevalent than those

across county lines.

       A potential problem with our specification is that household expectations about future

national economic activity may be positively related to local experiences, raising the prospect of

reverse causality in our empirics. We test for this possibility by examining the impact of past

state growth on current sentiment. We do find evidence of such a relationship in the data, as our

                                                  4
coefficient of interest enters at statistically significant levels. We respond to this reverse

causality challenge using instrumental variables estimation. Instrumental variables estimation

will also serve to address the also-likely issue that answers to the Michigan Survey are noisy

measures of consumer sentiment.

        We turn to political data as an instrument for local sentiment levels that vary

systematically across states. There is a large literature that demonstrates a positive relationship

between partisanship and economic assessments. A survey respondent that self-identifies as a

member of one of the major political party is more optimistic about the national economic

picture when the sitting national leader is from that same party. In an early paper, Gerber and

Huber (2009) demonstrate that consumption changes following a political election are correlated

with whether or not the election was won by the preferred political party of the respondent. They

interpret this correlation as working through the sentiment channel.

        Political partisanship has also been used as an instrument for identifying a connection

between sentiment and consumption. Mian, et al (2015) demonstrate that presidential elections

are associated with changes in sentiment about the effectiveness of government policy in line

with political partisanship. However, they find no statistically significant relationship between

changes in the presidential party at the county level in the United States and changes in actual

consumption. 6 In contrast, Gillitzer and Prasad (2015) show in Australian survey data that

higher sentiment is associated with having a member from your political party in office at the

federal level. These changes in sentiment associated with elections are also associated with

increased future vehicle purchase rates.


6
 Mian, et al (2015) examine the cases of the 2000 and 2008 elections. While in neither case do they find evidence
of significant changes in consumption at the county level, they do find a significant correlation between the 2008
election outcome and planned consumption measures consistent with the predictions of a partisanship model of
politically-driven sentiment changes.

                                                        5
        One distinction that favors the Australian study is that Australian survey data has a direct

question about political affiliation. U.S. consumer data, such as that used by Mian, et al (2015) -

and also used in this study – require proxies for political partisanship. The Mian, et al study uses

county-level data on voting in presidential elections. Below, we use the share of state

congressional representatives from the same political party as the sitting president. The latter

proxy has the advantage of changing every two years, yielding more variability in our sample

and allowing us to use our full panel sample. This is desirable because our use of state-level data

to mitigate consumption leakages across counties results in a smaller cross-section than the

Mian, et al (2015) county-level study.

        We demonstrate below that our proxy is a strong instrument in the first stage of our IV

specification, and that the instrumented measure of consumer sentiment is shown to be positively

and statistically significantly associated with State output growth over the following four

quarters.

        These results are shown to be robust to the inclusion or exclusion of state and time fixed

effects, as well as a variety of sensitivity tests. These include weighting observations by either

state size or the number of respondents, or changes in the sample population, dropping specific

time periods, states with exceptionally high or low incomes, investment levels or populations, or

dropping states identified as outliers based on residual values. 7 We also examine robustness to

the use of conventional, rather than heteroskedasticity-corrected standard errors, random instead

of fixed effects, and regional instead of state dummies. The results are also robust to a change to



7
 We do find that our results disappear when we drop the pre-crisis portion of our sample. However, this appears
to be the result that we have a relatively small number of non-crisis years available in our sample. As we discuss
below, our results are also weaker when we drop the post-crisis years (and strengthen when the crisis years are
dropped). It appears that the relationship we identify between sentiment and economic activity broke down
during the crisis period.

                                                         6
annual frequencies, and to the inclusion of lagged state and national output growth in our

specification.

       We also examine other sentiment questions. Here our results are more mixed, but they

remain relatively robust for most alternative sentiment measures. We also consider the impact of

sentiment shocks on state consumption, in the form of personal consumption expenditures at the

state level. Sentiment is found to play a positive role in the determination of consumption a year

out of sample as well.

       Finally, we consider longer-horizon sentiment impacts. We repeat our base specification

to investigate the impact of sentiment on state activity and personal consumption expenditures

over 2 and 3 year horizons. Our results for these longer horizons generally remain strong for

both activity and consumption effects, but we find that our longer horizon activity results lose

their significance when we include time dummies and cluster our standard errors by state.

       The remainder of this paper is organized into 7 sections. The following section

introduces our data summary statistics. Section 3 discusses our IV methodology. Section 4

describes our base specification results. Section 4 subjects these results to a battery of robustness

tests. Section 5 discusses our IV specification and results. Section 6 reports our results for

longer horizons. Section 7 concludes.



2. Data

       Quarterly sentiment data is obtained from 2004 through 2015 from the University of

Michigan Surveys of Consumers (2017). Our base gauge of consumer sentiment is the answer to

question BUS5 in the survey, “Looking ahead, which would you say is more likely -- that in the

country as a whole we'll have continuous good times during the next 5 years or so, or that we



                                                 7
will have periods of widespread unemployment or depression, or what?” Respondents’ answers

are scored 1 through 5, with 1 representing the answer “Good times,” 2 representing “Good with

qualifications,” 3 representing “Pro-Con,” 4 representing “Bad with Qualifications,” 5

representing “Bad Times.” There are also a modest number of responses characterized as

“depends,” scored 6 through 99 based on the response. The distribution of responses for the

entire sample is shown in Figure 1. It can be seen that extreme responses of 1 or 5 are most

common.

       Figure 2 displays the relationship between national sentiment and national economic

activity. As in much of the literature, sentiment appears to track current economic activity

closely. For example, it is clear that sentiment declines sharply in tandem with the onset of the

Great Recession. Still, sentiment does not track activity perfectly. Sentiment reaches its lowest

level in 2011, reflecting volatility in financial markets associated with the euro area debt crisis.

Needless to say, while there is a decline in output at this time, it does not match that experienced

during the Great Recession. During that period, sentiment appears to have held up on average

while the US economy fell into recession, and then continued to fall after the recession had

ended. The great recession periods is notable, as sentiment appears to track activity much more

closely both before and after the event.

        It is also difficult to draw any causal inferences from this national picture. Changes in

sentiment may be following national economic conditions, rather than leading them. For that

reason, we turn to state activity data for identification. Reassuringly, there appears to be no

apparent cross-sectional pattern to state responses, either by income, education, geography, or for

the purposes of our IV specification below, political partisanship. In the latter case, note that our

sample period spans years with sitting Presidents from both political parties. 8

        As our base measure of lagged sentiment, GOOD, we consider the share of a state i at

time t-4 whose respondents’ answers were scored 1 or 2.

        We include other variables obtained from the Michigan Surveys to condition on the

characteristics of individual respondents. As our observation is at the state level, these are

measured as state respondent averages, also at time t-4. Our conditioning variables include

income levels by state, INCOME, which is calculated as the average of reported levels of

respondent incomes within a state, EDUC, which is the average of the highest year of education

reported by respondents within a state, and INVEST, which is the share of state respondents who

said that they hold investments. Growth at the state level from period t-4 to t, GGDP, is obtained

from Haver analytics, as is our measure of the national output gap, YGAP.

        Summary statistics are shown in Table 1. It can be seen that there is a lot of variability in

the data in both growth and sentiment measures, unsurprising since our sample includes the

Great Recession period as well as the boom that preceded it. The final three columns show

average growth rates in our pooled sample for states exhibiting high (more than one standard

deviation above the mean) sentiment levels, HGGDP, neutral (within one standard deviation of

the mean) sentiment levels, MGGDP, and low (more than one standard deviation below the

mean), LGGDP, sentiment levels. As expected, it can be seen that subsequent growth on

average is higher following reports of high sentiment levels, and lower for states where low

levels of sentiment on average are reported. However, t-tests for differences in these populations

are not statistically significant.

3. Methodology

3.1 Base specification

        Our base specification is a conventional panel estimator:

                             ∆yit = α + β GOODit − 4 + γ X it − 4 + {δ i } + {ε t } + ηit                   (1)

where ∆yit represents income growth in state i from period t − 4 to the present, GOODit − 4 represents

the share of respondents with positive sentiment responses in state i in period t − 4 , X it − 4 is a vector of

controls linked to state growth via a set of nuisance parameters γ , {δ i } and {ε t } are respectively state

and time-specific fixed effects, and ηit is a is a residual, assumed to be well behaved. Our coefficient of



                                                         11
interest is β , the partial-correlation between sentiment and subsequent state income growth. We use

three covariates in X it − 4 to control for other determinants of state growth available from the respondent

survey, including, INCOME, EDUC, and INVEST, all described above.


        We consider two alternative methods for conditioning for prevailing economic

conditions. First, we include the start-of-period output gap, YGAPt − 4 . Alternatively, we include

yearly time dummies, {ε t } . Quarterly time dummies are included below in our robustness

checks. 9

        It is also quite possible that our data may exhibit heteroscedasticity and correlations

within and across state groups. We therefore use heteroscedasticity-corrected standard errors

throughout, and also allow for cross-sectional or state-specific dependence. For cross-sectional

dependence, which is likely across states in our panel, we use Driscoll-Kraay (1998) estimators.

Hoechle (2007) demonstrates that Driscoll-Kraay standard errors are well-calibrated when cross-

sectional dependence is present. For state-specific dependence, we include state dummies and

cluster by state.

        For those specifications that include a comprehensive set of both time and state-specific

fixed effects, our specification can be interpreted as a difference-in-differences estimator of the

impact of changes in the share of agents within a state holding positive sentiment about future

national economic prospects or not.




9
 We use yearly time dummies because estimating the full set of quarterly dummies results in a substantial loss of
degrees of freedom. Still, as we show in Table 5, our results are robust to the inclusion of quarterly dummies, with
our coefficient of interest retaining significance at least at a 10% confidence level for all estimation methods.


                                                        12
3.2 Endogeneity issues

         One potential challenge in identifying a causal relationship between sentiment and

activity is that opinions about future national economic performances may be based on

individual experiences, and hence tied to the fortunes of the local economy. 10 This would render

a least-squares identification strategy invalid. To test if this is the case, we first examine the

relationship between current state economic growth and current sentiment levels. Our reverse

specification satisfies

                               GOODit = α + β∆yit + γ X it − 4 + {δ i } + {ε t } + ηit                            (2)

where variable definitions are the same as in our base specification and we include the same

nuisance covariates in X it − 4 to control for other determinants of state growth available from the

respondent survey, INCOME, EDUC, and INVEST. We run this specification using ordinary least

squares, with the same variety of error specifications as those in our base specification.

         Our results are shown in the appendix of this paper (Table A2). The data do appear to

indicate that sentiment is associated with local activity, although statistical significance is lost

when time dummies are substituted for the national output gap. Overall, however, there does

indeed seem to be a risk of reverse causality.

         We address this potential issue through instrumental variables (IV). We follow the

literature in turning to political data as an instrument for differences in sentiment levels that vary

systematically across regions. Our posited relationship is that survey respondents will be more



10
  We do find positive, albeit modest, correlations in the survey between responses to our national outlook
question and individual household experiences and expectations. The estimated correlation coefficient between
positive responses to the national economic outlook and positive responses to the question about whether a
household’s financial condition is better or worse off than it was a year ago (question PAGO in the survey) is 0.32,
while the estimated correlation coefficient between expected future national economic conditions and expected
household financial conditions five years in the future (question PEXP5 in the survey) is 0.23.

                                                         13
optimistic about national economic prospects if the sitting president is from his or her political

party.

         Sentiment has been shown in the literature to correspond to economic activity, as in

Gerber and Huber (2009), who identify a positive relationship between partisanship and

economic activity, as consumption changes following a political election are correlated with

whether or not the election was won by the preferred political party of the respondent.

         We expect that the primary channel through which partisanship can affect economic

activity is through changes in sentiment. A positive relationship between political partisanship

and economic sentiment has been demonstrated in the literature. Mian, et al (2015) find that

presidential elections are associated with changes in sentiment about the effectiveness of

government policy in line with political partisanship. However, they find no statistically

significant relationship between changes in the presidential party at the county level in the

United States and changes in actual consumption. In contrast, Gillitzer and Prasad (2015) show

in Australian survey data that higher sentiment is associated with having a member from your

political party in office at the federal level. Changes in sentiment associated with elections are

shown to be associated with increased future vehicle purchase rates.

         One distinction that favors the Australian study is that Australian survey data has a direct

question about political affiliation. U.S. consumer data, such as that used by Mian, et al (2015)

have to use proxies for political partisanship. Their study uses county-level data on voting in

presidential elections. Our study using U.S. data faces the same challenge. To proxy for

political partisanship at the state level, we use the share of state congressional representatives

from the same political party as the sitting president, which we term CONGPRES. Our proxy




                                                  14
has the advantage of changing every two years, with each congressional election, and therefore

yields more variability in our sample.

       We follow this literature in using changes in partisan fortunes as an instrument for

sentiment changes. However, such an instrument would be invalid if the political situation

directly affected underlying economic fundamentals. In particular, it is possible that states with a

higher number of congressional representatives from the same political party as the sitting

president will be favored in political outcomes in a manner that directly supports local economic

conditions. For example, decision about military base closures may be made in geographically

partisan manners.

       Mian, et al (2015) provide two pieces of evidence against this possibility. First, they look

at income growth in U.S. counties before and after Presidential elections. They find no evidence

that Presidential elections are systematically related to changes in county growth in manner

associated with local political leanings. Second, they also find no relationship between election

outcomes and changes in government transfers to localities.

       We provide additional evidence against this potential problem below, by adding taxes

and transfers from the federal government to our base specification. As in these previous

studies, our demonstrated relationship between sentiment and economic activity is robust to

conditioning for federal government economic transfers.



4. Base specification results

       We first examine the first stage of our IV specification to demonstrate that we have a

strong instrument. We include our base specification conditioning variables as well. Our panel

results are shown in Table 2. We consider six variations: Models 1 through 3 include the lagged



                                                15
output gap, while models 4 through 6 include annual time dummies. Models 1 and 4 use robust

standard errors, models 2 and 5 use the Driscoll-Kraay estimators, and models 4 and 6 allow for

clustered standard errors by state. We include state fixed effects throughout.

estimators, and models 4 and 6 allow for clustered standard errors by state. Data is taken for sample
years 2004-2015.



        Our variable of interest, CONGPRES, consistently enters significantly with its expected

positive sign at a 1% confidence level, indicating significant correlation with our sentiment

variable. Our point estimate for this variable is also largely invariant to perturbations in our

specification. We therefore conclude that we have a strong instrument and proceed with our IV

estimation using a two-stage least squares approach.

        The second stage results are shown in Table 3. It can be seen that our variable of interest,

GOOD, enters significantly positively. The instrumented coefficient point estimate in our IV

statistics in parentheses. Models 1 and 4 use robust standard errors, models 2 and 5 use the Driscoll-
Kraay estimators, and models 4 and 6 allow for clustered standard errors by state. Data is taken from
sample years 2006-2016.



                                                   17
specification is large. With the income gap included, it comes in at 0.19 and with state fixed

effects included it comes in at 0.13.

           Overall, the data support a non-trivial sentiment channel for differences in economic

growth across US states. Indeed, if anything, these point estimates appear to be too high. Under

our Model 1 sample, a one standard deviation increase in sentiment would be associated with an

3.6 percentage point increase in state output growth in Models 1 through 3, and a 2.5 percentage

point increase in Models 4 through 6. 11 However, the 95% confidence intervals for these

coefficients allow a one standard deviation increase in sentiment to be associated with an

increase in state output of as low as 1.1 percentage points, a much more plausible figure, for our

base specification with robust standard errors and the income gap included (Models 1-3), and as

low as 75 basis points with robust standard errors and state fixed effects included (Models 4-6).

           Our point estimate for the coefficient of interest, changes in the sentiment share, with the

output gap included is equal to 0.19 with the income gap included, implying that a one standard

deviation increase in our sentiment measure would be associated with a predicted increase in

annualized state GDP growth of approximately 3.6 percent. This seems to be a non-trivial effect,

but one that is not too large to be plausible. Our point estimate with time dummies instead of the

output gap is qualitatively similar, albeit modestly smaller at 0.13.

           All of the specifications are statistically significant, at a 1% confidence level using White

heteroscedasticity-robust standard errors, at a 1% confidence level, using Driscoll-Kraay

standard errors, and at a 5% confidence level with standard errors clustered by states using the

output gap and at a 10% confidence level with clustered standard errors with time dummies

instead of the output gap.



11
     The estimated standard deviation of the variable GOOD in our base sample is equal to 0.19.

                                                          18
        The performances of the conditioning variables are mixed. Only the INCOME variable

enters with statistical significance, and then only in our output gap specifications (Models 1

through 3).



5. Sensitivity analysis

        In this section, we demonstrate that our base results, that state sentiments about national

economic prospects have a direct impact on future state output, are quite robust. We first

demonstrate that our base specifications results are largely robust to a wide variety of sample

perturbations (Table 4).

        For each sample perturbation, we report the point estimate and standard error for the

coefficient of interest, GOOD, for the six Models in our base specification in Table 3. It can be

seen that the variable of interest is robust to a large majority, but not all permutations. First, we

drop the financial crisis period, which we interpret as spanning from 2007Q4 to 2009Q2. It can

be seen that our results get stronger with the removal of the crisis period, as we experience

increases in point estimates and significance for all specifications. 12 The increased significance

when the crisis period is dropped -- which indicates that our results are not driven by the crisis --

suggests that our overall results are likely to strengthen as more data becomes available.

        We next drop observations from “high” (more than one standard deviation above the

mean) and “low” (more than one standard deviation below the mean) average state income

levels. We do the same for high and low reported share of households with investments, and


12
  We also tried dropping the first and last 8 quarters of our sample period, but experienced more sensitivity. In
particular, the GOOD variable of interest drops out with the early sub-sample omitted for all specifications. The
results are more robust with final 8 quarters dropped, entering at a 5% confidence level for all output gap
specifications, but only at a 10% confidence level for the White and Driscoll-Kraay specifications with time
dummies, and narrowly misses significance at a 10% level with standard errors clustered by state. These results
are available from the authors on request.

                                                        19
states with large and small GDPs. Finally, we drop outlier observations, measured as those with

residuals more than two and a half standard deviations above or below zero in our base

specification.

Coefficient estimates are for GOOD sentiment values. T-statistics in parentheses. Models 1 and 4 use
robust standard errors, models 2 and 5 use the Driscoll-Kraay estimators, and models 4 and 6 allow for
clustered standard errors by state. Data is taken from years 2006-2016.



                                                  20
       Our base specification results are robust to dropping high or low incomes, high and low

investments, and large GDP states for all specifications. However, we do observe some

sensitivity to either dropping small GDP or outlier observations. Our results for both sample

perturbations remain significant at least at a 10% level with White heteroscedasticity standard

errors for our base specification with the output gap included, but both alternative samples drop

out with Driscoll-Kraay standard errors and only our drop outliers alternative sample is

significant with standard errors clustered by state.

       Table 5 considers the robustness of our results to changes in estimation methodology and

specification. First, given our sample sensitivity to dropping small GDP states, one might be

concerned that averages of sentiment responses from larger states might be more informative, as

these are taken from a larger sample of individual responses. We respond with two types of

weighted least squares estimators, weighting by both state GDP and the number of Michigan

Surveys respondents in the state for that time period. The results for the six specifications with

these weighting schemes for the sample are in the first two rows of Table 5.

       Weighting in either manner leaves our coefficient estimate for the variable of interest

significant for all model specifications, with the majority entering at least a 5% confidence level.

Moreover, the change does not qualitatively change our point estimate for output gap

specifications. It falls modestly when weighted by state GDP and marginally rises when

weighted by the n umber of survey responses. We observe larger point estimate declines using

time dummies, where weighting by GDP and the number of responses yield 0.11 and 0.10

point estimates respectively. These lower point estimates seem more plausible, as a one standard

deviation increase in the GOOD variable is predicted here to result in 2.1 and 1.9 percentage

point increases in state GDP growth respectively.

         We also consider conventional, rather than robust standard errors, random, rather than

fixed effects, quarterly, instead of annual, time dummies, and regional dummies instead of state

fixed effects. All specifications continue to enter at standard confidence levels.

         We next consider annual, rather than quarterly data. Our annual data is available a year

earlier, and so our sample spans from 2005-2016 and has 588 observations. Our coefficient

estimates for the annual frequency are almost identical to those we obtain with quarterly data,

and our variable of interest remains statistically significant for all specifications.

         The use of annual data allows for the consideration of lagged GDP under the same time

period as our base specification. We consider the inclusion of lagged state GDP, lagged US

GDP, and both variables. All specifications enter with qualitatively similar values on our GOOD

variable of interest, and remain statistically significant. The coefficient point estimates are

modestly smaller, but still indicative of a substantive impact of positive sentiment on output.

Given a one standard deviation increase in our GOOD variable, our point estimate for our base

specification indicates a 2.3 percentage point increase in state output growth. 13

         Finally, as we discuss above, our instrument may be rendered invalid if the political

situation directly affects underlying economic fundamentals. In particular, if states with a higher

number of congressional representatives from the same political party as the sitting president are

favored in political outcomes that support local economic conditions. We therefore also

condition for federal taxes and growth in transfers in Table 5. 14


13
   We lose a year of data when adding lagged state GDP at a quarterly frequency, leaving our time series only
spanning 2007-2016. Our variable of interest, GOOD, is positive but insignificant with this truncated sample.
However, we run the specification under our original sample by linearly interpolating our 2005 annual state output
data. Using this sample, the statistical significance for the variable of interest is restored. This alternative sample
was provided to the referees and is available on request from the authors.

14
  Taxes are measured as the ratio of state Federal income taxes paid to state income. We measure transfer
growth as the growth in transfers from the federal government relative to the previous year. These are introduced
as separate variables in our regressions.

                                                          23
       It can be seen that our results are qualitatively the same with these variables included, as

our point estimates are roughly the same and enter significantly for all specifications. Given this

evidence, we proceed under the assumption that the sentiment channel is the only channel

through which the political characteristics of a state influence its economic activity, rendering

our IV specification valid.

       Table 6 considers several alternative sentiment measures to the Michigan Surveys as well

as the impact of sentiment on consumption. Among the alternative sentiment measures, we first

we consider negative responses to the question about future national economic conditions, i.e.

those that answered response “5” to the question above. We term this variable “BAD5”.

Second, we consider the share of respondents in state i at time t that answered the question above

that national economic conditions over the next five years would be “good,” without

qualifications, i.e. with responses that were coded “1” to the question above. We term this

variable “GOOD1.” We also consider responses to question BAGO (109) which asks whether

business conditions are better or worse than the previous year, which we term “BETTER1”.

Finally, we use the sentiment measure studied by Mian, et al (2015) on the quality of government

performance, which we term “GOVT.” We measure this variable as the share of respondents

who answered “1,” indicating that they thought that the government was doing a “good job” in

its economic policy.

       Our results for these alternative sentiment measures continue to enter with their expected

signs, but their performances in terms of statistical significance is uneven. Our results for

negative sentiment responses, “BAD5,” universally enters negatively at statistically significant

levels. Our point estimates for this variable indicate a comparable response to what we saw for




                                                 24
our positive sentiment measure. Given the standard error for this variable in our sample of 0.19,

robust standard errors (Model 1) implies that a one standard deviation increase in the share of

negative sentiment is associated with a 2.7% percentage point decrease in state output growth.



                                                  25
       Our coefficient estimates for the GOOD1 variable are larger than those in our base

specification above (which is unsurprising as it is on average a more positive reponse), and are

universally statistically significant at standard confidence level for all of our specifications.

       Our results are not as strong over a shorter horizon, as the impact of those with higher

expectations concerning business conditions a year from now, BETTER1, consistently obtains a

positive coefficient estimate, but is statistically insignificant for our output gap specifications,

and is also insignificant for the clustered regression with time dummies included.

       We obtain stronger results for the specifications where sentiment is measured in terms of

attitudes about the government’s performance, GOVT. These enter significantly for all of the

specifications except Model 6, which clusters and includes time dummies. In that specification,

the variable of interest just barely misses a 10% confidence level of statistical significance.

       All of the alternative measures considered enter with their expected signs in all of our

specifications. Not all of these are statistically significant for our sentiment variable of interest,

but then, neither were the specifications with our base sentiment measure in Table 3. Overall,

then, while we acknowledge some sensitivity to the sentiment measure used, our results continue

to indicate a positive (negative) impact on state output with higher (lower) measures of sentiment

about future economic activity used.

       Finally, a number of papers in the literature [e.g. Gillitzer and Prasad (2015)], examine

the implications of sentiment shocks for consumption, rather than income. These need not go

together, as positive responses in income to sentiment shocks may more reflect movements in

local investment, rather than consumption. We therefore look at the impact of sentiment shocks

on consumption, as measured by movements in personal consumption expenditures. Data for

this variable is available by state only at an annual frequency.



                                                  26
         Our results are also shown in Table 6. It can be seen that we find a statistically

significant and positive response by state in consumption to sentiment differences as well.

Moreover, the point estimates for our specifications appear to indicate responses of a plausible

and economically significant magnitude, as a one standard deviation increase in GOOD is

predicted to result in a 2.3 percentage point increase in PCE consumption.



6. Impact on activity over longer horizons

         Finally, we consider the impact of sentiment over longer horizons. We redo our base

specifications with a two-year lag for sentiment. As the start of our quarterly sample is

constrained by data availability for quarterly growth by state, we estimate over these longer lags

at an annual frequency over our base sample. 15 Our dependent variable is now GGDPit ,t + 2 ,

average annual state growth from period t through period t+2.

         Our results for the variable of interest, GOOD, over a two-year horizon are shown in

Table 7. Our base specifications estimated using OLS are shown in the first row. Our

specifications are significant at standard confidence levels for all methods of estimating standard

errors with the output gap included (models 1 through 3). The coefficient point estimates are a

little smaller, as would be expected over a longer horizon, but still indicate a substantive impact

on state growth from changes in sentiment.

         The results are more mixed for growth over a two year horizon with state fixed effects

included. The coefficient point estimates are smaller, but still indicate a notable impact on

growth. However, while we obtain significant coefficient estimates with robust standard errors,




15
  Recall that coefficient point estimates for our variable of interest are very close for quarterly and annual
frequencies.

                                                          27
our results over a two-year horizon are weaker using either Driscoll-Kraay or clustered standard

errors. As above, we have some reservations about our standard error estimates for these

clustered specifications because our panel is small in the time dimension. Our point estimates




* p < 0.1, **p < 0.05, ***p < 0.01

Models 1 and 4 use robust standard errors, models 2 and 5 use the Driscoll-Kraay estimators, and
models 4 and 6 allow for clustered standard errors by state. For 2 year PCE we are sampling from 2006-
2015 data. For 1 year IV we are sampling from 2007-2016.




                                                  28
suggest that under our sample a one standard deviation increase in sentiment is associated with

an 1.6 percentage point increase in average state growth over the next two years for the

specifications with the income gap included (Models 1 through 3), and even smaller effects with

state fixed effects. However, a 95% confidence interval would include values similar to our

point estimates for the one year horizon.

       The point estimates for average annual growth are even smaller and less significant over

a three year horizon, as might be expected. Our point estimates suggest that under our sample a

one standard deviation increase in sentiment is associated with a still-substantial 0.9 percentage

point increase in average state growth over the next two years for the specifications with the

income gap included (Models 1 through 3), and even smaller effects with state fixed effects

included. Again, a 95% confidence interval includes values similar to our point estimates for the

one year horizon. Moreover, it is important to remember that as the impact period increases in

length, the probability that further unmeasured sentiment shocks took place increases, which

adds noise to our analysis.

       Our estimates over the 3-year horizon for state growth are in the second row. These

results appear to be weaker, as our point estimates fall, for example to 0.05 in the case of output

gap specifications (Models 1 through 3), and we only obtain statistically significant coefficient

estimates at standard confidence levels under robust standard error estimation. Our coefficient

estimates for models 1 through 3 suggest that a one standard deviation increase in sentiment

results in a 1.0 percentage point increase in average annual output growth over a three year

horizon.

       Our results suggest a more modest, but still positive impact of sentiment shocks over

these longer term horizons. Still, we acknowledge that our results over these longer –term



                                                 29
horizons are weaker than those we found over a 1 year horizon, indicating that the positive

impact of state sentiment shocks on output growth that we find in the data appears to be

temporary.

          We next turn to longer-term impacts on PCE consumption by state, which is only

available at an annual frequency. Our results for two and three year horizons are shown in rows

three and four of Table 7. It can be seen that our point estimates are modestly lower, but all of

our specifications over both longer horizons are statistically significant at standard confidence

levels.

          Overall, our results confirm a longer-term relationship between sentiment and future

consumption at the state level is persistent. We also obtained positive, but weaker, estimates of

the implications of sentiment shocks for state economic activity.




7. Conclusion

          We revisit the relationship between consumer sentiment and economic activity. Our

identification strategy is based on using the cross-sectional information in state data. We

examine individual responses to survey questions about long-term prospects for the national

economy. If sentiment drives activity, states in which agents hold more optimistic outlooks

about national economic prospects should undertake higher levels of economic activity:

Sentiments about economic prospects can thereby affect output at the state level.

          A potential problem with our strategy is that it is possible that agents’ responses to

questions about future national economic conditions may reflect local conditions. Our reverse

regression results suggest that reverse causality along these lines may indeed be an issue,

although formal Hausman tests do not indicate endogeneity at statistically significant levels. To


                                                   30
address this potential problem, we turn to IV estimation, based on a predicted relationship

between political partisanship and economic sentiment concerning national economic prospects.

Our results demonstrate a strong first stage relationship between our instrument and our

sentiment measure. Our instrumented sentiment measure confirms a statistically significant

relationship between state sentiment about national economic prospects and next year’s state

economic activity under a variety of specifications. Our point estimate under our base

specification indicates that a one standard deviation increase in sentiment is associated with

additional 49 basis points of growth in the following year. This result is robust to a wide variety

of robustness tests, including sample perturbations, changes in estimation methods, and the use

of alternative sentiment measures. Moreover, we find a significant and robust relationship at

annual frequency between state sentiment and next year’s PCE consumption at the state level.

       We also consider the impact of sentiment over two and three year horizons. Our results

over these longer horizons are weaker for state output, always entering positively but except for

the specifications with robust standard errors, only statistically significantly at a two-year

horizon for our specifications with Driscoll-Kraay or clustered standard errors with the national

output gap included instead of state fixed effects. At the three year horizon, our point estimates

are smaller and only enter at statistically significant levels for our robust standard error

estimates.

       Our results for longer horizons with state PCE consumption are stronger. All of

specifications enter positive at statistically significant levels, regardless of model or estimation

method. Still, our point estimates diminish with horizon, indicating that our data indicate a

persistent positive one, but not necessarily a permanent one.




                                                  31
       Our overall results therefore support the notion of a positive empirical relationship

between sentiments and future economic activity, as well as future consumption expenditures.

We find weaker and sometimes insignificant impacts of sentiment shocks in economic growth at

the state levels at longer than two and three year horizons, but robust evidence of measurable

impacts on consumption at those horizons.

       Still, under our specifications it is possible that new sentiment shocks that occur late

under the longer horizons add noise to our sample and preclude finding statistically significant

results. Therefore, we remain skeptical of rejecting the possibility of measurable and significant

sentiment effects on output at longer horizons because of the weaker results we obtain under

clustered standard errors. Our quarterly sample is by necessity small in the time dimension, and

with longer samples we may obtain stronger results over time.
