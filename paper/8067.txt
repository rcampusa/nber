As of this writing, Internet sales still total only about 0.7% of all retail sales in the United States1. However,
the rapid growth of Internet commerce suggests that this sales channel will eventually become a significant
factor for many goods. Because purchasing through the Internet does not allow the consumer to touch and
experience the good prior to buying, it is reasonable to anticipate that established branded products will be
particularly well suited for Internet sales. The emergence of this new sales channel raises many questions
for the manufacturers of branded goods: are there any costs to allowing one’s products to be sold over the
Internet? If products are sold over the Internet, should the manufacturer sell them directly, via Internet
retailers, or via the websites of established brick-and-mortar retailers? What pricing strategy should the
manufacturer use for Internet sales? We address these questions in our research.

Manufacturers of branded goods employ various means of restricting distribution of their products with the
goal of controlling free-riding on the sales and promotional efforts of their retailers. The emergence of the
Internet as a new distribution channel may alter manufacturers’ and retailers’ incentives to exert promotional
effort, and may thus affect the optimal vertical arrangements that manufacturers adopt. Furthermore, new
types of antitrust issues are likely to arise as these vertical arrangements evolve. This issue is of immediate
practical importance since the Federal Trade Commission and Department of Justice have recently shown an
increased willingness to prosecute restricted distribution cases and appear to be giving less weight to free-
rider defenses than in previous years. 2

In this paper, we investigate empirically the extent to which manufacturers of several different types of
branded goods appear to control the pricing and availability of their products over the Internet. We analyze
the probable impact of these actions on the promotion and sales incentives of brick-and-mortar retailers. We
also discuss the types of antitrust issues that are likely to arise because of Internet sales.

The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. In the next two sections, we review the standard theory of free
riding and its consequences, noting how these theories apply to distribution via the Internet. We derive
several conjectures that we test. Next, we discuss some recent legislative and antitrust activity, showing that
the issues associated with restricted distribution are likely to become hotly litigated. We then discuss the data
for the three industries that we study: fragrances, DVD players, and refrigerators. These industries were
chosen on the basis of data availability and the possibility that free riding is a concern. Finally, we report
empirical results that document the availability and price of branded products over the Internet for these
industries. We conclude with some general observations.

I.      Free Riding

Free riding amongst retailers has been much studied and is well understood.3 Free riding occurs because the
inputs needed to sell a product -- e.g., informed retail sales effort, retail showrooms to display products, retail
advertising -- cannot be sold separately from the physical product. Hence, it is possible for one retail store to
engage in the activity necessary to sell the product, but for a different lower-priced store to make the final
sale. If such free riding occurs, it erodes the incentive of any retail store to promote the product. With lower
promotion, total sales could fall, to the chagrin of the manufacturer.

There are myriad ways for a manufacturer to deal with the free rider problem. One common approach is to
create exclusive territories or to otherwise limit the number of firms selling a brand in one area. Another is
for the manufacturer to take over the sales or marketing function from the retailer. A less extreme form of
this approach is for the manufacturer to share in the advertising or employee training expense that the retailer
chooses. This decentralization of decision making from the manufacturer to the retail store is usually
desirable because the local retail store possesses knowledge about its customers that allows the retailer to sell
the product more effectively than the manufacturer.

Another approach to the free rider problem is for the manufacturer to engage in resale price maintenance.
Though resale price maintenance (RPM) is a per se violation of the antitrust laws, under the Colgate
doctrine4, a manufacturer can choose to deal with whomever it pleases and can, if it wants, cease dealing with
price cutters. (The tension between the Colgate doctrine and the per se ban on resale price maintenance has
been noted many times before.) By preventing retailers from cutting prices, the manufacturer removes the
incentive of the consumer to purchase from the firm other than the one providing the sales effort. 5 When
we see no discounting off a relatively uniform retail price, we will say,as a convenient shorthand,that the
manufacturer is engaging in RPM. (We are not intending to make any suggestion whatsoever that the pricing
policy violates the law.)

Finally, manufacturers often limit the types of stores where their products are sold, frequently in conjunction
with some type of resale price maintenance. Typically, this restriction takes the form of favoring specialty
stores over stores carrying a broad selection of goods. These restrictions often stem from the manufacturer’s
objection to the use of its product as a loss leader. A loss leader is a product whose price is set very low in an
effort to attract consumers into a retail store. Once there, consumers purchase other products sold in the
retail store, so there are definite spillover benefits to the retail store. However, the consequence to the
manufacturer is that the specialty stores that promote his product will have difficulty capturing the benefit of
their sales efforts since consumers will purchase the product at non-specialty stores where the product may
be used as a loss leader. In such cases, manufacturers may limit the type of stores where it allows its product
to be sold.

Addressing the free rider problem becomes more complicated when consumers differ in their need to obtain
sales service. For example, some knowledgeable consumers do not need to deal with a trained sales staff,
while others rely heavily on them. In such a case, the manufacturer faces a dilemma. Providing the
incentives for the retail store to provide trained assistance ultimately raises the retail price that all consumers
must pay, including the price to those consumers who don’t need the sales service. One way around this
problem is to segment the market -- making one low-priced product available to knowledgeable consumers
(or consumers who don’t care about sales effort) and another higher-priced product available to the others.
As long as the consumers who do consume sales effort are limited in their ability to purchase the lower-
priced version (perhaps by being unaware of its existence), the manufacturer can avoid the dilemma of
choosing which consumer group to cater to. Since the cost of serving knowledgeable customers is lower than
that of serving the others, it is both profitable and efficient for manufacturers to segment the population.
Clothing manufacturers who cut out their labels from their product and sell it to discount houses provide a
good example of population segmenting--- segmenting between those who care about brand names and

4 U.S. vs. Colgate and Co., 250 US 300 (1919).
5 While RPM mitigates the problem of horizontal free-riding across retailers, it does not necessarily insure
that retailers have sufficient incentive to provide the optimal amount of promotion from the manufacturer’s
viewpoint. Since the retailer captures only part of the total margin on the good, retailer incentives may be
inadequate. See, for example Klein and Murphy (1988).

those who do not. Notice though that, identifying consumers who do and do not require sales effort is
insufficient; some mechanism must be used to prevent those that do need sales effort from consuming the
sales effort at one retailer and then purchasing from the low-priced retailer who was intended to sell only to
the knowledgeable consumers.


II.     Applications of the Theory of Free Riding to Internet Sales

Our main concern is that, in the absence of vertical restrictions, brick-and-mortar retailers will be vulnerable
to free riding on their sales effort by their Internet competitors. Of course, it is theoretically possible that
free-riding could occur in either direction. That is, brick-and-mortar retailers could also free ride off of the
sales effort of Internet retailers. Brick-and-mortar retailers provide the opportunity to touch and smell the
products and brick-and-mortar salespeople will often demonstrate the product for customers. Internet
retailers often provided detailed product information, sometimes including commentary on the product from
previous customers. The interactive technology often helps customers search for the particular model of a
product that most closely matches the customer's needs. Thus, both types of retailers may be providing
valuable sales effort.

There are two important distinctions between the type of support offered by Internet retailers and brick-and-
mortar retailers that we think make free riding by Internet retailers on brick and mortar retailers more of a
problem than free riding in the reverse direction. First, much of the effort of the brick-and-mortar retailers
takes the form of a per-customer cost, while Internet retailers incur fixed costs in providing support. Second,
because the promotional effort of a brick-and-mortar retailer consists of personal interaction between
customers and sales consultants, it is much more difficult to directly verify. Thus, in some sense, the classic
free rider problem might not be as important when we think about free-riding across Internet sites or from
the Internet sites to physical stores because the manufacturer could, in principle, use fixed fees to
compensate Internet retailers who provide information- or promotion-laden sites. However, it is much less
practical to use fixed fees to compensate brick-and-mortar retailers for their unverifiable per-customer effort.
 The most feasible way to compensate brick-and-mortar retailers for sales effort is through a device such as
RPM or exclusive territories which allows them to charge high prices. In the absence of restrictions on their
competitors on the Internet, the brick-and-mortar retailers will be vulnerable to free riding by Internet
retailers.

Another important feature of Internet sales that may lessen the importance of free riding off of Internet
retailers is that, unlike sales at brick-and-mortar retailers, Internet sales are typically national not local. The
incentive for the manufacturer to delegate promotional effort to the retailer is diminished if the retailer does
not have specialized local knowledge that allows the retailer to sell the product better than the manufacturer.
The only analogy on the Internet to that local retail knowledge is knowledge of the customers of the
particular Internet site. So, for example, if one Internet site attracted consumers who had unusual
characteristics known only to the Internet retailer,the manufacturer would have to rely on that retailer for
promotioal effort.

While the Internet may lower the cost to manufacturers of selling directly to consumers, the costs involved in
direct selling are not trivial. The logistics and warehousing functions of selling often have scale economies
and expertise associated with them that a manufacturer may lack. Manufacturers avoid these distribution
costs by relying on others to distribute the product.

A final relevant feature of Internet retailing is that search costs may be lower than in the physical world.
Consider a consumer who visits a specialty men’s store to receive fitting advice for an expensive suit. Even if
the manufacturer of that suit sells the same suit to a discount store, it may be extremely costly for the


                                                        -3-
shopper to figure out how to obtain the suit more cheaply. These search costs may mitigate the free rider
problem. On the Internet, these search costs are potentially lowered, especially as shopbot technology
improves. How low these costs are is an empirical question that others have addressed and that we will
consider as well.

Using these facts about Internet sales and our knowledge of free riding, we can make the following
observations.

        1. Internet sales sites increase the free rider problem for manufacturers. If a customer can obtain
           sales service from a retail store, but purchase at a lower price on the Internet, free riding occurs.
            We hypothesize that manufacturers that rely strongly upon sales effort that is necessarily
           physical may limit the availability of their products on the Internet.

            There is, however, an important caveat to this argument. Exclusively distributed goods are
            generally those that are heavily reliant on retailer sales effort. Allowing those goods to be sold
            on the Internet exacerbates that free-rider problem. However, the more exclusively a
            manufacturer distributes a good, the more consumers there are who are outside of the feasible
            sales area of any brick-and-mortar retailer. The opportunity to reach new customers, then, is
            particularly valuable for manufacturers using small distribution networks. Thus, manufacturers
            of exclusively distributed products may authorize Internet retailing but use other vertical control
            mechanisms to control free-riding.

            The first goal of our empirical work, then, is to document the availability of products over the
            Internet. Is the availability of products over the Internet positively or negatively correlated with
            their availability in the physical world?

        2. In a competitive market with search costs, we know that price dispersion arises. Although
           search costs seem low on the Internet, significant price dispersion for identical products has
           been documented by other researchers. We expect manufacturers of branded items that are
           heavily promoted at the retail level to be more concerned about price dispersion than
           manufacturers of products that are less reliant on retail sales effort since heterogeneous prices
           encourage free riding. This might lead the price distributions of heavily promoted products to
           be tighter both across retail stores and across Internet sites compared to the price distributions
           of less heavily promoted products.

              In our empirical work, we examine the magnitude of price dispersion across Internet retailers.
            Is the price dispersion across Internet sites lower for heavily promoted items than for other
            items? Is there evidence that manufacturers of promotion-intensive products attempt to restrict
            the availability of those products to Internet sites that engage in discounting?

        3. Manufacturers face a dilemma in deciding whether to offer products for sale through their own
           website, through the website of a retailer, or both. Clearly, retailers may threaten to discontinue
           carrying a manufacturer's product if the manufacturer becomes a retail competitor.6 However, if
           manufacturers use their own websites to sell products, the manufacturers will recognize the
           value of mitigating the free rider problem and we would expect them to do so. Of course, even
           if the manufacturer website is attractive from the perspective of controlling free-rider issues,

6Home Depot issued a warning in July 1999 that it might discontinue any suppliers who sold product directly
over the Internet.



                                                      -4-
             manufacturer site sales may be unattractive if they do not achieve minimum efficient scale in
             website operation.

             In our empirical work, we examine the propensity of products to be offered on manufacturer
             websites. For which types of products are manufacturer sites used? Do manufacturer websites
             price as if they are attempting to mitigate the free rider problem?

        4. Manufacturers of exclusively distributed products should be more likely to allow price discounts
           on Internet sales when consumers affected are highly knowledgeable already and require no retail
           sales effort. In particular, the distinction between initial and repeat sales may be relevant. Initial
           sales of the good may give rise to the potential for more free riding (e.g., need to see the good in
           a showroom) than repeat purchases. Repeat purchases of unchanging goods would seem well
           suited to Internet sales. A manufacturer’s Internet strategy may be different for new products
           whose sales are dominated by first-time purchasers than for older products, whose sales are
           dominated by repeat purchasers. Alternatively, the manufacturer could use some type of
           information technology to certify repeat customers for Internet purchases.

             To study this issue, we contrast the availability of newer introductions with the availability of
             older, established goods. This issue is most germane to the one product in our study, perfume,
             that is subject to frequent repeat purchases.

        5. There is an important potential advantage that established brick-and-mortar retailers may have
           over pure-Internet retailers that has not been given much attention in the popular press
           discussions of e-commerce. Brick-and-mortar retailers who distribute a branded product might
           be given preferential access to that product for Internet sales, since the brick-and-mortar retailer
           can internalize the free-riding between Internet and retail stores. This effect can only be
           important if the brick-and-mortar retail sector is highly concentrated. If there are many brick-
           and-mortar retailers, Internet sales provide a vehicle for that retailer to free ride off of other
           retailers' promotional efforts. 7

             Thus, in our empirical work, we examine the following issue: do brick-and-mortar stores
             partially internalize the free-rider problem and charge higher prices on the Internet? Do
             manufacturers appear to source products to brick-and-mortar retailers that they do not source to
             pure-Internet retailers?


III.    Antitrust Issues

Already, the Internet has created legal battles about property rights in the vertical chain of distribution in
several retail sectors, including auto dealers and drug stores. We foresee three types of litigation arising under
the federal antitrust statutes. The first issue is whether a dealer of a product can be terminated for violating

7It is worth noting that self-free-riding does create some potential problems for the retailer. For example,
suppose that the retailer utilizes a commission-based sales staff to sell its product in the brick-and-mortar
outlet. The incentives of these salesworkers are diluted by the fact that the sales staff may service customers,
only to have the customers purchase the product from the Internet site, potentially bypassing their
commissions. When appliances are sold by Sears.com, Sears issues a commission check to the appliance sales
force at the Sears store located closest to the delivery address of the Internet shopper. This practice may
mitigate, but not solve this internal free-riding problem.

exclusive territories provisions by setting up a website that ships products outside the dealer’s territory. A
second related issue is whether a dealer can be terminated for reselling goods to an “unauthorized” Internet
dealer (creating a so-called “grey market” for the product). Finally, a third legal issue is whether a
manufacturer's or franchisor's web sites violate the territorial exclusivity of retailers or franchisees. These
conflicts may in part be settled by manufacturers or franchisors agreeing to pay retailers or franchisees
whenever product is sold directly by the manufacturer over the Internet.

One of the most powerful dealer groups is auto dealers. Numerous and successful, this group has many state
franchise laws to protect them from competition from other dealers located nearby selling the same brand
and to protect them from termination by the manufacturer. Auto dealers were initially concerned that GM
and Ford would use the Internet to sell cars directly to consumers. Responding to their dealers, both GM
and Ford have recently abandoned their plans to use the Internet to sell direct.8 Moreover, many state
franchise laws now prevent (or are being reconsidered to prevent) a car manufacturer from giving high-
volume dealers lower wholesale prices. The goal of these new laws is to prevent a dealer from undercutting
rival dealers by running a high-volume, low cost Internet business. However, because state law makes
termination of dealers so difficult, it seems unlikely that either auto manufacturers or other dealers will be
able to prevent dealer sales over the Internet. Furthermore, under current laws, the manufacturer is likely to
be powerless to charge higher wholesale prices to retailers whose ratio of sales to test drives given is low due
to Internet sales.9 Other politically influential industries that have succeeded in using state laws to limit
online competition include insurance and liquor distribution.10

The drugstore industry provides another example of legal conflict over exclusive territories. Drug Emporium
franchises drug stores and gives them exclusive territories. When Drug Emporium set up a web site, it
initially refused to sell to customers in its franchisees’ exclusive territories. Instead, customers in exclusive
territories of franchisees were provided with the nearest store location. In Fall 1999, Drug Emporium
changed its policy, began selling in its franchisee’s territories but offered to provide a sales commission on all
such sales to the exclusive franchisee. The franchisees brought a legal action, claiming that Internet sales
violate their exclusivity clause. The case is in arbitration.11

Legal actions have also been attempted against unauthorized Internet retailers who obtain products from
either authorized retailers or wholesalers and then sell those products at discount prices. Parfumsnet.com
shut down (at least temporarily) its website in France after having been sued by at least 16 different perfume
manufacturers.12

We have gathered data on three categories of branded goods that are highly reliant on retailer sales support
and are in product categories where Internet sales are expected to reach at least 5 percent of retail sales by
20003 according to Forrester Research: fragrances, DVD players, and side-by-side refrigerators. Fragrances
rely on retail support because consumers of expensive fragrances prefer to try them on prior to purchase.
DVD players rely on retail support because they are fairly complex. The features are very different from
those offered on a VCR and the hookup procedure is non-trivial if the customer does not have a new DVD-
ready television. Side-by-side refrigerators rely on retail support because consumers generally like to examine
the attractiveness of its appliances and inspect its features.

Fragrances

We gathered fragrance data from 17 retail Internet sites plus manufacturer sites. Our goal in selecting retail
sites is to obtain representatives of four different types of websites: department store sites, upscale beauty
sites, drugstore sites, and discount fragrance sites. To identify department store websites we obtained
listings of the largest department stores in the U.S. and selected all of those that sell fragrances over the
Internet (Bloomingdales, Dillards, Macys, Nordstrom, and Nieman Marcus).

To identify other websites that sell beauty products, we obtained a list of top traffic Internet sites selling
beauty products from the Media Metrix/NPD Winter 1999 e-visory report (see
http://www.npd.com/corp/beauty/ evflyerweb.htm). From this list of nine sites, we eliminated three sites
from consideration. Avon.com and avonorder.com are websites that carry only Avon products. Avon
products are not distributed through stores, but rather are direct distributed by "Avon representatives".
While the channel conflicts created by launching an Internet site to compete with direct sales agents are quite
interesting, we view the channel conflicts faced by this type of firm as sufficiently different from those facing
traditional retailers and manufacturers that we eliminate those websites from study. We also eliminated
mothernature.com, which does not appear to carry any name brand fragrances. To the remaining list of 6
sites (ibeauty.com,eve.com, drugstore.com, more.com, planetrx.com, and Ashford.com), we added
Sephora.com, as private communication with a project manager at NPD group indicated that this site would
be added to the list of top beauty sites for the Spring 2000 edition of the NPD/Media Metrix e-visory report.
 Three of the sites listed in the NPD/Media Metrix report are upscale beauty sites (ibeauty.com, eve.com,
and sephora.com). 13 Three are drugstore sites (drugstore.com, planetrx.com, and more.com). The last,
Ashford.com ,carries all types of luxury goods (perfume, jewelry, watches, etc.). For our purposes, we
classify Ashford as an upscale beauty site.

We supplemented this list with perfume-only sites indexed by 4anything.com (a popular index of web sites).
One of these, fragrancenet.com is rated by PCDataonline as the second-highest traffic beauty site on the
Internet as of September 2000. We also added beauty.com to the list of upscale beauty sites to analyze, since
its recent association with Amazon.com suggests that its traffic might increase. Hence, our final list of 17
retail Internet sites consists of 5 department store sites, 5 upscale beauty sites, 3 drugstore sites and 4
discount fragrance sites.

During the month of June 2000, we collected all of the prices for all of the women's fragrances carried by
these 17 retail sites.14 This results in a database containing prices across sites for 3156 total products. Most
fragrances are available in a variety size-type-vehicle combinations. By "type" we refer to the formulation of
the fragrance. Most fragrances are available not only in the fairly concentrated perfume formulation, but also

13Since our data was collected, eve.com has ceased operations.
14 That is, we gathered data for perfumes, colognes, etc. We did not gather data for "home fragrances",
creams, powders, or aromatherapy products.



                                                      -7-
in more dilute types such as cologne, eau de toilette, eau de cologne, and eau de perfume. Similarly, most
fragrances are available both in the traditional "pour" vehicle, as well as in the "spray" vehicle. For a given
fragrance, prices are highly correlated across sizes, types, and vehicles. Thus, for most of the analysis we will
consider only the most widely available vehicle-format for each fragrance (most often, the 1.7 oz EDT spray).
 This results in a dataset of prices for 1106 unique fragrances available for sale on the Internet.

The methodology described above does not allow us to document whether or not there are fragrances that
are not available for sale over the Internet but are available for sale at brick and mortar retail locations. We
obtained this information in two ways. First, we obtained information from the Fragrance Foundation. The
Fragrance Foundation (www.fragrance.org) presents annual awards (called the "Fifi" awards) for the best
new fragrance introductions, as well as an annual "hall of fame" award in which an established classic
fragrance is inducted into the Hall of Fame. Using the list of Fifi nominees for 1998 and 1999, and the list of
winners for 1972-1997, we matched our list of fragrances to the list of fragrances for sale on the Internet.
There are two possible reasons why some nominees/winners would not be available for sale on the Internet.
 The first possibility is that the manufacturer has decided not to offer the product for sale on the Internet or
that retailers have decided not to carry it. The second possibility is that the fragrance has actually been
discontinued. Since we do not have sales figures for individual perfumes, it is very difficult to know if low or
zero total sales explain unavailability on the Internet. To try to separate out perfumes that were unavailable
due to discontinuation or low sales, we asked a research assistant shopper to look for the Fifi
nominees/winners at Chicagoland department, beauty, and perfume stores. We consider all perfumes that
our shopper was able to buy in Chicagoland as "legitimate" sellers, and document the Internet availability
thereof. The list of retail stores visited is given in Data Appendix One.

The Fragrance Foundation provided two other sets of data that we exploit here. First, we obtained data from
the Fragrance Foundation on all new fragrance introductions that would qualify for nomination for the 1999
Fragrance Foundation awards, awarded in June 2000. This would encompass fragrances introduced from late
1998 to late 1999.

Finally, as part of the annual Fifi awards, nominees are asked to certify which of the following categories of
brick-and-mortar distribution their fragrances fall into: for sale in limited specialty and department stores (to
department and specialty stores totaling less than 500 doors), for sale in department stores generally, for sale
in chain/mass market stores, for sale exclusively through non-store venues, and for sale only in private label
stores. We use this information as a proxy for the extent to which the manufacturer uses exclusive
distribution arrangements in the brick-and-mortar world.

For the most part, we will use information only about the first three distribution categories, as fragrances
sold in the latter two categories are likely not to be sold in the "general" beauty websites that we examine. In
doing this, however, we should note that these two alternative channels are not miniscule. The private label
category includes perfumes labeled for the Gap, Banana Republic, Eddie Bauer, and Victoria's Secret. The
"not in stores" category includes direct distributed products such as Avon and Mary Kay (companies with all
sales totaling approximately $6 billion). Indeed, Avon is the largest seller of perfume in the US (by volume,
not dollar sales).

The data on the exclusiveness of distribution tend to be the same for all of the perfumes within a designer.
Because these data appear to be consistent within designers, we infer the availability of any perfume by a
designer if we have data from the Fragrance Foundation for a particular perfume in that designer's line.
Thus, for example, Estee Lauder's "Pleasures" has been nominated for a Fifi, but not Estee Lauder's




                                                      -8-
"Knowing". We assume that "Knowing" is distributed to the same type of outlets as "Pleasures".15

We used four search engines and links from the Fragrance Foundation to document which of the Fifi-
nominated manufacturers listed in our entire database of fragrances had their own Internet sites. We visited
all of these Internet sites to establish whether or not the manufacturer sold fragrances directly through the
site. For any site that we found that sold fragrances, we recorded the prices. The "manufacturer site"
information in the tables below cover, to the best of our knowledge, the universe of manufacturer sites for
the Fifi nominees. Several of the manufacturers had websites that appeared to sell fragrances, but did not
have English-language websites. We eliminated these from consideration.16 All prices and availability data
are as of June 2000. Since that time, one of the sites that we examine has exited the business (eve.com), while
others that we did not consider have gained sufficient popularity that they would have been included in a
study covering a later time period (particularly gloss.com).


DVD players

We undertook several steps to find important Internet retailers of DVD players. First, using Dealerscope
Magazine, a trade journal for consumer electronics retailers, we identified the top-selling brands of DVD
players and the top-selling brick-and-mortar retailers of DVD players. We searched for the corresponding
manufacturer websites and retailer websites. Then, using Media Metrix and PCDataOnline data, we obtained
lists of the most visited consumer electronics retailing websites. Finally, we supplemented this list by
examining retailers whose products were listed on deja.com, a consumer information site. In all, this
methodology identified 41 sites selling DVD players, of which 2 were manufacturer sites and 8 are the
websites of brick-and-mortar retailers.

Every major manufacturer of DVD players had a website describing their models (though most of these
manufacturers did not sell directly from their sites). Thus we were able to obtain a listing of the universe of
potential models. We obtained information from manufacturer websites about authorized versus
unauthorized dealers of each manufacturer's products. We will look separately at the behavior of
unauthorized and authorized retailers.

Appliances: Side-by- Side refrigerators

The second category of products that we analyzed is side-by-side refrigerators. We narrowed our focus to
only side-by-side refrigerators because of the large number of brands and sellers of compact refrigerators
intended for non-home use. All side-by-side refrigerators are large in scale and are designed for home and
restaurant buyers. We identified the major appliance manufacturers by consulting with industry data from
the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers (AHAM), the Homebuilders Financial Network (HFN),
and Dealerscope magazine, a trade journal for Consumer Electronics Retailers.

We also sought a measure of the "exclusiveness" of an appliance. We suspect that the free rider problem is
less pronounced for "standard" appliances in standard sizes and more pronounced for more "custom" type
appliances. That is, while it is possible that one could purchase a standard-sized freezer for an apartment

15 Note that we make this inference at the "designer", not the manufacturer level. The Estee Lauder
companies, for example, own Tommy Hilfiger, which makes fragrances called "Tommy Girl" and
"Freedom". We do not infer anything about the distribution of "Tommy Girl" using information on the
distribution of "Pleasures."
16 As best as we could ascertain, these websites would not ship products to the U.S. in any case.




                                                      -9-
without first inspecting it personally, it is probably unthinkable to purchase a commercial-quality Subzero
refrigerator without doing so. We identified "professional" appliances by searching through every page of a
set of "high-end" magazines, including several magazines targeted to gourmet cooks. The "high-end"
magazines were the set of travel and lifestyle magazines identified by the Fall 1999 Mediamark Magazine
Pocketpiece having average readership with a median household income of at least $60,000 and at least one
woman reader per copy. We identified 5 manufacturers of side-by-side refrigerators that have advertisements
in those magazines: GE, JennAir, KitchenAid, SubZero, and Viking.

We searched for appliance retail sites using several sources: Yahoo shopping, Alta Vista shopping,
4anything.com, MySimon, and links from AHAM. Despite these efforts we found only a few Internet sites
selling appliances and even fewer shipping nationally. Nonetheless, we collected pricing and availability
information for all nationally shipping appliance sites that carried any side-by-side refrigerators.

The prices and availability data that we examine are for October 2000. Once again, we have found that the
Internet sites selling these products have been in considerable flux since we began this research. For
example, in June 2000, we found 2 Internet sites selling SubZero refrigerators. Since then, one of these sites
has "gone dark", while the other appears to have dropped SubZero from its offerings.


V.      Empirical Findings

Fragrances
Availability
Our most basic question is whether some manufacturers do not make their products available on the Internet
and if they do, whether they limit which Internet sites distribute their products. As discussed above, a retailer
using exclusive distribution in the brick-and-mortar world faces a conflict in determining whether to allow its
product to be sold over the Internet. On the one hand, manufacturers use exclusive distribution
relationships to insure a return to retailer effort. By allowing the sale of products over the Internet, the
manufacturer endangers those retailer relationships. This suggests that manufacturers who use exclusive
distribution arrangements off-line might be least likely to offer their products online.

A countervailing incentive is to make the product available to consumers who do not live near an authorized
retail outlet. The more exclusive a product is, the more compelling is the incentive for the manufacturer to
offer sales over the Internet to those consumers who are unserved by the retail network. Indeed, for a
product such as a mass market fragrance available in every drugstore and discount store in America, it may
well not be worthwhile for anyone to attempt to sell the product over the Internet, as most consumers have
access to the product as a matter of course. Thus, it is an empirical question whether more "exclusively
distributed" products have a greater or lesser Internet presence.

Table 1 examines the propensity of the fragrances to be available on the Internet. The base sample is the 603
fragrances nominated for a Fragrance Foundation award. Twelve of these are dropped because our research
assistant shopper could not find the fragrance for sale in a physical store in Chicagoland. The vast majority
of these perfumes are available over the Internet at some type of site,as the third row of Table 1
demonstrates Interestingly, the least exclusively distributed perfumes offline (those sold through chain
stores and mass market outlets) are the least likely to be offered for sale on the Internet. One potential
reason for this is the economic unsuitability of these fragrances for shipping. As Table 1 illustrates, the
average price of the chain store perfumes is $14, as compared to $41 for the less exclusive department store
perfumes and $42 for the more exclusive department store perfumes.

Conditional on offering a product for sale on the Internet, the manufacturer faces several choices as to how


                                                     - 10 -
to distribute it. The manufacturer can simply source the product to Internet retailers, the manufacturer can
sell it directly through a manufacturer website, or the manufacturer can do both. Of course, both
manufacturer and retailer sites have the potential to create channel conflicts with retailers, as either the
manufacturer or an Internet retailer can potentially free ride off of the promotional efforts of brick-and-
mortar retailers.

As Table 1 shows, direct sales by manufacturers are quite prevalent in perfume. Thirty-eight percent of the
fragrances in our sample are available for sale over the Internet through a manufacturer site. This might be
expected for manufacturers whose non-Internet operations are vertically integrated into retailing (such as
Avon), but, as mentioned before, we are excluding manufacturers who are fully vertically integrated into
retailing.17 Twenty one percent are available exclusively through a manufacturer site. This suggests that, for
the majority of fragrance manufacturers, selling on the Internet through retail sites and selling on the Internet
through a manufacturer site are substitutes rather than complements. Why would a manufacturer choose to
source its perfume through a manufacturer site but not through a retail site? One hypothesis is that a
manufacturer that sells fragrances through its own site may, through pricing and product availability policies,
 be able to control the extent to which retailer effort is diminished by free-riding. Legal restrictions on
vertical contracting may prevent a manufacturer who sells through Internet retail sites from exercising the
same type of control on free riding. The fourth row of Table 1 provides support for this hypothesis since
perfumes that have exclusivity in the brick-and -mortar world have a higher fraction of manufacturing only
websites.

Table 2 systematically considers the relationship between Internet availability and proxies for the potential
for free riding. The first proxy we use is a measure of the exclusiveness of distribution in the brick –and-
mortar stores. We use variables that indicate whether the perfume is sold at brick-and-mortar stores very
exclusively (department stores less than 500 doors) or through a wide number of department stores. The
omitted variable takes the value of one if the fragrance is available through chain/mass market stores. In
addition to the degree of exclusivity in brick-and-mortar stores, the other proxy for the potential for free-
riding that we consider for perfumes is whether or not a perfume is a new introduction. Older established
perfumes are likely to be largely bought by repeat purchasers who will not need to try the perfume on before
purchasing. New perfumes, on the other hand, may be very reliant on retailer inputs, because consumers
may only purchase the perfume once they have tried it on in a retail outlet. If a consumer purchases a brand
new perfume over the Internet, that consumer is more likely to have free ridden upon a physical retailer's
recent efforts than is the purchaser of an older perfume. Complicating any such analysis, however, is the fact
that the demographics of purchasers of older and newer perfumes are likely to be radically different.
Younger women are probably more likely to both use the Internet to shop and are more likely to use newly
introduced perfumes.

Table 2 reports probit coefficients as well as the change in the probability that a fragrance is available on the
Internet when the right hand side variable increases from 0 to 1.As suggested by Table 1, Table 2 confirms
that overall availability over the Internet is positively correlated with the exclusiveness of distribution offline.
  The most exclusively distributed fragrances are the most likely to be available online, while the chain mass
market fragrances are least likely to be available online. As discussed above, we attribute this finding to the
relatively high ratio of shipping charges to price for the perfumes widely available offline. However, we do
find that new fragrances are less likely to be available over the Internet. The coefficients indicate that a
fragrance is 6 percentage points less likely to be available over the Internet if it is a new introduction.

In columns 3 and 4 of Table 2, we reestimate the probit specification, replacing the dependent variable with

17   See Gertner and Stillman (2000).



                                                       - 11 -
an indicator variable that takes the value of one if a perfume is available through an Internet retailer (e.g.
availability at manufacturer websites is ignored). There, we find quite different results. The most exclusively
distributed fragrances (offline) are significantly less likely to be available through retail Internet sites than are
general department store fragrances. That is, the coefficients for exclusively distributed fragrances and
general department store fragrances are statistically different from one another at the one percent confidence
level. Fragrances distributed offline by chain/mass market outlets are less likely to be available at the
surveyed retailer websites than are fragrances distributed offline through general department stores. This is
not surprising, given that our retailer Internet site sample consists largely of department stores and upscale
beauty websites. The lower weight to value ratio of these fragrances may make shipping them unattractive.
The coefficient for "new" remains negative, but is statistically insignificant in this specification.

Finally, in columns 5 and 6 of Table 2, we present for completeness the estimates for the probit specification
again, replacing the dependent variable with an indicator variable that takes the value of one if a perfume is
available through a manufacturer website. Consistently with the previous columns, the most exclusively
distributed fragrances (offline) are the ones most likely to be sold through manufacturer websites compared
to other less exclusively distributed fragrances (offline). When we examine pricing patterns below, we will
explore whether manufacturers design their websites to attempt to control the amount by which they free
ride off of their offline and online retailers.


Websites of brick-and-mortar retailers

As we argued above, the websites of brick-and-mortar retailers may be expected to obtain exclusive internet
access to some products because these retailers will partially internalize the effects of free rider issues.

Table 3 contains data about the availability of fragrances at the websites of brick-and-mortar department
stores (Bloomingdales, Dillards, Macys, Nordstrom, and Nieman Marcus). These websites tend to offer a
very small number of perfumes. Only 134 of the 1106 fragrances available over the Internet are available at
these department store websites. However, a substantial 19% of those fragrances offered at department
store sites appear to be available at retail sites only at the brick-and-mortar department store websites18. The
table also shows that perfumes that are “limited distribution” in the physical world are exactly the perfumes
that these department store sites are most likely to carry exclusively. Sixteen percent of the "limited
distribution" fragrances carried by the department store sites were carried exclusively by the department store
sites. In contrast, only 2% of the "general department store" fragrances were carried exclusively by the
department store sites. 19 Interestingly, the most “upscale” of these retailers, Nieman Marcus, has a small
collection of only 25 perfumes offered for sale on the Internet, but 15 of these cannot be found at any of the
pure-internet retailers, discount retailers, or drugstore sites. Surprisingly, considering the potential for free-
riding in new introductions, however, no new fragrance introductions are exclusively carried on the
department store websites.



18  We ignore whether or not these fragrances are also found at manufacturer sites, since manufacturers can
control the free rider problem.
19 It is somewhat difficult to decide how to treat Sephora.com. Sephora is a high-end brick-and-mortar

specialty cosmetics store that also has an Internet site. In this section, we consider products available at the
department stores. We examine whether their offerings are unavailable at pure-Internet sites, so we exclude
Sephora from that category. Sephora has a very large selection of products. Were we to include them with
the department stores, we would find many more products offered only at the brick-and-mortar sites.



                                                        - 12 -
Selection and pricing of Internet retailers

We have established that the majority of fragrance manufacturers have allowed the sale of their products over
the Internet. While most fragrance manufacturers are apparently willing to have their products sold on the
Internet, manufacturers may place restrictions on the way that their products are sold. In particular, as
discussed above, it is well known that resale price maintenance (RPM) is a way to control the free-rider
problem. While manufacturers may encounter legal difficulties with RPM per se, manufacturers are free to
supply only retailers with a "no discounting" policy.

We examine the pricing and availability of products at different types of sites in Tables 4 and 5. Table 4
compares the prices at different types of Internet sites. The entry in Table 4 shows the price of the row site
minus the price of the column site, divided by the price of the row site. The final column contains data for
the set of all manufacturer websites for fragrances made by designers in the Fragrance Foundation
subsample. The shaded area shows the price relationships between the "upscale beauty websites" and
department store websites, on the one hand, and drugstore and discount fragrance websites, on the other.
The price difference is calculated using only fragrances common to both websites. In fact, to be considered
in Table 4, both the row store and the column store must sell the most popular vehicle-size combination of
the same fragrance. If there are zero or one fragrance-size-type-vehicle combinations in common between
the two websites, then the table entry is "NA".

Table 4 shows striking price homogeneity amongst the "upscale beauty" and department store prices (upper
left corner of Table 4). The limited information that we have on manufacturer's suggested retail prices
(MSRP) suggests that these stores are almost uniformly charging the MSRP for their products. In contrast,
as the shaded area of Table 1 shows, the price disparity between the upscale beauty websites and the
department store websites, on the one hand, and the drugstore and discount perfume websites, on the other,
can be enormous. Paris Fragrance, the cheapest competitor, charges approximately 37% less than the upscale
beauty and department stores websites, on average. Shipping cost information is given in the last row of the
table. Shipping costs appear to be, if anything, positively correlated with the prices charged at the websites.

These results inform not only our study of vertical relations, but also are informative with regard to previous
papers studying price dispersion on the Internet such as Brynjolfsson and Smith (2000) and Clay,Krishnan,
Wolff, and Fernandes (2000). While we do not have extensive information about physical store prices, our
fragrance dataset represents the largest cross-section of Internet price comparisons of which we are aware.
For the websites studied, our data represent price comparisons for the entire universe of perfumes sold.20
Our findings are consistent with the findings of these other authors in that they too find a very large amount
of price dispersion across websites over the Internet.

Some of the most extreme examples of price dispersion in our dataset are quite astonishing. For example, we
found one fragrance, Byzance which was sold only at Sephora and PlanetRx. The Sephora price was $54 for
a 1.7 oz EDT spray, while the PlanetRx price was $7.99. Similarly, 1 fluid ounce of Delicious by Gale
Hayman perfume sells for $12.99 at PlanetRx, $59.99 at Perfumania, and $106 at Fragrancenet, and $190 at
the www.galehayman.com, the manufacturer website (although with 20% off the order for those willing to fill
out a survey).

We showed that those fragrances that are most exclusively distributed in the physical environment are most
reliant on manufacturer websites for Internet sales. We hypothesized that this may be because the use of a

20Although, recall, that we limit attention to the most popular size-type-vehicle combination for each
fragrance.



                                                     - 13 -
manufacturer site allows the manufacturer better control over the extent of free riding between Internet and
physical sales. The right hand column of Table 4 confirms this hypothesis. The right hand column of Table
4 shows the relationship between the prices of Internet retail websites and manufacturer websites for those
perfume-vehicle-type combinations being sold by both the retail site and the manufacturer website. The
entry in the table is the row store's price minus the manufacturers' price, divided by the row store's price.
The results here are unambiguous: manufacturer websites charge high prices. The manufacturer's average
price is greater than or equal to the price of each of the 17 retailers in our study. Furthermore, as can be seen
in the bottom of Table 4, manufacturers charge high shipping rates on average. Thus, manufacturers appear
to mitigate channel conflicts by charging high prices for their products on their own Internet websites.

The manufacturer website prices also seem to be high by the standards of physical retailing. For a subsample
of 99 perfumes, we compared manufacturer website prices to the prices charged at brick-and-mortar
department stores in Chicagoland. In every case, we found that the price at the department stores was
identical to the price at the manufacturer websites. However, while the brick-and-mortar department stores
were sometimes offering "free gift" promotions, these promotions appear to be unavailable at manufacturer
websites.

From this evidence of enormous price dispersion, both across retailer websites and between manufacturer
and retailer websites, one might be tempted to leap to the conclusion that cross-price demand elasticities are
extremely low due to high consumer search costs across websites or that there is some excludable service
element being provided by the high priced websites which leads some customers to pay higher prices in order
to shop at these websites. However, we are not convinced that any of these explanations are entirely correct.
Rather, we find it plausible that the upscale beauty websites are not selling large amounts of those fragrances
that "overlap" with the less expensive websites but are selling significant amounts of those fragrances that do
"overlap".

Table 5 reveals some data that are not apparent in Table 4. Table 5 contains data on the availability of
various perfumes over the Internet. The entries in Table 5 are the fraction of the row store's fragrances that
are also sold in the column store. For this analysis, we define an "overlap" to occur whenever two websites
are selling the same fragrance, even if the fragrances are only available in different size, type , and vehicle
combinations. The highlighted portion of Table 5 shows the overlap between the upscale/department store
websites and the discount/drugstore websites. As is apparent from the table, many of the perfumes sold at
the exclusive websites are not sold at any discount/drugstore websites. The second to last column of Table
5 shows the fraction of each site's fragrances that are found at any discount/drugstore website. The table
reveals that consumers have no choice on the Internet except upscale beauty websites and department store
websites for many products. Thus, while there is tremendous price dispersion for some products, there is
effectively zero price dispersion for other products: those products that cannot be found at drugstore or
discount websites.

Table 6 extends this analysis by examining the extent to which perfumes are sold exclusively through a single
retail website. Table 6 shows that 30% of the Fragrance Foundation subsample of fragrances appear in our
sample only at a single retail website. Furthermore, Table 6 reveals that the fragrances for which distribution
is limited to a single retailer on the Internet tend to be fragrances for which distribution is limited in the
physical world as well. The business press suggests that exclusive relationships with key brands may be
important to a retailer's success.21

21See for example, Kerry Diamond, "Beauty.com to Launch with 300 Brands," Women's Wear Daily,
October 1, 1999, which describes an exclusive relationship with the most popular brands, Estee Lauder,
Lancome, or Clinique as a "golden ring" for which beauty sites were competing.



                                                     - 14 -
Recall that, due to the legal status of RPM, the manufacturer may not be able to discontinue service to a
retailer who charges low prices, and may not be able to contractually arrange the retailer to charge the MSRP.
  Manufacturers may be willing to supply retailers who adopt an across-the-board "no discounting" policy and
who stick to it even when it is expensive to do so (when others are discounting). Since we don't know the
quantities sold by these upscale beauty websites, it could be true that these websites sell very few units of the
fragrances for which they have discount competition, and more units of the fragrances that upscale beauty
websites sell exclusively.

Our findings for fragrances address several of the hypotheses that we put forth above. First, we show some
evidence that exclusively distributed goods may actually be more likely to be available for sale on the Internet.
 However, we find that goods that rely on exclusive distribution in the physical world are likely to tightly
control distribution on the Internet by avoiding discount retail Internet sites or, in the extreme, by avoiding
retail websites overall and selling only through high-priced manufacturer websites. Restrictions on
availability are also somewhat more likely for newer products, for which free-riding may be more of a
problem. Thus, while we find that extraordinary price dispersion for some fragrances exists on the Internet,
we also find that there are many fragrances for which there is no price dispersion. Lastly, there is some
evidence that brick-and-mortar stores receive favorable sourcing of products by manufacturers. We do find
some potential evidence of internalization of the free-rider problem, as these stores do not engage in
significant discounting on the Internet.

DVD Players

Availability and Pricing
The second market that we examined is the market for DVD players. DVD players were selected for
evaluation in part because, in the brick-and-mortar environment, manufacturers use authorized dealer
networks to distribute the products. The trade press suggests that receiving authorization to sell some of
these products is non-trivial. Also, DVD players are a relatively new category of product. Properly hooking
up and operating a DVD player can be nontrivial and thus, substantial product support at the retail level
might be expected.22 Nonetheless, the demographics of DVD player purchasers seem to be a very strong
match for Internet retailing. Dealerscope magazine estimates that 4.9% of DVD players were sold online in
1999, as compared 0.6% of all VCRs.23

Availability of DVD players online through retail websites does not seem to be the issue that it is with
fragrances or, as we will show, appliances. Using the information section of the websites of the ten
manufacturers with the largest market shares (as identified by Dealerscope) , we were able to identify all
current model DVD players of these manufacturers. We then examined 39 retail websites and were able to
locate every current model DVD player for sale on some retail website. Of course, many retail websites
carried not only current model DVD players but prior generation models as well. Furthermore, we could not
detect any evidence that the websites of brick-and-mortar stores had some models for sale that were
unavailable at pure Internet retailers. Nothing in the data suggested product sourcing practices favoring the
Internet sites of brick-and-mortar retailers.


22 Of course, some of this product support might occur after the sale is made. If this is the case, this sales
effort cannot be free-ridden upon and the Internet might serve as a device to separate consumers who
forecast needing support from technophiles who do not forecast needing support.

                                                      - 15 -
Manufacturer websites do not appear to be an important sales channel for DVD players as yet. Using the 39
retail websites, we identified every manufacturer of a DVD player sold at those websites. There were a total
of 34 different brands. Only two of these manufacturers had websites through which direct sales were made.
 Interestingly, the two manufacturers were Sony and RCA, the two manufacturers identified by Dealerscope
as having the two largest market shares of DVD players in the U.S. Summary statistics for DVD player
sales over the Internet are contained in Table 7.

An interesting feature of the DVD player market is our ability to identify authorized versus unauthorized
retailers. A survey of the business and trade press suggested that manufacturers of DVD players have
recently tightened the restrictions placed on retailers regarding sales of their product over the Internet. Most
manufacturers have authorized a limited number of retailers to sell their products over the Internet. Some
manufacturers, such as Sony, post a notice on their websites cautioning consumers against purchasing from
unauthorized retailers.

Despite these restrictions, the number of "unauthorized" retailers abounds. For example, while Amazon.com
is an authorized retailer of Philips products, it is not an authorized retailer of Sony products. Nonetheless,
many Sony products are for sale on Amazon's site. Sony's official statement to the trade press is that it was
"surprised" to see Sony products for sale on Amazon.com. We hypothesize that manufacturers are selective
about the retailers that they authorize in part to control the free-riding problem.

While availability of products over the Internet appears not to be a major issue in the DVD player market, as
in fragrances, we identified substantial price dispersion across retailers. Table 8 compares prices across
Internet retailers for DVD players. The table entry is the row store's price, minus the column store's price,
divided by the row store's price. Table entries are calculated using only models in common across both
stores. The entry is "NA" if there are only 0 or one overlapping models. Because of the large number of
retailers of DVD players, the table includes only those retailers who sell at least 30 models of DVD players
plus BestBuy and Circuit City, the largest brick-and-mortar retailers of DVD players.24

The pattern of price dispersion across websitesfor DVD players is very different than for fragrances. In
fragrances, there were several retailers who sold at exactly the manufacturer's suggested retail prices, leading
to zero price dispersion across those retailers’ websites. For DVD players, there are no instances of two
retailer websites charging identical prices for all of their offerings. As in the case of fragrances, manufacturer
websites charge high prices, perhaps because the manufacturer internalizes the effect of its prices on retailer
effort.

The characteristics of price levels are investigated in regression specifications presented in Table 9. The left-
hand-side variable in Table 9 is the log price. Each observation is the price for a specific model of DVD
player at a specific retailer or manufacturer website. The independent variables are dummy variables for the
websites of brick-and-mortar retailers, manufacturer websites, and a dummy variable that equals one if the
retailer is an authorized retailer. Model fixed effects are included so that the coefficients only represent price
differences across websites for given models, not differences in the models carried. The data include
observations only from those manufacturers for whom we could determine the identity of authorized
retailers.

The findings in Table 9 confirm and extend the results for fragrances. The results suggest that brick-and-
mortar retailers charge 5% higher prices at their websites compared to non-brick unauthorized retailers.

24According to Dealerscope, Best Buy accounts for 21.5% of DVD player sales nationwide, while Circuit
City accounts for 16.9%.



                                                      - 16 -
Authorized retailers charge 11% more than unauthorized ones and manufacturer's charge 22% more than
unauthorized non-brick retailers. All of these coefficients are statistically significant at at least the 5% level.
The results accord with our basic beliefs about free riding. That is, manufacturers price their products so as
to avoid free-riding effects. The higher prices at the websites of authorized retailers may reflect either
manufacturer restrictions or the reputation benefits of manufacturer authorization (or both). However,
absent the free-riding explanation, one would be hard-pressed to explain why manufacturers like Sony would
not authorize retailers such as Amazon.25

Prices are not only higher at the websites of authorized dealers, but price dispersion across authorized dealers
is lower than price dispersion across unauthorized dealers. We examined the 18 models of DVD players
sold by at least 2 authorized dealers and at least 2 unauthorized dealers. We calculated the standard deviation
of the price for the set of authorized dealers and for the set of unauthorized dealers for each model. These
average $61 for unauthorized retailers and $18 for authorized retailers.

These findings leave open the question of why manufacturers of DVDsdo not work harder to prevent sales
by "unauthorized websites". This contrasts with fragrances where, as mentioned above, manufacturers have
been active in litigation against unauthorized retailers. On possible explanation is optimal leakage. Those
customers who buy from unauthorized retailers face the possibility that the manufacturer will not honor the
warranty.26 Manufacturers want customers who don't anticipate using post-sales service to pay lower prices.
 However, we have seen a flurry of articles in the trade press suggesting that DVD player manufacturers are
paying increasing attention to the free rider problem and are working harder to stop the diversion of supply
to unauthorized retailers.27

We also find higher prices for the Internet websites of brick-and-mortar retailers. The higher prices of brick-
and-mortar stores like Best Buy might also be attributable to reputation, although it is difficult to argue that
BestBuy has a much better reputation than a major retailer such as Amazon. Again, partial internalization of
the free-rider problem by a high share brick-and-mortar retailer seems like a likely explanation for the brick-
and-mortar retailer's higher prices. 28

Thus, our results for DVD players are in part similar to and in part different from our results for fragrances.
We do not find any products that are completely unavailable on the Internet, nor do we find any available
solely at manufacturer websites. However, as in perfumes, we do find evidence that manufacturers attempt
to control the extent of price discounting on the Internet. As in fragrances, manufacturers charge high prices
and those retailers whose sales are "authorized" by the manufacturer charge higher prices as well. While the
trade press suggests that it is easier for existing brick-and-mortar retailers to become authorized Internet
retailers than it is for a pure Internet retailer, we do not find much evidence in the data that the brick-and-
mortar retailers are the sole suppliers for any products. However, consistent with our findings for
fragrance, we find that the websites of brick-and-mortar retailers charge somewhat higher prices than pure

25 On its website, Sony lists some criteria that authorized Internet retailers must meet, such as 24 hour
response time to customer emails. These all appear to be criteria that Amazon.com would meet.
26 In principle, manufacturers like Sony reserve the right not to honor the warranties of consumers

purchasing from unauthorized retailers. In practice, they honor all warranties unless the serial number of the
product has been obliterated by the dealer (a practice frequently used to prevent tracking the retailer's supply
source.
27 See, for example, "Harman's strict web policy gets stricter," Audio Week, August 16, 1999 and

"Toshiba to Roll out Authorized Dealer Policy", Consumer Electronics, April 24, 2000. .
28 Employees of Chicago-area Best Buy and Circuit City stores stated that their online prices are always the

same as their in-store prices.

Internet retailers.

Side-by-side Refrigerators

Availability and Pricing

The third category of products that we examined are side-by-side refrigerators. Refrigerators were selected
because of the use of authorized dealer networks in appliances as well as the wide quality gradient in
refrigerators. In sharp contrast to DVD players and fragrances, we found very few websites selling side-by-
side refrigerators and even fewer that would ship nationally. Given the large economies of scale in the
logistics of shipping refrigerators, the paucity of sellers is not, perhaps surprising. The largest selection of
products seems to be offered by the brick-and-mortar retailers (Sears, Abt,) and US Appliance, a brick-and-
mortar distributor. These brick-and-mortar retailers are the only ones who carry the upscale brand Jenn-
Air. The only pure Internet retailer with a large selection of products is helpfindit.com.

In contrast to fragrances and DVD players, we found no examples of direct sales by manufacturers over the
Internet. This is probably largely due to the logistics issues involved in shipping refrigerators.
Table 10 shows price dispersion and product availability data for each of the retailers in our sample. Price
dispersion is very low once helpfindit is excluded from consideration. Since helpfindit typically charges
above the manufacturer suggested retail price for its products, it is hard to see how it stays in business. The
lowest prices are recorded by Shop4.com. The small selection of models at Shop4.com suggests that that site
is fulfilling a "closeout" role.

The right hand columns of Table 10 show the availability of high end/professional quality brands at each
website. Sub-Zero and Viking, brands that we identified as the two most expensive brands advertised in
wealthy-targeted and cuisine-oriented magazines, are unavailable for sale at any Internet site. Since it seems
quite unlikely that a consumer would purchase these items without first visiting a retail store, free rider
considerations may explain the absence of these products. Thus, for appliances, the most promotion-
intensive products appear to be completely unavailable for sale over the Internet.

Dealerscope estimates Sears's share of the overall appliance sales in the U.S. as exceeding that of the next
twelve largest competitors combined. Thus, appliances might be a category in which a very high share
retailer completely internalizes the free rider problem. Sears's average prices, only 3% below the MSRP in
our sample, supports that interpretation.


VI.      General Findings Across Industries

Cross-sectional evidence in our data align with our hypothesis that manufacturers of more promotion-
intensive products are more likely to restrict Internet distribution. For fragrances we find evidence that the
most exclusively distributed perfumes in the physical world have a greater tendency to distribute only
through a manufacturer website, where the manufacturer controls all aspects of Internet selling. We find
that the most expensive professional-quality refrigerators (Subzero and Viking) are not available online at all.


Given that there will be some Internet availability of the product, how have manufacturers dealt with the free
rider problem? For perfume, especially for the select brands that have high levels of exclusion in the physical
world, we found a) significant ability to prevent price discounts, b) significant ability to prevent availability at
drugstore/discount websites, c) some ability to withhold the newly introduced brands from Internet sites and
d) the use of manufacturer websites with high prices. For refrigerators, there are no manufacturing websites,


                                                       - 18 -
the expensive high-end brands (exclusively distributed in brick-and-mortar stores) are unavailable at all on the
Internet, and there is minimal discounting on Internet sites. This suggests, as seems reasonable, that the need
to control free riding in appliances is a significant concern of manufacturers. Finally for DVD players, we see
widespread availability on the Internet, yet only two manufacturers have websites. Just as in fragrances, these
manufacturer websites have high prices.

Consistent with the findings of other Internet researchers, we find a considerable amount of price dispersion
on the Internet for DVD players and fragrances. However,we do not find significant price dispersion for
appliances.29 For both fragrances and DVD players, however, there are caveats to this finding and these
caveats illustrate the extent to which manufacturers have tried to mitigate the free rider problem. Many
fragrances simply cannot be found on websites that offer discounts, implying that there is zero price
dispersion for a large number of fragrances. Furthermore, for those fragrances, consumers can expect not to
save any money by purchasing over the Internet. In fact, our research assistant shopper found many
instances of "free gift" promotions at brick-and-mortar stores that were unavailable over the Internet. For
DVD players, the low end of the price distribution is created by unauthorized retailers. As noted above, we
are somewhat skeptical that manufacturers are making an effort to stop sales by unauthorized retailers.
Internet sales now account for a nontrivial amount of sales (about 4.9 percent), and the trade press has
reflected an increased sensitivity on the part of DVD manufacturers to channel conflict.

While it does appear that RPM and availability restrictions are used widely to control vertical relationships
between manufacturers and Internet retailers, there are other mechanisms of vertical control that do not
appear to be used widely. In particular, one might imagine that the technology for enforcing exclusive
territories is quite simple: one could allow Internet websites to only ship to consumers who live in certain zip
codes, those zip codes outside the existing retailers’ territories. In our searches, we found no instances of
this practice in fragrances. Indeed, in all three of the categories studied, we found only one potential instance
of this practice: US-Appliance.com sells many high-end appliance brands. They have a note on their site that
states that they will ship Thermador brand products only to Michigan or New York. While we could not get
the site to confirm this precisely, this restriction is most likely due to manufacturer geographic restrictions.30

Finally, our results suggest that large brick-and-mortar stores retailers may partially internalize the effects of
free-riding when choosing prices for their Internet stores. On average, brick-and-mortar retailers chose high
prices in our study. We do find limited evidence for this leading to them receiving favorable treatment in
obtaining product from manufacturers. In fragrances, we see that 19% of the fragrances on the websites of
brick and mortar department stores are not found on the websites of any pure Internet retailers or
discount/drugstore websites. For DVDs, the result is less clear. Brick and mortar retailers seem are more
likely to be authorized retailers than are pure Internet retailers. However, DVD player manufacturers have
not been successful in preventing the sale of their products by many unauthorized retailers on the Internet.


VII.    Conclusion

Our research indicates that channel conflict is and should be a serious concern for manufacturers. Where
exclusivity is used in offline brick-and-mortar retailing to control free riding, some comparable restraint is
needed to control Internet websites. The two most common restraints are pricing (with no discounts
allowed) and, less frequently, the restriction of available supply to Internet websites. The most striking

 Ignoring the one appliance retailer that consistently offers goods at significantly above the MSRP.

30The stringency with which territorial restrictions are enforced is unclear. Corespondence with US-
Appliance.com suggested that they would be willing to ship a particular Thermador product to Illinois.



                                                      - 19 -
empirical regularity in our data is that manufacturers appear not to use their Internet websites to undercut the
prices of their retailers.
We regard any conclusions that we draw as preliminary, since retailing over the Internet is in its infancy. The
patterns that we observe today could well change as Internet penetration alters the characteristics of the
marginal consumer. It appears to us, from examining both the trade press and trends in litigation, that there
is a growing recognition that uncontrolled Internet sales through unauthorized websites are not always in a
manufacturer's best interest where free riding can occur and sales service is important. Accordingly, in the
future, we expect to see manufacturers paying more attention to channel conflict and further restricting
Internet pricing and availability for products where sales service is important.
