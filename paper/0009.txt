                      From Age-Earnings Profiles to the

                          INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY


       Economists have long been interested in individual earnings differ-

ences and in the dispersion of earnings within populations. Recent

development of explicit theoretical and empirical earnings functions from

life cycle human capital investment models increases the potential to ex-

plain existing earnings distributions and to predict changes in it. The

purpose of this paper is to suggest how these earnings functions can be

used more directly to derive predicted earnings and human wealth dis-

tributions for populations and sub-populations, with an empirical illus-

tration. This is accomplished by an application of statistical distri-

bution    theory as a link between the   earnings function and the earnings

distribution.    The appropriate   statistical distribution theory   is first
presented in very general terms. The means of translating the joint
distribution of a population's characteristics into earnings distribution
through the earnings function is presented. When an explicit relationship

between earnings or human wealth and the characteristics of an individ-

ual which determine it is specified and when the joint density of those

characteristics in a population is known the distribution of that popu-

lation can be deduced.

      The empirical illustration entails application of the general frame-

work to a particular set of data, the 1960 Census of Population, using an

estimated earnings function. Both distributions of earnings and human

wealth are predicted. The predicted distributions are then compared with

actual distributions when possible.

      Earnings as a cubic function of age, schooling, ability and their

interactions are estimated using results from the NBER—Thorndike sample.

This earnings function is used to predict earnings and human wealth dis-

tributions for the 1960 Census population based on the joint distribution

of age, schooling, and ability based on age and schooling data from the

1960 Census of Population and ability data within schooling classes from

the NBER—Thorndike sample. Predicted earnings distributions are derived

for the overall population, for schooling classes, for age groups, and

for ability classes. Both the distribution of expected or mean earnings

arid the distribution of earnings corrected for variation not explained by

age, schooling, and ability are presented for each along with selected

summary statistics and Lorenz curves.

      The distribution of human wealth of the 1960 Census population is

then predicted. Human wealth is defined as the present value of the

earnings stream from the end of schooling until age sixty-six. Human

wealth is then a function of schooling, ability, and the rate of
                                     —3—


discount. It is assiimed that everyone has the same rate of discount but

rates from 3 to 7 per cent are considered. Human wealth distributions are

predicted for the overall population, for schooling classes and ability

classes.

       The   most striking result of the empirical estimation is that there
is   clearly a great deal more   inequality in earnings than in human wealth.
Also   an interesting result is that at a discount rate above 5 per cent an

increased schooling level of the population does not necessarily increase

the expected value of human wealth and that at 6 per cent and above it

actually declines monotonica]].y. Detailed comparisons of age groups,

schooling groups and ability groups are discussed.

             FRAIIEWORI( FOR TRANSLATING THE JOINT DISTRIBUTION
         OF POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS INTO EARNINGS DISTRIBUTIONS

       Life cycle   earnings models allow the specification of a functional

form   for the earnings of    an individual over his life cycle. Earnings at

any point in the life cycle are determined by both formal schooling

and past schooling investment behavior. Earnings are a function of,

for example, the initial stock of human capital at the beginning of the

life cycle, the human capital production parameters including the eff i—

ciency parameter 8 and the input coefficients         and 82, the rate of

depreciation of the capital stock, the length of working life, the

market interest rate, the rental rate of human capital, the price of

direct educational imputs and of course, age. The characteristics may

be summarized by the vector

            C   (8,   E,   8i 82, 6, ii,   N, P, R)                    C].)

       The purpose of this section is to show how the overall earnings

distribution of a population and earnings distributions of various

subpopulations can be derived from the joint distribution of characteris-

tics of that population. The joint distribution of characteristics can

be transformed through the functional form f or earnings into the

various earnings distributions.

       Any individual takes his characteristics as given, and not under

his control, and invests in an optimal fashion accordingly. For any

individual, earnings are thus a function of age with his characteristics

acting   as parameters. For a given population the individuals in it will

differ in characteristics as well as age. The characteristics are then
                                —5—


variable across individuals in the population as is age and the joint

density function of age and the vector of characteristics.

     Variation in earnings within the population can be considered as

coming from two sources, variation in age and variation in characteristics.

Individuals with different parameters and epdowments are constrained to

select different optimum age profiles. Individuals with the same

parameters and endowments are constrained to select different optimum

age profiles while individuals with the same parameters and endowments

select the same investment patterns but still differ in age. These

sources of variation are considered separately, then combined.


                  Variation in Earnings due to Age Only

     Variation of earnings due to variation in age in the population is

an important source of income Inequality and can be analyzed by means

of the life—cycle earnings function. The specification by means of the

life cycle model of an earnings function allows the age profile of

earnings for an individual to be identified and thus allows a much more

refined analysis of the population income density function because the

age distribution of the population can be explicitly accounted for.

     First, consider the effect of the age distribution on the income of

identical persons. That Is, consider the population of all persons who

have exactly the same Initial endowment, production parameters, depreciation
                                      —6—


rate, working life, input price and rental rate. Let these persons

differ in age. Since the individuals are identical in all characteristics

except age, they all have the same age profile but are at different points

along that profile. For each age there is a unique income, Y. Let

Y(a,C) be the earnings function, where a is age1 and C is a vector of

parameters and initial endowments.

     Consider the density of persons with respect to age. The density

function g1(a), where a stands for age, is given by


                       g1(a)                Oa1N                     (2)


                         0                  elsewhere


     Consider the two basically different regions of a with respect to

the age profile.

where Y(a,C) is monotonically increasing with respect to a, and

where Y(a,C) is monotonically decreasing with respect to a where:



      1Note that age is different from work experience. Age begins at
the time when the individual makes a decision by selecting an investment
pattern, or begins to make his own investment decisions. Work experience
begins when the individual enters the labor force, but a year of labor
force participation does not necessarily imply a full year of experience
especially if the work is not full time.

      2Life cycle theories indicate age profiles demonstrating these
tharacteristics. The monotonicity need not be limited to two regions,
but this assumption simplifies the analysis. The shapes of the curves
are assumed but are consistent with the empirical findings.
                                                                             S

              age   where positive earnings begin

      amax     age where earnings are a maximum

      N      = age at the end of the work life


In the region a* to a    the individual is investing only a fraction of
                     max
his potential earning and is realizing positive earnings and those earnings
are rising monotonically. In the region a to N, the individual's
earnings   are declining monotonically due to low investment and a dominating

depreciation of existing human capital. This last region need not exist if

there is no depreciation.3       In the region 0 to a*, the individual is

investing all of his potential earning in producing more human capital and

is realizing no income.4       Individuals in this age category will not be

included in the discussion since earnings while in full—time schooling

are not generally reported and the data used in a later section will be

for persons reporting earnings from employment. Therefore, all earnings

distributions are for persons reporting positive earnings and those

persons still in full—tim& schooling are not included.

      The objective is to transform the density of persons with respect

to age into the density. of persons with respect to income via the earnings

function Y(a,C).. (See Figurel)        To.accoznpiish this, first solve for

the inverse functional relationship mapping income into age. This can

be done only for monotonically increasing or decreasing regions. We



      3
       If the stock of human capital does not depreciate, earnings
received as a rent on that stock must rise since the stock can only grow
and investment in producing more is a declining function of age.

      4Net earnings will be zero, but observed earnings may not be under
imperfect loan markets.

defined Y(a,C) to be monotonically increasing in the region a* < a < a

and monotonically decreasing in the region a               <   a   <   N.   On each region

we can then define the inverse function a =        Y(Y).               For any income in the

range Y(a*, C) < Y < Y(N,C) there is exactly one inverse age in the region

a* < a
             <ad.5
                     However, for any income in the range Y(N,C) < Y <             Y(a,C)
there are two ages corresponding to that income.6                  These considerations

must be dealt with in the transformation to obtain the income density

function.

     Given the foregoing specifications, the conditional probability

density function for income is g3(Y/C). The probability density element

for any age interval IS transformed through the earnings function into

the probability density element of the corresponding income interval.

Age density is transformed uniquely from the age interval a* < a < ad

into the income interval Y(a*, C) < Y <                        However, in the age

A doublecounting of income occurs then at higher levels of income, while
a single. counting occurs at lower levels of income with a discrete jump

point at the income Y(ad, C). These statements are presented in statis-

tical terms in Appendix A.

     For a given density function of age a downturn in earnings at later

yearsin the life cycle adds a doublecounting effect which introduces a



         5
       The point aA is the age at which income during the life cycle
equals income at the end of the working life. Thus, all incomes above
Y(N) occur twice, once while rising and once while declining.

      6Again the slopes of the curves are assumed. It is possible to
consider the case where Y(N,C) < Y(a,C) but the above case was chosen
for expositional purposes.

source of negative skewness or at least less positive skewness that is        S
not present if the earnings function increases monotonically.

     A second source of a tendency toward negative skewness can be noted

at this point. If the earnings function rises at a decreasing rate and

falls at an increasing rate as is drawn in Figure 6, then as the age

interval moves toward aax from a*, or from N, it maps into increasingly

smaller income intervals thus transforming probability density from equal

age intervals into increasingly smaller income intervals. This tends to

increase the density of high income levels relative to low income levels

for a given earnings function and a given age density function relative to

what it would otherwise be. These sources of a tendency toward negative

skewness have not been noted in the income distribution literature.

     The moments of this conditional income distribution are functions

of the moments of age distribution. The relationships are specified

through the earnings function. The moments of the income distribution of

persons with the same parameters and initial endowments are conditional

upon and thus functions of those characteristics. It should also be

noted that the moments of income for an entire population are functions

of the moments of these conditional moments over- characteristic space.

See Appendix B for a more precise statement.


                Variation in Earnings-due to Variation in
                   Endowment and Characteristics Only

     Consider the effect of the distribution of persons with respect to

characteristics on the income of persons the same age.7     Each individual




      7This statement implied using the joint density with respect to
characteristics of all persons at the given age. Alternatively, it Is
possible to consider the distribution of- earnings if everyone were at
the specified age by using the overall joint of the entire population.

with   different characteristics has a different income profile but is the

same distance a into his profile. The distribution of income will derive

from the distribution of persons by characteristics at that age (see

.Figures 2 and 3). There is a different density function for each age

a, but there is a continuous array of density functions over all ages

between 0 and N.8

       The objective is to transform the joint density function of persons

with respect to parameters and initial endowments into the density of

persons with respect to income via the earnings function. The 4istri—

bution of these characteristics is assumed independent of age. Density

is transformed from an interval in n—dimensional characteristic space

into a corresponding income interval through the earnings function. The

moments of this conditional income distribution are functions of the

moments of the characteristics. The relationship is specified through

the earnings function. The moments of the income distribution of persons

the same age is conditional upon and thus a function of age. For example,

the, popular belief that the variance of income increases with age as

summarized by Mincer (1970) can be considered in this context. An

empirical consideration of such matters appears in a later section. For

a fuller exposition, see Appendix A.


                       Overall Variation in Earnings

       Consider the combined effect of the variation of the population with

respect to both age and parameters and initial endowments on the distri-

bution of personal income. Probability density is transformed from



      8Again only persons having completed full—time schooling are included
in the age distribution.

intervals   in (n+l) dimensional age—characteristic spaoe into income inter-

vals through the earnings function. This is considered as an extension

of the previous framework.

     In an earlier part of this section the density function of income

at each age was derived (see Figure3). Now combine these density

functions to form the joint density function of income and age, g6(Y,a)

in Figure 4. The conditional densities g4(Ya) are in effect scaled

down by the marginal density of age g1(a) through the relationship


                                               •
                          g6(Y,a) =   g4(Ya)       g1(a).                     (5)


     The overall earnings distribution represented by the marginal density

function of income Y is obtained by integrating the joint density function

g6('1,a) over the age dimension. As is illustrated in Figure 5, this sums

all of the density from two dimensions into one. The contour of density

is effectively flattened against the income density plane. Again the

moments of the personal income distribution are functions of the moments

of age and of the moments of the parameters and initial endowments. These

relationships are estimated in a later section. For a more complete

statement of these concepts see Appendix A.

     Another way to view this same process is to reconsider Figure 2.

Graphing the density functions g4(YIa) each weighted by g1(a) in income—

probability space results in a continuum of curves such that when the

heights or functions are added overall a density function of income is

obtained as is illustrated in Figure 6

     Thus, the density function for income         is   derived from the density

functions of age and of parameters and initial endowments. The analysis

proceeded through several stages, each of which yields useful information

about the personal income distribution.

        Variation   in the Present Value of Net Earnings, Human Wealth

       Consider the distribution of the population by human wealth.9     Human

wealth is defined as the present value of the stream of net earnings over

• the individual's life cycle at the age a = 0.           Therefore,

                                     N
                            W(C) =   j e—raY(a,C)

                                     a*


 Differences in wealth between individuals occur because of differences

 in their characteristics. If we know the joint density function of C, we

 can   derive   the density element of W(C) in a manner similar to that of

 Income.

       The implications of this general framework are as follows. Whether

 we are interested in studying the distribution of earnings or the

 distribution of human wealth, the life cycle income theories tell us that

 the distribution of the population by characteristics is Important. These

 characteristics determine the optimal time spent In formal schooling, and

 after schooling investment decisions as well as the flow of actual earning

 and maximum human wealth.




        See T. W. Schultz (1971, P. 23) and an unpublished paper, the
 NBER Approach to Human Resource Problems, by Finis Welch, Research
 Associate, National Bureau of Economic Research, New York, 1970, p. 6,
 for further discussion of this concept.

                               AN EMPIRICAL ILLUSTRATION


      This section will provide an illustration of the empirical use of the

more general framework. An estimated earnings—age relationship dependent

upon level of schooling and       ability is   described and earnings distributions

as well as human wealth distributions are predicted from it. The estimated

earnings    function is based on the NBER—Thorndike sample of Air Force     pilot
and   navigator   school   candidates in 1943.   The predicted distributions are
for   employed males in 1960. This section may be characterized as answer-

ing   "What would be the distribution of earnings of the men in the NBER-
Thorndike   sample if they had the distribution         schooling present
                                                     of age and

in the 1960 Census?" or "What would be the distribution of earnings of
employed men in 1960 if they were like the men in the NBER-Thorndike
sample?"    Several caveats are in order to use one group to predict the

other. Predicted and actual 1960 distributions are compared when

possible.

                  A Specific Earnings Function and Estimates

      It   is well founded theoretically and empirically that earnings
depend upon schooling, ability, and age or experience)0 The earnings
function estimated and used here results from a life cycle of earnings

model which is discussed elsewhere in detail along with the empirical

estimates.11 The estimated earnings function is cubic in age, quadratic

in schooling, and cubic in ability, including

all interactions. This is the "best" equation in the sense that the age,

schooling, and ability polynomials were determined by error variance

criteria,12 The estimated earnings function is

age sixteen. No individual in the sample had less than a high school
education. Caution should be taken for predicting below this schooling
level, especially late in the life cycle. The estimates are based on
observation of 15,578 age—earnings points from 4,956 individuals.
                                       — 20 —



The resulting age—earnings profiles are presented in Figures 7 for various

ability and schooling levels. Both schooling and ability raise earnings

at every age in the life cycle after some Initial period.14 Earnings

estimated beyond age fifty—six are a pure prediction in the sense that

there are no individuals in the sample beyond that age. The resulting

estimates of human wealth defined as the present value of predicted earn-

ings are presented in Figures 8 for discount rates of 4 and 6 percent.15

        Consider the characteristics of the NBER-Thorndike sample which may

make it   different   from the general population described in the 1960

Census.   The NBER-Thorndik. sample is bas.d on a group of males volunteer-
ing for Air Force pilot, navigator, and bombadier programs in the last
half   of 1943. These volunteers were given initial screening tests and a

set of seventeen tests to measure various abilities in 1943. Thorndike
and Hagen sent a questionnaire to a sample of 17,000 of these men in 1955
which included a question on 1955 earnings. The NBER sent to a subset of
these a   subsequent   questionnaire   in 1969 which included additional ques-

tions on earnings in later years and questions on      schooling and   initial
job earnings.




        14Again these results are discussed In detail in Lillard (1973).

            to the data limitations in age mentioned earlier, it was
assumed that earnings remained constant over the life cycle after the
peak earnings period.

       The data includes five separate approximately equally spaced points16

on the age-income profile as well as the year of initial job, year of last

full—time schooling, years of schooling and seventeen separate measures of

ability. The age—income points are approximately initial job, 1955, 1960,

1964, and 1968. The individuals in the Thorndike sample differ from the

U.S. male population as a whole in several ways.17 First the sample in-

cludes a high ability group. All of the men completed high school of

high school equivalency examinations, and passed the initial screening

for the Air Force flight program. Their general health was better than

the general population18 in 1969. They were more homogenous in height

and weight due to military qualifications. They seem to have a high

degree of self confidence, self reliance and risk preference. They tend

to be entrepreneurs, an unusual 20 per cent work longer hours. Some of

these factors may however be related to the high ability. The observed

age range is nineteen to fifty-seven years but with less than 1 per cent

outside the range nineteen to fifty—five. The cubic earnings equation is




   16Any observation which might cause special problems is omitted. These
include those individuals disabled, unemployed, in the military, or who
is a pilot at his major occupation. Particular year observations for an
individual are omitted if for example the year of initial job was ques-
tionable.


   '7Many of these comments originated with T. F. Juster who directed the
data collection for the NBER.

   18The model response was excellent with 57 per cent, 38 per cent were
good, 3 per cent fair, and less than 1 per cent each were poor or non—
rei;ponse.

quite a poor prediction   above this range since predicted earnings drop

rapidly to large negative values; therefore, earnings are   assumed   con-

stant at their peak level after the peak occurs)9




  19When mean earnings predicted distributions are derived without this
assumption (and negative earnings are not counted in relative frequencies)
about 10 per cent of total frequency is lost primarily from high schooling,
low ability, and late age groups. Three, fifteen, eighteen, and twenty—
seven per cent are lost within schooling classes 12, 13—15, 16, and 17+,
respectively. Four, eight, twenty, and thirty-eight per cent are lost
within age groups 30—34, 35—44, 45-54, and 55—64, respectively. Thirty-
three and fourteen per cent are lost within the lowest and second lowest
(both below average) ability groups, respectively.

   Deriving     Earnings Distributions from the Estimated Earnings Function


       The distribution of earnings derives from the distribution of the

population with respect to age, ability, and      time   in schooling. The

purpose of this section is to apply the principles of the general frame-

work using the estimated earnings. Use of the framework is illustrated

by using 1960 United States Census of Population data on the distribution

of the United States population of males eighteen years old and over by

labor force status, years of school completed, and age to predict earn-

ings   distributions based on    the estimated earnings function.2°

        Since   the   earnings function predicts earnings only after the end

of full-time schooling, the distribution of the population by age and

schooling is taken only for persons employed and in the civilian labor

force. The joint and marginal distributions of age and schooling are

presented in Table 1. Since the earnings function is estimated based

on a sample reporting earnings only from ages nineteen to fifty—five,

all distributions are for that age group only. Since all persons in

the NBER-Thorndike sample have at least a high school education, pre-

dictions are restricted to that population. That is, the distribution

of yearly earnings is predicted for persons who are between the ages

of eighteen and sixty—four, have at least a high school education and

are   employed.21 The distribution of the population with respect to ability

is assumed    to be the   same as the NBER—Thorndike sample on which the earn-

ing function was estimated since no ability data are reported       in the   1960

Census of Population. The distribution of ability by schooling class used
is presented in Table 2. For calculation of predicted yearly income, it

is assumed that all individuals in an age or schooling class are at the

midpoint of that class.22

        Yearly earnings are calculated for each age, schooling, ability

combination corresponding to     midpoints of class intervals.   Each calcu-

lated   yearly income assumes the relative frequency of the corresponding
age, schooling, ability combination. The relative frequency of any
(A, B, S) combination is calculated as the joint relative frequency of
the age, schooling combination reported by the Census of Population
times    relative frequency of the ability level within that schooling
        the

class.23 These relative frequencies are then sued into relative


   21The age is extended to forty-four because it corresponds to the
closest Census of Population age classification 35—64 years old. The
distributions do include persons employed while going to school full
time and are correspondingly incorrectly estimated.


   22Any assumption   about how observations are   distributions   within
reported class intervals is arbitrary. This assumption facilitates
calculation of earnings but adds a source of error in the predicted
distribution of earnings. The predicted relative frequencies are
created in a discrete rather than a continuous manner.


   23Assuming this distribution of ability is a source of error in the
predicted distribution to the extent that the distribution of ability
of Air Force pilot and navigator school candidates in 1943 is differ-
ent from the distribution of ability of employed males in 1960.

frequencies   of yearly earnings for intervals of a thousand dollars.24

      The resulting predicted overall distribution of earnings and the

predicted distribution for various subpopulations effectively represent

distributions of mean earnings. However, only about 28 per cent of the

variation is earnings is explained by variation in age, schooling, and

ability.

      Consider the problem of the distribution of earnings after cor-

recting for variation not accounted for by variation in age, schooling,

and ability. A very simple approximate estimating procedure is used

here. The error variance of the estimating equation is 36593472.

(standard error =   6049.25).   It is assumed that the errors are

identically and independently25 distributed with mean zero and standard

deviation 6049.25. The probability density for any individual age,

schooling, ability combination is calculated as before but the density

is allocated to earnings intervals according to the above normal dis-

tribution   centered on the midpoint of the interval in which the pre-
dicted value falls. The interval in which the predicted earnings value


   24The equal intervals of $1,000 is used to allow the greatest per-
spective and skewness since the discrete and widely spaced midpoints
of the age and schooling intervals distort the continuity of the pre-
dicted distribution. The predicted distributions with unequal interval
lengths for higher incomes used in Census of Population tabulations are
presented later for comparisons with the actual distributions calculated
from Census of Population data.

   25Each individual observations error is distributed independently of
age, schooling, ability and the error in any other observation.




                                                                           .

falls   receives an incremental relative frequency of .0662 times         the   rela-

tive frequency of that age, schooling, ability combination.26 Intervals

adjoining the central interval receive an incremental relative frequency

of .0643 times the relative frequency of (A, S, B) each, and so forth

until all relative frequency     of   the error is exhausted.

        Finally, the actual distribution of earnings for employed males
sixteen   to sixty-four years old with at least a high school education
is calculated from more general distributions reported in the 1960 Census
of Population.
     All three overall earnings distributions and the corresponding
Lorenz Curves are presented in Figure 9. Selected statistics and re].a—
tive frequency tables     are included in    the tables of individual type
distribution subsections.
        The   major caveats may be suiarized     as   follows. The NBER-
Thorndike sample and the population of employed males in 1960 differ
in several ways the most important of which is the high Level         of

ability   present in the NBER-Thorndike sample. Even though ability
distributions      by schooling class are used,   the   distribution of

ability especially in lower schooling classes will overstate ability

relative to the actual distribution in the 1960 population. The 1960




   26lnterval length is $1,000. All intervals probabilities are cor-
rected according to the truncated normal so that only positive earn-
ings are counted and the total relative frequency of all positive
earnings is unity.

population   is heavily concentrated at lower levels of schooling especially

high school which is at the lower end of the range of observation for the

Thorndike sample and thus subject to less confidence in estimation. Inter-

val midpoints with respect to schooling are used for schooling classes

13-15 (14) and 17+ (18). More precise information about the distribution

within these intervals would sharpen the prediction.

       Predictions beyond age fifty-six are made assuming earnings constant

after peak earnings. This is necessary due to the data limitations in

the NBER-Thorndike sample. The age distribution used from the 1960 Census

assumes   individuals are at the midpoint       of age intervals that increase in

length   from   two years at early ages to ten at late ages. Approximately

10 per cent of the 1960 population falls in the least reliable age

interval 55—64.

       The unequal intervals also cause problems in comparing predicted and

actual earnings distributions. Predicted distributions can be made for

any interval groups and are made for equal $1,000 intervals here. The

Census of Population earnings distributions are unequal beyond $7,000.

Statistics are computed using interval midpoints and will vary with differ-

ent groupings. The interval midpoint 25,000 is used for the interval

>   15 in the Census of Population while equal 1,000 intervals up to 50,000

are used for predicted distributions.

         Several important differences remain. The 1960 Census figures are

for total income while the predicted figures are for earnings in the

labor market. There may be important differences in weeks worked during
                                        — 37 —




the   year,   and hours worked during the week between the sample and the
population.      There are indications that the men in the NBER-Thorndike
sample tend to work longer hours and to spend less time unemployed.
Another very important difference is that the 1960 Census figures
include   employed students while these persona are       excluded   in

estimating     the   earnings   function. This   contributes largely to the
large relative frequency of very low income at early ages. For
example, 84 per cent of sixteen and seventeen year olds earned less
than $1,000 as did 53 per cent of eighteen and nineteen year olds.
These   are likely to be mostly      employed students.

                   Predicted   Mean Earnings Distributions

        These earnings distributions are    derived   by transforming probability

density from three-dimensional (age, schooling, ability) space through

the estimated earnings function into the        earnings   dimension. Since age,

schooling, and   ability are   not the only characteristics of an individual

which determine earnings, these may be termed expected or mean         earnings
distributions. They are    the   distribution of the expected value of earn-

ings.

        Selected statistics relating to the     earnings   distributions are

presented in Table 3. The relative frequency distributions are in
Figure 10 and Table 4. Lorenz curves are plotted in Figure 10.

  Predicted Earnings Distributions Corrected for Unexplained Variation

        These earnings distributions are mean earnings distributions cor-
rected for   variation in earning, not explained by age, schooling, and

ability. Instead of transforming density          from (age, schooling, ability)-
space   into a single earnings point it is spread over the positive real

line in a manner proportional to the normal probability density with its

center   at the predicted mean value    and   standard deviation equal to the
estimated standard error of the regression.
        Selected statistics are presented in Table 5. Relative frequency
distributions   are   presented   in Figure 11 and   Table 6. Lorena curves
are plotted in Figure 11.

        earnings. Both the                             larger in the predicted
                                   center and dispersion are

        distributions. All of the distributions display- positive skewness, and
        have   center and dispersion positively related to age and schooling. The

        predicted distributions also         indicate increased center and dispersion
        with   increased ability. Th. distributions corrected for unexplained
        variation tend to "overcorrectTM in the sense that the resulting distri-
        butions are more smooth than th. actual distribution.
                Consider    the properties of these distributions in more detail.

        with respect to central tendency,          both   the mean and median are over-

        stated by the predicted distribution. Even             so,   the mean and median

        move in the right direction within age and schooling classes. The

        mean   increases                                         predicted and
                            within higher schooling classes for both

        actual   distributions. However, the median falls from high school to
        some college then rises in the mean and actual distributions but rises
        continuously throughout in the corrected distribution. Mean and median
        earnings rise continuously with age in the actual distributions             but

        decline   very slightly before rising continuously after age twenty-four
        in   both predicted distributions • This dip in mean earnings is clearly
        evident   in the age-earnings profiles in          Figure 7.   In the actual dis-

        tribution this property would be hidden by the inclusion of employed
        young students with very low earnings. Both mean and median earnings

arepredicted    to dip slightly then rise very      sharply as   the ability level

of a subgroup rises. Again the     high   ability level of the NBER-Thorndike

sample itself is a source of the overstatement of earnings. It should

be noted that the overall mean of the population is a weighted average27

of    individual subgroup means, whether grouped by age, schooling, or

ability.

        Dispersion is overstated in the predicted distributions whether

measured by the standard deviation or the coefficient of variation. The

exceptions are that both measures are understated in the mean distribution

for ages below   tweny-nine   and the high school group. The standard devia-

tion increases continuously with schooling. As age increases it dips

slightly before age twenty-four in the predicted distributions then rises

continuously as it does throughout in the actual distribution. The

standard dip then rises as ability increases. The coefficient of variation,

or standard deviation relative to the mean, moves in a less stable way.

As the schooling level increases it first rises than declines in the cor-

rected and actual distributions, that is, the increased variance is more

than offset by the increased mean.        In the   mean distribution the co-

efficient of   variation doubles from high school to some college then re-
mains   constant.   As age increases the coefficient of variation rises
continuously   in the predicted distributions while it forms        a U-shape in




     27The weights are   obviously the relative     frequency of the subgroups.
the actual distribution. The coefficient of variation is noticeably higher
in the ability group average to one standard deviation above average and
fairly constant outside that interval. It is interesting to note here that
the variance of overall earnings is the sum of the average of the variances
of the subgroups and the variance of average earnings of subgroups.28
        Another characteristic of earnings distributions widely discussed in
the literature is concentration represented by the Lorsnz curve and its
sury statistic the Gini coefficient. 29 The Lorenz curve and Gini co-
efficient are unambiguous measures of concentration only if the Lorenz
curves do not cross. An infinite number of Lorenz curves may have the
same Gini concentration coefficient if they cross. If two Lorenz           curves

cross   once,   say at the point (.7, .3) and have the same Gini coefficient

the    population underlying the Lorenz      curve   which is beneath in the region
bounded by (0,0), (0, .3), (.7, 0), and (.7, .3) may be said to have income
distributed     more   unequally among   low income holders (lower 70 per cent)

than   among high income holders relative to the other population. This
says nothing about location of high and low, only about the concentration


          the average,of variances, and the variance, of averages, are
calculated weighted by the relative frequency of the subgroups. Formally
E(Y)      B [Var (Y) subgroup ] + Var ((Y) subgroup 1.

      29The Gini coefficient is the area under the Lorenz curve relative to
the area of the triangle, one—half a larger Gini coefficient implies
less concentration. The extremes are one when every individual gets and
equal share of total income and zero when one individual holds total in-
come.
                                            — 70   —




of     relative to high income holders. This may be thought of as if popu-
      low

lations have the same Gini coefficient, and thus their Lorenz curves must
        ,   and   the same variance, the   population with the largest positive

skew   will have its Lorenz curve above the            other in the   lower earnings
region.

            The actual distribution of income may be said to be unambiguously
less concentrated than the corrected predicted distribution. The pre-
dicted mean distribution Lorenz curve crosses both the others from above,
in Figure 9, it has the largest skew, and its Gini coefficient halfway
between      the other two.    Even though the actual distribution has only one-
half   the standarddeviation of the two predicted distributions its con-
centration is the least. Between the two predicted distributions which
are   approximately the same variance and close to the same concentration,
within six one—hundreths, the distribution with the largest skew inter-
sects the other from above. These same basic relationships hold within
subgroup      distributions.

        Within schooling groups the largest range in concentration is noted

in the mean distributions with a range from .81 in the lowest schooling

class to •4730 in the highest schooling class, declining monotonically.




   30The Gini coefficient is overstated for both the highest schooling
and highest ability groups in the predicted distributions due to the
open-ended earnings interval > 49,000. The actual distribution Lorenz
curve and Gini coefficient are also approximaate due to the wide unequal
intervals for high income levels.




                                                                                       O

    The   corrected predicted and actual distributions range           from .65   to   .53   and
    from .65 to .58, respectively. Generally the Lorenz               curves   indicate in-
    creased inequality      at the lower earnings levels as schooling increases

    with a convergence or crossing of the curves at higher earnings levels.31

            Within   age   groups   again the largest range in concentration is in           the

    predicted   mean distribution. Mean earnings are very             concentrated, Gini.

    of    .90 to .98, for groups eighteen to        twenty-nine and the correction       for
    unexplained   variation has the         largest impact on this group bringing the
-   Gini coefficient very close to the actual value. Concentration is pre—
    dicted   to decline -with       age   but rises then declines in the   actual dis-

    tribution. This difference may be partly tothe -inclusion of more

    employed students at early ages with low iflComf a. The corrected and

    actual Lorenz curves       and Gini coefficients are      quite   close except for

    generally    less concentration in the         corrected distribution.

            Within ability classes only predicted distributions are available.

    Concentration     in mean earnings is greater among below average individ-
    uals than above average individuals and is least concentrated for those
    within one standard deviation above the mean. For the corrected dis-
    tribution roughly the same pattern holds but with slightly less con-
    centration.




       31Again higher and lower are relative with a distribution and are
    not comparable, with Lorenz curves, between distributions.

     The predicted distributions tend to indicate more skewness than the

actual   distribution but this statistic is very sensitive to the unequal

broad earnings classes in the actual distribution and the results are not

directly   comparable.

                 Deriving Predicted Human Wealth Distributions from the
                               Estimated Earnings Function

        The purpose of this section is       to apply the   principles of the general
framework to     predict the distribution of human wealth       over all, by school-
ing class and     by ability class for several interest rates. Human wealth
is defined here as the present value of earnings          net of educational or
human capital investments over         the individual's lifetime•     The earnings

function   and   corresponding age-earnings profiles estimated from the NBER-

Thorndike sample correspond to an earnings somewhere between the net and
gross   values depending upon what fraction of investment is obtained on—

the-job with direct inputs deducted from earnings. The empirical measure

of   human wealth is then the integral       of the   discounted   estimated earnings

function   with respect to age from the end of formal schooling to the end
of working life • Since the estimated earnings function corresponds to
mean earnings the estimated human wealth corresponds accordingly to the
mean present value of observed earnings. Sinàe the mean error for any
age is zero and the estimation error is assumed to be uncorrelated with
age, schooling or ability          the expected discounted sum of errors over
the life cycle ii     also   zero.32


     32This maynot be the case in reality to the extent that the estima-
tion error is explained by factors other than schooling, age, and
ability which affect the lifetime pattern of earnings. The error term
may not be correlated with age while factors which explain error or
reduce error variance may be correlated with age • These factors would
then affect hun wealth other than in a transient way.
                                             —74—



       Human   wealth   is then a function of the level of schooling, ability,

and the rate of discount (r) and the length of working life (N).

The same schooling and      ability distribution and midpoints are used       as before.

The predicted human      wealth   distributions are calculated for discount rates

of 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 per        cent   and assuming the end of working life is age

sixty-six. Everyone in the population is assumed to have the same discount

rate and   the   same working life, but individuals        differ in schooling and
ability. Following the general              framework density is transformed from

two-dimensional (schooling, ability) — space            into human wealth—space
through the      integral function.

       Selected statistics are presented in Table 9, relative frequency

histograms     and   selected   Lorenz curves are    presented in Figure 13, and

predicted   distributions are presented in Table 10 for the overall popula-

tion, by schooling group, and by ability class for interest rates from 3

to 7 per   cent.
       The most striking result is that there is much less inequality in

human wealth than in earnings. The overall coefficient of variation

drops from above 80 per cent to less than 10 per cent and the overall

Gini coefficient rises from less than 65 per cent to at least 90 per

cent   for the interest rates considered.

      -'The statistics for the highest ability class are calculated as if the highest open ended in—
come interal 246,000+ were of length 2000 as the lower intervals are. This is however clearly not
true.   For r = .03, for example, this last interval for the highest ability class contains 53.8 per-
cent of the operations. This is important only for the statistics relating to r = .03. At all other
discount rates the percent in this final interval is less than 8 percent.
