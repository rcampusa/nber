                                               ABSTRACT

Policymakers are increasingly using norm-based messages to influence individual decision-making.
We partner with a metropolitan water utility to implement a natural field experiment examining the
effect of such messages on residential water demand. The data, drawn from more than 100,000 households,
indicate that social comparison messages had a greater influence on behavior than simple pro-social
messages or technical information alone. Moreover, our data suggest social comparison messages
are most effective among households identified as the least price sensitive: high-users. Yet the effectiveness
of such messages wanes over time. Our results thus highlight important complementarities between
pecuniary and non-pecuniary strategies.

I. Introduction

       Most travelers have been confronted with a strategically placed card in a hotel washroom

urging them to protect the environment by reusing their towels. Such efforts are consistent with

a growing trend of employing non-pecuniary strategies (e.g., norm-based messages and social

comparisons) to influence individual decision-making. As noted by Schultz et al. (2007), such

strategies have been applied to a range of behaviors including alcohol and drug use, eating

disorders, gambling, recycling, and energy consumption. Although the use of such strategies

continues to grow in popularity, their relative efficacy remains under-researched amongst

economists.

       In an attempt to fill this gap, we examine the effectiveness of non-pecuniary strategies as

a means to manage residential water demand. To maintain consistency with existing policy

initiatives, we focus our analysis on t hree commonly employed conservation strategies: (i) the

dissemination of information on behavioral and technological modifications, (ii) appeals to pro-

social preferences, and (iii) the provision of social comparisons to enhance appeals to pro-social

preferences. To the best of our knowledge, we provide the first apples-to-apples comparison of

programs based on appeals to pro-social preferences with those augmented with social

comparisons.

       We focus our analysis on residential water demand for two reasons. First and foremost,

policymakers frequently rely upon non-pecuniary measures rather than market-based approaches

to promote conservation efforts and manage water resources. For example, such strategies are

the essence of the EPA’s Water Sense program – a public education campaign launched in 2006

to spread word about the importance of water efficiency and conservation.




                                                                                                1
       Second, during the 20th Century, global water use increased six-fold – a pattern that has

prompted many to identify the availability of fresh water as one of the most critical issues

confronting policymakers in the twenty-first century.     The United Nation’s Environmental

Program estimates that by 2025 over two-thirds of the world’s population will reside in regions

considered water stressed.    Similar concerns abound in the United States where a recent

government survey suggests that at least 36 states are anticipating some form of water shortage

by 2013. Thus water scarcity concerns are likely to magnify over time.

       We begin by developing a conceptual framework based on t he work of Levitt and List

(2007) to identify channels through which norm-based strategies may influence household water

consumption. The framework affords a rank ordering over the expected influence of commonly

enacted conservation strategies on consumption decisions.      Empirically, we investigate the

relative effectiveness of such strategies by partnering with a metropolitan water utility to

implement a large-scale, natural field experiment. Our field experiment includes data on more

than 100,000 residential households randomized into four treatments: a control group, a group

that received technical advice, a group that received both technical advice and an appeal to pro-

social preferences, and a group that received technical advice and an appeal to pro-social

preferences augmented with a social comparison.

       Our study builds upon two distinct literatures. The first is a growing body of work that

examines the use of pro-social messages and/or social comparisons in the context of charitable

giving (see, e.g., Bryan and Test, 1967; Reingen, 1978; Frey and Meier, 2004; Croson and

Shang, 2007; Martin and Randal, 2008; Shang and Croson, 2008).           Despite the seemingly

amorphous nature of public goods and common pool resource games, it is not clear that results

from the former would necessarily generalize to the latter. As noted in Sandler and Arce (2003),



                                                                                               2
“….Individuals appear to place a premium on inaction which requires sacrificing a right, so that

the commons problem may pose a greater policy dilemma….” Moreover, many of these studies

(e.g., Frey and Meier, 2004; Croson and Shang, 2007; Shang and Croson 2008) focus on t he

decisions of individuals along the intensive margin – i.e., previous donors or those actively

planning to donate at the time of intervention. 1 Hence, this literature provides little insight

regarding the effectiveness of such strategies on behavior along the extensive margin.

         The second is a growing body of work in social psychology that examines the use of

social-norm marketing, feedback, and tailored information campaigns to promote environmental

conservation (see, e.g., Hutton and McNeill, 1981; Luyben, 1982; Siero et al., 1996; Kurz et al.,

2005; Schultz et al., 2007; Goldstein et al., 2008; Nolan et al., 2008). H owever, almost all of

these studies rely upon s mall samples that were often informed about the study prior to any

intervention (e.g., Luyben, 1982; Kurz et al., 2005; Schultz et al., 2007; Nolan et al., 2008). 2

Further, many of these studies rely upon s elf-reported measures of behavioral change (e.g.,

Hutton and McNeill, 1982; Luyben, 1982; Nolan et al., 2008) which may introduce a powerful

confound when attempting to generalize results to other settings (social desirability bias).

         Several insights emerge from our field study. First, non-pecuniary motivations influence

water consumption in ways consonant with our conceptual framework. For example, technical

advice has a small impact on water use – households in this treatment consume approximately 1

percent less than counterparts in the control. Augmenting technical advice with an appeal to pro-

social preferences and a s ocial comparison generates a substantially larger reduction –

approximately 4.8 percent.              From a policy perspective, these differences suggest that

1
  Frey and Meier (2004) examine the effect of social comparisons amongst all students, but only find a significant
effect when the sample is restricted to students who contributed to the charity in the past.
2
  For example, Kurz et al. (2005) use a final sample of 166 households allocated into one of eight treatment
conditions. Participants were recruited by way of an initial information letter detailing the nature of the study with
response rate for the different treatments ranging from 29.1 to 48.9 percent.

                                                                                                                         3
there are high returns to explaining why customers should reduce water consumption rather than

outlining how best to reduce water use.

        Interestingly, this estimated social comparison effect is equivalent to that which would be

expected if average prices were to increase approximately 12 to 15 percent. 3 Under the current

pricing system, such a price increase would translate into an approximate $5 per month increase

in water bills for the median user in our sample. Moreover, the estimated treatment effect is

more than twice that observed across recent programs using social comparisons to affect energy

conservation (see Allcott 2009; Ayres et al. 2009).

        Second, we find a fundamental difference in the efficacy of norm-based messages across

low and high-use households. For example, there is an approximate 94.1 percent difference in

the relative treatment effect across user groups in our strong social norm treatment. From a

policy perspective, heterogeneity in the effectiveness of norm-based appeals is notable as high-

use households tend to be less price sensitive than others (Mansur and Olmstead, 2007). Thus

non-pecuniary strategies provide a useful complement to pecuniary measures because they are

most effective amongst the group that is least sensitive to price changes.

        Finally, the effectiveness of non-pecuniary strategies wanes over time. In the month

following intervention, households in our strong social norm treatment use approximately 5.62

percent less water than counterparts in our control group. F our months later, the estimated

difference across these groups declines by 35.4 percent. This observed waning is consonant with

previous work suggesting the impermanence of non-pecuniary incentives (see, e.g., Gneezy and

List, 2006; Curtis and Price, 2009; Landry et al., 2009). I nterestingly, our data suggest that

waning is driven almost entirely by the high user group.


3
 This comparison is based upon recent estimates of price elasticity of demand for U.S. metropolitan residential
customers, which fall in the range of -0.33 to -0.36 (Mansur and Olmstead, 2007; Olmstead et al., 2007).

                                                                                                                  4
II. Conceptual Framework

       We develop a conceptual framework in the spirit of Levitt and List (2007) to identify

possible channels through which policy measures such as information transfers and pro-social

messages may influence household water consumption. O ur framework posits an agent with

utility that is additively separable over two terms – consumption utility, c, and a moral payoff,

M. B oth of these terms depend on a s ingle action, a, the choice of water consumption and a

vector of individual specific characteristics, θ. A s in Levitt and List (2007), M captures

nonpecuniary impacts associated with the choice of action and depends upon the extent to which

the decision-maker’s actions are scrutinized, s, and the perceived saliency (strength) of the set of

social norms, n, that dictate acceptable levels of water consumption.

       The utility function for agent i is specified as:

                                Ui(a,n,s;θ) = ci(a; θ) – Mi(a,n,s;θ)

where consumption utility, c(·), is strictly increasing and concave in a. G iven the common

nature of water supplies, consumption imposes negative externalities on ot hers through the

depletion of resource stocks. Hence, M(·) is assumed increasing and convex in a. As in Levitt

and List (2007), we assume that moral costs are strictly increasing in the extent to which actions

are scrutinized (observed) by others and the extent to which actions deviate from the perceived

social norm.

       Our conceptual framework highlights how policymakers could influence water use by

employing non-pecuniary strategies that target and affect the realization of s and n. For example,

consider a program, such as EPA’s Water Sense, that frames conservation as a social norm.

Under our framework, this frame should map into an increased realization of n and an associated

increase in the disutility (moral cost) of any prior consumption level. As consumption utility is



                                                                                                  5
assumed increasing and strictly concave in a, we would therefore expect a reduction in overall

water use to offset this increased “marginal cost”.

         We implement a series of experimental treatments designed to systematically augment

the realization of these factors, allowing us to rank the expected ordering of each treatment. Our

treatments are based upon existing conservation programs and focus on t hree commonly

employed strategies: (i) the dissemination of information on behavioral and technological

modifications, (ii) requests to voluntarily restrict use and preserve scarce resources, and (iii) the

provision of social comparisons to induce conformity and make salient the norm of

conservation. 4 Moreover, to maintain consistency with existing policy initiatives, we consider

interventions that combine technical and behavioral information and norm-based appeals.

         Our first treatment, a technical advice letter, works though a single channel – increased

scrutiny – and therefore is predicted to have the smallest effect on overall patterns of

consumption. Our second treatment augments the technical advice letter by including an appeal

to pro-social preferences highlighting the importance of conserving water. To the extent that

such appeals highlight a social norm – conservation and concern for the environment – we would

thus expect to see additional reductions in average use. O ur final treatment makes the social

norm more salient by including a social comparison that contrasts the household’s use in the

previous year with median use in the county. We would thus expect this treatment to generate

the largest reductions in overall water consumption – particularly amongst high-use households.

         Conceptually, the inclusion of the weak social norm treatment affords a be tter

understanding of the channels through which appeals to pro-social preferences and social

comparisons influence behavior. Importantly, this treatment allows us to differentiate our model

4
 Our final two treatments are similar in spirit to Goldstein et al. (2008) who compare the relative effectiveness of
appeals for hotel guests to reuse towels as a means to “help save the environment” with appeals that augmented this
message to include a descriptive norm informing guests about participation in the program by prior visitors.

                                                                                                                   6
from alternatives that focus on imperfect information in the spirit of Becker’s (1965) household

production framework.         The weak social norm treatment reveals no i nformation about the

behavior of others that a household could use to update beliefs and re-evaluate consumption

decisions. C onsequently, models based solely on imperfect information would predict similar

patterns of consumption across our technical advice and weak social norm treatments.                           In

contrast, our framework predicts very different patterns of use across these treatments.

III. Experimental Environment and Design

        Cobb County is part of the metropolitan statistical area of Atlanta, Georgia. In 2006, it

contained an estimated 679,325 people – 71% of whom self-identified as White/Caucasian and

23% as Black. 5 The county is not known for environmentalism. The current Congressmen have

some of the lowest League of Conversation Voter scores (LCV, 2008) recorded in 2007 a nd

2008. During this same time period, Georgia’s Senate delegation tied for last place in the

League’s scorecard. H ence, we have not selected a subject pool particularly known for pro-

environmental preferences. As noted in Costa and Kahn (2010), the conservative nature of our

subject pool may serve to mitigate observed treatment effects from social comparisons.

        The Cobb County Water System (CCWS), an agency of the Cobb County Government,

distributes treated surface water for about 170,000 Cobb County customers. O f these, about

150,000 are residential customers that reside in single-family dwellings. 6 CCWS obtains its

water from disputed surface supplies that have been affected by periodic drought conditions that

began in 1998. Starting in 2006, the CCWS created a number of initiatives to encourage water

conservation among its customers. On January 1, 2006, i t introduced a new tiered-rate pricing

6
  In 2000, Cobb County was Georgia’s second largest user of the public water supply accounting for almost 8% of
statewide consumption (Fanning, 2003). Within the county, residential water use is highly variable with about 5%
of the customers using about 18% of the water (unpublished data, CCWS).

                                                                                                                7
scheme to replace the previously fixed-price-per-gallon pricing scheme. Concurrently, CCWS

also initiated a number of supplemental programs designed to inform consumers how and why to

conserve water. These initiatives, however, were not targeted towards individual households and

remained available to all households throughout the post-intervention period of analysis. As

such, our experiment likely provides a conservative test of the ability of policy-makers to harness

pro-social preferences to achieve policy goals.

Experimental Design

        To reduce water use among its residential customers in the summer of 2007, the CCWS

agreed to initiate a targeted, mail-based residential customer conservation education program

through a randomized experimental design. 7 The aim of the program was to provide CCWS

empirical evidence on the relative effectiveness of providing residential customers (i) a message

about ways in which they could reduce their water use most effectively, i.e., the “how” of

reducing water use, and (ii) a message that appealed to pro-social preferences, i.e., the “why” of

reducing water use. Each treatment was designed in collaboration with CCWS employees and

pre-tested using small focus groups of residential customers from neighboring counties.

Treatment 1 – Technical Advice

        Our first treatment provided households an “information-only” message that included a

two-sided “tip sheet” listing ways to most effectively reduce water use and whom to contact for

more information (see Appendix 1). All letters were personalized and sent to households in

official CCWS envelopes as first class mail, and thus we expect that households perceived

increased scrutiny over consumption decisions. Because moral costs are increasing in scrutiny,

we would expect an increase in the disutility (moral cost) associated with any prior level of


7
 In the taxonomy of Harrison and List (2004) our approach would be considered an example of a natural field
experiment.

                                                                                                              8
consumption. As consumption utility is strictly concave in a, the household must lower overall

consumption to offset this increased marginal cost. We would thus expect to observe a reduction

in average water use relative to households in our control group.

       Undoubtedly, there are other channels through which this treatment could operate if

households were unaware of the strategies highlighted on t he tip sheet.        However, as the

information contained in the “tip sheet” was widely available prior to our intervention, it is

unlikely that such effects would be very pronounced. Yet, we cannot rule out this possibility. It

would thus be remiss if we did not note that increased scrutiny is not the only reason one might

observe reduced water use in this treatment.

Treatment 2 – Weak Social Norm

       Our second experimental treatment augments Treatment 1 by including a personally

addressed letter on official CCWS stationary that was signed by the Water Conservation

Coordinator.   The letter includes standard, norm-based language from water conservation

materials used both nationally, and in Georgia, as well as information found on the customer’s

month bill (and tip sheet) including whom to contact for more information about water

conservation. The letter in part reads:

       As you know, Cobb County’s water resources are stretched because of population growth
       and many years of low rainfall. Cobb County residents consume almost one of out every
       ten gallons of Georgia’s public water supply. As a result, our water use has a large
       impact on the ability of Georgia’s waterways to protect wildlife and dilute pollutants that
       threaten human health. We all need to work together to use water wisely….

       We need your help. Act on the tips listed in the enclosed tip sheet. We all have to do our
       part to protect Cobb County’s precious water resources. Reducing our water
       consumption today is important for preserving our environment and our economy for
       future generations. Please don’t waste water. Remember: every drop counts!




                                                                                                9
In addition to the effects on scrutiny, the inclusion of pro-social appeals may enhance the

disutility associated with any level of consumption through an increased realization of n – the set

of social norms affecting water use. We would thus expect larger reductions in average water

use than those observed in Treatment 1.

Treatment 3 – Strong Social Norm

          Social psychologists often stress that attention can be drawn to social norms most

saliently through social comparisons. Our final treatment takes the pro-social appeals from our

weak social norm treatment and adds a comparison of the household’s water use from June to

October 2006 to the median County household use for the same period, and the percentile in

which the household fell during this period. 8 This comparison reads:

          As we enter the summer months, we thought that you might be interested in the following
          information about your water consumption last year:

          Your own total consumption June to October 2006:                         52,000 gallons

          Your neighbors’ average (median) consumption June to October 2006:                          35,000 gallons

          You consumed more water than 73% of your Cobb County neighbors.


Based on focus groups and prior work from social psychology (see, e.g., Cialdini et al., 2006;

Schultz et al., 2007), the percentile text was framed was in a negative way to emphasize how

many people do not engage in the targeted behavior. See Appendix 1 for an example of the full

letter.

          This final treatment message is expected to influence behavior through two distinct

channels. First, the inclusion of a social comparison may further strengthen the perceived social


8
  Technically, the data presented to the household are for billed use dated June to October 2006 (May through
September use). Focus groups indicated that recipients may wish to verify the information in the letter and would
look to their recent bill as the relevant source. Monthly bills show very prominently, near the top of the first page, a
histogram documenting the billed month’s use and each of the previous twelve billed months’ use.

                                                                                                                     10
norm – i.e., the realization of n in our model. Second, the provision of such detailed information

may also enhance the extent to which the household perceives its actions are scrutinized. Ceteris

paribus, we would therefore expect a greater reduction in average water use than that observed in

Treatment 2.

        Before proceeding to the results section, a few key features of our experimental design

should be highlighted. First, the CCWS required a m inimum detectable treatment effect of a 2

percent decline in average water use and statistical power of at least 0.90 – a request that

required a sample size of 11,600 for each treatment message group and a control group of at least

69,600 households. 9 Second, the three treatment mailings were sent out on the same day during

the week of 21 May 2007. All mailings were sent via first-class mail in official CCWS envelopes

to maximize the likelihood that they would be opened by customers and to clearly associate the

messages with CCWS. A follow-up tip sheet was sent four weeks later in the same manner to all

treated customers. For Treatments 2 and 3, copies of the original personalized letters did not

accompany this mailing because the CCWS indicated that they would not have sent follow-up

letters in a non-experimental version of their education program. 10

        Third, meters are read and bills are sent out daily based on a household’s assignment to

one of 390 “meter routes.” To ensure that we have no systematic differences across treatments in

the day of the month an outcome is measured, we randomize treatment assignment within meter

routes which correspond to neighborhood sections. Such stratification has the additional benefit




9
  These sample sizes were derived using the desired minimum treatment effect, water use data from summer 2006,
an assumed 0.70 intra-household annual correlation of water use (based on CCWS data), and a Type I error rate of
0.05.
10
   Our single treatment “dose” contrasts with previous work (Allcott, 2009; Ayres et al., 2009) in which
conservation materials are sent monthly/quarterly without cessation.

                                                                                                               11
of increasing the precision of the estimates provided that unobservables affecting treatment

response are more similar within rather than between meter routes. 11

         Fourth, the strong social norm message requires the communication of baseline water use

for summer 2006. Although the water system billed 156,326 residential customers in April

2007, this requirement limits the set of households eligible for treatment assignment to 139,693

households whose customer billing names had not changed between May 2006 and March 2007.

Fifth, under a nonrandomized conservation message program, CCWS would not send messages

to individuals who consume fewer than 4,000 gallons/month or who use zero gallons for most of

the summer water season. Households that met these criteria for May through September 2006

were excluded from our final sample. Using these procedures, 11,699 households (HHs) were

assigned to Treatment 1, 11,695 HHs were assigned to Treatment 2, 11,699 HHs were assigned

to Treatment 3, and 71,779 HHs were assigned to the control condition. 12 Finally, monthly pre-

and post-experiment water use data come from the CCWS billing department.

IV. Experimental Results

         We begin by examining the effect of our experimental treatments on household water use

for June through September 2007. The first column of Table 1 summarizes water use for this

period and the second column the percentage change in average use relative to that observed

during this same time period in 2006. The data in Table 1 exclude 187 households whose water

was turned off during the months June through September 2007, thirteen households for whom

we cannot determine with certainty actual water use due to billing mistakes, and three

households with large catastrophic leaks of at least one million gallons.



11
   For over 90% of the routes in our sample, the coefficient of variation in 2006 summer water use is lower within
routes than across routes.

   Using STATA 10 “sample” command and “by” option.

                                                                                                                     12
        As noted in the second column of Table 1, average water use in summer 2007 declined

relative to that observed for summer 2006 a cross all household types. However, the observed

decline across our three treatment groups is approximately 7.41 to 53.38 percent greater than that

observed amongst our control group. Moreover, the observed rank ordering of treatment effects

corresponds to that predicted by our conceptual framework. We observe the smallest decline in

Treatment 1 and the largest decline in Treatment 3. Importantly, the estimated differences in

treatment effects are statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level using parametric and non-

parametric tests. 13

        Taken jointly, these differences suggest a first result:

        Result 1: Non-pecuniary motivations influence average water use. As we increase the

        scrutiny of actions and the perceived saliency of social norms, we observe greater

        reductions in average consumption.

Result 1 is consistent with the hypothesis that moral payoffs influence consumption decisions for

the average household in our sample. Consonant with the rank ordering predicted by our

conceptual framework, we observe the smallest effect in our technical advice treatment, which

works through a single channel – scrutiny. We observe the largest effect in our strong social

norm treatment, which operates through multiple channels. Result 1 also accords well with

Goldstein et al. (2008), who observe that significant increases in the reuse rate of hotel towels

could be achieved by augmenting normative appeals to reuse with social comparisons that report

the percentage of prior guests who engaged in such behavior.




13
   A one way ANOVA with Sidak adjustment for multiple hypotheses indicates that each treatment effect is
significantly different from zero and that the effect of Treatment 3 is larger than that observed in the other
treatments. Similarly, a non-parametric Jonckheree-Terpstra test for trend in summer 2007 water use indicates a
significant trend as one moves from Treatment 1 to Treatment 2 to Treatment 3.

                                                                                                                  13
         Importantly, we observe a significant reduction in consumption when augmenting the

technical advice letter to include an appeal to pro-social preferences. Treatment 2’s impact calls

into question alternate explanations for the observed data patterns that focus on i mperfect

information in the context of Becker’s (1965) household production model. 14 Our weak social

norm treatment reveals no i nformation about the behaviors of others that could lead the

household to update beliefs and re-evaluate its own consumption decisions.

         To increase the precision of the estimated treatment effects, we regress summer 2007

water use for the ith household (Yi2007) on t hree dummy variables representing the three

treatments (T1=Technical Advice; T2=Weak Social Norms; T3=Strong Social Norms):



                  Yi2007 = α + β1* T1 + β2* T2 + β3* T3 + β4*Yi2006 + β5* YiSpring + ε                           (1)



We include as covariates household water use for the watering season in 2006 (Yi2006) and spring

2007 (YiSpring). 15 This latter variable aims to capture any home or landscaping changes since

2006 but before the experiment began. T o control for heteroskedasticity, we estimate robust

standard errors.

         These empirical estimates (in 1000s of gallons) are contained in Model A of Table 2 and

provide evidence consistent with our unconditional analysis: households in all three treatment

groups consume less water than those in our control group. Figure 1 depicts the estimated

effects from Table 1 as percentage changes relative to the baseline group. For example, the



14
   For example, one could envision a situation where a household has incorrect beliefs regarding the marginal cost of
increasing efficiency. Observing that the median household in Cobb County uses significantly less water could
signal to such a household that the actual marginal cost of improving efficiency is lower than their original belief
and lead them to reconsider consumption patterns.
15
   Water use in 2006 is aggregate household consumption for the months of May through October. Spring water use
captures aggregate consumption for March and April.

                                                                                                                  14
average household in Treatment 3 ( strong social norm) is predicted to consume approximately

4.8 percent (or 1,740 ga llons) less water than the average control group household. To better

understand the magnitude of this difference, consider that a five minute shower uses anywhere

from 10 to 25 gallons of water and the average top load washing machine between 40-45 gallons

of water per load.

         The final two columns of Table 2 augment this basic specification. Model B augments

the model to include route specific dummy variables to capture unobserved neighborhood

specific characteristics that influence water consumption. 16 Model C trims the data to exclude

observations from the extreme tails of the underlying distribution of use. Empirical results from

these models are qualitatively similar to those presented in Model A – we observe the smallest

(largest) reductions in consumption in our technical advice (strong social norm) treatment.

         Although the estimated technical advice effect in Model C is statistically different from

zero, the observed reduction in average consumption level is less than the desired minimal

detectable treatment effect of two percent. From a policy perspective, this calls into question the

economic significance of information-only conservation efforts.

Heterogeneity in Treatment Effects – Low versus High Users

         Result 1 refers to mean treatment effects. Our experimental design, however, allows us

to explore treatment effects at a deeper level by examining heterogeneous impacts across user

types. A key feature of our strong social norm treatment is the inclusion of a social comparison

designed to increase the saliency of social norms. As highlighted in our conceptual framework,

such comparisons should have a greater effect on households whose consumption exceeded that

of the median Cobb County resident. To the extent that it is easier for high-use households to


16
  The route dummy variables are designed to capture factors such as local variations in rainfall totals or
neighborhood specific requirements/social pressures to maintain a healthy, green lawn.

                                                                                                             15
identify easy, low-cost means to curtail consumption and adhere to a conservation norm, our

framework would predict a similar but less pronounced difference across the highest and lowest

user groups in our weak social norm treatment.

          To examine this conjecture, we split our data into two household types – (i) low users

whose consumption in summer 2006 w as less than the median Cobb County resident and (ii)

high users whose consumption in summer 2006 w as greater than the median Cobb County

resident – and re-estimate equation (1). 17 Columns A and B of Table 3 present the empirical

estimates, which suggest that appeals to social norms are most effective amongst high-use

households. Figure 2 shows that this conclusion holds for relative as well as absolute impacts.

For example, the estimated strong social norm effect for our high user group is approximately

94.1 percent greater (5.28 versus 2.72 percent relative reduction) than that for our low user group

– a difference that is significant at the p < 0.05 level.

          We observe a s imilar, albeit less pronounced difference, in the estimated weak social

norm effect across these household types. However, the approximate 31.5 percent difference in

the estimated treatment effect across high and low user types (2.88 versus 2.19 percent relative

reduction) is not significant at any meaningful level. Combined, these data suggest a second

result:

          Result 2: A ppeals to social norms are most effective amongst high-use households.

          These differences are most pronounced when the appeal includes a social comparison.

Result 2 highlights an important asymmetry in the effectiveness of conservation programs based

upon pro-social appeals – such strategies are most salient amongst high-use households. From a

policy perspective, heterogeneity in the effectiveness of norm-based appeals is notable. Mansur

17
  The experiment excluded households whose summer 2006 consumption was fewer than 4,000 gallons per month
(see final paragraph of Section IV), effectively removing users who fell in the lower quartile of the distribution over
summer 2006 use. As such, we observe approximately twice as many high-use households in our data.

                                                                                                                    16
and Olmstead (2007) highlight that because high-use households tend to be wealthier, such users

are less price sensitive than others. Result 2 suggests that norm-based, non-pecuniary strategies

may prove a useful complement to pecuniary measures because they are most effective amongst

the group that is least sensitive to price changes.

The Waning of Treatment Effects

         Our analysis thus far has focused on changes in relative consumption levels aggregated

over all summer months. A lthough we find evidence of treatment effects in these aggregated

data, there is a growing empirical literature suggesting the impermanence of non-pecuniary

incentives such as unconditional gifts for workers (Gneezy and List, 2006; Curtis and Price,

2009) and the physical attractiveness of female solicitors in door-to-door fund-raising (Landry et

al., 2009).

        As noted in Gneezy and List (2006) such impermanence is consistent with non-pecuniary

incentives having greatest import during initial, or “hot”, phases of decision-making. Social

comparisons and appeals to social norms trigger strong moral sentiments during the hot phase of

decision-making – i.e., the few weeks following intervention. O ver time, however, these

feelings may dissipate as the household’s focus of attention shifts elsewhere. Hence, a similar

pattern of decay is plausible in our setting.

        By design, treatment mailings were sent to all households in our sample on the same day

during the week of 21 May 2007.           Our design thus allows an evaluation of whether our

conservation strategies are subject to the same type of decay noted for other non-pecuniary

incentives that influence decision-making through psychological processes. In this spirit, we

regress separately June 2007 (September 2007) water consumption for the ith household on June




                                                                                               17
2006 (September 2006) consumption for that household and a vector of indicators for our

different experimental treatments.

        Results for these regressions are contained in the first two columns of Table 4 a nd

provide empirical evidence of waning. For example, as noted in Column A, the estimated effect

of our strong social norm letter on J une 2007 consumption was an approximate 5.62 pe rcent

reduction relative to the control group. By September, the estimated difference across these two

groups falls to 3.63 pe rcent. T his approximate 35.4 percent reduction in the estimated strong

social norm effect across the summer months is statistically significant at the p < 0.05 level. 18

We observe similar patterns of decay in both the weak social norm and technical advice

treatments.

        Combined these data provide evidence consonant with previous work highlighting the

impermanence of non-pecuniary incentives and suggest a third result:

        Result 3:      Treatment effects are most pronounced in the month following intervention

        and decay over the course of the summer.

For behavioral economists, Result 3 adds to a mounting body of evidence from field studies

suggesting that the effectiveness of incentives designed to trigger psychological processes may

differ markedly across “hot” and “cold” phases of decision-making. In this regard, our data

accord well with Gneezy and List (2006) who show that the effects of gifts on worker effort and

short-lived and decay over the course of the work day. For practitioners, Result 3 suggests an

important caveat on t he use of norm-based management strategies – they are best reserved for



18
  A similar pattern of decay is noted in Allcott (2009) amongst households randomly assigned to groups receiving
Home Energy Reports on a quarterly basis. Interestingly, Allcott (2009) reports evidence from survey data
suggesting that the observed pattern of decay reflects behavior consonant with “hot” and “cold” phases of decision
making. Receiving a letter reminds/motivates households to conserve energy by turning off lights, unplugging
electronics, and adjusting thermostats. Over time the household tires of the change, but upon receiving the next
quarter’s Report is again motivated to conserve.

                                                                                                                 18
situations where immediate, but short-lived, conservation efforts are desired. In this regard, such

strategies provide a complementary measure to pecuniary-based management strategies, which

are often slow to implement and difficult to adjust.

        Exploring this result a l evel deeper by examining the persistence of treatment effects

across the highest and lowest user groups in our sample (as in Columns C – F of Table 4)

suggests an important asymmetry. The observed pattern of decay is driven almost entirely by the

highest user groups – an asymmetry best illustrated in Figure 3. A mongst the low user group

there is no di scernable difference in the strong social norm effect across months. H owever,

amongst the highest user group we observe an approximate 31.7 percent reduction in the relative

treatment effect (6.08 versus 4.15 pe rcent) between June and September – a difference that is

significant at the p < 0.05 level. We observe similar, albeit less pronounced, patterns in both our

weak social norm and technical advice treatments.

Implications for Scaling Up

        We can use the results in Table 2 (Model A) to estimate aggregate impacts and cost-

effectiveness in a scaled-up version of the CCWS program. Had the strong social norm message

(Treatment 3) been assigned to all 106,872 targeted households, summer water use in Cobb

County would have been expected to decline by approximately 186 million gallons. F or

perspective, such reduction is the equivalent of shutting off the water to about 5100 households.

Based on t he treatment costs in the experiment, CCWS would have spent $0.575 per thousand

gallons reduced. 19 In contrast, if CCWS were only to target those households at or above the

median historical use, it could obtain 88% of the reduction for 75% of the total cost.



19
  If the June tip-sheet mailing were excluded, costs would be approximately 45% lower. CCWS would also lose
about $1.2 - $1.3 million in forgone revenues, but the education program is designed to reduce demand and thus
presumably CCWS is aware of the potential for lost revenues. How much of these foregone revenues represent

                                                                                                                 19
        Given there was no statistical difference in the estimated response to the weak and strong

social norm treatments for below-median water users, we also consider a hybrid policy that

assigns households with above median historical use to the strong social norm treatment and all

others to the weak social norm treatment. Importantly, such policy would enable CCWS to

target a larger set of households that includes those for whom historical use data are missing.

Under this hybrid policy, we estimate that CCWS would have affected an approximate 193

million gallon reduction in summer water use. Such reduction is equivalent to shutting off water

to about 5300 hous eholds. Although the estimated cost per thousand gallons reduced for such

program would be approximately 10 pe rcent higher than one focused solely on s ocial

comparisons, it would eliminate an important concern of CCWS officials – complaints from

below median users that could bring unwanted attention and controversy. 20

V. Conclusions

        Economists have only recently started to explore the effect of non-pecuniary strategies,

such as appeals to pro-social behavior or the use of social comparisons, as a means to influence

individual decision-making and promote pro-social behaviors. Much of this work has focused on

the use of such strategies in the context of charitable giving. Yet such approaches have been

implemented across a br oader range of economically relevant settings. This study seeks to

further our understanding of such strategies by exploring whether they influence household-level

consumption decisions. We do so by investigating the effectiveness of policy measures based on

information transfers and pro-social messages in a large-scale, natural field experiment carried

out in conjunction with a water utility system in metropolitan Atlanta.



savings to consumers depends on the costs of the behavioral and technological changes made in response to
treatment, which are unobservable to us.
20
   CCWS received some angry phone calls from such users who wanted to know why CCWS was not focusing
attention and budget on above-median users.

                                                                                                            20
       Empirical results emphasize the importance of moral payoffs on consumption decisions.

As we augment the range of channels targeted by a particular conservation strategy – i.e.,

scrutiny or the perceived saliency of social norms – we observe greater reductions in average

consumption levels. Thus policy makers are better served targeting the “why” of conservation

efforts rather than the “how”. Moreover, our results suggest that strategies based upon appeals to

pro-social preferences and social comparisons are most effective when targeting high

consumption groups. Yet the effectiveness of such policies is short-lived and wanes over time.

For practitioners, this suggests an important caveat on t he use of conservation strategies based

upon social comparisons or appeals to social norms – they are best reserved for situations where

immediate, but short-lived, conservation efforts are desired.

       Undoubtedly our research has raised more questions than it has answered. For example,

our analysis does not elucidate the specific channels through which our treatments affect water

consumption. Future work should augment our approach and focus on v ariations in the social

comparison message to uncover the underlying behavioral mechanisms driving our results.

Understanding which theoretical models best predict behavior will help policy makers identify

the most effective strategies to promote conservation efforts.

       In addition, the estimated average treatment effect for our strong social norm message is

more than twice that observed in similar programs targeting energy conservation (see, e.g.,

Allcott 2009; Ayres et al. 2009). Moreover, unlike these energy studies, we observe no evidence

of a rebound effect amongst low-use households. While we would have preferred to explore

these differences in greater detail, there are two important design differences that confound a

direct comparison of the results. First, the reference group to which household consumption

levels are compared in our study is the median user for all of Cobb County. In contrast, the



                                                                                               21
reference group for the OPower studies is significantly smaller – nearby households of similar

size. S econd, the home energy reports for the OPower studies include emoticons for both the

lowest and highest user groups. The extent to which these design differences affect the ways in

which households respond to social comparisons remains an open issue.

       Finally, our study focuses on t he use of normative messages to promote changes in the

way households use water. To the extent that such changes reflect behavioral adjustments that

require vigilance to maintain over time, it is not surprising that the impacts of such programs

wane over time as a ho usehold’s attention shifts elsewhere. Y et, one can envision a similar

program whereby normative appeals are used to encourage the adoption of new technologies

such as low flow shower heads or high efficiency toilets. Such technologies affect consumption

through efficiency gains rather than adjustments in patterns of use and thus we would anticipate

such a program to have a more persistent effect on demand. However, given the large up-front

costs of purchasing such technologies, it is likely that any such program would affect fewer

households than a program targeting behavioral adjustments. Which strategy would have a

greater impact on aggregate use remains an open question. Studies that compare the relative

impact of targeting technology adoption rather than end use would be a fruitful avenue for future

work. We suspect that research into these areas will likely lead to insights hitherto uncovered

and an improved understanding about the effectiveness of non-pecuniary strategies as a pol icy

instrument.

Note: Cell entries are parameter estimates (standard errors in parentheses) for a series of linear regression models of
aggregate water use (in thousands of gallons) for summer 2007 on the included covariates. The models differ in
whether route specific fixed effects are included and the rules used to trim the overall sample. The third column
excludes observations from the top and bottom 0.25 percentile of the distribution for summer 2007 water use. Cell
entries can be read as follows – as indicated in column 1, households that were randomly assigned into the strong
social norm treatment consumed approximately 1,740 fewer gallons on average than those in the control group.
