                       Real Exchange Rate Variability:
            An Empirical Analysis of the Developing Countries Case




                                      ABSTRACT




     The purpose of this paper is to investigate the potential role of

monetary and real factors in explaining real exchange rate variability in

developing countries. For this purpose two indexes of real effective exchange

rate variability that measure short—term and long—term variability were

constructed for 30 countries. The results obtained, using a generalized least

squares procedures on cross section data, indicate that real exchange rate

variability has been affected both by real and monetary factors. In

particular it was   found   that more unstable nominal exchange rate policies were

reflected in higher real exchange rate instability in the short—run; more

unstable domestic credit policies resulted in higher short—term real exchange

rate variability; and more unstable external terms of trade also affected

positively the degree of real exchange rate instability.

1. Introduction

    During the last few years real exchange rate variability has increased

substantially both in developed and developing countries. From a policy point

of view, it is important to understand what the main causes of this increased

real exchange rate instability are. To the extent that the causes of real

exchange rate instability are policy related ——   for   exauple, related to the

nominal exchange rate system or to the degree of instability of domestic

monetary policy —— economic authorities could, in principle, be able to imple-

ment policies aimed at reducing this variability. On the other hand, if real

exchange rare variability depends on exogenous or structural factors ——     like
changes in the external teens of trade — the domestic authorities will have

less maneuvering room to reduce it.1

     Some earlier papers have analyzed orne empirical aspects of the real

exchange rate variability problem. For example, Korteweg (1980) discussed the

possible sources of real exchange rate instability for a group of OECD count-

ries, and pointed out that there is a presumption that real exchange rate

variability had responded to shocks generated both from the monetary and real

sides. Relleiner (1981), in an extensive study on exchange rate systems in

developing countries, decomposed the sources of real exchange rate variability

between external sources, or sources related to exchange rate movements

between major currencies, and "other" sources. Re found out that even though

external sources had been important, in a large number of countries the

"other" factors had dominated. Although he doesn't explicitly test other

factors he mentions the potential roles of tens of trade changes and domestic

monetary policy.

     More recently some papers have analyzed the causes of real exchange rate

variability within the context of deviations from purchasing power parity
(PPP). Stocionan (1983), for example, developed a model to investigate the

role of nominal and real disturbances on real exchange rate instability.

&ccording to his model, the exchange rate system should be neutral with

respect to the degree of exchange rate variability. However, StocIan's

results for a group of 38 developed and developing countries reject this

proposition, and show that the variability of the real exchange rate has been

higher under a floating rate system. Yuravlivker (1982) also found out that,

for a group of four developing countries, real exchange rate variability was

affected positively by the instability of the nominal exchange rate policy.

     DeCrauwe, Janssens and Lelianert (1984) and DeGrauwe and Rosiers (1984)

investigated the proposition that real exchange variability is caused by

monetary disturbances. DeGrauwe, Jansserts and Lelianert (1984), for example,

used cross—section data to analyze the effects of inflation and monetary

disturbances on real exchange rate instability increases with the variability

of inflation and money growth rates. DeGrauwe and Rosiers (1984) developed a

model based on Mzenman (1984) to investigate the causes of real exchange rate

variability during the more recent period. This model predicts that in addi-

tion to monetary disturbances the degree of openness of the economy affects

positively real exchange rate instability. Using cross—section data for 39

developed and developing countries for 1970—82 they present evidence that

supports the hypothesis that monetary instability enhances real exchange rate

variability; their results, however, provide little support to the hypothesis

that openness has affected real exchange rate variability. Melvin and Bern-

stein (1984), on the other hand, analyze the role of real factors (only) on

real exchange rate variability. TJsing cross—country data for 37 countries

they regress a measure of variability of a bilateral real exchange rate

against an index of exports concentration and a measure of a country's degree
                                      3




of openness. They find that the coefficients of these two variables are

significantly positive.2

     ft is somewhat surprising that most empirical studies dealing with real

exchange rate variability have concentrated either on the role of monetary

factors, or on the role of real (structural) factors. In theory, however,

both types of disturbances will be important in determining real exchange rate

variability in the short run.3 In this paper this problem is tackled direct-

ly, by investigating the potential role of monetary and real factors in

explaining real exchange rate variability, using cross—country data for a

group of developing countries. In this paper a fairly pragmatic approach has

been taken. Rather than developing a specific model for explaining real

exchange rate variability, implications that emanate from a number of theoret-

ical models are considered in the empirical analysis. In this way a more

general set of possible determinants of real exchange rate variability is

considered.

     Contrary to previous work, in this paper the possible role of terms of

trade instability is explicitly taken into account. Although some authors

have recognized the theoretical importance of terms of trade movements in

explaining real exchange rate variability, the few empirical studies on the

subject have not taken this variable explicitly into account.4 Also contrary

to previous work —— which has concentrated on bilateral rates ——   this   paper

uses a measure of variability of the teal effective exchange rate. This paper

uses a more general estimation method than previous studies. In particular,

homoscedasticity is not imposed; the error's variance is allowed to vary

across countries. Finally, in this paper measures of both short—run and long—

term (or long—wave) real exchange rate variability are used in the regression

analysis.

Ii. Real Exchange Rate Variability in Developing Countries: An Overview

     During the last 15 years or so real exchange rate variability has

irtéreased substantially.5 However, this higher instability has not affected

all countries alike. In fact, here have been extremely large cross—country

differences in real exchange rate instability. The extent and characteristics

of real exchange rate variability for a selected group of developing countries

are illustrated in Tables 1 and 2.

     Table 1 presents, for a group of 30 developing countrtes, data on the

mean, variance, coefficient of variation, mininann and maxinnzn values for an

index of real effective exchange rate. (See below for an exact definition of

this index.) For most countries these statistics were computed using data for

the period between the third quarter of 1971 and the second quarter of 1984.

From these figures — and especially the minimum—maximira values —   it   is

apparent that during the recent period real exchange rate variability has been

substantial. The case of Sri Lanka is the most dramatic, where the difference

between the maximum and ntinirnum values of the Index exceeds 150 points. This

contrasts sharply with, for example, Mauritius where this difference was only

19 points. The striking difference in real exchange rate variability across

countries can be better illustrated by the ratio of the highest to the lowest

coefficient of variation of the real exchange rate. For this period this

ratio was almost equal to nine!

     Table 2 contains the same variables for the same group of countries for

the period between the first quarter of 1965 and the second quarter of 1971.

These indexes also show an important cross—country variability in the real

exchange rate for this earlier period. It is interesting to compare Tables 1

and 2. As can be seen, the degree of real exchange rate variability, as

measured by the coefficient of variation of the effective real exchange rate

    (1971—84) with the only exceptions being Ecuador, Korea arid Turkey.


    III. Eapirical Results

            In this section results obtained from the stitnation of real exchange rate

    variability equations, using cross—section data, are presented. The estima-

    tions were performed using data both on short—term real exchange rate

    variability and long—term (or long—wave) real exchange rate variability.6 The

    long—wave variability index was computed using annual data for the 30 count-

    ries in Table 1, for period 1972—83. The short—term variability indexes were

    computed using quarterly data for a smaller group of countries (26) for

    1972—83. The group of countries used was determined by the availability of

    data;    only a relatively small set of countries had quarterly data for the most
    important variables. It would be expected that         the   monetary factors would
    play    a more prominent role in explaining the short—term real exchange rate

    variability, and that real or structural factors would be more important in

    the explanation of long—wave variability.7

            The possible roles of monetary and real factors in the explanation of

    real exchange rate variability is analyzed by estimating the following log—

    linear equation:8

    exchange rate variability, xjn are the real or structural sources of real
    exchange rate variability and e       is the error ten. Since equation (1)

    refers to cross—section data, homoscedasticity is not imposed. In particular,

111.1 The Data

      Niost studies of real exchange rate instability have concentrated on

hilaterial real exchange rates.9 A problem with this practice, however, is

that it ignores possible important sources of real exchange rate instability

related to variations of exchange rates across trade partners. In this paper,

however, this problem is avoided by constructing a large data set for real

effective exchange rates for this group of developing countries)-0 For each

country j   the   REFR was constructed in the following way:
                                     k                      k
                                         a E    I       [       a.P*
                                                            —
(2)                   REERt=
                                                    t
where REERIt is the index of the ral effective rate in period t and                          is    a

proxy for the relative price of tradables with respect to nontradables in

country n; Ecit is an index of the nominal rate between country j and the

domestic country c in period t;          j =   l,...,k          refers to the k partner

countries used in the construction of the REEk index;                           is the weight
                                                                           a1

corresponding to partner J      in   the computation of REEk;                     is   the price

index of the j partner in period t; and P is the price index of the home

country in period t.

      In the construction of this real effective exchange rate index the

following procedure was followed. (1) The weights (a's) were trade weights
                                         9




constructed using data from the International Monetary Fund Direction of Trade

for 1975. (2) The ten larger partners in 1975 were used for the construction

of the index for each country. (3) The partner countries' WPIs were used as

the Pt's and the home country CPI was used for               While these assumptions

are somewhat arbitrary, they are defendable. First, for most countries 1975

was a fairly normal year and, consequently, its use as a base to compute the

a's is reasonable. Second, using the ten larger partner countries covers, for

most countries, well above 80% of total trade. Itreover, the inclusion of

other partners into the computation adds insignificant coverage to the REER

indexes, without affecting in a noticeable way the behavior of the index.

Also, using trade weights provides a more general view of the evolution of the

degree of competitiveness of a country than using. import or export weights.

      The real exchange rate variability index for country n was constructed as

the coefficient of variation of the log of the real effective exchange rate:

                           k       k
                                                    1/2 —
                                             2
                       =
(3)                        {z
                            i
                              [eniOi   e/ k)] /k}      /e.



      Where I    l,...,k refers to the number of periods used in the

computation of vn, eat is the logarithu of the real effective exchange rate,

and e is the average of en. The advantage of this index of instability is

that it is mean free. This is an important property when dealing with cross—

country studies of real exchange rate variability, since different countries

can have significantly different means during a given period)1

      In the regressions the following real or structural variables were used:

(1)   An openness index. For each period openness was measured as the average

propensity to import. The index was then constructed as the average value of

the average propensity to import during the relevant period. Melvin and

Bernstein (1984) have suggested that this variable will positively affect real
                                       10




exchange rate instability. For the data sources, see the Appendix.

(2) variability index of the log of the terms of trade. The terms of trade

are defined as the ratio of export to import prices, and for all countries,

except Chile, the raw data were obtained from the IFS. The variability index

was computed as the coefficient of variation of the log of terms of trade.'2

Icatseli (1984) , Mussa (1984) and Edwards (1985), among others, have pointed

out that the external terms of trade will affect real exchange rate movements.

(3) In some long—wave variability regressions, the coefficient of variation

of real CDP growth was also incorporated as a proxy for real productivity

shocks (Korteweg (1980) and 1-lelleiner (1981)).13

     In terms of monetary (or nominal) variables, the following were included

in the regressions: (a) Index of money (Ml) growth instability. Most models

of real exchange rate behavior and/or deviations from PT'P have pointed out

that monetary instability is an important source of real exchange rate van—

ability. The index was constructed as the coefficient of variation in Ml

growth. (b) Instability of domestic credit growth. This variable was

introduced in the analysis as an alternative measure of monetary instability.

The reason for this is that in some countries —— domestic credit is the

non etary aggregate more closely controlled by the conoraic authorities. The

raw data were taken from the IFS, and the instability index was constructed as

the coefficient of variation of domestic credit., growth. (c) Index of

volatility of domestic inflation. With other things given, a more variable

domestic rate of inflation is expected to result in a higher real exchange

rate variability (see Korteweg (1980)). Again the raw data were taken from

the IFS and the instability index was computed as the coefficient of variation

of the rate of inflation. (d) Index of volatility of nominal exchange rate

policy. Two alternative indexes were constructed. The first was defined as
                                        11.




the coefficient of variation of the rate of devaluation of the nominal

effective exchange rate. The second index was defined as one plus the stand-

ard deviation of the rate of devaluation of each domestic currency with

respect to the 11.8. dollar. There are also two reasons for defining this

second index in this way. First, most developing countries have traditionally

used the 11.8. dollar as a benchmark to formulate their exchange rate policies.

Second, since some countries have maintained a fixed rate with respect to the

dollar throughout the period, the standard deviation of this rate of

devaluation is zero and cannot be logged.14 (3) Average level of domestic

inflation. A n*unber of authors, including Aizeninan (1984) have pointed out

that higher inflation levels will be translated into higher variability of the

real exchange rate. All these variables were constructed from raw data

obtained from the IFS.


111.2 Results for tong—Wave Real Exchange Rate Variability

     In this section results obtained from the estimation of equations of the

type of (1), using instability indexes constructed with annual data are

reported. The regressions were performed using data for the 30 countries of

Table 1 for 1972—83, and were estimated using the generalized least squares

procedure suggested by Horn, Horn and Duncan (1975) to estimate heterosced—

astic variances. This method was used since the analysis of the residuals

obtained from OIJS regressions indicated the presence of heteroscedasticity.

     The following notation was used:

      In Table 3 the results for 1972—83 appear. Since the alternative

neasures of monetary instability used here are highly collinear, they were

introduced in the regressions one at a time. The results obtained are quite

interesting.'5 First, and contrary to previous results (i.e., DeCrauwe and

Rosiers (1984)) it was found that real or structural factors have played a

prominent role in explaining long—wave real exchange rate instability. More

specifically, the main source of explanation of real exchange rate variability

across countries during this period was the instability of the countries'

external terms of trade. This variable was significant at conventional levels

in all the equations where it was included. Second, these results also sug-

gest that during this period the instability of the nominal exchange rate

policy — measured through the variability indexes of the nominal rate of

devaluation —— played a marginal role in explaining real exchange rate

variability. Third, other measures of monetary instability —— the variability

indexes of domestic credit growth, money growth and of inflation —— do not

appear to have played an important role.

     In some sense it would appear that the results contradict the findings

reported by fleGrauwe and Liniart (1984) for a different period and group of

countries. This contradiction, however, is more apparent than real, since

they used short—tent instability indexes, whereas Table I results deal with

long—wave instability. s is discussed below, when a short—term variability

index is used, monetary sources do become important in the explanation of the

difference in real exchange rate variability across countries.

     Surprisingly, perhaps, enough the openness coefficient was never

significant. In order to check whether this result —— which contradicts the

finding by Melvin and Bernstein (1984) —— was due to the fact that an alterna-

tive measure of structural instability (i.e., the terms of trade index) had

been included, a regression that excluded a, but included OF, was also

run. As can be seen from Table 3 In this case the openness index remains

insignificant. This indicates then, that at least for this period the degree

of openness of the economy has not been associated with the extent of real

exchange rate instability.16

111.3 Short—Terni Real Exchange Rate Variability

     In Table 4 the results obtained from regressions using variability

indexes constructed with quarterly data for 1972—83 are presented. Data for a

subset of 23 of the countries in Table I were used)7 These results are quite

interesting and contrast with those obtained when the long—wave variability

indexes were used. The results in Table 4 show that, as expected, in the

short run monetary factors play a more important role in explaining real

exchange rate variability. Now, the coefficient of the index of instability

of domestic credit creation turned out to he large and significantly different

from zero in every regression where it was included. Also, the indexes of

instability of nominal exchange rate policy are significant and positive. On

the other hand, these results indicate that real factors (i.e., terms of trade

variability, openness) don't play an important role in the explanation of

differences in short—run real exchange rate instability across countries.

Another interesting finding reported in Table 4 Is that there is some evidence

that a higher level of inflation will be associated with a higher degree of

short—run real exchange rate instability. As in the case of Table 3, the

openness coefficient was never significant, this corresponding to what

DeCrauwe and Rosiers (1984) had found in their study which also used a short—

term variability index.

     The results presented in Table 4 have some important policy implications,

since they suggest that by pursuing more stable nominal exchange rate policies

countries could manage to reduce, in a significant way, the level of real

exchange rate instability in the short run.


TV. S.ary
     In this paper the relative importance of real and monetary factors in

explaining recent real exchange rate variability in developing countries have

been investigated. The empirical evidence shows that in the last 15 years or

so real exchange rate variability has increased significantly. However, the

degree of real exchange rate variability has been quite uneven across

countries, with some countries experiencing variability almost ten times

higher than others.

     tn   theory,   long—run equilibrium real exchange rates depend on the

behavior of a number of real variables, including the terms of trade and the

degree of openness of the economy (Mussa (1984)). ft the shorter run, how-

ever, real exchange rate movements will also be affected by monetary

disturbances, including the instability of the nominal monetary policy. From

a policy point of view it is important to determine the extent to which actual

real exchange rate variability stems from monetary and real disturbances. If

nominal policy—induced instability has been an important cause of real

exchange rate variability, there are policy options open to reduce it.

     In this paper data on a group of developing countries were used to

investigate   and assess the relative importance of monetary and real factors.

The analysis focused both on long—wave and short—term variability. The

results,  contrary to previous findings, indicate that real exchange   rate

variability has been caused both by monetary and real disturbances,    with real

variables   being relatively more important in the explanation of long—wave
instability   and nominal variables playing a more prominent role in case of

short—term instability.

     In terms of real disturbances the most prominent has been external terms

of trade variability, which was found to have played an important role in the

determination of long—run real exchange rate instability. In the shorter run,

however, it was found that no real variable had been important. Regarding

monetary disturbances, this study indicates that nominal exchange rate

instability has been the major and more persistent source of short—ten real

exchange rate instability in this group of countries.

     From a policy perspective these results are important. They suggest that

a stable nominal exchange rate policy will help to substantially reduce real

exchange rate variability. There are a number of ways to reduce the degree of

instability of the nominal exchange rate, including the adoption of any vari-

ant of crawling—peg systems. On the other hand, it is well known that nominal

exchange rate instability is greatly enhanced by the adoption of a flexible

rate system (Frenkel and Mussa (1982)). To the extent that policyruakers want

to reduce real exchange rate variability, the result reported in this paper

cautions them against adopting a floating rate system.

                                   FOOTTOT&S



     1Some authors have recently pointed out that "explaining the large

persistent real exchange rate inoventents...[is] at the center of policy debate"

(Dornbusch, 1984, p. 63). It has been argued that "excessive" real exchange

rate variability has negative welfare effects. It reduces the level of

international trade, affects investment decisions and, in general, hampers

growth possibilities. On the welfare effects of real exchange rate instabil-

ity see, for example, roes (1982) and Willet (1986). On the increase of real

exchange rate variability in the recent years, see Relleiner (1981), IMP

(1984). It should he noted that in IMP (1Q84) it is argued that this

increased instability has had little or no effects on international trade.

         should be noted that the degree of significance is narginal. Also, a

problem with these results, as well as from those of the studies discussed

before, is that the variables used in the regression analysis explain a fairly

small proportion of the cross—country differences in real exchange rate

variability.

     31n theory, in the short run, real exchange rate behavior will depend

both on monetary and real factors. See, for example, Mussa (1984, especially

section 1.6, pp. 37—43).

     4it is important to realize that some authors have used the terms of

trade and the real exchange rate interchangeably. These two variables,

however, will not be equivalent in models with importables, exportables and

nontradable goods. See Williamson (1983) and Katseli (1984). In fact,

Katseli (1984) shows that the tine series properties of the terms   of   trade and

the real exchange rate have been significantly different for a group of

countries.

      5See, for example, Helleirter (1981), IMF (1984), Cumby and Obstfeld (1984).

      6Krueger (1983) has emphasized the importance of looking both at short—

 term and long—term instability indexes. Melvin and Bernstein (1984) used

 yearly data only; Yuravlivker (1982) used quarterly data only.
                                                                       Der,rauwe,

 Janssens and Lelianart (1984), DeGrauwe and Rosiers (1984) and Stoclo-aan (1983)

 used monthly data only. DeCrauwe, Janssens and Lelianert (1984), DeGrauwe and

Rosiers (1984) and Melvin and Bernstein (1984) have also used
                                                                     cross—country
data in their studies. Stockman (1982), on the other hand, used a variance

components method on pooled cross—section, time series data. An alternative

method for looking at real exchange variability is to estimate a model of real

exchange rate determination using time series and then test for heteroscedast—

icity. If heteroscedasticity is present an Engel's (1983) ARCH procedure can

be used to compute the conditional real exchange rate variance.

     7See, for example, Mussa (1984).

     8Aizenman (1984)   ,   for   example, has postulated that real exchange rate

variability is a linear function of the variances of the underlying
                                                                           shocks,
both real and monetary, affecting the economy. See also Mussa (1984), Frenkel

and Mussa (1985) and Korteweg (1980).

     9Some of the more descriptive studies have also considered the

variability of the real effective exchange rate (Korteweg (1980), Helleiner

(1981)).

     10Unfortunately data on real effective exchange rates are not readily

available for the developing countries. The series published by Morgan

Guarantee, for example don't go far enough back in time.

     ''The equilibrium level of the real exchange rate in general will differ

across countries. Consequently, even assuming that the actual and equilibrium

real exchange rates will coincide, on average, for each country, there is no
                                       20




reason to expect that all countries will have the same mean. Williamson

(1983) also used coefficients of variation to compute nominal exchange rate

variability. Stocknan (1982) used the variance; the IMP         (1984) used period—
to—period changes; Ttatseli (1984) and Melvin and Bernstein used standard

deviations; and DeGrauwe, Janssens and Helinaert (1984) used mean absolute

changes.

     '2Some authors have sometimes confused the real exchange rate and the

terms of trade.   It is important to stress that in a setup with exportables,

importables and nontradables, both from empirical and analytical perspectives,

these are two different variables. Analytically, the terms of trade are

defined as the relative price of exportables to importables, while the real

exchange rate is the relative price of tradables to nontradables. See, for

example, the discussion in Katseli (1984).

     130f course, a problem with using a measure of growth variability is that

it is not clear to what extent it is a genuine exogenous variable.

     l4Notice that in the construction of the indexes of instability of the

nominal exchange rate policy the rate of devaluation was used; whereas the

variability index for the real effective exchange rate was constructed using

levels data.

     '5Note, however, that only a handful of coefficients turned out to be

significant. This — not uncommon in empirical works dealing with LDCs ——

indicates   that only a few variables have in fact been important in the

determination of real exchange rate instability in these countries. Several

aspects of these results are worth noting.

     '6Regressions were also run using data for period 1960—71. The results

obtained were somewhat different from those reported in Table 3. First, there

iaa only weak support for the   hypothesis   that   terms   of trade instability
                                       21




played a role in the explanation of real exchange rate
                                                         instability during this

early period. Second, and more important, there is rio evidence that during

this period real exchange rate instability was affected by monetary policy

disturbances. Also, these results indicate that during this earlier period

real exchange rate variability was greatly affected by the instability of

nominal exchange rate policy. This means that countries that had a more

variable rate of nominal devaluation also had a more unstable real exchange

rate.

         relatively small number of countries have quarterly data on the

relvant variables. The countries included in these regressions are: Bolivia,

Brazil, Colombia, Cyprue, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Ethiopia,

Greece, Guyana, Honduras, India, Israel, Korea, Malaysia, Pakistan, Paraguay,

Peru, South Africa, Thailand, Turkey, Western Samoa and Chile.
