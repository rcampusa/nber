                                       ABSTRACT



      The   paper                     events and policies in Argentina
                    reviews iracroeoz)nanic
in the period 1981-1984. In that period inflation, that had decelerated

to less than 100 percent, resumed and reached irore than 600 percent in
mid-1984. The real exchange rate that had appreciated in the policy of
disinflation depreciated sharply and, in the end-phase, real wages grew
rrore than forty percent. These events, by Northern-Atlantic standards,
are dramatic and the paper attanpts to sort out the main issues and
connections. Special attention is paid to the role of the real exchange
rate and its relation to real wages, the determinants of the black market
prnium for foreign exchange, and to the budget.

      In March 1981 the Viola government took over an economy that had

already for five years been in the process of' stabilisation. Finance

minister Martinez de Hoz had attempted stabilization in 1976—78 with non—

market approaches. But he dd not succeed n that way and therefore

moved in December 1978 to an alternative that turned out to be quite

destructive ——the Plan of December 20th. The plan fought inflation by

prefixed exchange rates, using the influence of stabilized and declining

import price inflation to reduce inflationary expectations and to reduce

directly the rate of' inflation. Concurrent commercial liberalisation was

expected to reinforce the price discipline of the exchange rate scheme.

At the same time the economy was opened widely to international capital

flows •

     The experiment failed to stop inflation definitively and by the time

Martinez de Hoz administration left office in March 1981, a legacy of

financial instability had built up that proved unmanageable for the

subsequent administrations. Today, three years and five finance

ministers later, stability is a prospect far removed and the traditional

conflicts about real wages; distribution, and inflation remain topical

and are further complicated by an external debt crisis.

     In late 1983 production of manufactures and real GDP were still at

the levels they had in early 1978 and significantly below the peak in the

transient period of prosperitiy of early 1979. Inflation has moved from

less than 100% at the peak of real appreciation in 1981 to more than

400%.   The product wage (manufacturing wages deflated by the WPI       for
domestic non—agricultural goods) today is as high as it was in early 1981

while the purchasing power of wages in terms of the CPI has risen more

than 30% over that period. These real wage gains, of course, stand now

at the center of domestic controversy over the budget; inflation

competitiveness.   As a counterpart industrial employment is more than 20%

below the 1979 level. The real exchange rate is significantly above the

level of early 1979 when the "tablita" started.

     After more than ten years of crisis it does not make sense to try

and decide where to lay the blame for the destruction of social and

economic stability, which event to single out as crucial and which policy

to identify as "the" single step toward disaster. Some policy episodes

might claim exemption because they purported to create stability via

rules and consistency, for example the Martinez de Hoz experiment.

Others, such as the Dagnino Pastore —      Cavallo   administration might appear

especially chaotic. But the former surely gained on inflation by

shifting the costs of overvaluation and increased external debts to later

administrations, while the other left behind much more inflation, but

also had reduced private and public debt burdens through a policy of

negative real interest rates.

     Of course, any administration with strong political support and

favorable initial conditions must be judged by a more demanding test.
                                  3



 Others that inherit lack of credibility, domestic and foreign debts,

 too high real wages, overvaluation and inflation start with a handicap.

      There are important differences in the strength of political mandate

with which different administrations could approach the economic

stabilization effort. Strongest, no doubt, was the mandate of Martinez

de Hoz who entered office in 1976, in the aftermath of the Peronist

debacle, on the shoulders of an as yet uncomprornised military-. His

political power, if anything, strengthened during his office as a direct

consequence of growth, reduced inflation and increased real wages. The

subsequent Sigaut administration operated with much more of a handicap,

in part self-imposed because of a lack of policy direction. Aleniann did

have strong political support but the Malvinas war completely ruined

his possibilities for stabilization. The following administrations were

rendered largely impotent by the complete collapse of any legitimacy the

military might have had. But something very positive must be said of

the post—Malvinas economic policy makers. Both gnino Pastore and Wehbe

made it their chief objective to create and sustain economic conditions

that would make possible the transition to democracy. In this they were

indeed successful even if it meant more inflation.

     Whatever the weight we give to these considerations, none of the

administrations can be judged a macroeconomic success. But, in a larger

historical perspective the experience of the last three years was not

unusual as Yeager (1981,p.139) suggests:


     "Argentine experience since World War II illustrates the self—
feeding aspects of an entrenched inflation—interactions among prices,
wages, exchange depreciation, controls, government deficits, and
expansion of money and credit. It provides examples of gimmickry...
Especially in contrast with episodes of successful stabilization policy
in other countries, Argentine experience illustrates the importance of
                                 4


whether the political situation warrants confidence in consistent and
resolute policy."


     The 1981—84 period discussed in this paper is not the first instance

of extreme macroeconomic instability. Certainly the years 1975—76 were

much the same. But from a longer perspective the macroeconomic

performance of the post—war period is very mediocre (see Table 1) and

sets Argentina apart from other semi—industrial countries. Indeed,

Argentina's problem is very much that "semi-industrial" status, the

country is neither efficiently industrial in the way of Brazil or the

Asian NICs, nor does she exploit effectively the extraordinary

opportunities of agriculture in the way Australia has more effectively

done. The strength of the agricultural export base has meant that

Argentina was "independently wealthy" being able to squander resources on

an inefficient industry, an even more inefficient public sector and an

uriforgiveably inefficient military. There is no indication that all this

inefficiency was the direct price of advancing social objectives as

opposed to narrow and often conflicting group interests. Martinez de Hoz

has claimed his policies were designed to change in a broad way the

Argentinian economy and society, and indeed his early micro—policies

pointed in that direction. But early success made him greedy and led to

his failure. Today Alfonsin is making a second attempt, based on

democratic compromise, with as much ambition but also with the handicap

of macroeconomic priorities and problems that make success quite

doubtful.

     We now present a brief overview of the 1978—84 period and then

discuss some brief details of the macroeconomic experience in each of the

four administrations. We then consider in more detail three issues:

exchange rate policy, real wages and the external debt.



I. An Overview

     Table 2 shows a broad view- of the path the economy has taken over

the period. The Table brings out why the Martinez de Hoz experiment had

so much appeal: in 1979—80 there was reduced inflation, strong growth and

a gain in real wages——everybody was benefitting from the experiment. As

Calvo (1982) has argued, this transitory euphoria represents the shortrun

adjustment to overvaluation. It is the counterpart for the appreciation

case of the recessionary impact of currency depreciation which Diaz-

Alejandro (1963) had identified earlier.

    The broad pattern of the 1981—84 period that does emerge is one of

accelerating inflation and declining and stagnant economic activity.

Striking points are the up and down        of   the real wage and the vast

deterioration in the budget, even when the deficit is calculated net of

domestic and foreign debt service.

     The budget deficit data are calculated in the following manner: the

C—P estimates due to Cavallo and Pena calculate the deficit on the basis

of total public sector financing. The estimate (A) represents total

borrowing, estimate (B) excludes all debt service, domestic and

international. The estimates labelled IMP use the International Monetary

Fund's procedures for calculating the consolidated public sector's

deficit, including state enterprises. Estimate A represents the total

financing requirement while estimate (B) excludes the inflation component

of interest payments. On the inflation—adjusted basis both sets of

estimates show a large increase in the deficit in 1980—81 and again

following the 1982 consolidation, in 1983. The budget deficit, of

course, is central to Argentinian macroeconomic instability.

industrial output, real wages and the premium in the parallel market.

The Figures highlight some of the important trends.

exchange rate is measured by the ratio of the WPI of imports to the WPI

of non—agricultural domestic goods. This Figure brings out the striking

real appreciation through 1981 and the corresponding gain in real wages.

In the 1981—82:111 period real wages decline and the real exchange rate

depreciates. Finally from 1982:111 on real wages and the real exchange

rate show less of a correlation. The real wage rises in a sustained,

steep manner while the real exchange shows some real appreciation. One

of the interesting questions to be raised below is why real wages and the

real exchange rate do not move (even) closer together, ifl particular In

the 1982—85 period.

     In Figure 2 we show manufacturing gross domestic product (MGDP) and

the real wage. The sharp decline In output, following the 1978—79 peak,

corresponds to the period of falling real wages and the upturn goes with

the recovery of the real wage.

     Finally Figure 3 summarizes the economic history of the period in

terms of the premium of the parallel rate for dollars over the official

rate. The premium Is some measure not only of overvaluation but also of

domestic political, economic and especially financial instability. In

particular it represents it varies inversely with the anticipated return

on Argentine assets. In that perspective the premium tells an obvious

story. With the exceptions of the Martinez de Hoz period and a brief

spell under Aleinann the premium is significant and often very high

indeed. The Figure highlights the financial panic of July—August 1982

and the pre—election uncertainty in the fall of 1983. But it is clear

that by May 1984 things are again well on the way to acute instability.

The behavior of the premium   in   the period surrounding the October 30th

election is particularly striking. Between September 30th and October

20th the premium was about 100% and on October 27tth it was still nearly

eighty percent. By October 31st it had declined to about 40% and by

December to Only 10%. But,it is clear.

     We now consider first in some more detail the chief intervals of the

1981—1984 period. In later sections we deal with exchange rate policy

and with the policy options involving real wages, activity and the

external balance. As already noted in Figure 3 the April 1981 to April

1984 period saw five minsters of finance. A natural divion of the period

is offered by the tenure of these ministers.

The Martinez de Hoz Legacy: Any   discussion   of the 1981—84 period must

first come to grips with the initial conditions. Specifically one must

decide whether Martinez de Hoz had in the 1978—80 period accumulated a

significant overvaluation of the exchange rate, and with it financial

instability and capital flight, as the counterpart of a reduction in

inflation. That view is, indeed taken her.

     The basic facts are well established: Having failed to reduce

inflation in 1976—77 to very low levels Martinez de Hoz embarked on a

radical experiment in the form of the "tablita". Exchange depreciation

was preannounced and set at levels significantly below the prevailing

rate of inflation. It was expected that the reduced depreciation would

directly cut down inflation but also contribute by supporting an

expectation of disinflation. Inflation did indeed come down to levels

much below 100%, but the disinflation was only borrowed by overvaluation,

not earnt by a thorough going domestic disinflation.

    The claim that Martinez de Hoz presided over a significant

overvaluation of the exchange rate is at first sight entirely

uncontroversial. Surely inspection of Figure 1 shows a vast real
                                  9




appreciation of the exchange rate index between 1977 and 1980. But that

evidence, though plausible, has been challenged in three ways. The

first, entirely unreasonable, questions the very fact of real

appreciation by suggesting difficulties with price indices. That

argument cannot be taken very seriously since on any sensible measure of

real exchange rates there has been a large real appreciation.

     The second challenge is based on the evolution of real activity.

It is argued that the absence of significant increases in unemployment

in 1979—80 proves that the real appreciation was not a move in a

disequilibrium direction. This argument was very fashionable in 1979—80,

but clearly with hindsight it has little merit. The data show a decline

in unemployment in 1979 from 1978, but in 1980, especially in the second

half, unemployment sharply increased. The evidence on work hours in

industry and on industrial output stronly reinforces the evidence. But

even if activity had not shown the adverse effects of overvaluation two

further considerations are relevant. First, Martinez de Hoz did bring

about a very large fiscal expansion in 1980 which must have partially

disguised the employment impact of appreciation. Second, the Diaz—

Alejandro effect-—the shortterm expansionary impact of appreciation——

would support employment via the spending effect of higher real wages for

a while before the elasticities take their toll.

     The third argument is due to Rodriguez and Sjaastad (See Fernandez

and Rodriguez (1983, Appendix 2)) who argue that the overvaluation claim

may have some justification, but that any overvaluation, at the time of

their writing in 1979, was minor. The basis of their argument is a

systematic relation between the relative price of domestic non-

agricultural and agricultural goods, PD/PA, and the relative price of
                                       10



imports in terms      of   agricultural goods, PM/PA. Specifically they show

that    over a long sample period a decline in the real price of imports in
terms    of   agricultural goods systemtically leads to a rise in the real
price    of domestic goods or real appreciation. They interpret deviations

from that historical relationship as real exchange rate disequilibria. In

1979 their measure showed a 10 percent overvaluation.

       Using their procedure we show in Figure 4 the time series of the

deviation from the systematic relation they claim. Clearly by 1980 the

real exchange rate, on this measure is more than 20 percent overvalued.

But the uncomfortable fact is that in the spirit of this analysis the

1976—77 period was one of massive undervaluation. This is not a view

that is   widely   held and it throws doubt on the oversimplified

specification of the Rodriguez—Sjaastad formulation.

       Perhaps   an approach based on simple   commonsense is justified. Any

foreign visitor to Argentina in 1980 would have been baffled by the

extraordinary price of services——a multiple of NY prices——and the

extraordinary     purchasing power of Argentinian incomes in terms   of foreign

goods.    There was no plausible erxplanation that would have justified

these real incomes in terms of productivity or other basic determinants.

The simple answer was that the high real incomes corresponded to a

massive exchange overvaluation. The overvalued rate represented a

consumption subsidy for imports and Argentinians travelling abroad and a

subsidy for anyone shifting their wealth from Argentinian assets into

assets abroad.

       By 1980 the public did start perceiving that the Martinez de Hoz

program was running into difficulties. A massive deterioration of the

current account, failures of financial institutions in early 1980 and

 the prospect of a change in government in early 1981 led increasingly to

capital flight. High real interest rates no longer proved enough to

finance the current account and budget deficits. Reserves instead of

rising started plummetting as the Central Bank maintained the tablita and

sold foreign exchange to finance the capital flight.

balance and the increase in gross external debt. It is interesting to

see the large shift in the current account toward a deficit and the

high              interest rates and confidence draw in capital flows, but in 1980 the

direction is one of capital flight. In 1980, for example the combination

of reduced foreign exchange reserves and increased gross debt sums to

$TJS 10.9 billion, but the current account deficit is only half that

amount. The remainder represents capital flight financed by selling off

reserves and borrowing abroad.

              The capital flight financed by the Martinez de Hoz administration

represents an unusual transfer within society. The benefits of exchange

overvaluation accrue to those who avail themselves of the subsidized

wealth into dollars, foreign securities or real estate abroad. Nobody

questions that this occurred on a vast scale. But who pays? In the end

the government has sold foreign exchange at privileged prices and

incurred or assumed a foreign debt that has financed the transfer. But

then subsequently depression of economic activity or real depreciation

(i.e. reduced real wages) are required to generate the foreign exchange

with which to service the external debts. In the end the disequilibrium

income part of the population toward those that had the wealth and

advantage to shift assets abroad. This aspect, of course, makes the

foreign debt question so controversial.

     The legacy of Martinez de Hoz, in my judgment, was a very large

liability: He had created through the "liberalisation" policy a financial

betting parlor. High real interest rates and overvaluatiuon had started

to impair economic activity and the sharp deterioration of the external

balance and the increase in debt made the external balance a serious

constraint. In late 1979 or early 1980 might have been the time to

change policies in a sharp way toward external competitiveness and away

from excessively free and speculative markets and capital mobility.

Incomes policy and regulation would have been appropriate instead of

"rules" that were plainly not working. Of course, there is always the

argument that in another one, two, or three years everything would have

worked perfectly. But that common claim does not carry much conviction

in this instance.

1. Sigaut 1981 :4 —1981:11. The Martinez de Hoz administration had

allowed real interest rates to rise to significantly positive levels and,
                                  13




 at the same time, had brought about a gain in real wages and a large real

 appreciation of the currency. The rise in real interest rates throughout

 1980 was required to check the capital flight induced by an increasingly

 conspicuous overvaluation, but of course had not been sufficient to avoid

 a massive outflow. Production in industry had declined nearly ten

 percent from the 79:11 peak and GDP, likewise had declined, though by

 less. The peso was widely considered overvalued and reserves had been

 declining sharply. With an annual inflation rate of about 80% the

 depreciation of the exchange rate, between December 1980 and June 1981,

alone amounted to 118%. The depreciation, necessitated by capital

flight, of course led to an immediate acceleration of inflation.

     The Sigaut administration inherited only problems. Inflation had

been artifically lowered by the exchange rate policy, but this had been

achieved at the cost of building up an external lack of competitiveness

as well as a large external debt. Sigaut therefore had to restore

competitiveness and could not avoid some increase in inflation. The

measure of success is whether the required real depreciation could be

achieved without bringing about a precipitous rise in inflation and

matching wage gains that would erode the real depreciation. The evidence

from Figure 2 is clear: more than 20% real depreciation and a cut in real

wages were, indeed, achieved. But, of course, inflation performance

deteriorated and, after June, high real interest rates and the real wage

compression provoked a sharp cut in manufacturing output.

     The real depreciation did not stop capital flight and failed to cope

with the large current account deficit. In June a dual exchange rate

regime was introduced which stayed in effect to the end of the Sigaut
                                    14




 period. The discrepancy between the commercial and the financial rate

widened over time from 30 to 60 percent, reflecting a growing imbalance

between the attempt to avoid the inflationary impact of depreciation and

the need to check capital flight by a rapid depreciation of the financial

rate.

        In exchange rate matters the Sigaut administration introduced two

practices that are important to note. One was exchange rate guarantees

as an incentive for renewing and lengthening external liabilities of the

private sector. The other was a preferential financial rate available

for firms willing to lengthen their external debt. In an economy with

extensive dollar liabilities of private firms the question of how private

debt is dealt with, and what incentives are offered to maintain private

external debt, are now common problems of borrowing countries that have

had to resort to devaluation. The initial overvaluation made these

questions particularly difficult in the Argentine context.

     Even though some real depreciation was achieved it is clear that the

trade—off between inflation and real depreciation was acutely present.

This is apparent from the pattern of the real exchange rate in the third

and fourth quarter.     In the last quarter of 1981 some 10 real

appreciation was allowed to dampen the tendency for inflation to

accelerate in a very pronounced way. The inability of the Viola—Sigaut

administration to solve the internal and external balance problems in a

manner consistent with non—accelerating inflation led to their

replacement in December 1981 by the Galtieri government with Roberto

Alemann as the new minister of the economy.



2. Alemann 1981:12—1982:6. Alemann came into office with full powers
                                    15




 and particularly strong and unambiguous terms of reference:

 disinflation, denationalisation and deregulation. These terms were

 pursued by unifying and liberalizing the exchange market, by reducing

 credit creation and by controls on wages and public sector prices.(See

 Dagnino Pastore (1983) p.10).

      The first quarter of Alemann showed a sharp turnaround relative to

Martinez de Hoz and relative to Sigaut as seen in Table 3. Even taking

into asccount the depreciation of the commercial exchange rate required

to unify the exchange market there was no large increase in inflation.

Of course, it must be noted that the inflation success was in part

achieved by very low depreciation in January followed by zero

depreciation in February. Output recovered somewhat and real wage cuts

and real depreciation were maintained and reinforced.

     The outbreak of the Malvinas conflict brings to an abrupt end this

stabilisation effort. Controls, not surprisingly, stabilize the economy

during the hostilities. Inflation under the influence of controls falls

to only 80 percent. But there is a lasting change that influences

significantly the external conditions under which the economy operates.

While previously capital had been readily available the hostilities, and
                                   16




later the Mexican moratorium and Brazil's inability to service her debt,

eliminate the possibility of external borrowing to finance interest and

non—interest deficits. Payments arrears and renewed issue of Bonex ——

dollar   denominated lOUs of the Argentine government made their

appearance.

3.   Dagnino Pastore: 1982:7—1982:8. The Malvinas conflict severely
weakened the miltary and Bignone who takes over at the end of the

conflict has a particularly weak mandate since the navy and airforce had

abstained from participating in the junta. On taking office Bignone

committed his government to a process leading toward elections.

     The new minister of the economy assumed office with a commitment to

achieve stabilisation thus facilitating the task for the future

democratic government. His main concerns were reactivation subject to

the external constraints and the need to contain inflation. A particular

concern of his administration and the large domestic debt overhang that

was gradually drawing enterprises into bankruptcy by the sheer force of a

rate of interest that far exceeds the profitability of capital. With

bankruptcy, of course, go job losses and declining output.

     Dagnino Pastore, and Domingo Cavallo at the Central Bank, shaped an

agressive program of debt reduction. Here is how Dagnino Pastore

(1983,p.13.-14) described the intentions:


     "...the strategy adopted in mid—1982 was more eclectic and
unorthodox. It set as a high priority the alleviation of domestic
recession and aversion of widespread bankruptcy.It chose the path of
price controls and effective domestic debt relief, and accepted larger
wage increases than would have been countenanced under more orthodox
approaches"
                                     17



        Simplifying somewhat, the strategy amounted to reducing the burden

of indebtedness of firms by a longterm restructuring of the debts of

firms   in   manufacturing and services and legal ceilings were set for

nominal active and passive rates at levels significantly below the rate

of inflation. The effects of negative real rates are reinforced by- an

exchange depreciation. Figure 5 shows the real, free and the regulated

loan rates. The effective loan rate was a weighted average with the

regulated rate having an initial share of .9 and declining to only .3 by

mid—1983. The negative effective real loan rate therefore continued to

transfer wealth from creditors to debtors. It is clear that in the

months of July and August 1982 debt burdens were sharply reduced. But

this was achieved at the cost of a massive increase in inflation. The

inflation increase was provoked both by overly high wage settlements but

also by the portfolio shifts into real assets and the parallel market.

The scare in financial markets drove the parallel market to a peak for

the 1978—84 period.

     The impact of these policies on real interest rates and inflation

was entirely drastic. Inflation rose from only 150% in June to more than

500% in July and stayed at that level for three months. The real

interest rate in the 3rd quarter of 1982 showed monthly- average of

averages —10% in the free market, —11.4 in the regulated market, and —

12.2 on deposits. The negative real interest rates of course
redistributed massively from debtors to creditors. The fear of hyper—

inflation arose acutely and the policies put the economic team critically

at odds with financial interests.

      It may be of interest to ask why inflation and negative real

 interest rates, rather than other forms of debt adjustment were chosen.

Keynes in the Tract (1923,p.54—55) comments on why levies on wealth (or

currency reform) and repudiation are politically inferior choices to

depreciation and erosion of debts.


     "...The remaining, the scientific, expedient, the capital levy has
never been tried on a large scaie;and perhaps never will. It is the
rational deliberate method. But it is difficult to explain, and it
provokes violent prejudice by coming into conflict with the deep
instincts by which the love of money protects itself."


     The idea of a Serman style currency reform with debt adjustment, for

example, had been rejected by Dagnino Pastore already months before (in

reply to questions on the occasion of a talk in the u.s.) as a measure

that requires more legitimacy and political support than Argentine

governments of the time could muster. The remaining alternative Df

administered   negative real interest rates did much the same in respect to

debts, but of course did so with more chaos. But then reactivation and

debt relief were the chief objectives, not inflation stabiLisation.

inflation and the external balance appeared primarily as the

constraints.

4. Wehbe 1982:8 —1983:12. Dagnino Pastore resigned on the issue of

union claims for excessive wage increases and was succeeded by Jorge

Wehbe who held office until the Alfonsin administration took over at the

end of 1983. Wehbe's policy was to seek a consolidation of the economy

with the help of an IM? stand—by agreement. Inflation was to   be   reduced

and contained and the external balance strengthened.

     Wehbe did not dismantle the changes in financial institutions or in

exchange rate arrangements undertaken by the previous team. Loan markets
                                   19




remained regulated, although the very large negative real rates were

allowed to rise somewhat. Even so the real deposit rate showed a monthly

average of about —3   percent over the next year and the real regulated
loan rate was also negative. The unregulated rates, however, became

positive.

    In the exchange market the separation of a commercial and financial

market, with exchange control, was maintained through October. Only at

that time, and following a devaluation, were exchange markets unified.

But exchange control remained and the premium   in   the parallel market, as

seen from Figure 4, remained significant.

    By early 1983 it might have been thought that the Wehbe policies had

managed to return inflation to levels significantly belDw the third

quarter Df 1982, restore some measure of fiscal discipline and do so with

rising real wages, growing output and without a deterioraticn in externaL

competitiveness. But clearly by late 1983 none was Left of that. Month

to month inflation, annualized, in the third quarter had accelerated to

600 percent, and the gain in external competitiveness was eroding. But

output and real wages retained their gain. In the fourth quarter

inflation remained at that higher level, and real wages had increased

further. The problems for the Alfonsin government were set with firm

roots.

5. Grinspun 1983:12— .     General agitation and the possibility of a

Peronist victory in the election had driven the parallel market to its

second highest level in the recent past. The victory of the decidedly

moderate Alfonsin government led to a rapid stabilisation of the premium,

at least for a while. But the new government was saddled with three

immense problems: record high inflation, an unexpectedly high real wages

and an unwise promise of much more to come, and finally an external debt

that demanded attention if not service.

     Debt issues were postponed for six month, to June 1984, and

attention focussed on the domestic front, delaying initially serious

economic issues in order to build a political foundation. But large wage

settlements kept up and threatened to accelerate inflation even beyond

the 600 percent level. Arrears on the external debt service, highlighted

at Punta del Este, forced a return to the IMF as part of the

international debt rescheduling process. The dilemma of the day is how

to cut real wages, especially in the public sector and thus have a chance

to reduce the budget deficit. But cuts in real wages would certainly

weaken the governments ability to get an upper hand in controlling and

weakening the power of unions. Matters are made easier by the fact that
                                    21




the external balance, not counting debt service, presents no difficulty

at all. In all likelihood the deciding factor is not the external debt

but the threat of explosive inflation that calls for immediate and

drastic attention.



II. Exchange Rate Policy

     The history of the period, starting with Martinez de Hoz, is

particularly interesting because of exchange rate policy. The Martinez

de Hoz experiment —   stopping   inflation through underdepreciation — gave

rise to the need to undo the overvaluation. But, of course, in the

process inflation accelerated. Increased inflation, in turn, called for

more rapid depreciation. The spiral was broken, off and on, by a slowing

down of the rate of depreciation and, inevitably and soon, by a catch—up

depreciation forced by the difficulties of the external balance.

     Figure 6 shows this pattern. The bars represent the depreciation

rate of the commercial rate, end of month relative to the end of the

preceding month. The smoother line shows the change in Argentine

relative to US wholesale prices. We take this relative WPI inflation

trend, a three month centered moving average, torepresent very broadly

the depreciation rate that would preserve purchasing power parity. It is

clear that in the period 1981—82 there are alternations of

underdepreciation followed by maxidevaluations, starting with the

Martinez de Hoz devaluation in February 1981.

     Is there any regularity to this exchange depreciation pattern? A

hypothesis would run as follows: The exchange rate, other things ecjual,

is depreciated at the PPP rate, indicated by the smooth line, so as to

maintain external competitiveness. But there are two adjustments. First
                                       22




 an incoming finance minister will use the occasion to make an immediate

 corrective devaluation the size of which will depend on the overvaluatjon

 she encounters as well as on the parallel market premium. Second, a

 niaxi—devaluation will always be somewhat forward looking and, for that

 reason, allows a slowdown in depreciation at least in the immediately

 following month.

      In   Table   6 we show a test of this hypothesis. We use a dummy that

 assumes   a   value of unity in the first month of a new minister's term.

 The explanatory variables are the dummy times the level of overvaluation,

 DTJMOVER, and the dummy times the premium in the parallel market,DUMPREM.

The variable PPP measures the depreciation rate indicated by the last

months' change in relative wholesale prices. DTJMPOST is a dummy that

assumes a value of unity in the month following a maxi. The equation was

estimated by OLS with monthly data for the 1981 to 1984:2 period.


                   Table 6     Explaining Exchange Depreciation

  (1.61)        (2.70)       (4.72)    (3.86)    (3.12)


     The empirical evidence offers support for the hypothesis. The PPP

coefficient is not significantly different from unity, although the point

estimate is only .74. There are strong first—month—of—office effects and

these devaluations are, indeed, governed by      an   estimate of overvaluation

(overvaluation is measured by the log of the real exchange rate relative

to its average over the 1981—84:2 period). Likewise a premium in the

parallel market prior to a new term leads to a higher depreciation.

Finally the month after a maxi there tends to be strong reduction in

depreciation relative to the PPP trend.

        Figure 7 shows the residuals (actual less predicted) of the

exchange rate equation. The few episodes of large residuals are of

interest. First, in April 1981 the first Sigaut devaluation is smaller

than predicted for a first month of office devaluation. Next the June

devaluation is an outlier because it does not coincide with anew term.

In 1982:2 a large outlier shows and is easily identified from Figure 6.

This outlier corresponds to Alemann's zero devaluation. Finally we note

in 1982:8 an underprediction because Webbe does not make the traditional

first month devaluation. But there is a matching positive error in

1982:11 when he does devalue. Note finally that Grinspun's first month

does not show up as an outlier because neither vervaluation nor the

premium in the parallel market were particularly out of line.

       Even though the equation does leave sone significant outliers it goes

far toward offering a common sense explanation of the apparently wild

depreciation behavior. It is interesting to note that neither reserve

losses nor inflation, or inflation acceleration, appear to be significant

determinants of the rate of depreciation.



III.   Real Wages and the ReaL Exchange Rate

       One of the impressive facts of the 1981—84 period is the large

variation in real wages. Figure 8 shows once more the real wage in

manufacturing. The Figure brings out the gradual real wage gains in

1977—80, following the large initial cut. Then, already under Martinez

de Hoz but particularly under Sigaut and Alemann real wages decline

reaching their bottom in the second quarter of 1982. From thereon they

show a gain of fully 70 percent to their 1984:1 levels. And, of course,

the rise may still be continuing, given Alfonsin's commitments.

       An interesting puzzle raised by the real wage behavior is the

following: We know that in the 1982-84:1 period the real exchange rate —

WPI   of   imports relative to the WPI of domestic, non—agricultural goods—

did not deteriorate significantly if at all. Yet during that period real

wages increased by 70 percent in terms of the CPI and the product wage in

terms of non—agricultural,domestic goods rose 58 percent. Where is the

leeway for real wages to rise that much without generating a

deterioration in competitiveness?

      A likely explanation goes as follows. We define in equation (i )   the
real wage as the money wage deflated as the CPI. The latter is a

weighted average of non—agricultural domestic prices (PD),import prices

(PM), agricultural prices (PA) and prices of goods supplied by the public

sector (PS)as shown in equation (2):

(i)            w =       w/cPi
(2)            CPI =     CPI(PD,PA,PM,PS)

(3)            PD =      aW(1+r)

Equation (3) shows the price of domestic goods as the unit labor

requirement, a, multiplied by the money wage (w)    and the financial cost
where r is the effective real cost of capital. Combining equations (1)

to (3) we obtain an equation for the real wage:1

(4)             w =   w(PA/PM,PM/PD,Ps/PD,(1+r))
Equation (4) shows that the real wage declines if agricultural prices

rise relative to import prices. A real depreciation, a rise in PM/PD,

likewise leads to a decline in real wages as does a rise in the real

price of public sector goods. A rise in labor productivity, 1/a, or a
                                 25



fall in the real financial cost raises real wages. The model thus

identifies three key relative prices, as well as real financial costs as

determinants of the real wage. Equation (4) could be further developed

by expressing PA/PM in terms of the external terms of trade, import

tariffs and export taxes. Similarly PS/PD might be expressed in terms of

the average subsidy rate of public sector goods. In these terms a rise

in the public sector subsidy would raise real wages, higher export

tariffs on agricultural goods or lower import tariffs, likewise, would

lead to increased real wages.

     It is clear that the real wage expression in (4) has room for

variables other than the real exchange rate PM/PD. Moreover, these other

variables have moved significantly during the period and hence may help

explain why the real exchange rate and real wages show only a correlation

coefficient of —.50 for the 1981—84:1 period. At the same time these

changes can explain why the CPI fell by nearly 35   percent relative to the
WPI since early 1981.

     The discussion of real wages already shows that income distribution

between workers and producers of agricultural goods is tied up in the

question. Compensated real depreciation for example, raises the real

prices of imports in terms of agricultural goods while improving the

budget through increased tax revenue and lowering real wages. By

contrast, removal of import tariffs raises real wages and might worsen

the budget while raising real prices to agriculture. Gaining real wage

growth consistent with no deterioration of the real exchange rate clearly

means either a deterioration in the world real price of agricultural

goods or else a commercial policy that redistributes income away from
                                    26




 agriculture. Such a policy- can, of course, worsen significantly the

 external balance.

        The variables that influence the link between real wages and the

 real exchange rate have,indeed, changed significantly over the period.

 Table 7 shows the behavior of the average rates of export taxes, the real

 prices of public sector goods, the terms of trade and the real interest

 rate. The large movements in these variables make it clear that we should

nopt expect anty simple relation between real wages and the real exchange

 rate. But it also means that a simple Rodriguez-Sjaastad real exchange

rate equation referred to above is bound to be seriously rnisspecified.

       There is another relation that we do not explore here in detail

but that is worth noting. There appears to be strong empirical linkage

between the real wage——wages deflated by the CPI——and manufacturing

employment. The relation suggests that increased real wages have quite

plausibly an expansionary impact on spending and production even within

the current quarter. Interestingly the expected negative link between the

product wage and employment does not appear in a striking way in the
                                     27



data. The link     between real wages and output is of course a critical
issue for stabilization policy: attempts to control real wages in order

to bring the budget under control have immediate adverse effects on

output and employment.



IV. External Debt

       The external debt situation is highly confusing because data are

almost as sketchy as debt service. Three available sources offer the

information shown in Table 9. The data come from Morgan Guaranty, the

Banco Central de la Republica Argentina and the Bank for International

Settlements.

       We take as given that the debt, including arrears, is around $ 40

billion, 75 percent of which is owed to banks. The rest involves

supplier credits and claims of official agencies. Official reserves at

the end of 1983 amounted to $ 2.8 billion and arrears stood at $2.3

billion. Another important aspect of the debt is that it has a very

short maturity. The BIS estimates that in mid—1983 more than half the

bank   debt   of Argentina had a maturity of less than one year and 60% a
                                    28



maturity of less than two years. There is accordingly not only a problem

of debt service but also of amortisation.

    The debt service problem is simple and obvious. In 1983 net

financial services in the balance of payments showed a deficit of $ US

5.4 billion. This stood against a non—interest surplus of of $ US 2.9

billion. The non—interest surplus thus pays about half the debt service.

The problem is how to cope with the other half. Of course, Argentina is

not alone in this position, most Latin American countries are unable to

service their debts entirely out of current earnings and, following the

drying up of automatic capitalisation through fresh money, have been

muddling through. Argentina is special in that she has allowed arrears

to develop in an agressive fashion, even to the point of testing the NY

banks ability to take losses in their quarterly statements. Her ability

to do so sterns in part from a large trade surplus and some reserves, in

part from an indecisiveness of the lenders who cannot quite decide how to

think about so much independence.

     The confusion of the debt issue is increased by the fact that

Argentinian residents conspicuously own assets abroad. Indeed that same

banks that seek repayment of debts from the Argentinian government are

the depositaries of Argentina's private capital flight. The data are

incomplete but even so they tell an obvious story: In December 1983 banks

in the major lending countries had claims of $23.4 billion on Argentina.

With only partial reporting liabilities of these banks to Argentina

amounted to $6 billion. These liabilities do not include the securities

or real estate in which Argentinians have invested on a large scale. A

significant part of the gross external debt is thus matched by private
                                     29



 Argentinian assets   abroad.   The debt crisis, in that perspective is an

 inability of the Argentinian government to control those foreign assets.

      Assuming that policy makers in Argentina do pursue a deliberate

 strategy of building up arrears to develop a negotiating position, what

 can Argentina hope to achieve? A mild course is to bargain for longer

 terms, smaller spreads, and fewer strings. None of this is outrageous

arid, given the complete impossibility of actually retiring, as opposed to

only servicing the debt, this is a likely course of events. Interest

capitalisation that now is actively discussed appears a plausible step in

this direction.

      An aitetmative, much more confrontational option is to call for a

complete renegotiation of the debt on concessional terms. The banking

community and policy makers in the U.S. are not prepared, it would

appear, to entertain such a possibility. European bankers, however, have

advocated a low level interest cap at say 7 percent. With such a cap

interest charges in excess of the cap are automatically capitalized.

This is, of course, what has been effectively been happening with

countries such as Mexico or Brazil where part of the interest has been

paid and part has been borrowed. An explicit cap would render that

process merely automatic thus replacing the periodic rescheduling. With

a cap the debt servicing is lightened and the question whether the debt

will ultimately be repaid is conveniently postponed to    infinity.

V.   Where Now?

     Argentina is in the process of negotiating a new stand—by agreement

with the IMF. If the events at Punta del Este are an indication she

appears to have turned away from radical debt options. Raul Prebisch,
                                     30



who is advising the President, and who in Argentinians domestic policy

has always been conservative, has publicly called for wage discipline. A

proposal is being considered for delaying ex—post adjustments of wages to

a quarterly basis, thus cutting the real wage. But there is another

strand that wants to hold the Alfonsin government to a commitment to

increase further real wages. What direction will have the upper hand and

will exteriial considerations be the deciding factor?

      The external debt situation, as Mr.Grinspun rightly remarked, is more

a bankers' problem than a problem for Argentina. Argentina is running a

trade surplus and has reserves. She can easily sell much of her exports

in world markets and does not have a critical import dependence that

would make it easy to enforce debtor discipline. The external situation

by itself will therefore not be the deciding factor unless banks unwisely

make it such, or unless an explicit political decision is made to use the

debt issue to gain a broader domestic support for recovery and

stabilisation —   the   "fortress Argentina" model.

       The inflation problem, and with it the real wage—budget deficit link

are   much more likely to force a change of direction. The real wage gains

of the past half year will lead to a dramatic deterioration of the budget

since about 75 of non—interest outlays are for wage payments. Increased

real wages then mean increased deficits and an increased financing

requirement. Since external financing has stopped there is then a need

to finance the budget domestically and that means largely inflationary

money creation and still higher inflation. So far the non—interest

current account is in a comfortable surplus so that, not counting the

growing arrears, increased deficits that spill—over into external

deficits can be financed without a crisis. That means inflation is the
                                      31




key issue.    More precisely, the question is what level of inflation is

high enough to give Alfonsin a mandate for a 180 degrees turn toward

orthodoxy.    But firm orthodoxy is there a willingness for restraint and a

disposition to use incomes policy rather than monetarism to control

inflation.

       In concluding it may be worth looking ahead to compare Alfonsin's

task with that encountered by Martinez de Hoz in 1976. Table 8 shows

data relevant to that comparison.

       Today, more than seven years since the time stabilisation started,

the chances for success certainly look as poor as they can be. Inflation

and the budget are as bad as they were in 1983. But output is much lower

which argues against austerity and the external debt is a liability

altogether insignificant in 1976. The comparison then suggests

pessimism.

*   Financial
            support was provided by a grant from the National Science
Foundation. I am indebted to Eduardo Borensztein, Domingo Cavallo and
Graciella Kaniinsky and Luis Radinea for generous help with the facts.
Jose Maria Dagnino Pastore bears responsibility for interesting me in
Argentinian policy problems.

'Suppose the CPI has a Cobb—Douglas form so that in logs it can be
written as follows: LogCPI= blogPD+clogPA + dlogPM + flogPS where b1—c—
d—f.IJsing that restriction we can with some manipulation derive an
expression for the real wage: log(W/CPI)=_c.Log(PA/PM)_(c+d)log(pM/pD)_
dlog(PS/PD) + v,here vLog(a(14-r)) denoting the combined effect of
productivity and financial costs . Now let e=Log(PM/PD) denote the real
exchange rate. Furthermore assume public sector prices are proportional
to domestic prices: PS =KPD where K denotes one less the rate of implicit
subsidy and k=logK for notational convenience. Suppose,too, that there
is an export duty on agricultural goods so that the domestic price is
linked to the world price by the relation PA*=TPA where tlogT denotes
the log of one plus the rate of export duty. Finally denote the
international terms of trade p*=log(PA*/P*).
     Substituting the shortcut notation in the real wage equation we
have: log(/CFI)= ct _cp*_(c*d)e_ dk—v. The equation shows that increased
export taxes or increased public sector subsides raise real wages. By
controast a terms of trade improvement lowers real wages as does a real
depreciation. Increased financial costs or reduced productivity,
tikewise,reduce   the real wage.
