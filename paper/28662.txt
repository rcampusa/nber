Terrorism and Political Attitudes: Evidence from European Social Surveys

JEL No. H56

                                          ABSTRACT

Since the turn of the last century, nationalistic political parties have been gaining support in
Europe. Over the same period, terror attacks have increased. Using data from European Social
Surveys (ESS), we examine the effects of terror attacks involving at least one fatality on attitudes
towards immigrants and government institutions. Comparing within-country responses to the
ESS shortly before and after fatal terror attacks, we find little evidence of a shift in attitudes
against immigrants. Consistent with "rally-around-the flag" effects documented by political
scientists, ESS respondents living in the region that was attacked tend to express more trust in
parliament and more satisfaction with the national government in the post- as compared to the
pre-attack period. Similarly, we find evidence that particularly salient terror attacks can produce
nationwide rally-around-the-flag effects.

1. INTRODUCTION

       Terror attacks in Western Europe have been trending upwards since the mid-2000s, with

a notable spike in the years 2014 and 2015 (Figure 1). There were, for instance, an average of

70 terror attacks per year in Western Europe during the period 2004-2007, and an average of 239

attacks per year during the period 2015-2018. This dramatic increase in the frequency of attacks

has been cited as evidence that the so-called "international war on terror" is failing (Thrall and

Goepner 2017, p. 2).

       As terror attacks have become more frequent, nationalistic political parties have also

gained support. The center-right Fidesz party, for instance, took over the reins of the Hungarian

government in 2010 (Than and Szakacs 2010), and the Eurosceptic Law and Justice party took

over the reins of the Polish government in 2015 (Sobczak and Szary 2015); other formerly fringe

nationalistic parties have increased their vote shares in Germany, France, the Netherlands, and

the United Kingdom (Holleran 2018). Many observers have argued that the recent surge in

terrorism has increased anti-immigrant sentiment and reduced support among voters for

traditional political parties and government institutions (Smale and Castle 2016; Fekete 2018;

Roth 2018; Turak 2018; Neumann 2019), but this argument has not yet been tested using a clean

and credible identification strategy.

       The goal of this study is to explore the short-run relationship between terror attacks and

political attitudes. Drawing on data from the European Social Survey (ESS) for the period 2002-

2019, our focus is on terror attacks that caused at least one fatality and, importantly, occurred

exactly at times when the ESS survey was being conducted in the field. Every two years, a new

round of the ESS is conducted. The ESS interviews residents of more than 20 countries across

Europe on a wide range of topics, including their attitudes towards immigration, the degree to


                                                  1
which they trust the institutions of government, and their satisfaction with the current national

government. Because we know the exact date each interview started, we can compare within-

country responses to the ESS in the weeks before and after a terrorist attack in the country and

produce credible estimates of the short-run effects of terror attacks on political attitudes and

opinions. Our identifying assumption is that the timing of each interview was quasi-random, so

that the pre- versus post-attack comparisons are arguably uncontaminated by secular trends,

economic conditions, and other political/social factors that could potentially bias naïve estimates.

        Our results provide little support for the hypothesis that terror attacks influence attitudes

towards immigration, at least in the short run. The estimated effects on immigration-related

responses are, with only a few exceptions, small and statistically insignificant at conventional

levels. By contrast, there is evidence that terror attacks affect attitudes towards government

institutions. Specifically, we observe sizeable post-attack increases in how much trust ESS

respondents have in their parliament and how much satisfaction they have with the national

government among respondents living in the region of the country that was attacked. Likewise,

high-profile attacks such the Charlie Hebdo shootings in France, are often associated with

nationwide and sizeable increases in how much trust ESS respondents have in their parliament, a

pattern of results which is consistent with "rally-around-the-flag" effects documented by political

scientists (Mueller 1973; MacKuen 1983; Brody 1991; Chowanietz 2011) in the wake of

diplomatic or military crises. 1

        There is an ongoing debate as to the effectiveness of terrorism. Studies by Berrebi and

Klor (2008), Gould and Klor (2010), and Montalvo (2011, 2012) provide evidence that terror

attacks can influence political opinions and alter choices at the ballot box. Other researchers,


1
 The sharp increase in popularity of President G.W. Bush after the attacks of September 11th, 2001 is, however,
considered anecdotally to be a clear example of rallying around the flag in response to a terror attack.

                                                         2
however, have concluded that terrorism has little, if any, impact on political attitudes and

election outcomes (Abrahms 2006, 2007, 2012; Lago and Montero 2006; Fortuna 2015;

Arvanitidis et al. 2016; Balcells and Torrats-Espinosa 2018; Silva 2018). We view our results,

described above, as directly contributing to this debate. Although popular support for European

nationalistic and anti-immigration parties has undoubtedly been on the rise in recent decades

(Holleran 2018; Roth 2018; Neumann 2019; Peri et al. 2020), our results suggest that terror

attacks did not substantially contribute to this phenomenon.

       The remainder of this study is organized as follows. We provide a brief review of the

literature in the next section. In Section 3, we describe our data. In Section 4, we describe our

empirical strategy and report our principal results. Estimates for specific country-round pairs

(e.g., estimates based on the responses of French participants immediately before and after the

Charlie Hebdo shootings, which occurred while Round 7 of the ESS was in the field) are

reported in Section 5. Section 6 concludes.



2. PREVIOUS STUDIES

       Terror attacks are, by definition, designed to serve political ends (Thornton 1964; Kydd

and Walter 2006). There is, however, surprisingly little evidence to suggest that they are actually

effective. Studies in this literature typically focus on a particular country and event, limiting

their generalizability and leaving questions about their external validity.

       For instance, using data from opinion polls conducted in the lead up to parliamentary

elections, Gould and Klor (2010) found that terror attacks increased Israelis willingness to grant

territorial concessions to the Palestinians as part of a peace agreement. Gould and Klor (2010)

also examined whether respondents intended to support the "right-wing bloc" in the upcoming


                                                  3
elections. Consistent with the results of Berrebi and Klor (2008), they found that terror attacks

were associated with a rightward shift in the preferences of Israeli voters. 2 Although the results

of Gould and Klor (2010) are intriguing, it is not clear whether they extend to other counties,

time periods, or types of attack.

           Silva (2018) used data from the ESS to examine the effects of the Charlie Hebdo

shootings, which began on January 7, 2015. Round 7 of the ESS was in the field at the time,

allowing Silva to compare responses from the week before and the week after these shootings.

The results provide little evidence that French attitudes towards immigrants or refugees or

shifted. 3 By contrast, Finseraas et al. (2011) found that ESS respondents across Europe became

more supportive of imposing restrictive immigration policies immediately after the murder of

Dutch film-maker Theo van Gogh on November 2, 2004 by a member of a radical Islamist

group. 4

           Finally, Brodeur (2018) used county-level data from the United States for the period 1970

­2013 to explore the effect of terror attacks on consumer sentiment and economic outcomes such

as employment, earnings, and housing prices. Brodeur's results suggest that terror attacks can


2
 These two results (i.e., that terrorism is associated with a greater willingness to make territorial
concessions and greater support for right-wing parties) are seemingly at odds. Gould and Klor (2010, p.
1504) explained that they "can be reconciled by the idea that the platforms of the political parties are
endogenously changing over time" and pointed to the fact that Likud's platform went from asserting
sovereignty over the occupied territories to declaring a willingness to make territorial concessions in
exchange for peace.
3
  Specifically, Silva (2018) examined whether ESS respondents thought that France was made better (or
worse) by immigrants and whether the government should be generous when judging applications of
refugee status. Silva (2018) also examined whether attitudes in other European countries shifted as a
result of the Charlie Hebdo shootings. Again, there was little evidence to support this hypothesis.
4
  Finseraas et al. (2011) compared responses to the ESS in 16 countries before and after the murder of
Theo van Gogh. A total of 10,376 interviews were conducted in the 27 days before the murder and 9,183
interviews were conducted in the 27 days after the murder. See also and Finseraas and Listhaug (2013)
and Legewie (2013).


                                                    4
have powerful and long-lasting economic consequences. Specifically, he found that successful

terror attacks decrease employment by 2 percent and decrease housing prices by 1-2 percent.

Brodeur (2018) also explored the effects of terror attacks using individual-level data from the

Michigan Survey of Consumers (MSC). The results of this exercise lend support to the argument

that terror attacks are related to economic outcomes through consumer sentiment. 5



3. DATA AND TRENDS

3.1. Terror attacks

        Data on terror attacks come from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), which is housed

at the National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism (START).

These data are based on a wide variety of publicly available sources, including newspaper and

journal articles, legal documents, and other existing datasets. 6 They contain detailed information



5
  Numerous studies have estimated the effects of terror attacks on election outcomes, as opposed to
attitudes or opinions. The results have been decidedly mixed. For instance, Kibris (2010) examined the
effects terror attacks carried out by the PKK (i.e., the Kurdistan Workers' Party) on the 1991 and 1995
Turkish general elections. She found a strong positive association between casualties suffered by security
forces (police officers and members of the military) and the vote share of right-wing parties. Kirbis
concluded that terrorism "led the Turkish people to vote for hard-liners" (Kibris 2010, p. 241). Gassebner
et al. (2008) and Balcells and Torrats-Espinosa (2018) examined whether incumbents or challengers
benefited from terror attacks but came to opposite conclusions. After analyzing more than 800 elections
taking place in 115 countries across the world, Gassebner et al. (2008) found "strong evidence that
terrorist attacks increase the probability that the cabinet will be replaced after an election" (p. 129). By
contrast, Balcells and Torrats-Espinosa (2018) found that attacks carried out by Euskadi Ta Askatasuna
(ETA), a Basque terrorist organization, had no discernable impact on self-reported support for the
incumbent party. Perhaps because they occurred just three days before an election, the Madrid train
bombings have received a fair amount of attention from past researchers. Bali (2007) and Montalvo
(2011, 2012) found that the bombings significantly contributed to the opposition's victory over the
incumbent party, while Lago and Montero (2006) concluded that the bombings "have not changed the
electoral preferences of Spaniards" (p. 22).
6
 START is a research center at the University of Maryland, College Park. It is dedicated to examining
and understanding the causes and consequences of terrorism. See https://www.start.umd.edu/gtd/ for
more information on collection methods and the information available in the GDT data.


                                                     5
on each attack, including the date in which it occurred, its location, the number of casualties, and

the responsible group. The GTD data have been used by dozens of researchers interested in

exploring the causes and consequences of terrorism. 7

          The GTD defines a terror attack as "aimed at attaining a political, economic, religious, or

social goal." Furthermore, there must be evidence that the attack was intended to coerce or send

a message to a broad audience (as opposed to the immediate victims). Finally, terror attacks are,

according to the GTD, perpetrated by a non-state actor (or actors) and are therefore distinct from

"legitimate" warfare activities conducted by national governments or military forces.

          Figure 1 shows the number of terror attacks on European soil per year for the period

2000-2018. Since the mid-2000s, terror attacks have been trending upward, with a notable spike

in 2014 and 2015 thought to be, at least in part, inspired by the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq

and the Levant (ISIL) (Nesser et al. 2016). The number of fatal attacks, defined as attacks

involving at least one death, are also shown in Figure 1. 8 After averaging fewer than 8 per year

during the period 2004-2013, terror attacks involving at least one death peaked in 2014, when

there were 233.



3.2. Measuring political attitudes

          To explore the effects of fatal terror attacks on political attitudes among Europeans, we

use data from the European Social Survey (ESS). The ESS was launched in 2002. Since then,

more than 430,000 respondents from 38 countries have been interviewed in person and asked a

battery of questions about their attitudes, behaviors, and values. The ESS is conducted every two


7
 See, for example, Choi (2010), Drakos (2010), Gaibulloev and Sandler (2011), Findley and Young
(2012), Ding et al. (2017), and Brodeur (2018).
8
    Non-fatal attacks were either aimed at property or were unsuccessful attacks with human targets.
                                                      6
years, although there are changes to the mix of participating countries from round to round. It is

considered to be a "model for international surveys" (Jagodzinski and Moschner 2008, p. 475)

and has been used by previous researchers interested in estimating the various effects of

terrorism (Finseraas and Listhaug 2013; Arvanitidis et al. 2016; Silva 2018; Ahern 2018).

          Our immigration-related outcomes are based on responses to three ESS questions.

Specifically, the ESS asks respondents whether immigrants make their county "a worse or better

place to live," how many immigrants of a different race and/or ethnicity should be allowed in

their country, and how many immigrants from "poorer countries outside Europe" should be

allowed in their country. Answers to the first question are on a 0-10 scale (where 0 is "worse

place to live" and 10 is "better place to live"), while answers to the second and third questions

are on a 0-4 scale (where 0 is "allow many to come and live here" and 4 is "allow none"). 9

          To gauge whether terror attacks affect attitudes towards government institutions, we use

responses to three more ESS questions. Specifically, ESS respondents are asked how much trust

they "personally" have in their country's parliament and how much trust they have in the

European Parliament. 10 Answers to these questions are on a 0-10 scale (where 0 is "no trust at

all" and 10 is "complete trust"). The ESS also asks respondents whether they are satisfied with

the national government. Answers to this last question are on a 0-10 scale (where 0 is

"extremely dissatisfied" and 10 is "extremely satisfied"). Descriptive statistics for the outcomes

used in the analysis are provided in Appendix Table A1.




9
    Appendix B shows these questions as they appear on the survey.
10
   We include the question about the European Parliament because the European Union is a frequent
target of nationalist and anti-immigration politicians.


                                                     7
        As noted in the introduction, our focus is on countries that were attacked while the ESS

was conducting its interviews. We begin the empirical analysis by pooling ESS responses from

16 country-round pairs. These country-round pairs (listed in Appendix Table A2) were chosen

because the ESS was in the field for at least two weeks before and two weeks after a fatal terror

attack, allowing us to leverage within-country variation and estimate what can be characterized

as average treatment effects (ATEs). In Section 5, we report separate estimates for each

individual country-round pair in our analysis. For instance, France experienced a series of

attacks between December 20, 2014 and January 9, 2015, when Round 7 of the ESS was in the

field. In Section 5 we report estimates of the effects of this series of attacks on French attitudes

towards immigrants and government institutions.



4. EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS

        Following Depetris-Chauvin et al. (2020), baseline results are obtained by using ordinary

least squares (OLS) to estimate the following simple regression model:



(1)     yicmt = 0 + 1Post_Attackicmt + m + ct + icmt,



where yicmt is one of several outcomes discussed above, i indexes respondents, c indexes country,

m indexes calendar month (i.e., January-December), and t indexes ESS rounds. 11 The

independent variable of interest is Post_Attack, equal to 1 if respondent i was interviewed




11
  Depetris-Chauvin et al. (2020) examined the relationship between national football team victories and
national identity in sub-Saharan Africa. Leveraging within-survey variation, they found that respondents
were less likely to identify with their ethnic group immediately following a victory.


                                                   8
after a fatal terror attack occurred and equal to 0 otherwise. Its coefficient, 1, measures the

change in political attitudes from the pre-attack period (1-14 days before an attack) to the post-

attack period (0-13 days after an attack). If there were multiple attacks in country c during round

t, then the pre-attack period is based on the date of the first attack while the post-attack period is

based on the date of the last attack. Identification comes from 16 pre- post-attack comparisons.

Five out of these 16 comparisons involve multiple attacks. 12

        Month fixed effects (m) account for any seasonality in political attitudes. Country-by-

round fixed effects (ct) ensure that identification comes from comparing within-country

responses from interviews conducted shortly before and after attacks. The identifying

assumption is that the timing of each interview was quasi-random, unrelated to the attack or the

characteristics of the respondent being interviewed. Standard errors are corrected for clustering

at the country-round level to allow for correlation of unobservable individual characteristics

within a country-round.




12
   For example, there were two fatal terror attacks on German soil when Round 8 of the ESS was in the
field. The first of these occurred on October 16, 2016 and the second occurred on December 19, 2016.
Using a two-week bandwidth, our sample includes respondents interviewed 1-14 days before the attack
on October 16 and those interviewed 0-13 days after the attack on December 19. Respondents
interviewed between these two attacks are not included in the analysis. To take another example, there
were 5 fatal terror attacks on French soil when Round 7 of the ESS was in the field. The first of these
attacks occurred on December 20, 2014 and the last occurred on January 9, 2015. Using a two-week
bandwidth, our sample includes respondents interviewed 1-14 days before the attack on December 20 and
those interviewed 0-13 days after the attack on January 9. Country-round pairs were included in our
analysis only if ESS interviews were conducted in each of the two weeks before the first attack and each
of the two weeks after the last attack. Appendix Table A2 contains descriptions of the terror attacks used
in our analysis, when they occurred, and the pre- and post-attack periods. Appendix Figures A1 and A2
report interview counts in the pre- and post-treatment periods for each of the 16 country-round pairs that
comprise the two-week bandwidth sample.



                                                    9
4.1. Main Results

       Estimates of 1 using a two-week bandwidth sample are reported in the top panel (Panel

A) of Table 1. They provide little evidence that terror attacks influence attitudes towards

immigrants and government institutions. Without exception, the estimates of 1 are small,

relative to the mean and statistically insignificant at conventional levels. For instance,

experiencing a fatal terror attack is associated with a (statistically insignificant) 0.160 increase in

whether respondents believed that immigrants made their country a better place, which is only 3

percent of the mean (5.131).

       In the bottom panel (Panel B) of Table 1, we expand the bandwidth to 4 weeks, allowing

for the possibility that the effects of terror attacks on political attitudes take more than two weeks

to manifest. With this modification, the pre-attack period is 1-28 days before the first terror

attack while the post-attack period is 0-27 days after the last. Because we require that the ESS

was in the field for at least 4 weeks before the first attack (and 4 weeks after the last),

identification is now based on 12, as opposed to 16, pre- and post-attack comparisons. 13

       Using the 4-week bandwidth, the estimates of 1 remain small and statistically

insignificant with one interesting exception: experiencing a fatal terror attack is associated with a

0.151 increase in trusting the European Parliament. It should be noted, however, that this

estimate is only significant at the 10 percent level and represents a small (3.6 percent) increase

relative to the mean response (4.202).

       If terror attacks systematically affected who was willing to participate in the EES, the

estimates reported in Table 1 may not be reliable. To explore this possibility, we conduct a


13
  The country-round pairs that are dropped when we go to from the two- to the 4-week bandwidth are:
the Czech Republic-Round 6, Ireland-Round 8, Poland-Round 5, and Spain-Round 4. See Appendix
Table A2 for details.


                                                  10
balance test for several respondent characteristics (age, gender, educational attainment, whether

the respondent lives in an urban setting, minority status, and whether the respondent was "coping

with their current level of income") that, in theory, could be correlated with the outcomes under

study. 14

          The results of regressing each of these characteristics on the post-attack dummy and

country-by-round fixed effects are reported in Table 2. They suggest that the characteristics of

respondents are largely balanced, although a few differences are statistically significant. Using a

two-week bandwidth, experiencing a terror attack is associated with a 0.035 increase in the

probability that the respondent lived in an urban area and a 0.016 increase in the probability that

the respondent self-identified as belonging to a minority group. Using a 4-week bandwidth,

experiencing a terror attack is associated with an almost two-year reduction in respondent's age

and a 0.35 increase in years of education. It is possible, although unlikely, that these associations

are driven by post-attack concerns regarding ESS participation.

          To account for these small post-attack changes in the composition of ESS respondents,

we augment our estimation equation by including a vector of individual-level characteristics,

X. 15 The augmented version is:



(2)       yicmt = 0 + 1Post Attackicmt + Xicmt + m + ct + icmt.




14
  Minority status is determined by the question, "Do you belong to a minority ethnic group in [country]?"
We code the coping-with-income indicator as equal to 1 if the ESS respondent indicated that he or she
was "Coping on present income" or "Living comfortably on present income" in response to the question,
"Which of the descriptions comes closest to how you feel about your household's income nowadays?"
The coping-with-income indicator is otherwise equal to 0.
15
     Descriptive statistics for the controls are provided in Appendix Table A3.


                                                      11
Estimates based on (2) are reported in Table 3. Reassuringly, the basic pattern of results remains

extremely similar: the estimates of 1 are small and statistically insignificant. Using a two-week

bandwidth, there is a post-attack increase of 0.046 in believing that fewer immigrants of different

race/ethnicity should be allowed in the country (Panel A). However, using the 4-week

bandwidth, this estimate shrinks to 0.031 and becomes statistically indistinguishable from zero at

conventional levels.



4.1. Event Studies

        Figures 2-7 report event-study estimates of the effects of terror attacks on political

attitudes using a 4-week bandwidth. Specifically, these estimates are from a modified version of

equation (2) in which the post-attack indicator is replaced with a series of mutually exclusive

lead and lag indicators. 16 This specification allows us to check for pre-treatment trends and to

explore whether the effects of terror attacks grew stronger over time. We flexibly estimate the

effects of terror attacks before/after one, two, three, and 4 weeks. 17

        Event-study estimates for whether immigrants make the respondent's country a better

place to live are reported in Figure 2. There is no evidence of pre-treatment trends (the estimated

coefficients of the pre-event dummies are consistently small and statistically insignificant at

conventional levels), but one week after treatment there is a modest tick upwards of 0.098 in how

this question was answered, followed by a gradual decline of roughly equal magnitude.




16We use the 4-week bandwidth sample, which contains 12 country-round pairs. See Appendix Table A2
for details.

  Specifically, the zero-week indicator in Figures 2-7 is for interviews that were conducted 0-6 days after
the last attack. The one-week indicator is for interviews conducted 7-13 days after the last attack, and so
forth. The negative one-week indicator is for interviews conducted 1-7 days before the first attack.


                                                    12
However, none of the post-treatment coefficients are sufficiently precise to reject the hypothesis

of zero effect.

        Event-study estimates for whether fewer immigrants of different race/ethnicity should be

allowed are reported in Figure 3. Although there is no evidence of pre-treatment trends, two

weeks after an attack there is a statistically significant 0.122 increase in how this question was

answered, or 5.2 percent of the mean response (2.332). To explore whether this estimate reflects

a permanent shift in political attitudes, we widen the bandwidth from 4 to 8 weeks. 18 The results

of this exercise are reported in Appendix Figure A3. There is no evidence of a sustained upward

trend in the post-attack period, which we interpret as evidence against the hypothesis that

attitudes towards immigrants of different races and ethnicities permanently hardened.

         The remaining event-study estimates, reported in Figures 4-7, tell a similar story. If

using a 4-week bandwidth produces evidence that terror attacks have a modest effect on political

attitudes, the estimates based on an 8-week bandwidth, which are reported in Appendix Figures

A4-A8, suggest that these effects are, in general, short-lived. 19




18
   In this analysis, we do not require that ESS interviews were conducted in each of the 8 weeks before
and after an attack. Instead, we include country-round pairs with any ESS interviews conducted during
the 8 weeks before and after an attack and four additional country-round pairs (Hungary-Round 4,
Ireland-Round 3, and United Kingdom-Rounds 1 and 7) were included. The results of this analysis
should be viewed with caution because each event-study coefficient is based on different within-county
comparisons.
19
  Using an 8-week bandwidth, there are small but statistically significant increases in the belief that fewer
immigrants from poor countries should be allowed 0, 2 and 3 weeks after an attack (Appendix Figure
A5). These estimates range from 0.056 to 0.082 (with p-values of .021 to .027). However, 5 to 7 weeks
after an attack, there is a pronounced downward trend in how ESS respondents answered this question,
suggesting that any effect of fatal terror attacks on attitudes toward immigrants from poor countries was
not only small but impermanent.


                                                     13
4.2. Regional effects of terror attacks

         Up to this point in the analysis, we have estimated average effects across ESS

respondents living in country c, the country that was attacked. However, it is possible that

attacks are more salient when they occur in the respondent's own region of residence. ESS

Rounds 4-9 provide "Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics" (NUTS-1), which allow us

to match where an attack occurred with each respondent's region. 20 While fatal terror attacks

typically receive national and even international attention, press coverage is more intense at the

regional and local levels. In this section, we use Rounds 4-9 of the ESS to explore the effects of

terror attacks on political attitudes at the regional level by estimating the following regression

model:



(3)      yicrmt = 0 + 1Post Attackicmt + 2Post Attackicmt x Regionicrmt + Xicrmt + m + crt + icrmt,



where the post-attack indicator is interacted with the variable Region, equal to 1 if the respondent

lived in the NUTS-1 region of the country that experienced the attack. 21 In place of the country-

by-round fixed effects used in equations (1) and (2), we include region-by-round fixed effects,

crt.

         Estimates of equation (3) based on a 4-week bandwidth are reported in Table 4. They

provide some evidence that terror attacks can affect political attitudes among residents of the

region in which they occur. The direction of these estimated effects is, however, not consistent


20
  NUTS regions have three levels, with level 1 being the broadest. We use level 1 because a large
portion of ESS observations do not contain information on levels 2 and 3.
21
  The GTD provides the latitude and longitude of terror attacks. Attacks were matched to regions using
GIS software.


                                                  14
with the idea that the recent surge in terrorism has weakened faith in government and

parliamentary institutions (Smale and Castle 2016; Fekete 2018; Roth 2018; Turak 2018;

Neumann 2019). Specifically, estimates of 1 and 2 are small and imprecise when attitudes

towards immigration are on the left-hand side of the regression. For instance, experiencing a

fatal terror attack is associated with a statistically insignificant 0.087 increase (1 + 2 =

0.087) in whether respondents in the affected region believed that immigrants made their

country a better place, which is less than 2 percent of the sample mean (5.231). 22

        By contrast, trust in the country's parliament and satisfaction with the national

government increase significantly in the affected region (i.e., the region in which the attack

occurred). Moreover, these increases appear to be sizable. Specifically, a fatal terror attack is

associated with a 0.462 increase in trust in the parliament (1 +  2 = .462) and a 0.470 increase

in satisfaction with the national government (1 +  2 = 0.470) in the affected region. The

former estimate represents a 10 percent increase relative to the sample mean (4.530), while the

latter represents a 12 percent increase relative to the sample mean (3.995). 23

        Why might terror attacks lead residents of the affected region to view government

institutions more favorably? Political scientists have described a rally-around-the-flag



22
    1 is statistically significant at the 10 percent level for whether the country should allow fewer
immigrants of different race/ethnicity, but the sum of       1 +  2 (0.077) is not statistically distinguishable
from zero and is small relative to the mean (2.256).
23
  These estimates of    1 +  2 are statistically significant at the 10 percent level. Affected region event-
study estimates for trust in parliament and satisfaction with the national government are reported in
Appendix Figures A9 and A10. In general, these estimates, although imprecise, confirm that there were
sustained post-attack increases in how ESS answered these questions. In Appendix Table A4, we report
estimates of equation (3) using a two-week bandwidth. The estimates for trust in parliament and
satisfaction with national government are positive but no longer statistically significant at conventional
levels, although there is evidence of post-attack increase in the belief that immigrants make the country a
better place to live. The estimated effect on the belief that fewer immigrants from poor countries should
be allowed is also positive but only significant at the 10 percent level.


                                                       15
phenomenon, in which support for the current government surges in response to some sort of

crisis, although their focus has been on military or diplomatic crises (Mueller 1973; MacKuen

1983; Brody 1991; Kuijpers 2019). According to Chowanietz (2011, p. 676) this phenomenon

may be a "patriotic reflex" in response to crises that affect the entire nation. 24 Brody and

Shapiro (1989) and Brody (1991) argue that the rallying effect is more likely to occur when there

is a dearth of information about the nature of the crisis and opposition leaders are therefore

obliged to withhold criticism. In the next section, we provide evidence of rally-around-the-flag

responses at the country-round level.



5. SEPARATE ESTIMATES BY COUNTY-ROUND PAIR

           The estimates reported thus far have been based on a pooled sample, potentially masking

important heterogeneity. In Tables 5-9, we report separate estimates of 1 from Equation (2) for

each country-round pair in our analysis using 4-week bandwidths. Using two-week bandwidths

produced similar results and are reported in Appendix Tables A5-A9. 25




24
  For more information on rally-around-flag effects, see, for instance, Chowanietz (2010) who examined
181 terror attacks occurring in five countries (UK, France, Germany, Spain, USA) during the period
1990-2006. Chowanietz (2010) found that terror attacks were associated with sharp reductions in
criticisms of the government by the opposition party and media, which he viewed as evidence of a
rallying effect. Brody and Shapiro (1989) found that "elite" criticism of the U.S. government declined in
the week following revelations concerning the Iran-Contra scandal in 1986. Analyzing data from 10
OECD countries, Kuijpers (2019) found that the popularity of the governing party increased with
casualties during the first year of military interventions.
25
     Month-of-year fixed effects are not included in these regressions due to lack of variation.


                                                       16
5.1. Terror attacks in Spain.

        In the top panel of Table 5 (Panel A), we focus on two, small-scale fatal terror attacks

carried out by the Basque Fatherland and Freedom (ETA) movement when Round 1 of the ESS

was in the field. In the first attack occurred on December 17, 2002 and the second occurred on

February 8, 2003. These attacks, each of which resulted in the death of a police officer, seem to

have reduced trust in the parliament and satisfaction with the national government among

Spanish ESS participants. The relevant estimates of 1 are statistically significant and sizeable.

Trust in the parliament was, on average, 0.770 lower in the post-attack period as compared to the

pre-attack period (or 16 percent of the mean); satisfaction with the national government was

0.701 lower (or 17 percent of the mean).

        In the bottom panel of Table 5 (Panel B), we turn our attention to a bombing at the

Madrid airport that occurred when Round 3 of the ESS was in the field. This attack, carried out

by ETA, killed two bystanders and wounded 12. It does not seem to have affected trust in

parliament or satisfaction with the national government, but attitudes towards immigrants seem

to have hardened in the aftermath. 26 Overall, it is difficult to discern a clear, systematic pattern

to how Spaniards reacted to being attacked by ETA. The results reported in Table 5 suggest that

each attack elicited distinct reactions, perhaps driven by the particular circumstances of the

attack and the steps taken by the Spanish government in the aftermath.




26
   The attack is associated with a 0.151 increase in the belief that fewer immigrants of different
race/ethnicity should be allowed, which is 6 percent of the mean response (2.54). It is also associated
with a 0.159 increase in the belief that fewer immigrants from poorer countries should be allowed, which
is 6 percent of the mean response (2.50).


                                                   17
5.2. Terror attacks in France.

        France experienced a series of 5 terror attacks between December 20, 2014 and January

9, 2015, when Round 7 of the ESS was in the field. Among them, was the attack on the offices

of the satirical weekly magazine Charlie Hebdo, in which 12 people were killed and 11

wounded. The Charlie Hebdo attack received intense national and international press coverage

and was followed by a sharp rise in anti-Islamic incidents in France (Mondon and Winter 2016;

Mechai 2015).

        In the top panel of Table 6 (Panel A), we examine the effect of these attacks on political

attitudes among French ESS respondents. Similar to the affected-region estimates discussed

above (and reported in Table 4), trust in parliament increased by 0.707 in the post-attack period

as compared to the pre-attack period; likewise, there was an 0.828 increase in satisfaction with

the national government. 27 These estimates suggest that high-profile terror attacks that result in

a substantial number of casualties appreciably strengthen faith in government institutions, at least

in the short run.

        The attack on French soil during Round 8 was small-scale (only one person was killed)

and the perpetrator is still unknown. There is no evidence that it appreciably altered political

attitudes (Table 6, Panel B). By contrast, the mass shooting by jihadi-inspired extremists at the

Strasbourg Christmas market on December 11, 2018 (while in Round 9 of the ESS was in the

field) resulted in 5 deaths, received a great deal of press coverage, and anecdotally caused great



27
   These estimated effects are sizeable. The attacks are associated with an increase in trust in parliament
of 18 percent relative to the mean (0.707/3.972 = 0.178), and an increase of 28 percent in satisfaction with
the national government relative to the mean (0.828/2.93 = 0.283). The attack is also associated with a
0.427 increase in how much trust French respondents had in the European Parliament, or an 11 percent
relative to the mean (0.427/3.959 = 0.108). Consistent with the results of Silva (2018), who also used
data from the ESS to examine the effects of the Charlie Hebdo shootings, we find little evidence that the
attack affected French attitudes towards immigrants.
                                                    18
anxiety among the French (Rubin and Breeden 2018). It does not, however, appear to have

affected political attitudes: the estimates of 1 based on French ESS participants interviewed

before and after this attack are consistently insignificant and small in magnitude (Table 6, Panel

C).



5.3. Terror attacks in the United Kingdom.

       The United Kingdom terror attacks used in our analysis were perpetrated by the New

Irish Republican Army (IRA) or the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA). Specifically, three

attacks took place in Northern Ireland, each resulting in the death of a single civilian. Panel A of

Table 7 shows estimates of 1 for the two attacks that happened in quick succession during

Round 6; Panels B and C of Table 7 show estimates of 1 for the other two attacks. There is no

evidence of post-attack changes in how much trust British respondents had in parliament or how

much satisfaction they had with the national government. After the attack on October 20, 2016

(during Round 8 of the ESS), there was an increase of 0.097 in the belief that fewer immigrants

should be allowed in the country, but there is no evidence of a similar change in attitudes

towards immigrants after the other attacks.



5.4. Terror attacks in the Netherlands

       On November 2, 2004, the filmmaker Theo van Gogh was shot and decapitated by a

member of a jihadist group, while Round 2 of the ESS was in the field. This attack received

worldwide attention and inspired a series of attacks on mosques in the Netherlands (Finseraas et

al. 2011). We also have responses from Round 4 of the ESS before and after a car attack on the




                                                 19
Dutch royal family. This latter attack occurred on May 1, 2009 and killed 5 festival-goers. The

motives of the perpetrator are still unknown.

       We find a significant decrease among Dutch respondents in the belief that immigrants

make the country better after the murder of Theo van Gogh (Panel A, Table 8). Specifically, our

estimate of 1 is -0.398, or 8 percent of the mean (4.974). The van Gogh murder also appears to

have increased trust in the Dutch parliament as well as trust in the European Parliament, a pattern

of results that is consistent with what happened after the Charlie Hebdo shootings. There is no

evidence that the May 1, 2009 attack affected political attitudes (Panel C, Table 8).



5.5 Terror attacks in Germany and Sweden

       Panel A of Table 9 reports estimates of 1 for two attacks that took place in Germany

during Round 8 of the ESS. On October 16 of 2016, a 16-year-old was stabbed to death in

Hamburg. Approximately two months later, a truck was driven by a jihadi-inspired extremist

into a Berlin Christmas market, leaving 12 bystanders dead and more than 50 injured. Despite

the large number of fatalities and intense press coverage (Grieshaber 2016; Hjelmgaard 2016;

Stack 2016), these attacks do not seem to have appreciably affected political attitudes among

Germans.

       Finally, we examine effects on political attitudes in Sweden after an attack carried out

while Round 5 of the ESS was in the field. On December 11, 2010, a suicide bomber affiliated

with Iraqi extremists attacked a shopping center in Stockholm. Although nobody aside from the

bomber was killed, there was a statistically significant and sizeable increase how much trust

respondents had in parliament (Table 9, Panel B); there is also evidence of an increase in the

belief that immigrants make the country a better place in the post-attack period.



                                                20
5. CONCLUSION

       This study provides the first comprehensive, multi-country examination of the effects of

terror attacks on political opinions and attitudes. Previous studies examining the relationship

between terror attacks and similar outcomes have focused on a single event or country and, as a

consequence, it is not clear whether their results are generalizable. By comparing within-country

responses to the European Social Survey in the weeks before and after terror attacks, we produce

arguably causal estimates uncontaminated by secular trends, economic conditions, and other

political/social movements and events.

       Our results provide little support for the hypothesis that terror attacks involving at least

one fatality appreciably shift attitudes towards immigration. With only a few exceptions, the

estimated effects on immigrant-related outcomes are small and statistically insignificant.

Although we do observe modest post-attack changes in attitudes towards government

institutions, these estimated effects are confined to the region in which the attack occurred and

they are positive: i.e., experiencing a fatal terror attack is associated with increases in how much

trust respondents have in their parliament and how much satisfaction they have with the national

government. It is possible that these estimates reflect a rally-around-the-flag phenomenon, in

which support for the current government surges in response to some sort of national crisis

(Mueller 1973; MacKuen 1983; Brody 1991; Chowanietz 2011).

       Finally, when we focus on specific, high-profile attacks, such the Charlie Hebdo

shootings in France and the murder of filmmaker Theo van Gogh, we uncover evidence of

nationwide rally-around-the-flag effects. Specifically, there was a substantial increase in how

much trust French respondents had in their parliament after the Charlie Hebdo shootings.


                                                 21
Likewise, there were substantial increases in how much trust Dutch ESS respondents had in their

own parliament and in the European Parliament after the murder of Theo van Gogh. By contrast,

a high-profile attack on a Christmas market perpetrated by a jihadi-inspired extremist does not

seem to have appreciably affected political attitudes among Germans.

       In recent decades, support for European nationalistic and anti-immigration parties has

been on the rise, with nationalistic parties increasing their vote shares in prominent Western

European countries such as Germany, France, and the United Kingdom (Holleran 2018).

Although observers have speculated that this trend is directly connected to terrorism (Smale and

Castle 2016; Fekete 2018; Roth 2018; Turak 2018; Neumann 2019), our results provide no

evidence that terror attacks substantially contributed to the changing political views of

Europeans.

*Statistically significant at 10% level; ** at 5% level; *** at 1% level.

Notes: Based on individual-level data from the European Social Surveys (ESS). Each coefficient estimate (and its standard error, which is reported in parentheses) is from a separate
OLS regression where the dependent variable is equal to respondent i's level of agreement with the relevant question. Standard errors are corrected for clustering at the country-
round level. Sample sizes are reported in brackets. The two-week bandwidth sample includes respondents interviewed 1-14 days before the first attack during the survey period and
those interviewed 0-13 days after the last attack. The 4-week bandwidth sample includes respondents interviewed 1-28 days before the first attack during the survey period and
those interviewed 0-27 days after the last attack. Post attack is equal to 1 if the respondent was interviewed on or after the day of the attack (and is equal to 0 otherwise).
Regressions include country-by-round fixed effects and month-of-year fixed effects.

Notes: Based on individual-level data from the European Social Surveys (ESS). Each coefficient estimate (and its standard error, which is reported in parentheses) is from a separate
OLS regression where the dependent variable is equal to respondent i's level of agreement with the relevant question. Standard errors are corrected for clustering at the country-
round level. Sample sizes are reported in brackets. The two-week bandwidth sample includes respondents interviewed 1-14 days before the first attack during the survey period and
those interviewed 0-13 days after the last attack. The 4-week bandwidth sample includes respondents interviewed 1-28 days before the first attack during the survey period and
those interviewed 0-27 days after the last attack. Post attack is equal to 1 if the respondent was interviewed on or after the day of the attack (and is equal to 0 otherwise).
Regressions include country-by-round and month-of-year fixed effects, respondents' age, gender, years education, an indicator for living in an urban area, an indicator for minority
status, and an indicator for respondent coping at current income level.

Notes: Based on individual-level data from the European Social Surveys (ESS), Rounds 4-9. Each coefficient estimate (and its standard error, which is reported in parentheses) is
from a separate OLS regression where the dependent variable is equal to respondent i's level of agreement with the relevant question. Huber-White robust standard errors are
reported in parentheses. Sample sizes are reported in brackets. The sample includes respondents interviewed 1-28 days before the first attack during the survey period and those
interviewed 0-27 days after the last attack. Post attack is equal to 1 if the respondent was interviewed on or after the day of the attack (and is equal to 0 otherwise). Region is equal
to 1 if the respondent lived in a NUTS (level 1) region attacked during the survey period. Regressions include country-by-round and month-of-year fixed effects, respondents' age,
gender, years education, an indicator for living in an urban area, an indicator for minority status, and an indicator for respondent coping at current income level.
