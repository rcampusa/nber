This paper uses an RCT to estimate the impact of PROBEMS, a scholarship program in Mexico
aimed at improving graduation rates and test scores among upper secondary school students from
poor backgrounds. We find that, on average, the program has no impact either on graduation rates
or on Math and Spanish test scores. We identify two possible reasons for this failure: a. the
program was badly targeted, with many of the recipients being from less disadvantaged families
than intended; b) many eligible students did not have a sufficiently strong academic
achievement that would allow them to productively attend and complete successfully the
academic requirements of upper secondary school. This points to accumulated achievement
deficits that could be addressed by interventions targeting learning at an earlier stage.

1    Introduction

Improving high school or upper secondary graduation rates for children from lower income
backgrounds is often seen as important for offering access to opportunity and improving
intergenerational mobility. Indeed, in many circumstances low attendance is an impor-
tant issue of economic efficiency and has implications for aggregate economic growth
((Hanushek and Woessmann 2012), (WorldBank 2018)). As such it has motivated policy
in numerous countries, where financial support is offered for upper secondary attendance
that goes beyond providing tuition free. The underlying reason that is often cited is that
certain high ability but low SES students are liquidity constrained, which generates a
wealth gradient in attendance even conditional on ability ((Abbott et al. 2019), (Belley
and Lochner 2007)). Such liquidity constraints can arise both because parents may be
reluctant to fund education when they are unlikely to be repaid and/or because willing
parents are themselves poor and constrained in their ability to fund their children's edu-
cation. This can imply that children with potentially high returns do not obtain enough
schooling. Both from efficiency and equity considerations, targeting such programs ap-
propriately is likely to be of first-order importance.

In light of such arguments, the Mexican government introduced a new scholarship program
in 2007 (PROBEMS) targeted to poor upper secondary students, with the objective of
increasing graduation rates as well as learning outcomes. As there was excess demand
from eligible students for such a program, the scholarships were allocated through a lottery
system in 2009. Based on this randomization, we estimate the impact of the intervention
on beneficiary students' probability of graduation and on their test scores at the end of
upper secondary (2012).

The main result we obtain is that the scholarship program had no effects either on upper
secondary graduation rates or on performance in the standardized test. However, to
better understand the mechanisms behind the results of the exercise, one has to take into
account a variety of factors, ranging from different motivations for school enrollment, to
the possibility of heterogeneous effects in different groups of the population.



                                              2
This surprising result could be due to miss-targeting of the program. As a result of such
a conditional transfer we would expect two different groups to increase their graduation
rates: those who have high net returns but are liquidity constrained and those who have
low net returns and would not have enrolled in upper secondary (optimally) but because
of the conditionality are incentivized to do so. If the program is badly targeted and
liquidity constraints are not an issue the question remains whether we can expect an
impact (albeit possibly inefficient) from those whose net returns become positive as a
result of the transfer. While this may be the case, many of these children may have been
unprepared for the relative rigors of upper secondary either because of earlier low quality
of education or because of low effort in anticipation of dropping out.

To try to better understand the absence of an impact, we obtain estimates of the effects of
the intervention for different groups of youths, divided on the basis of their socioeconomic
background, their motivation at baseline and their academic readiness. Our results show
that most of the impacts for different groups are not significantly different from zero. Even
among the poorest students and among highly motivated ones­proxied by the highest
education level they expect to achieve the scholarship was ineffective. The only subgroup
of students where the scholarship had a positive and significant impact on the probability
of graduation were those with relatively high initial test scores. For students at the top
tercile of the test score distribution at baseline, being awarded a scholarship increases the
probability of graduation by 4 percentage points.

One possible interpretation of the results we find is that individuals from extremely poor
backgrounds are at a disadvantage which is not exclusively economic. It might be that
their set of basic skills presents important deficiencies that cannot be alleviated by a schol-
arship. It may also be that they lack the confidence in their own academic skills or that
they perceive the returns from upper secondary education to be low. An alternative and
possibly more productive use of public resources would be to fill in the skills and knowl-
edge gap among poor and less poor students before upper secondary, possibly improving
the education these youths receive in primary and junior high school. A remediation
program at the start of upper secondary (or during the summer between lower and upper
secondary), providing basic skills to kids from marginalized backgrounds could be a more

                                              3
effective use of the resources devoted to PROBEMS.

The rest of the paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we discuss the Mexican context
and describe the intervention. In particular, in Section 2.1, we discuss the upper secondary
or high school system in Mexico, Section 2.2 describes the PROBEMS scholarship system,
including the trends in number of beneficiaries. Section 3 describes the evaluation design,
the baseline and follow-up data. Section 4 presents the main results. Section 5 presents
a discussion of some of the reasons that explain the lack of effects of the intervention.
Finally, Section 6 concludes with the policy implications of the results.


2         Context and Intervention

Mexico, like other middle-income countries, has reached almost universal enrollment rates
in primary school (grades 1 to 6) and lower secondary school (grades 7 to 9) school. How-
ever, its education system still faces important challenges, especially in upper secondary
school. For instance, around 35 of every 100 students who enroll in upper secondary will
never graduate. Among those who graduated from high school in 2015, more than 60%
attained insufficient levels in math according to the national standardized test, Planea
((INEE 2017b)).1 Many of the students dropping out or finishing high school but with
insufficient skills come from poor or marginalized households. Therefore, upper secondary
education dropouts and low achievement levels have important implications for Mexico's
long-term economic growth and income disparities ((de Hoyos et al. 2016)).


2.1        Upper Secondary Education in Mexico

The upper secondary education system in Mexico (EMS for its acronym in Spanish)
consists of 4.9 million students, typically between 15 to 18 years old, in grades 10th, 11th
and 12th. The EMS system is large and complex with several service providers and types
of degree programs. EMS is offered by four different providers: 1) the federal government
(accounting for 21.8% of total enrollment), 2) the state governments (47.4%), 3) publicly
financed autonomous universities (12.3%), and 4) private entities. EMS offers three types

                                                  4
of degree programs: general ­ preparing students for higher education, technological ­
preparing students both for the labor market and for higher education, and technical ­
emphasizing technical and vocational education (INEE 2017a)).

Although graduation rates and learning outcomes in EMS have experienced an improve-
ment during the last 10 years, their levels are consistently low (see Figure 1). According
to the official statistics from Mexico's National Institute for the Evaluation of Education
(INEE for its acronym in Spanish),2 in 2014 only 67% of students graduated three years
after enrolling in EMS, with this share being significantly higher among females (70%)
than males (62%). Graduation rates vary across types of degree programs with general
schools showing the highest (69%), followed by technological schools with rates very close
to the national average and technical schools showing the lowest (54%). According to
INEE, more than 60% of the cumulative dropouts throughout the three years of EMS
take place during the first year. Household survey data show that enrollment in EMS
among youths aged 15 to 18 varies substantially across household income deciles. For
instance, in 2012, only 13.5 percent of youth aged 15 to 18 in the poorest households were
enrolled in EMS versus an enrollment rate of 95 percent among the richest households.
The disparity in enrollment rates across the distribution raises the question of whether
liquidity constraints have an important role to play. Moreover, information from the 2011
EMS School Dropout Survey shows that more than a third of the 2,549 EMS dropouts sur-
veyed declared that economic constraints were the main reason for leaving school ((SEP
2012)).

The EMS system is characterized by strict promotion criteria. Students must pass five of
eight disciplinary subject areas and practical modules. Otherwise they have to repeat the
semester. Students who fail three or fewer subject areas can enroll in the next semester,
but they have to attend and pass intensive courses (the so-called regularizacion ) during
a fixed time window. In addition, students must satisfactorily complete all their subject
areas and modules within 10 semesters after enrolling in EMS, otherwise they lose the
right to re-enroll. Partly as a result of the strict promotion rules, there are very high grade
and subject repetition rates, 15.3 percent and 31.3 percent, respectively in 2013.3


2.2     The PROBEMS Scholarship Program

In the context of a major EMS curricular reform4 , with the aim of reducing school dropouts
and improving learning outcomes, in 2007 the Secretariat of Public Education (SEP for
its acronym in Spanish) introduced a new scholarship program, PROBEMS. The pro-
gram targeted poor EMS students mostly in urban areas since, at the time, a national
conditional cash transfer program, Progresa /Oportunidades later renamed as Prospera,
already benefited poor EMS students in rural areas.5 The number of beneficiaries under

     Students who fail three or more subjects for two consecutive semesters have to repeat the entire
grade.

     The conditional cash transfer program has since then expanded to many urban areas.

                                                                               6
PROBEMS increased substantially between 2007 and 2014, from less than 300,000 to
almost 900,000 (see Graph 2), representing 23% of the total enrollment in EMS in 2014.
The budget assigned to the program in 2014, the year when PROBEMS had the largest
number of beneficiaries, was close to US $410 million, representing 23% of the total EMS
federal budget, excluding salaries.

PROBEMS had three different types of scholarships: "support", "retention" and "excel-
lence". The difference between the three types of scholarships was determined by the
grade point average (GPA) during the year prior to applying to the program (the last
year of lower secondary in the case of candidates about to enter EMS). The "excellence"
scholarship required a minimum GPA of 9 out of 10, "retention" a GPA between 8 and 8.9
and a minimum GPA of 6 (the passing mark) was required under the "support" modality.
To incentivize students' efforts, monthly transfers were marginally larger under the "ex-
cellence" modality than under the "retention" modality and this was marginally larger
than the transfer under the "support" modality. Transfers also varied between gender,
grade and type of degree program. Table 1 shows the monthly transfer in 2009 under
the different modalities, by grades and gender. The overall average monthly transfer of
a PROBEMS scholarship was $716 MX or $56 US dollars in 2009, slightly less than the

PROBEMS' operating rules in 2009, the year when the lottery took place, defined the
following eligibility criteria to be considered as a potential beneficiary:

   1. Be enrolled in a public EMS school.

   2. Applicants who were about to enter EMS, were required to present their lower
       secondary graduation certificate. Students continuing EMS studies, were required
       to have a pass mark in all subject areas of the previous semester.

   3. Not be enrolled in any other government program providing scholarships.

   4. Have a household per capita income below the "assets" poverty line defined by
       CONEVAL as $1,413 MX and $2,102 per person, per month for households located
       in rural and urban areas, respectively.

   5. Apply for a PROBEMS scholarship through the program's portal.7
   6
     In 2009 the National Council of Social Policy Evaluation (CONEVAL) defined three poverty lines in
Mexico: "food intake" (pobreza alimentaria) or extreme poverty line, "capabilities" (pobreza de capaci-
dades) and "assets" (pobreza patrimonial), with values of $949 MX, $1,164 MX, and $1,905 MX, per
person, per month, respectively.

To assign the PROBEMS scholarships, SEP issues one and sometimes two calls for ap-
plications per year depending on budget availability. The call for applications is usually
issued in March of each year, targeting students starting or continuing EMS in the fol-
lowing academic year (August). Interested candidates start their application process by
filling in a form capturing household income, the availability of household assets, parents'
education and basic academic information such as the school and grade of enrollment.
All applicants must have a personal identifier known as the CURP, issued by the Gov-
ernment of Mexico.8 SEP uses the CURP to identify applicants who are beneficiaries of
the conditional cash transfer program (PROGRESA / Oportunidades) at the time of ap-
plying, which automatically excludes them from PROBEMS. The self-declared household
income and assets information included in the on-line application format is used to rank
students in terms of their likelihood of being below the "assets" poverty line. Finally, as
stated by the call for applications, SEP gives priority to first-year EMS students. The
likelihood of being poor, budget availability and EMS grade of enrollment determined a
list of pre-selected candidates.

When a candidate is pre-selected­usually one month after the call for applications is closed,
he or she is notified by email with instructions on how to complete the application process.
The next step is to enroll in EMS or continue to the second or third grade, and present,
at the school, all the relevant documentation to validate the information uploaded in the
program's portal. School directors receive the list of pre-selected candidates via email
and are responsible for validating the information provided by the candidates through
the program's portal. In particular, the school director has to validate that the student
is indeed enrolled in his or her school, that the student has no subject areas of previous
semesters below the passing mark, and validate the GPA as declared by the student.
Once the school director validates the information, the candidates receive a second email
notifying them that they have been awarded a scholarship. SEP issues debit cards under
the name of the beneficiary. As a final step the student, together with their father, mother
or legal guardian, collects the debit card at the closest branch of the commercial bank

3       Evaluation Design

Our evaluation strategy relies on the random assignment into the program. The call
for applications in March 2009 received close to 70,000 valid applications of which more
than 50,000 of them fulfilled the eligibility criteria. However, SEP's budget was enough
for awarding between 40,000 to 45,000 scholarships, depending on the distribution by
type of scholarship. Thus, for the purposes of evaluation SEP authorized a randomized
assignment of the scholarship in a pre-selected eligible population of 12,000 students: 6,000
students were randomly selected to be part of the treatment group and the same number
formed the control group. All 12,000 students received an email from SEP at the end of
April 2009 notifying them that they were granted or rejected a scholarship according to the
random assignment. PROBEMS is assigned on a per-year basis, therefore the compliance
with the random assignment was only valid for one school year, so all students, treatments
and controls, could apply to receive a scholarship in the call for applications in March
2010.

Since PROBEMS prioritized first-year EMS students, 60% of the eligible candidates were
completing lower secondary (9th grade) while submitting their application in March 2009.
Therefore 3,648 students in the treatment and 3,673 in the control group, respectively, were
about to start EMS in August of 2009. For the purposes of this paper, we will concentrate
on this subsample. Focusing on first-year students and following them through the three
school years of EMS, estimates the impact of one year of exposure to the program at
the beginning of EMS, versus not having this monetary support, on graduation rates and
learning outcomes measured by the standardized test ENLACE in 12th grade.

Figure 3 presents a timeline of the evaluation design including the important dates:

  3. Candidates were informed of the outcome of their application in April 2009.

  4. The national standardized test ENLACE 9th grade was applied to all students
      finishing lower secondary in May 2009.

  5. To receive the scholarship, school directors of first-year treatment students had to
      validate all the information provided during the application between August and
      end of September 2009.

  6. A new call for applications was issued in March 2010 and all students, regardless of
      their treatment status could apply.

  7. The national standardized test ENLACE 12th grade was applied to all students
      finishing EMS in May 2012 and May 2013. These are the administrative data used
      to measure the outcome variables: graduation rates and math and Spanish test
      scores.

3.1    Evaluation Data

In order to measure students' characteristics at baseline, we use two sources. First, we
rely on the form completed by all applicants in March 2009, through the PROBEMS
portal. This survey included self-reported information on household income, education

                                            11
of parents, number of family members living in the same household, the availability of
household assets as well as gender, age, geographic location and GPA of the applicant,
among others.

Second, to measure students' ability at baseline, we use the information from the census-
based ENLACE 9th grade, measuring math and language achievement levels. From 2007
to 2013, ENLACE was administered to all students in 3rd to 9th grades and those finishing
12th grade. The test had no consequences either on graduation or on student's GPA. The
score of ENLACE is normalized to have a mean of 500 and a standard deviation of
100.

Using the CURP we were able to merge the baseline application format with the micro
data from ENLACE 9th grade which was taken by applicants in May 2009. For ease of
exposition and interpretation, when presenting the results, we renormalize the ENLACE
results to a mean of zero and a standard deviation of 1. Table 2 shows the baseline
characteristics, distinguishing between students in the treatment and the control groups.
In the top panel we report the socioeconomic characteristics measured through the baseline
format completed by all applicants, in the bottom panel the administrative information
on 9th grade test scores. Overall, the characteristics of the treatment and control groups
are well balanced in line with the randomized design of the evaluation.

Outcome variables are measured through ENLACE 12th grade administered in May 2012
to all students finishing EMS. Additionally, our evaluation sample was also merged with
ENLACE 12th grade of 2013 to identify students that graduated from high school but
that had a lag of one year. The participation of students in our sample, who entered EMS
in August 2009, in ENLACE 12th grade of 2012 or 2013 is used as a proxy for upper
secondary graduation.9 The same end-of-secondary-school test is also used to measure
the impact of PROBEMS scholarship on math and Spanish test scores.
   9
    In what follows, when we refer to ENLACE 12th grade, which includes the information from the
tests administered in 2012 and 2013. Of the total 7,321 students in our evaluation sample, 4,978 where
identified in ENLACE 12th grade of 2012, a proxy for on-time graduation. An additional 262 students
were identified in ENLACE 12th grade of 2013, these students also graduated but with a lag of one year.
So most of the effects on outcome "graduation" are, indeed, on-time graduation. For a discussion on
the reliability of this measure as a proxy for EMS graduation, see (Dustan et al. 2017), (Avitabile and
de Hoyos 2018).

3.2    Empirical Strategy

To estimate the causal impact of providing a PROBEMS scholarship to first-year EMS
students on education outcomes, we estimate the following equation:



                                 Yi = 0 + 1 Di +  Xi + ui                                  (1)

where Yi is either the presence of student i in ENLACE 12th grade or his or her test score
recorded in ENLACE. Di is an indicator dummy that takes the value 1 if student i is
assigned to the treatment group, 0 otherwise. 1 measures the intention-to-treat effect of
the scholarship on education outcomes. Xi is a vector of baseline covariates measured at
the individual level and includes age and gender of the student, math and Spanish test
scores in 9th grade ENLACE, a dummy controlling for rural areas of the school where the
student attended 9th grade, regional dummies and self-declared household income and
the availability of household assets.

We standardize all test scores using the mean and the standard deviation observed in the
control group. In order to address the inference issues related to the presence of multiple
learning outcomes, we consider the effect on a composite score, defined by the simple
average of the standardized scores in math and Spanish. When we consider multiple
separate hypotheses, we compute stepdown p-values that correct for multiple hypothesis
testing based on the method by (Romano and Wolf 2005).


4     Results
4.1    Education Outcomes

The main results of the paper are summarized in Table 3. We present the effects of
PROBEMS on four education outcomes: EMS graduation­proxied by students present in
the standardized test ENLACE 12th grade­math test scores, Spanish test scores, and a
simple average of math and Spanish scores. We ran two specifications for each of these
four outcomes, one without controls and a second one including the controls as defined
above. Regardless of the specification, we do not find statistically significant effects of the

                                              14
PROBEMS scholarships on any of the four education outcomes. All the effects are very
small and not statistically different from zero, even though our sample is large enough to
detect small impacts.

The large sample of our evaluation allows for the analysis of heterogeneous effects of the
scholarships. It could be that the overall effect is zero but some particular groups did ex-
perience an improvement in education outcomes as a result of the cash transfer.10 Tables
A1 and A2 in Appendix A show the effects of the PROBEMS scholarship on graduation
rates by age, rural versus urban, gender and geographical region. The scholarships did not
increase either girls' or boys' probability of graduating. It also did not have any impact
among students enrolled in rural or urban lower secondary schools at the time of applying
to the scholarship. The only effect that is significant (p-value=0.06) is among slightly
older candidates, those who were 16 years old at the time of applying for the scholarship.
Among this population subgroup­who have a significantly lower probability of graduating
compared to younger students­PROBEMS is increasing the probability of graduation by
4 percentage points, on a mean graduation rate of 62%. Table A2 also in Appendix A,
  10
    By using stepdown p-values adjusted for multiple testing, we avoid the pitfalls of data mining that
could lead us to false positives from such heterogeneity analysis.

presents the effects by geographical region showing zero impact of the scholarship in the
5 regions defined. Although not presented here, the lack of statistically significant effects
on graduation rates by age, area, sex and region hold for math and Spanish test scores.




5     Why are PROBEMS scholarships ineffective?

It is possible that the lack of effects of the scholarships on education outcomes is the result
of poor targeting, poor students' motivation, weak academic conditions among scholarship
recipients or a combination of these. In this section, we perform further analysis to identify
the effects of these three potential explanations behind the lack of impact of the scholarship
program.


5.1    Targeting

To test if poor targeting explains the lack of effects of the scholarships, we rely on in-
formation from the PROBEMS application portal to compute an index of self-declared
household assets. The index of household assets (IHA) is the sum of four variables, indi-
cating, respectively, the following basic characteristics of the dwelling: (1) concrete floors,
(2) running water inside the house, (3) toilets connected to sewerage, and (4) concrete
roof. A zero is used to indicate the absence of the amenity and a one its presence. The
IHA index, therefore, has a maximum value of 4 and minimum of 0. The distribution of
the IHA is shown in Figure 4. Few students self-declared that they live in a household
with zero or only one of the basic dwelling characteristics; close to 70% of students have
only two or three of the basic needs met, and 23% of students in our sample declared
living in a household that meets all four basic needs.

To test for heterogenous impacts by socio-economic status the evaluation sample was di-
vided in two groups according the value of the IHA: those with a value of the IHA of 2 or
less and the rest. Table 4 shows the effects of PROBEMS on graduation rates, by socioe-
conomic status in a specification with and without controls. The effects of PROBEMS
are zero, even within the group of more marginalized individuals (IHA of 2 or below).
As a complementary exercise we estimate the effects of PROBEMS among individuals
with a value of the IHA of 0 or 1 (the most marginalized) and the results are shown in
Table A6 in the Appendix. For students with a value of the IHA of zero or one, in the
specification without controls, being awarded a scholarship increases the probability of
graduation by 8 percentage points (p-value of 0.06), on a mean value of 60% among the
control group. However, when the controls are included in the specification, the positive
effect remains but is no longer statistically significant (p-value of 0.104). The lack of
statistically significant effects among the group of poorest students could be explained
by the relatively small number of students with a value of the IHA of 0 or 1 (483). We
also test for heterogenous effects on test scores by different levels of IHA, splitting the
sample as indicated in Table 4 and found very small and statistically insignificant effects.11



To identify how well targeted PROBEMS was, we use the Mexican national household

 survey ENIGH, which measures incomes and expenditures, to identify, self-declared, schol-
 arship holders and divide them between recipients of "Oportunidades" and "other govern-
 ment program". Using ENIGH 201012 we identify households with students enrolled in
 EMS and, among this subsample, those that declared having an "Oportunidades" schol-
 arship or a scholarship from another government program. Figure 5 shows the share
 of scholarship beneficiaries by decile of the distribution of per capita household income.
 Overall, "Oportunidades" scholarships seem to be well-targeted, benefiting the poorest
 EMS students. However, beneficiaries of "other government programs", a category ba-
 sically capturing PROBEMS, tend to be located in deciles 5 to 9 of the income distri-
 bution. The lack of targeting combined with the marginally positive effects among the
 most marginalized suggest that PROBEMS could increase the likelihood of finishing high
 school among the poorest students, but the program's targeting mechanism was not very
 effective in reaching the poorest, or they were already covered by the conditional cash
 transfer program (Oportunidades).

     ENIGH is collected every two years and there was no survey in 2009, the year when PROBEMS
 applicants filled the online format with the socio-economic information.

5.2    Motivation

In this section we test the role played by motivation (or lack thereof) in explaining the
ineffectiveness of the PROBEMS scholarships. A random sample of around 10% of the
ENLACE takers were administered a survey, the so called ENLACE de contexto that
elicits a broad set of information about student sociodemographic characteristics, such
as student effort, family composition and aspirations. We merge the information of the
ENLACE de contexto applied to students in our evaluation sample when they sat for the
ENLACE 9th grade in 2009 to test a student motivation hypothesis.

The merged sample includes only 564 individuals, a sample substantially smaller than
our original one but still well-balanced between treatment and control and showing the
same lack of treatment effects as with the entire sample. Students' motivation is proxied
by the, self-declared, highest degree they expected to achieve, the options being: lower
secondary, EMS, technical higher education, university or postgraduate. Of the students
in our sample, 80% expected to finish, at least, a university degree and 47% expected

to get a postgraduate degree. We classify these two groups as "motivated students" and
"highly motivated students", respectively.

Table 5 shows the results of a specification including, separately, our two definitions
of motivation on EMS graduation and test scores. As expected, motivated and highly
motivated students have a higher probability of graduating and better test scores at the
end of EMS. However, the treatment effect of PROBEMS on graduation and test scores
remains zero in these new specifications and the interaction between the treatment and
motivation is not statistically significant. In other words, even among motivated and
highly motivated students, the scholarship is not relevant for increasing their likelihood
of finishing EMS or obtaining better grades. The results remain when we use the self-
declared hours spent doing homework (from the ENLACE de contexto ) as an alternative
proxy for "motivated students".


5.3    Academic Readiness

We now consider the role of school readiness and whether this can explain the lack of
impact. Academic readiness is measured by the proficiency level at the end of lower sec-

                                                20
ondary (grade 9). We use, separately, math and Spanish results of ENLACE 9th grade
of 2009­the year when the candidates applied for a scholarship­to divide our sample in
terciles of the distribution of test scores. We ran two specifications within each of the
terciles, with and without controls, to measure the effects of the scholarship on the prob-
ability of graduating and test scores at the end of EMS. The effects of PROBEMS on the
probability of graduation, by tercile of the 9th grade math distribution, are summarized
in Table 6.

The results show positive and statistically significant effects (p-value of 0.02) of the schol-
arship on the probability of graduation among those candidates in the top tercile of the
9th grade math test scores distribution (i.e. those with academic readiness ). The in-
clusion of controls does not change the results. For candidates with academic readiness,
receiving a scholarship increases their probability of graduation by 4 percentage points (of
a mean level of 76% among the control group). We found no effects within the lowest and
middle terciles of the 9th grade test scores distribution. There are also no effects of the
scholarships on learning outcomes by tercile of 9th grade math or Spanish test scores.13
Candidates with academic readiness, those at the top tercile of the 9th grade math test
scores, have the largest probability of finishing EMS (76%), as oppose to those in the bot-
tom tercile (57%). It seems that the scholarship is only effective as long as the candidates
have academic readiness, otherwise the requirements of EMS are such that a scholarship
is irrelevant to address this constraint. This is consistent with other school interventions
that seem to build on prior success (Machin, McNally, and Meghir 2010).

In Appendix Table A5, we cross academic readiness with socio-economic status measured
by the IHA. We found that the positive effects of PROBEMS on EMS graduation rates
among students with academic readiness hold both for poor and non-poor households,
but are statistically significant only for non-poor households. The lack of statistically
significant effects among poor students that show academic readiness could be explained
by the relatively low number of poor students in the upper tercile of the 9th grade test
score distribution.

5.4     Interpretation

The results presented here are consistent with other evidence on the effects of scholarships
and conditional cash transfers in EMS education outcomes in Mexico. The most recent ev-
idence identifies the importance of targeting to make scholarships effective. For instance,
(Parker and Vogl 2018) rely on a difference-in-difference estimator to show that young
children exposed to Progresa-Oportunidades, a well-targeted conditional cash transfer
program, increase the likelihood of graduating from EMS. Using administrative data and
a difference-in-difference identification strategy, (Araujo et al. 2018) also show a positive
and significant effect on EMS graduation associated with the expansion of Oportunidades
into urban areas. However, when the cash transfer is not well-targeted it has no effects
on EMS graduation rates, as shown by (Dustan 2018) evaluation of "Prepa Si" a uni-
versal scholarship program for EMS students in Mexico City. (Dustan 2018) also finds
that "Prepa Si" had no impact on test scores measured by the end of upper secondary
ENLACE.



                                                  22
Increasing student motivation by providing monetary incentives linked to math perfor-
mance or information on the returns to high school does not increase EMS graduation
rates, as shown in (Behrman et al. 2015) and (Avitabile and de Hoyos 2018), respec-
tively. These results are in line with those presented here, suggesting that the lack of
effects of PROBEMS scholarships in Mexico is not explained by students' low motivation,
the scholarships are ineffective even among students with higher motivation. However,
our results show that the program's weak targeting mechanism can partly account for
its ineffectiveness, which is consistent with (Dustan 2018), (Parker and Vogl 2018) and
(Araujo et al. 2018). The most important explanation behind PROBEMS' lack of ef-
fects is the large share of first-year EMS students without academic readiness. For 2 of
3 eligible candidates for a scholarship, income is not the binding constraint and therefore
the monetary transfer will not do much to improve their likelihood of graduating from
upper secondary. For the majority of first-year EMS students, the real problem lies in the
profound academic deficiencies that students carry over from basic education.


6       Conclusions

In this paper, we present evidence of the impact of a scholarship program aimed at poor
households with the intention of improving upper secondary school graduation rates and
test scores. The results we obtain show that, by and large, the program was ineffec-
tive.

We explore this negative result in detail, to understand the reasons behind it. We show
that the program was not effectively targeted, as students from poor households were a
minority among its beneficiaries. We also show that the ineffectiveness of the program is
not explained by the lack of students' motivation: the program has no impact both among
students with high and low motivation. Finally, we show that the only positive impact
we find, even after correcting for possible inference biases due to multiple hypothesis
testing, is among students with academic readiness, that is, those students who finish
lower secondary school with relatively good grades.

These results are important not only because they point out the ineffectiveness of PROBEMS,


                                            23
an important and expensive program, but also because they indicate the reasons of such a
result. If the goal of an intervention is to improve educational outcomes of students from
poor families in Mexico, programs such as the one we evaluated have to be complemented
by interventions that improve the quality of education in lower secondary school and,
probably, even earlier in pre-primary and primary school. Only then one can hope to
improve the educational outcomes of poor students by improving graduation and learning
at the upper secondary level.

These results are consistent with other results for Mexico and other low- and middle-
income countries. It has been shown, for instance, that conditional cash transfers improve
enrollment past primary school (and in particular in lower secondary) (see, for instance
(Todd and Wolpin 2006) and (Attanasio, Meghir, and Santiago 2012)). But it is not clear
that the quality of the education these students receive has improved.

Our results suggest that educational interventions would work better if they aimed at
improving quality as well as demand for education. The formation of skills and human
capital, which is important for reducing inequality and the intergenerational transmis-
sion of poverty, are a dynamic process that starts very early in the life cycle, possibly
even before children start formal education. Interventions aimed at secondary education
may only succeed in raising achievement when preceded by interventions aimed at im-
proving the ability of poorer students to take advantage of education opportunity during
adolescence.
