1. INTRODUCTION

       A burgeoning literature finds that financial development exerts a first-order impact on

long-run economic growth. Levine and Zervos (1998) show that banking and stock market

development are good predictors of economic growth. 1 At the microeconomic level, Demirguc-

Kunt and Maksimovic (1998) and Rajan and Zingales (1998) find that financial institutions are

crucial for firm and industrial expansion. While disagreements remain, the bulk of existing

evidence points to a strong finance-growth nexus.

       The finding that financial development influences economic growth raises critical

questions, such as why do some countries have well-developed growth-enhancing financial

systems, while others do not? Why have some countries developed the necessary investor

protection laws and contract-enforcement mechanisms to support financial institutions and

markets, while others have not?

       The law and finance theory focuses on the role of legal institutions in explaining

international differences in financial development (La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Shleifer, and

Vishny, 1997, 1998, 2000a, henceforth LLSV). The first part of the law and finance theory holds

that in countries where legal systems enforce private property rights, support private contractual

arrangements, and protect the legal right of investors, savers are more willing to finance firms

and financial markets flourish. In contrast, legal institutions that neither support private property

rights nor facilitate private contracting inhibit corporate finance and stunt financial development.

       The second part of the law and finance theory emphasizes that the different legal

traditions that emerged in Europe over previous centuries and were spread internationally
                                                           3


through conquest, colonization, and imitation help explain cross-country differences in investor

protection, the contracting environment, and financial development today. More specifically,

legal theories emphasize two inter-related mechanisms through which legal origin influences

finance (Hayek, 1960). The “political” mechanism holds that (a) legal traditions differ in terms

of the priority they attach to private property vis-à-vis the rights of the State and (b) the

protection of private contracting rights forms the basis of fina ncial development (LLSV, 1999).

The “adaptability” mechanism stresses that (a) legal traditions differ in their formalism and

ability to evolve with changing conditions and (b) legal traditions that adapt efficiently to

minimize the gap between the contracting needs of the economy and the legal system’s

capabilities will more effectively foster financial development than more rigid systems

(Merryman, 1985).

         Countervailing theories and evidence challenge both parts of the law and finance theory.

Many researchers accept that effective investor protection facilitates efficient corporate financing

and growth-enhancing financial development, but reject the law and finance’s view that legal

origin is a central determinant of investor protection laws and financial development (Roe, 1994;

Pagano and Volpin, 2001; Rajan and Zingales, 2003). Furthermore, while some scholars accept

the important of legal tradition in shaping the efficiency of financial contracting, there are sharp

disagreements about which legal systems work best to promote the efficient evolution of the law

(Rubin, 1982). Alternatively, some studies directly question the importance of investor

protection laws by arguing that changes in investor protection laws did not drive the evolution of




1
  Furthermore, King and Levine (1993a,b) show that bank development predicts economic growth. Panel
investigations indicate that the relationship between finance and growth is not due to reverse causality (e.g., Beck,
Levine, and Loayza (2000), Levine, Loayza, and Beck (2000), and Beck and Levine (2003). For a review of the
literature, see Levine (1997, 2004).

corporate ownership and financial development in the United Kingdom and Italy (Franks, et al.,

2003; Aganin and Volpin, 2003).

        Given debates about the role of legal institutions in shaping financial development, the

remainder of the Chapter is organized as follows. Section 2 describes the law and finance theory

along with skeptical and competing views.2 Section 3 reviews empirical evidence on both parts

of the law and finance view. That is, we assess (i) whether legal origins account for cross-

country variations in property rights protection, support of private contractual arrangements,

investor protection laws, and financial development and (ii) the degree to which cross-country

differences in investor protection laws explain differences in corporate finance and financial

development. Besides examining supportive and conflicting evidence on these two parts of the

law and finance theory, we also summarize recent findings on the mechanisms – the politics and

adaptability mechanisms -- through which law and finance may be related.




2
  To qualify our approach, however, we recognize that many participants in the law and finance debate may not
agree that the law and finance view is necessarily composed of the two parts mentioned above. This is not crucial for
our review. We simply note that many contributors to the debate on the links between legal institutions and
financial development examine (i) the impact of legal origin on property rights protection, support for private
contractual arrangements, and investor protection laws, (ii) the impact of investor protection laws and their
enforcement on financial development, or (iii) both. This review examines these different components.

2. LEGAL THEORIES OF FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT

       This section describes the law and finance theory. We devote considerable space to

tracing the historical evolution of legal institutions because the law and finance theory stresses

that historically determined differences in legal heritage continue to shape private property rights

protection, investor protection laws, and financial development today. Furthermore, this section

describes two mechanisms through which legal origin may influence the contracting

environment: the political and adaptability mechanisms.          Finally, we review countervailing

views that question the law and finance theory.

Law, Enforcement, and Financial Development

       The first part of the law and finance theory stresses that legal institutions influence

corporate finance and financial development (LLSV, 1998). As LLSV (2000a) emphasize, the

law and finance view follows naturally from the evolution of corporate finance theory during the

past half century. Modigliani and Miller (1958) view debt and equity as legal claims on the cash

flow of firms. Jensen and Meckling (1976) stress that statutory laws and the degree to which

courts enforce those laws shape the types of contracts that are used to address agency problems.

Furthermore, as summarized by Hart (1995), financial economists have increasingly focused on

(i) the control rights that financial securities bring to their owners and (ii) the impact of different

legal rules on corporate control. From this perspective, we may view finance as a set of

contracts.   Thus, a country’s contract, company, bankruptcy, and securities laws, and the

enforcement of these laws fundamentally determine the rights of securities holders and the

operation of financial systems.

       At the firm level, Shleifer and Vishny (1997) note both that inside managers and

controlling shareholder are frequently in a position to expropriate minority shareholders and
                                                  6


creditors and that legal institutions play a crucial role in determining the degree of expropriation.

Expropriation may include theft, as well as transfer pricing, asset stripping, the hiring of family

members, and other “perquisites” that benefit insiders at the expense of minority shareholders

and creditors (LLSV, 2000a).       The law and finance theory emphasizes that cross-country

differences in (i) contract, company, bankruptcy, and securities laws, (ii) the legal systems’

emphasis on private property rights, and (iii) the efficiency of enforcement influence the degree

of expropriation and hence the confidence with which people purchase securities and participate

in financial markets.

       Within the broad vision that legal institutions influence corporate finance and financial

development, there are differing opinions regarding the degree to which the legal system should

simply support private contractual arrangements and the degree to which the legal system should

have specific laws concerning shareholder and creditor rights. Coasians hold that the legal

system should simply enforce private contracts. Effective legal institutions allow knowledgeable

and experienced financial market participants to design a vast array of sophisticated private

contracts to ameliorate complex agency problems (Coase, 1960; Stigler, 1964; Easterbrook and

Fischel, 1991). For this to work effectively, however, courts must enforce private contracts

impartially and have both the ability and willingness to read complex contracts and verify

technically intricate clauses that trigger specific actions (Glaeser, et al., 2001, p. 853). Given the

difficulty in enforcing complex private contracts, there are potential advantages to developing

company, bankruptcy, and securities laws that provide a framework for organizing financial

transactions and protecting minority shareholders and creditors. While standardization may

improve efficiency by lowering the transactions costs associated with many financial market

contracts, the imposition of too rigid a framework may curtail customization and thereby hinder
                                                          7


efficient contracting. 3 Whether assuming a Coasian reliance on enforcing complex private

contracts or an approach that augments the support of private contracts with company,

bankruptcy, securities laws, etc., the law and finance view’s first part argues that the degree of

protection of private investors is a crucial determinant of financial development.



The Historical Development of Europe’s Legal Systems

         The second part of the law and finance theory stresses that a country’s legal heritage

shapes its approach to property rights, private contracting, investor protection, and hence

financial development. Comparative legal scholars note that the world’s major legal families

were formed in Europe over many centuries and then spread internationally. Thus, we begin our

discussion with Roman law.

         Hayek (1960) notes that when Emperor Justinian had the Roman law compiled in the

sixth century, he attempted to implement two substantive modifications. First, while Roman law

placed the law above all individuals, the Justinian texts placed the emperor above the law.

Second, Justinian broke with Roman law by attempting to eliminate jurisprudence. Roman law

had developed over centuries on a case-by-case basis, adjusting from the needs of a small farmer

community to the needs of a world empire with only a minor role left for formal legislation.

Justinian changed this doctrine and “… asserted for himself a monopoly, not only over all law-

making power, but over legal interpretations.” (Dawson, 1968, p.22). This “Justinian deviation”

did not take root; jurisprudence continued to shape the law.




3
  There may exist complex tradeoffs between law-making and enforcement conducted by the courts versus
regulation. One difference is that courts enforce the law reactively, while regulators enforce laws proactively. For
analyses of the conditions under which these different approaches work best, see Glaeser, Johnson, and Shleifer
(2001) and Pistor and Xu (2002).
                                                        8


        From the 15th century, France’s legal system evolved as a regionally diverse mélange of

customary law, law based on the Justinian texts, and case law (Dawson, 1968, p. 349). Three

observations are notable. First France had a very fragmented legal system. 4 Second, although

courts must have debated the appropriate application of conflicting Roman and customary law as

new circumstances emerged, these deliberations generally occurred in private and without the

same public, scholarly debates seen in Germany or England (Dawson, 1968, p. 286-302). Third,

by the 18th century, there was a notable deterioration in the integrity and prestige of the judiciary.

The Crown sold judgeships to rich families and the judges unabashedly promoted the interests of

the elite and impeded progressive reforms. 5

        Unsurprisingly, the French Revolution turned its fury on the judiciary and quickly strove

to (a) place the State above the courts and (b) eliminate jurisprudence.6 Codification under

Napoleon supported the unification and strengthening of the State and relegated judges to a

minor, bureaucratic role. According to the theory underlying the French Civil Code, the

legislature drafts laws without gaps, so judges do not make law by interpreting existing laws.

The theory is that the legislature does not draft conflicting laws, so that judges do not make law

by choosing between laws. The theory is that the legislature drafts clear laws so that judges do

not make law by giving meaning to ambiguous laws. Like Justinian, Napoleon sought a code that

was so clear, complete, and coherent that there would be no need for judges to deliberate

publicly about which laws, customs, and past experiences apply to new, evolving situations. 7


4
  Voltaire mocked it by writing, “When you travel in this Kingdom, you change legal systems as often as you
change horses.” (Quoted from Zweigert and Kötz, 1998, p. 80)
5
  See, Dawson (1968, p. 373). Also, while the Crown at times issued progressive reforms, the courts “...refused to
apply the new laws, interpreted them contrary to their intent, or hindered the attempts of officials to administer
them.” (Merryman, 1985, p. 16)
6
  Robespierre even argued that, “the word jurisprudence … must be effaced from our language.” (Quoted from
Dawson, 1968, p. 426)
7
  When the first commentary on the Code was published in 1805, Napoleon is said to have exclaimed, “My Code is
lost!’ (Quoted from Dawson, 1968, p.387)
                                                 9


Furthermore, this approach required a high degree of procedural formalism to reduce the

discretion of judges in regulating the presentation of evidence, witnesses, arguments, and appeals

(Schlesinger, et al., 1988). Thus, to reduce corruption and enhance the fair application of the

law, France adopted both greater procedural formalism and more limited judicial discretion.

       There are conflicting views on the success of the Napoleonic Code’s goal of eliminating

jurisprudence. Merryman (1985, 1996) argues that the Napoleonic doctrine was a temporary,

largely theoretical “deviation” from two thousand years of a legal tradition built on

jurisprudence. Indeed, the lead draftsman of the Code recognized explicitly that the legislature

could not revise the Code sufficiently rapidly to handle efficiently the myriad of changing

problems that arise in a dynamic nation. In contrast to theory, the French courts eventually built

an entire body of tort law on the basis of Article 1382 of the Code Napoleon that states that one

whose act injures another must compensate that person. In contrast to theory, French courts have

used case law to recast the law of unjust enrichment, alter the law on obligations, re-work the

law of contract regarding gifts, and change the system of administrative law (Dawson, 1968,

400-415). From this perspective, while the theory of the Napoleonic code rejected jurisprudence

and embraced judicial formalism, practicalities in conjunction with a legal tradition grounded in

jurisprudence produced in France a legal system that has increasingly employed judicial

discretion over the last two centuries and thereby circumvented inefficient qualities of the Code.

       Others disagree and argue that antagonism toward jurisprudence and the exaltation of the

role of the state produced a comparatively static, rigid legal tradition. 8 The French situation

encouraged the development of easily verifiable “bright-line-rules” that do not rely on the

discretion of judges (Glaeser and Shleifer, 2002). While simple and clear, Johnson et al. (2000)

argue that bright-line-rules and excessive judicial formalism may not allow judges sufficient
                                                           10


discretion to apply laws fairly to changing conditions and therefore not support evolving

commercial needs.

           Turning to Germany, Bismarck -- like Napoleon -- unified the country (in 1871) and

placed a high priority on unifying the courts through codification. Although Bavaria and Prussia

codified parts of the law during the 18th century, it was Bismarck’s decision in 1873 to codify

and unify the whole of private law in Germany that led to the adoption of the German civil law

in 1900.

           The parallels between France and Germany’s legal history, however, can be exaggerated.

Unlike in France, German courts have published (since at least the 16th century) comprehensive

deliberations that illustrated how courts weighted conflicting statutes, resolved ambiguities, and

addressed changing situations (Dawson, 1968). Law faculties at German universities worked

directly with courts and tried to reconcile emerging situations with the logic of the Justinian

texts. Through active debate between scholars and practitioners, Germany developed a dynamic,

common fund of legal principles that then formed the basis for codification in the 19th century.

           Moreover, in contrast to the revolutionary zeal and antagonism toward judges that shaped

the Napoleonic Code, German legal history sheds a much more favorable light on jurisprudence

and explicitly rejected France’s approach. 9 Thus, the German Code “was not intended to abolish

prior law and substitute a new legal system; on the contrary, the idea was to codify those

principles of German law that would emerge from careful historical study of the German legal

system.” (Merryman, 1985, p.31)

           Whereas the Napoleonic code was designed to be immutable, the Bürgerliches

Gesetzbuch was designed to evolve. For instance, France technically denies judicial review of

8
    See, Posner (1973), Rubin (1977), and Priest (1977).
                                                        11


legislative actions, while Germany formally recognizes this power and German courts actively

exercise it (Glendon, et al., 1982, p.57). Similarly, in terms of adjudicating disputes involving the

government, France’s administrative courts are within the executive branch itself. In Germany,

the judiciary handles these disputes. Further, the Court of Cassation in France was originally

viewed as an institution to assist the legislature. It had powers to quash decisions, but not decide

cases. This is different from the Bundesgerichtshof in Germany that can reverse, remand,

modify, or enter final judgment on cases, and where judicial decision-making process tends to be

more openly debated. 10 Thus, while codification had a similar role in Germany and France in

unifying the country and reasserting the power of the central state, Germany had a very different

approach toward jurisprudence.

        The Scandinavian Civil law developed relatively independently from the other traditions

in the 17th and 18th centuries and is less closely linked with Roman Civil law than the French or

German traditions (Zweigert and Kötz, 1988, henceforth ZK). Moreover, neither the

construction, nor the subsequent evolution, of the Scandinavian Civil law has been used to

eliminate jurisprudence and boost the role of the State relative to private investors to the same

extent as in the French Civil law (LLSV, 1998). 11 While extensive, active scholarship examines

differences between French, German, and British law, comparatively less effort has been devoted

to understanding the functioning of the Scandinavian civil law tradition and its influence on the

development of financial systems in Scandinavia.




9
  The German legal scholar Karl von Savigny argued that the law of a people was a product of the history and
culture of that people’s development (Merryman, 1985, p. 30).
10
   See Zweigert and Kötz (1998, p. 264) and Glendon, et al. (1982, p. 96-100, 123-133).
11
   Coffee (2001) points to the superior performance of the Scandinavian countries relative to other Civil Law
countries and even to Common Law countries and explains this with the high level of social cohesion in these
countries.
                                                          12


         The historical development of the British common law is unique both in terms of (a) the

relationship between the State and the Courts and (b) jurisprudence. From 1066, the English law

evolved based on the resolution of specific disputes and increasingly stressed the rights of private

property. While landholding rights in England were originally based on William I´s feudal

system, the courts developed legal rules that treated large estate holders as private property

owners and not as tenants of the king. Indeed, the common law at the dawn of the 17th century

was principally a law of private property (e.g., Littleton, 1481, and Coke, 1628).

         The English Common law asserted its independence from the State during the tumultuous

16th and 17th centuries, during the great conflict between Parliament and the English kings. The

Crown attempted to reassert feudal prerogatives and sell monopoly rights to cope with budgetary

shortfalls. Parliament (composed mostly of landowners and wealthy merchants) along with the

courts took the side of the property owners against the Crown. While King James I argued that

royal prerogative superseded the common law, the courts asserted that the law is king, Lex, Rex.

This political struggle culminated in 1688, when the Stuarts were thrown out. This allowed the

courts to place the law above the Crown and limit the Crown’s power to alter property rights and

grant monopoly rights. 12

         Besides the power of the law vis-à-vis the State, the Common law’s history is also

importantly different from France’s in terms of jurisprudence and legal formalism. Unlike in Pre-

Revolutionary France, the courts in England were frequently viewed more favorably and

sometimes as supporters of progressive reforms, so that judges were afforded greater discretion.

In terms of legal formalism, English law typically imposes less rigid and formalistic

12
  There are two additional related issues. First, England was unified during the formative period of the Common
law. This reduced political incentives for codification. Second, English courts were a liberalizing force that helped
dismantle the feudal system and protected the rights of landowners against the Crown (Hayek, 1960). Whereas the
                                                         13


requirements on the presentation of evidence, witnesses, etc., and instead offers judges greater

latitude (Schlesinger, et al., 1988). In terms of jurisprudence, the English common law tradition

is almost synonymous with judges having broad interpretation powers and with courts molding

and creating law as circumstances change. The common law is obsessed with facts and deciding

concrete cases, rather than adhering to the logical principles of codified law. Thus, the popular

dictum: “The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience.” (ZK, 1998, p. 181).

Unlike the Napoleonic doctrine, judges continually – and as a matter of general practice -- shape

the law through their decisions.

The Spread of Europe’s Legal Systems

         The English, French, and German legal traditions spread throughout the world through

conquest, colonization, and imitation. Napoleon secured the adoption of the Code in all

conquered territories, including Italy, Poland, the Low Countries, and the Habsburg Empire.

Also, France extended her legal influence to parts of the Near East, Northern and Sub-Saharan

Africa, Indochina, Oceania, French Guyana, and the French Caribbean islands during the

colonial era. Furthermore, the French Code heavily influenced the Portuguese and Spanish legal

systems, which helped spread the French legal tradition to Central and South America. The

English common law spread through colonization and conquest to all corners of the world. The

Austrian and Swiss civil codes were developed at the same time as the German civil code and the

three influenced each other heavily. In turn, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Yugoslavia, and Greece

relied on German civil law in formulating and modernizing their legal systems in the early part

of the 20th century. The German Civil Code was not imposed but exerted a big influence on

Japan. At the end of the 19th century, Japan looked toward Europe as it sought to draft a


French Revolution sought individual rights through strict prohibitions on the discretion of judges, England found
liberty through an independent and influential judiciary.
                                                          14


commercial code. While Japan considered the French civil code, Japanese legal scholars were

attracted to the systematic theorizing of the German code and its emphasis on fitting the

evolution of the law into a country’s historical context (ZK, 1998, p. 296-302.) The Japanese

commercial code of 1899 is squarely based on the German counterpart. Although Japan came

under the influence of the Common law during the post World War II occupation period

(especially in the area of public law), it is not uncommon to classify Japan as a German civil law

country, particularly when focusing on Commercial and Company law. Similarly, the German

code influenced the development of commercial law in Korea, especially through the Japanese

occupation. During the early decades of the 20th century, China (and hence Taiwan) examined

European law in seeking to improve the operation of their commercial law. China introduced

civil codes in 1925 and 1935 that, except for family and inheritance law, were shaped by German

civil law. Of course, China has its own ancient legal tradition and also experienced Mao and the

Cultural Revolution. The Scandinavian legal system was not spread to any country outside

Northern Europe.

         While the subject of active debate, Merryman (1996) advances four inter-related reasons

for why the exportation of the Napoleonic Code had more pernicious effects in French, Belgian,

Dutch, Spanish and Portuguese colonies than in France itself. According to this view, the

adoption of the French civil code has crippled the judicial systems of many French legal origi n

colonies and hindered their ability to develop efficiently adaptive legal systems.

         First, the French rigidly imposed the Code Civil in its colonies even though there were –

and remain -- serious conflicts between the Code and local laws (ZK, 1998, p. 109-13).13


13
  England did not try to replace Islamic, Hindu, or unwritten African law and the flexibility of the Common law
eased its transfer. For instance, the English courts in India were instructed to apply Islamic or Hindu law depending
on the faith of the parties in cases of inheritance, marriage, caste, etc. In Africa, judges were to apply the English
law only to the extent that local circumstances permitted and matters were to be decided by equity and good
                                                       15


Tensions between local law and the transferred doctrine may impede the efficient development

and application of the law with negative implications for financial development (Berkowitz,

Pistor, and Richard, 2002).

        Second, when the French instilled the Code, they brought the theory of the Napoleonic

doctrine with its antagonism toward jurisprudence and its reliance on judicial formalism to

minimize the role of judges. The French did not also bring the practical knowledge of how to

circumvent some of the negative attributes of the Code and create an efficient role for judges

(Merryman, 1996).

        Third, given the Napoleonic doctrine, judges frequently “… are at the bottom of the scale

of prestige among the legal professions in France and in many nations that adopted the French

Revolutionary reforms, and the best people in those nations accordingly seek other legal careers”

(Merryman, 1996, p. 116). Consequently, it is more difficult to develop efficiently responsive

legal systems if the courts do not attract the best minds. Also, the static theory of the Napoleonic

doctrine may become self-fulfilling: the best minds choose other professions, which hinders

efficient legal flexibility. As a consequence, the legislature will have a tendency to write “bright

line laws” to limit the role of the courts. As argued by Pistor et al. (2002, 2003), once a country

adopts the “bright line” approach to law making, it is very difficult to change. Courts will not be

challenged to develop legal procedures and methods to deal with emerging conditions. Thus,

according to some scholars, these characteristics of the French law have worked to retard the

development of efficiently adaptive legal systems that support financial development.

        Fourth, France has a long history of avoiding open disputes about legal interpretation

(Dawson, 1968). Moreover, Napoleonic doctrine formally inhibits open disputations by judges


conscience as rendered necessary by local circumstances (ZK, 1998, 225-9). While somewhat chaotic, this arguably
set the stage for the evolution of an independent, dynamic common law in the post-colonial era.
                                                16


on how they weigh competing statutes, ambiguous laws, and past court decisions in deciding

new cases. The exportation of this characteristic to French legal origin colonies, i.e., the absence

of a legal culture of openly discussing the application of the law to evolving conditions, hindered

the development of efficient legal systems around the world accordingly. From this perspective,

French legal origin colonies imported a restrictive, formalistic legal doctrine under particular

conditions that enhanced the probability that their legal systems would be less efficiently

adaptable than Common and German civil law countries and even than the legal system in

France itself.


From Legal Origin to Finance: Political & Adaptability Mechanisms

        We now describe two mechanisms through which legal origin may influence financial

development. The political mechanism is based on two premises. First, legal traditions differ in

the emphasis they place on protecting the rights of private investors relative to the rights of the

State. Second, private property rights protection forms the foundation for financial development.

Thus, historically determined differences in legal origin can help explain existing differences in

financial development according to this component of the law and finance view (LLSV, 1998).

        Some scholars argue that the Civil law has tended to support the rights of the State,

relative to private property rights, to a greater degree than the Common law with adverse

implications for financial development. Indeed, La Porta, et al. (2003) find that in civil law

countries, the State is less likely to grant judges tenure, give courts jurisdiction over cases

involving the government, or permit judicial review of the constitutionality of laws. LLSV

(1999, p. 231-2) state that a civil legal tradition, then, can be taken as a proxy for the intent to

build institutions to further the power of the State. A powerful State with a responsive civil law

at its disposal will tend to divert the flow of society’s resources toward favored ends, which is
                                                17


antithetical to competitive financial markets. Furthermore, a powerful State will have difficulty

credibly committing to not interfere in financial markets, which will also hinder financial

development. Thus, the law and finance theory holds that Civil law countries will have weaker

property rights protection and lower levels of financial development than countries with other

legal traditions.

        In contrast, the Common law has historically tended to side with private property owners

against the State according to this view. Rather than becoming a tool of the State, the Common

law has acted as a powerful counterbalance that promotes private property rights. Rajan and

Zingales (2003) note that governments in Civil Law countries were more effective than

governments in Common Law countries in expanding the role of government at the cost of

financial market development during the Interwar period 1919 – 1939. They attribute this to the

stronger role of the judiciary vis-à-vis the legislature in Common Law countries. Thus, the law

and finance theory holds that the British Common law supports financial development to a

greater degree than the Civil law systems.

        The second mechanism linking legal origin with financial development is the adaptability

mechanism, which is built on two premises. First, legal systems differ in their ability to adjust to

changing circumstances. Second, if a country’s legal system adapts only slowly to changing

circumstances, large gaps will open between the financial needs of an economy and the ability of

the legal system to support those needs.

        An influential, though by no means unanimous, line of inquiry holds that legal systems

that embrace case law and judicial discretion tend to adapt more efficiently to changing

conditions than legal systems that adhere rigidly to formalistic procedures and that rely more

strictly on judgments based narrowly on statutory law (Coase, 1960). Posner (1973) argues that
                                                            18


while legislators consider the impact on particular individuals and interest groups when writing

statutes, judges are forbidden from considering the deservedness of specific litigants and

therefore more likely to render decisions based on objective efficiency criteria (Rubin, 1982, p.

205. Rubin (1977) and Priest (1977) hold that common law systems are more efficient than

statutory-based systems because inefficient laws are routinely litigated and re-litigated pushing

the law toward more efficient outcome. In contrast, Posner (1973) and Bailey and Rubin (1994)

argue that statutory law evolves slowly and is subject to a greater degree of inefficient political

pressures than the Common law.14 If statutes are constantly playing “catch-up” and are

constantly pushed in inefficient direction by the legislative process, then this will hinder efficient

corporate finance and financial development.

         Thus, while subject to countervailing views presented below, the adaptability channel

predicts that French legal origin countries, albeit not necessarily France itself, have a lower

probability of developing efficiently flexible financial systems than German civil law and

especially Common law countries. The adaptability channel holds that the Common law is

inherently dynamic as it responds case-by-case to the changing needs of society. This limits the

opportunities for large gaps to grow between the demands of society and the law. Indeed, La

Porta, et al. (2003) show that common law countries are more likely to admit judicial decisions

as a source of law. In addition, Djankov, et al. (2003a) stress that differences in legal formalism

also influence the adaptability of the law. They find that common law countries tend to have less

legal formalism in terms of regulating the collection and presentation of evidence, requiring


14
   For example in the United States, corporate officers and directors have a legal responsibility to maximize firm
value for shareholders. Macey and Miller (1993) argue that the efficiency justification for these broad fiduciary
responsibilities is to fill in gaps because it is impossible to pre-contract for all contingencies. This gap-filling role of
fiduciary duties can lower transactions costs and improve corporate governance by requiring directors to promote
the interests of shareholder above their own interests. For example, in a legal system where judges do not got
beyond the statutes, “... a corporate insider who finds a way not explicitly forbidden by the statutes to expropriate
outside investors can proceed without fear of an adverse judicial ruling” (LLSV, 2000a, p. 9).
                                               19


elaborate and extensive procedures throughout judicial processes, insisting on written

documentation at every stage of the process, and setting rigid procedural requirements on

communication between parties. In contrast, the Napoleonic doctrine’s distrust of judges induces

a reliance on judicial formalism. This hinders the flexibility of the legal system in many French

law countries, with adverse implications on financial development. Furthermore, as noted, many

legal scholars argue that the German law falls close to the Common law in terms of adaptability

since it rejected the Napoleonic doctrine and instead maintained its historical roots in

jurisprudence.

       While the political and adaptability mechanism are inter-related parts of the law and

finance theory and while they both predict that legal origin shapes financial development, they

make conflicting predictions regarding French versus German civil law countries. The political

channel holds that the Civil law tradition – both French and German – tends to centralize and

intensify state power and therefore takes a more wary stance toward the development of free

financial systems than the Common law. In contrast, the adaptability channel stresses that

Common law and German civil law countries have notably more adaptable legal traditions than

French civil law countries.

       The two mechanisms also make different predictions concerning the channels through

which legal systems influence the development of financial markets. The political mechanism

contends that State control of the judiciary produces a system that focuses more on the power of

the State and less on the private contracting rights of individual investors than a legal system

characterized by an independent judiciary. Thus, the political channel stresses that cross-country

differences in the independence of the judiciary are critical for explaining cross-country

differences in financial development. In contrast, the adaptability mechanism stresses that cross-
                                                          20


country differences in the flexibility of the law are critical for explaining cross-country

differences in financial development. 15

         One can overemphasize the difference between the political and adaptability channels,

however. The political channel focuses on the power of the State while the adaptability channel

highlights differences in the ability of legal systems to evolve with changing conditions.

Jurisprudence, however, may be much less likely in a system where the State controls the

judiciary than in a system where the judiciary enjoys greater independence (Damaska, 1986;

Glaeser and Shleifer, 2002).

Skeptical Views regarding the Law and Finance Theory

         Many influential legal scholars and economists question each of the premises underlying

the law and finance theory. There are disagreements about the comparative flexibility of the

Common and Civil law traditions, doubts about the view that the common places greater

emphasis on private property rights protection than the Civil law, skepticism about classifying

countries by legal origin, questions about whether legal origin is a fundamental determinant of

financial development, and doubts about the central role of investor protection laws in promoting

financial development.

         Specifically, Backhaus (1997) and Blume and Rubinfeld (1982) argue that precedent can

stymie the efficient evolution of the law. Indeed, Epstein (1975) and Rubin (1982) provide a rich

set of examples, including the evolution of the law of property during 19th century and the design

of private clauses in contracts, when statutory law changes were necessary to produce more

15
   Proponents of the political channel argue that historically Germany had much more efficient institutions than
France did. Citing Ertman (1997) and Finer (1997), LLSV (1998, 1999) note that Germany built a professional
bureaucracy based on the military and professional civil servants, while France developed a patrimonial bureaucracy
with strong links to political elites. Arguably, these differences have also worked to create German courts that are
more independent from the State, more efficient at protecting private contracting rights, and less focused on the
rights of the State than in France. Proponents of the legal-adaptability channel would counter that this cannot explain
                                                        21


efficient outcomes in the United States.             As another example, English law has clung with

remarkable tenacity to the principle that “only a person who is a party to a contract can sue on

it.” (ZK. 1998, p. 468) In contrast, the Continental countries granted greater rights to third

parties through statutory changes. Furthermore, Lamoreaux and Rosenthal (2002) provide a

fascinating comparison of the laws of incorporation and partnerships in the United States and

France. They argue that the French civil law system responded more effectively to evolving

economic conditions than the U.S common law system. Finally, Bentham (1789) noted that the

Common law’s lack of coherence hinders its ability to evolve efficiently.

        Another line of criticism questions Posner’s (1973) argument that the courts have better

incentives to select socially efficient outcomes than the legislature. Galanter (1974) and Tullock

(1980) argue that rich disputants and well-endowed special interest groups can litigate and re-

litigate cases, which blurs Posner’s (1973) delineation between the processes of legislation and

litigation. Furthermore, the choice of litigation and legislation may be primarily a strategic,

decision regarding avenue offers the greatest probability of success. From this perspective, there

is no reason to presume that Common or Civil Law systems will produce more efficient

outcomes.

        Research also questions whether Common law systems emphasize property rights relative

to the rights of the State to a greater degree than Civil law systems. For instance Ekelund and

Tollison (1980) and Rubin (1982) argue that while the courts in England sided with Parliament

against the Crown’s efforts to grant monopolies in 16th and 17th centuries, this should not be

viewed as a general characteristic that Common law legal systems favor private property rights

and competition more than Civil law systems. Arguing along similar lines, Coffee (2000) argues


why other German legal origin countries, such as Korea and Japan have developed relatively efficient financial
markets.
                                                 22


that Civil law systems are not inherently against minority shareholder rights, but rather the law

has evolved sufficiently in Civil law countries to protect minority shareholder effectively given

that patterns of corporate ownership in those countries.

       Furthermore, many question whether it is appropriate and analytically useful to

categorize countries as simply having British, French, German, or Scandinavian legal origins. As

stressed above, Dawson (1960, 1968) and Merryman (1985, 1996) stress than when the French

legal system was exported to colonies around the world, it operated less effectively than in

France itself. One may further refine the categorization of legal systems. For instance, Franks

and Sussman (1999) describe differences in the adaptability of two Common law countries: the

United Kingdom and the United States. Also, legal scholars study differences across the French

civil law countries of Latin America. Along the same lines, Berkowitz, Pistor, and Richard

(2002) stress that the manner in which national legal systems were initially transplanted and

received, e.g., through conquest, colonization, or imitation, around the world is very important

for economic development. They stress that the transplant process – not just whether countries

are classified as having British, French, German, or Scandinavian legal origins – is important for

establishing well-functioning legal systems. Thus, many observers question the usefulness of

using legal origin to explain property rights protection, the efficient adaptability of legal systems,

and hence financial development.

       Some researchers question whether legal heritage is a crucial determinants of legal and

financial institutions and instead stress that politics determines the degree of investor protection

laws, the energy devoted to private contract enforcement, the extent to which legal systems

emphasize the rights of property owners relative to the rights of the State, and hence the

development of competitive financial markets (Pound, 1991; Roe, 1994; Pagano and Volpin,
                                                          23


2001; Rajan and Zingales, 2003; Haber, et al., 2003). From this perspective, those in power

shape policies and institutions – including legal and financial institutions – to stay in power and

enrich themselves. The elite may or may not favor financial development, which ultimately

influences the operation of legal and financial institutions. This view does not reject the

importance of legal institutions in shaping financial systems. Rather, it stresses the political roots

of differences in legal and financial institutions. 16

         Skepticism about the central role of legal institutions in shaping financial development

also emanates from those highlighting culture. Stulz and Williamson (2003) note that different

religions have different attitudes toward the rights of creditors. In particular, the Catholic Church

has historically taken a negative stance toward the charging of interest and creditor rights.

Similarly, the Qur’an prohibits the charging of interest, so that some countries still impose this

prohibition. In contrast, according to this culture-religion view, the Reformation advanced a

different religious attitude towards finance, whereby the payment of interest was considered a

normal part of commerce, so that the rights of creditors were more naturally emphasized in

countries dominated by Protestant religions. From this perspective, countries with a

predominantly Catholic religious heritage would tend to have less developed credit markets and

more poorly developed loan issuing financial institutions.

         An additional line of attack comes from geography. The endowment view stresses that

differences in geography and disease have critically shaped patterns of political, institutional, and

economic development (Diamond 1997; Jones 1981; McNeill 1963; Crosby 1989; Engerman and



16
  Glaeser and Shleifer (2002) model the evolution of legal institutions, while Glaeser and Shleifer (2003) show that
legal and regulatory institutions may evolve together and sometimes substitute for each other depending on specific
conditions. For broad discussions of the co-evolution of legal, regulatory, and political institutions see Olson (1993),
North (1981, 1990), Djankov, Glaeser, LaPorta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (2003b), and Barth, Caprio, and
Levine (2003). Easterly and Levine (1997) show that ethnic division may shape the wide range of institutions and
policies.
                                                 24


Sokoloff 1997, 2002; Sokoloff and Engerman, 2000; Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson, 2001,

2002).

         Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2001, henceforth AJR) base their theory of how

endowments influence enduring institutions on three premises. First, AJR note that Europeans

adopted different types of colonization strategies. At one end of the spectrum, the Europeans

settled and created institutions to support private property and check the power of the State.

These “settler colonies” include the United States, Australia, and New Zealand. At the other end

of the spectrum, Europeans sought to extract as much from the colony as possible. In these

“extractive states,” Europeans did not create institutions to support private property rights; rather,

they established institutions that empowered the elite to extract gold, silver, etc. (e.g., Congo,

Ivory Coast, and much of Latin America). Second, AJR’s theory holds that the type of

colonization strategy was heavily influenced by the feasibility of settlement. In inhospitable

environments, Europeans tended to create extractive states (AJR, 2001). In areas where

endowments favored settlement, Europeans tended to form settler colonies. The final piece of the

AJR theory of institutional development stresses that the institutions created by European

colonizers endured after independence. Settler colonies tended to produce post-colonial

governments that were more democratic and more devoted to defending private property rights

than extractive colonies. In contrast, since extractive colonies had already constructed

institutions for effectively extracting resources, the post-colonial elite frequently assumed power

and readily exploited the pre-existing extractive institutions. AJR (2001, 2002), Beck, Demirguc-

Kunt, and Levine (2003a, henceforth BDL), and Easterly and Levine (2003) provide empirical

support for the view that endowments influence institutions, including financial institutions.
                                                  25


       Other work questions the central role of investor protection laws in shaping the efficient

flow of capital to corporations and overall financial development. For instance, Dyck and

Zingales (2003) find that non-traditional corporate control mechanisms, such as an open,

competitive media and a high degree of product market competition, are as important as statutory

protection of minority shareholders in explaining the private benefits of controlling a

corporation. Furthermore, Guiso, et al. (2000) hold that “social capital” the informal rules that

govern social interactions play a critical role in determining financial development in Italy.

Similarly, Franks, et al (2003) argue that implicit contracts enforced by informal mechanisms

fostered small shareholder participation in financial markets in late 19th and early 20th century

England. Johnson, McMillan, and Woodruff (2002a), however, note that while informal,

relational contracting has been important in post-communist countries and can sustain old

relationships, effective formal court systems are crucial in fostering new commercial

relationships and boosting the overall level of trust in society.



3. EMPIRICAL EVIDENCE ON LAW AND FINANCE

       In this section, we review the empirical evidence on the law and finance view. The first

sub-section discusses evidence on the links between legal origin and financial development,

investor protection laws, and private property rights protection. Next, we assess whether investor

protection laws influence corporate valuations, corporate governance, and the operation of

financial markets? The third subsection reviews emerging evidence on the mechanisms -- the

political and adaptability mechanisms – linking the law to financial development.
                                                       26


Legal Origin and Financial Development

        To measure legal origin, many researchers follow LLSV (1998) in classifying a country

as having either a British common law, French civil law, German civil law, or Scandinavian civil

law based on the source of each country’s Company or Commercial code. David and Brierley

(1985) argue that commercial legal systems of most countries derive from these four major legal

families. Reynolds and Flores (1989) provide information on the origins of national laws for over

100 countries. Using these legal origin dummy variables, researchers have initiated an energetic

examination of the relationship between legal and financial institutions.

        LLSV (1997, 1998) find that French civil law countries have the lowest levels of

financial development even after controlling for the overall level of economic development.

French civil law countries have smaller stock markets (as measured by market capitalization

divided by GDP), less active initial public offering markets, and lower levels of bank credit as a

share of GDP. These results are broadly consistent with the theories of law and finance discussed

above.17

        Empirical work also examines the connection between legal origin and specific laws

governing the rights of external investors in firms. To the extent that the legal system protects

shareholders and creditors, this may tend to (1) foster better functioning stock and debt markets

and (2) facilitate the flow of capital to firms.

        Consider LLSV’s (1998) Shareholder rights measure, which is an index aggregates the

following six measures. The index is created by adding 1 when (a) the country allows

shareholders to mail their proxy vote to the firms, (b) shareholders are not required to deposit

their shares prior to the General Shareholders Meeting, (c) cumulative voting or proportional


17
  Additional work further shows that Common law countries have significantly greater Market Capitalization than
the combined group of civil law countries (BDL, 2001).
                                                  27


representation of minorities on the board of directors is allowed, (d) an oppressed minorities

mechanism is in place, (e) the minimum percentage of share capital that entitles a shareholder to

call for an Extraordinary Shareholders Meeting is less than the sample median (10 percent), or (f)

shareholders have preemptive rights that can only be waived by a shareholders vote. Higher

values indicate greater minority shareholder rights such that majority shareholders have less

discretion in exploiting minority shareholders.

       LLSV (1998) show that French civil law countries have lower levels of Shareholder

Rights. LLSV (1997) and Levine (2003) go on to show that low levels of Shareholder Rights

are associated with poorly developed equity markets. In contrast, Common law countries have

high levels of Shareholder Rights with correspondingly high levels of equity market

development. Furthermore, LLS (2003) find laws and regulations that force information

disclosure and that foster private enforcement through strict liability rules enhance market

development. Moreover, LLS (2003) show that French legal origin countries tend to have

relatively weak liability rules and weak information disclosure requirements, such that the legal

and regulatory environment in French civil law countries tends to emphasize private contract

enforcement less effectively than in Common law countries.

       Next, consider Creditor Rights, which is an index that is formed by adding one when (a)

the country imposes restrictions, such as creditors consent or minimum dividends, to file for

reorganization, (b) secured creditors are able to gain possession of their security once the

reorganization petition has been approved (no automatic stay on assets), (c) secured creditors are

ranked first in the distribution of the proceeds that result from the disposition of the assets of a

bankrupt firm, and (d) the debtor does not retain the administration of its property pending the

resolution of the reorganization. Higher values indicate greater creditor rights.
                                                 28


       As shown by LLSV (1998), countries with a Common law tradition tend to have greater

Creditor Rights than French civil law countries. Furthermore, LLSV (1997) and Levine (1998,

1999) show that greater Creditor Rights are positively associated with financial intermediary

development.

       Furthermore, Levine (1998, 1999) and Levine, Loayza, and Beck (2000) empirically

trace the chain of connections from legal origin to financial development to economic growth.

Specifically, legal origin importantly accounts for cross-country differences in the development

of bank and stock markets and these differences in financial development explain international

differences in long-run rates of economic growth. Thus, a growing body of work suggests that

legal institutions influence the operation of financial institutions with substantial implications for

corporate finance and investment decisions, along with the overall rate of economic growth.

       Nevertheless, legal origin is certainly not the whole story. Rajan and Zingales (2003)

argue that financial development does not always evolve monotonically over time and that cross-

country differences in financial development also change materially over time. Thus, time-

invariant factors such as legal origin cannot fully explain time-variation in the relative levels of

financial development across countries. Rajan and Zingales (2003) stress the important role of

political forces in shaping policies toward financial markets and intermediaries and hence the

development of financial systems. Pistor, et al. (2002, 2003) disagree with Rajan and Zingales

(2003) in the area of corporate law and argue that even acute political changes in Germany,

France, and England during the 20th century did not substantively alter the evolution of corporate

law.

       While recognizing the limitations of the law and finance theory’s ability to explain

intertemporal changes in relative levels of financial development across countries, recent
                                                29


research has conducted a number of robustness checks regarding the linkages between legal

origin and financial development. Levine, (1998, 1999, 2003a), Levine, Loayza, and Beck

(2000), and BDL (2003a) use different measures of financial development and also expand the

set of countries to over 100. This research confirms that legal origin helps explain cross-country

differences in financial development. In particular, French civil law countries, though not France

itself, tend to have particularly low levels of equity market development. To the extent that

competitive securities markets rely more on legal institutions than banks, these results are very

consistent with theories that suggest a strong link between legal institutions and financial

development.

       Furthermore, BDL (2003a) show that French civil law countries tend to have lower levels

of private property rights protection. Again, this is consistent with the view that French legal

origin countries place comparatively less emphasis on the rights of private property holders than

countries with a Common or German civil law tradition.

       While still in its nascent stages, research is also running statistical horse races between

theories that stress the role of legal institutions and alternative theories. As noted earlier, an

influential body of works stresses the dominating role of political forces in shaping financial

development. While it is extraordinarily difficult to measure cross-country differences in

political institutions, BDL (2003a) make an initial attempt to control for differences in political

systems in assessing the law and finance relationship. They include measures of the degree of

competitive and executive elections, measures of the number of influential veto players in

legislative process, and an overall index of national openness based on trade openness. BDL

(2003a) continue to find that legal origin explains differences in equity market development,
                                                 30


banking sector development, and the level of private property rights protection even when

controlling for these proxies for characteristics of the political environment.

       BDL (2003a) also control for natural resource endowments and religion in examining the

robustness of the connection between legal heritage and financial development. To control for

religion, BDL (2003a) measure the percentage of the population adhering to different religious

faiths. To proxy for natural resource endowments, BDL (2003a) use the AJR measures of settler

mortality. As a further check, they use measures of each country’s latitude (the absolute value of

either the geographic mean of the country or of the country’s capital city) as an exogenous proxy

for the degree to which the country is in a tropic environment. They find that endowments

importantly explain cross-country differences in financial institutions, confirming the AJR and

Engerman and Sokoloff (1997) theories of institutional development. Nevertheless, legal origin

continues to explain property rights differences and stock market development even when

controlling for endowments.

       Similarly, Stulz and Williamson (2003) examine the impact of legal origin on financial

development while controlling for cross-country differences in culture, as measured by the

dominant religion in each country. They find that legal origin is more important than religion in

explaining laws protecting equity holders, while religious differences are more closely tied to

laws protecting creditors. Thus, while culture matters, legal origin still explains cross-country

differences in financial development, especially equity market development, after controlling for

differences in religious heritage.
                                                31


Investor Protection Laws, Corporate Finance, and Financial Development

       We now examine the empirical evidence concerned with the relationship between

investor protection laws and the corporate financing decisions of firms and the operation of

financial markets. This subsection discusses this more microeconomic-based work.

       Recent work suggests that legal institutions influence the valuation of firms and banks

and hence the cost of capital. Claessens, et al., (2002), LLSV (2002), and Caprio, et al, (2003)

find that stronger investor protection laws, as measured by higher values of the Shareholder

Rights indicator defined above, tend to enhance corporate valuations. Furthermore, LLSV

(2000b) show that countries with strong Shareholder Rights are able to force firms to disgorge

cash and pay higher dividends. This evidence is consistent with the view that investor protection

laws influence corporate governance with measurable implications on stock prices and dividend

policies. In related work Johnson, McMillan, and Woodruff (2002b) show that countries with

strong private property rights protection tend to have firms the reinvest their profits, but where

property rights are relatively weakly enforced, entrepreneurs are less inclined to invest retained

earnings.

       Empirical analyses also find a strong connection between investor protection laws and

both ownership concentration and the private benefits of corporate control.         The data are

consistent with the view that stronger legal protection of investor rights makes minority investors

more confident about their investments, which reduces the need for firms (Claessens, et al.,

2000; LLS, 1999) and banks (Caprio, et al., 2003) to use concentrated ownership as a mechanism

for alleviating corporate governance problems. Furthermore, Dyck and Zingales (2003) and

Zingales (1994) show that greater statutory protection of minority shareholder rights and more
                                                 32


effective legal enforcement of those rights lowers the private benefits of controlling a

corporation.

          Legal institutions also influence the ability of firms to raise capital. Thus, laws may

influence the degree to which firms operate at financially constrained levels. Kumar, Rajan, and

Zingales (2001) and Beck, Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic (2002) find that countries with legal

institutions that more effectively protect property rights tend to have larger firms. This is

consistent with the law and finance theory that in countries with better legal institutions, firms

are less constrained by retained earnings and operate at more efficient scales.

          Recent work has also drawn a connection between legal institutions and the efficiency of

equity markets. Morck, Yeung, and Yu (2000) examine the relationship between legal

institutions, the availability and precision of information on firms, and the efficiency of stock

prices. They find that the degree to which legal institutions protect private property rights and the

rights of minority shareholders help account for cross-country differences in stock market

synchronicity. That is, in countries where legal institutions do not protect shareholders

effectively, domestic stock prices move together, so there is less information in individual stock

prices.

          The impact of legal institutions on corporate finance may also play a role in explaining

the Asian financial crisis. Johnson, Boone, Breach, and Friedman (2000) show that weak legal

institutions – legal institutions that do not effectively support the claims of outside investors –

help account for cross-country differences in stock market declines and exchange rate

depreciations during the Asian crisis. Specifically, if managers expropriate more firm assets as

expected rates of return on firm investment fall, then adverse shocks to the economy will lead to

greater expropriation, larger stock declines, and bigger incipient capital outflows in countries
                                                33


with weak legal institutions. Johnson, Boone, Breach, and Friedman (2000) find evidence

consistent with this legal institution explanation of exchange rate and stock price declines.

        Wurgler (2000) and Beck and Levine (2002) examine whether legal institutions influence

the allocation of capital across firms and industries. They show that legal institutions influence

the efficiency with which financial systems re-allocate capital across industries. Specifically,

countries with legal institutions that define and enforce strong rights for small, outside investors

more effectively reallocate the flow of finance toward growing firms and away from declining

firms. Thus, well-functioning legal systems boost the efficiency with which financial systems

allocate capital.

        Also, Demirguc-Kunt and Maksimovic (1998) show that countries with legal institutions

that protect outside investors tend to create better functioning financial systems that fund faster

growing firms. Claessens and Laeven (2003) show that legal rules regarding investor protection

influence the types of firms that get financed. Specifically, in countries with strong investor

protection laws, firms with less collateral have an easier time getting external finance than

similar firms in countries with poorly functioning legal institutions. Furthermore, building on

Rajan and Zingales (1998), Beck and Levine (2002) show that the efficiency of legal institutions

increases the availability of financing to industries and the creation of new establishments. Along

these lines, Demirguc-Kunt and Levine (2001), Beck and Levine (2002), Demirguc-Kunt and

Maksimovic (2002), and Levine (2002) provide empirical support for the view advanced by

LLSV (2000a) that the legal approach is a more fruitful way to explain corporate performance

than the more conventional distinction between bank-based and market-based financial systems.

Thus, national legal institutions are critically important in determining the supply of capital

available for corporate investment.
                                                34


       Some careful case-studies, however, challenge the importance of investor protection

laws. For example, Franks et al. (2003) trace the history of investor protection laws and

corporate ownership in the United Kingdom. They note that in a landmark court case, Foss v.

Harbottle (1843), the judge found that no individual shareholder could sustain an action against

the company, thereby rejecting the notion of minority investor protection. Not until 1948 did

Parliament begin to enact limited legislation to protect minority shareholders and Franks, et al.

(2003) stress that it was not until 1980 that Parliament enacted strong minority shareholder rights

statutes. According to the law and finance view, the U.K. should have had comparatively

inactive equity markets and concentrated ownership in the 19th and early 20th centuries and then

had more dispersed ownership and greater equity market activity after 1948 and especially after

1980. The evidence is, however, is at best mixed. Ownership concentration was similar in 1900

and 1960, which is not consistent with the law and finance prediction, but market liquidity did

jump substantially with enactment of stronger shareholder rights legislation.

       Similarly, Aganin and Volpin (2003) argue that the history of investor protection laws

and corporate ownership in Italy during the twentieth century do not provide strong support for

the law and finance view. They hold that investor protection laws were weak at the beginning of

the century, did not change much after World War II, but were strengthened after 1974 and

especially after 1990. They note that the law and finance theory predicts a fall in corporate

ownership concentration after 1974 as stronger investor protection laws make small shareholder

more confident about their investments. But, corporate ownership concentration did not fall after

1974; it rose, and ownership concentration was more diffuse at the beginning of the 20th century

than at the start of the 21st century. Aganin and Volpin (2003), therefore, question the
                                                 35


applicability of the law and finance view in Italy and stress the importance of considering

politics in explaining corporate ownership and the evolution of investor protection laws.

Law and Finance Theory’s Political and Adaptability Mechanisms

       While an exploding body of research examines (a) the links between legal origin and

investor protection and financial development and (b) the links between investor protection laws

and corporate financing efficiency, researchers are only beginning to examine the mechanisms

through which legal origin operates. The political channel postulates that legal traditions differ in

terms of the priority they give to private property rights relative to the rights of the state. The

adaptability channel stresses that legal traditions differ in terms of their responsiveness to

changing socioeconomic conditions.

       BDL (2003b,c) study whether legal origin influences financial development primarily

through the political or adaptability mechanism by exploiting the data assembled by Djankov et

al. (2003a) and La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, Pop-Eleches, and Shleifer. (2003). To proxy for the

political channel, Supreme Court Power is a dummy variable that takes on the value one if

Supreme Court Judges have both life-long tenure and power over administrative cases, and zero

otherwise. The political channel predicts that (i) Civil law countries are less likely to grant

Supreme Court Power and (ii) Supreme Court Power will be positively associated with

private property rights protection and financial development. To proxy for the adaptability

channel, Case Law is a dummy variable that indicates whether judicial decisions are a source of

law. The adaptability channel predicts that (a) Common law and German civil law countries are

more likely to admit judicial decisions as a source of law than French law countries and (b)

countries in which judicial decisions are a source of law will adapt more efficiently to changing

financial conditions.
                                                36


       BDL (2003b) find that, French and German civil law countries have significantly less

Supreme Court Power than British common law countries. This is consistent with the view that

the State grants less independence in a civil law tradition than in a common law system. The

results also indicate that French civil law countries have significantly less Case Law -- i.e., a

significantly smaller role for judicial decisions as a source of law – than in German civil law or

British common law. This is consistent with the view that German civil and British common

legal traditions rely more on jurisprudence than French civil law systems.

       BDL (2003b) next examine whether the proxy for the political channel or the proxy for

the adaptability channel is better able to account for international differences in stock market,

financial intermediary, and private property rights development. They use two-stage least

squares, where the instrumental variables are legal origin dummy variables.

       The results provide support for the adaptability channel but not the political channel.

Specifically, the political channel predicts that Supreme Court Power will enter positively: less

State control of the courts will translate into greater financial development. In contrast, however,

Supreme Court Power enters either insignificantly, or negatively. Instead, the data are

consistent with the adaptability channel: Case Law is positively associated with stock market

development, bank development, and private property rights protection.

       Research also focuses on judicial formalism, which is related to the adaptability

mechanism. Excessive formalism may slow legal processes, increase legal costs, and hinder the

ability of courts to arrive at fair judgments due to the rigid adherence to bright-line-rules

(Johnson et al., 2000; Djankov et al., 2003a; Glaeser and Shleifer, 2002). Indeed, Djankov, et al.

(2003a) construct an index of legal formalism that measures the need for legal professionals,

written documents, statutory justification, the statutory codification of evidence, and the formal
                                                 37


procedural steps associated with legal processes. They find that legal formalism is lower in

common law countries and that less legal formalism is associated with shorter proceedings and

less corruption.

       In terms of finance, Acemoglu and Johnson (2003) examine the impact of legal

formalism on financial development using legal origin as an instrumental variable. Although

legal formalism is not linked with banking sector development, they find that the exogenous

component of legal formalism is associated with stock market development. Greater legal

formalism lowers stock market development, which is consistent with the adaptability

mechanism.

4. Conclusions

       A rapidly growing body of research exami nes the role of legal institutions in explaining

financial development. The law and finance theory holds that (i) historically determined

differences in legal tradition influence national approaches to private property rights protection,

the support of private contractual arrangements, and the enactment and enforcement of investor

protection laws and (ii) these resultant legal institutions shape the willingness of savers to invest

in firms, the effectiveness of corporate governance, and the degree of financial market

development. Each of the components of the law and finance theory is being dissected, critiqued,

and evaluated from a broad array of perspectives. Many economists, legal scholars, political

scientists, and historians are questioning, testing and modifying the law and finance theory. This

promises to be an exciting and important area of inquiry in coming years.
