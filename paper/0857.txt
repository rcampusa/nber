                   Models for the Analysis of Labor Force Dynamics



                                      ABSTRACT



     This paper presents new econometric methods for the empirical analysis
of individual labor market histories. The techniques developed here extend
previous work on continuous time models in four ways: (1) A structural
economic interpretation of these models is presented.      (2) Time varying
explanatory variabtes are introduced into the analysis in a general way.
(3)   Unobserved heterogeneity components are permitted to be   correlated across
spells.  (4) A flexible model of duration dependence is presented that
accommodates many previous models as a special case and that permits tests
among competing specifications within a unified framework.
     We contrast our methods with more conventional discrete time and
regression procedures. The parameters of continuous time models are in-
variant to the sampling tine unit used to record observations. Problems
plague the regression approach to analyzing duration data which do not
plague the likelihood approach advocated in this paper. The regression
approach cannot be readily adopted to accommodate tine varying explanatory
variables. The functional forms of regression functions depend on the
time   paths of the explanatory variables. Ad hoc solutions to this problem
can make exogenous variables endogenous to the model and so can induce
simultaneous equations bias.
      1'wo sets of empirical results are presented. A major conclusion of
the first analysis is that the discrete time Narkov model widely used in
labor market analysis is inconsistent with the data. The second set of
empirical results is a test of the hypothesis that 1tunemployment1' and
"out of the labor force'1 are behaviorally different labor market states.
Contrary to recent claims, we find that they are separate states for our
sample of   young men.

           This paper presents new econometric      methods or the empirical analysis

of individual labor market histories. Jovanovic's equilibrium model of worker

turnover, the McCall—Nortensen search model, and Holt's model of labor force


dynamics    can   be estimated, and crucial assumptions tested, wIth our tech-

niques.
           Our   point of departure is the continuous tine        >!arkov    odel widely
utilized in sociology (Coleman; Singer and Spilerman; Tuma, Rannan and
Groneveld). The methodology developed here extends this work in four ways. Cl)
A structural economic interpretation of         these   nodels is provided. It       is


demonstrited      that continuous time models naturally arise from optimal stopping
rules that are the essence of a variety of         economic   problems. (See Brock at
al). (2)    Th€   methods developed below admit the introduction of time varying
explanatory variables into the analysis in a general way. Previous work
either ignores such variables or utilizes special procedures for selected
variables. (e.g., Tuma, Rannan and Groneveld). Regression procedures
for introducing time varying nriables require special assumptions that are
unlikely to be realized in empirical work vith labor force data.
           We present a flexible empirical procedure which can be used to estimate
 duration models with time vüying variables and demonstrate, both theoretically
 and empirically, the importance of being careful about the way time varying
 variables are introduced into duration zodels. (3) We extend :revtous warlcby
 introducing unobserved components          ("bacarogeneity")     that are   correlated across

 srel.Ls. Previous work assumes chat         unobserved   ccnponencs art indeoendant2.y
 distributed across      stalls —   a   strong — and as we   demonstrate below            one   data
 set —    a counter factual   assumption. (4) We        produce   a flexible   econometric
model with general types of "state dependence." Many models coonly

used in the analysis of continuous time data can be written as a special

case of our model. Our framework can be used to test among competing

model specifications.

       We    present    empirical estimates of a two—state model of     employment

and nonenployment1         in the youth labor market. We then proceed to test a

critical assumption often used in labor market analysis: that "unemploy-

ment" and "out of the labor force" are legitimately separate labor market
states. We find that this is so and that the behavioral equations that
generate movement into and out of these states are fundamentally different.
       The structure of the paper is       as   follows.   In Section 1 we   present a

continuous time model of worker turnover. We demonstrate that this model
can be used      as a framework within which it      is possible to estimate
Jovanovic's model and many other models as well. The model is extended
to allow for heterogeneity, time varying variables and general types
of dependence of labor market transition rates on previous labor force
states. The likelihood function for a two—state model is presented               and

solutions to the problem of correct treatment of the initial conditions
of the process (sometimes called the "left censoring" problem) are offered.




            The nonemploynent    state is cootosed   of the states   "unem,lovmenc'
 and   "out    of the    labor force."
                                    3



       Section II presents a discussion of the advantages of continuous

time models over discrete time models. Certain limitations of continuous

time models are discussed as well.

        Section III discusses pitfalls that arise iii      using   regression

methods to analyze duration data. Two      problems plague the     regression

approach. First, standard regression estimators are ill—equipped to

deal with censored spells of events that arise in short panels.           Failure


to account   for censored   spells leads to biased estimates of the parameters

of population regression functions. Second, the regression approach
cannot be readily adapted to accommodate time varying explanatory variables.
The functional forms of population regression functions depend on the
time athsof the explanatory variables. Ad hoc solutions to this problem
can make exogenous variables endogenous to the model and so can induce
simultaneous equations bias.
         Section IV presents two sets of empirical        results. The first

set is an analysis of   employment and nonemployment data using both regres-

sion and maximum likelihood procedures. The second set is a test of

 the hypothesis that "unemployment" apd    "out    of the labor force" are

behaviorally different labor market states.
        Appendix A presents a general multiple state multiple pell
 likelihood function for a continuous time model. Appendix B presents
 the Weibu.U regression model used in some     of   our empirical work.
 Appendix C presents a simple economic     model    in which non—Markovian,
 long—ten dependence between labor market outcomes is senerated.

       I.    CONTLNUOUS TtE ZCoNO?rRIc MODELS OF TURNOVER AND UNENpLOYENT


      (a) First Passaze Tine    Distributions as an Economic Construct. We start             with
the iafluential model of Jovanovic.       A worker and firm together constitute
a   match. At the start of the match, both are uncertain about the productivity
of the match but both learn about this productivity through a Bayesian
leaning algorithm. Both worker and firm start with the same prior about the
productivity of the match. The prior does not depend on the previous labor
market hIstory of the worker because each match is unique: the
productivity is not inherent in either the worker or the firm alone. The prior
is   then updated as     the two partners continue their relationship.
            Jovanic demonstrates that a competitive equilibrium wage policy
of the firm which is also a socially optimal wage policy is to pay all
employees their expected marginal productivity where the expectation is computed
with respect to the updated prior on the productivity of the worker — f±rm
match. Workers, however, have alternatives. These alternatives include employ-
ment in other fins, participation in social. transfer programs which subsidize
unemployment, or nonmarket activity.
            Jovanovic demonstrates that the worker and fin continue their match
until the tine when the perceivedproductivity of the match —             falls
                                                                     ¶4(t)   —         below
the reservation wage — Q(t)      —   defined as the monetar value of the best
altarnattve to the current employment match. From his assumvtion of a Lener
;age Browth orocess W(t) is normaflv distributed.           The      length cf the
match is the fIrst passage tine to the event W(t) cQ(t).          The first      tine chat
this occurs is denoted :'.
            ;ocher   way to fonujata this model is in terms of the index fumc::.n

model fldeiy used in labor econozics. Define

                           1(t)   w(t)   - Q(t).
When I(t)<O, the worker leaves the firm (for a match to exist at all the

initial value of the index function —        1(0)   —   must be non—negative). The first

time in the match that 1(t) becomes negative —               — is termed the first

passage time. (See Jovanovic, page 981, for the explicit formula for r                in
his model).

          Denote the distribution of T* by F(t*) with density (t*).            For   the

moment,   we ignore any   dependence    of this distribution on observed or unobser-
ved components. The Jovanovic          implies a special functional form
                                   model

for   this distribution. 1oreover, it Implies that the same distribution
characterizes all spells of a worker's employment with firms,            and that the

outcomes of previous matches do not determine the distribution of the first
passage time or exit time from a current match.
          At this point it is useful to rewrite the Jovanovic model in
a more convenient form. To da    requires the introduction of
                                   so


the hazard function, h(t*). The hazard function is a conditional density of
first passage or exit time from a spei1 given the length of time spent in the
spell. For expositional convenience assume that the distribution function
is continuous and differentiable.

                  Let g(T*jT* >t*) be the       conditional    density of the first passage time
T' given that 1* is greater than or equal to t*. From the definition, i—F(t)
is the probability that the first passage occurs after t*. Thus

dependence during unemployment is associated with a declining reservation wage

in search theory (e.g., Lippman and Mccall) .   Negative duration dependence during
employment is associated with firm specific capital in the theory of turnover.

         The hazard function arises as a simple and readily interpreted represen-

tation of the structural conditional distributIon of first oassage times in

many models of labor market turnover. The Mortensen, Lippman and McCall search

theory   generates a structural distribution of first passage tines. In the
infinite horizon case with a stationary economic environment, the optimal search
strategy is stationary so that there is no duration dependence in unemployment
speils. A shrinking horizon (Gronau), systematic job search over different
wage distributions (Salop), or declining assets in a utility maximizing job
search model (with constant relative risk aversion, see Danforth, or Hall,
Lippman and McCall), all generate optimal stopping time distributions with
positive duration dependence. The precise functional form of the hazard function
is determined by the distribution of the random shocks facing the agents.
Typically, these specific distributional assumptions are imposed as a matter
of mathematical convenience in formulating a theory and are not, themselves,
justified by an appeal to theory. For this reason, it    is   important to develop
a flexible approach to estimation that does not require special functional forms
to secure estimates. The approach to empirical model building which is developed
below permits the analyst to explore the sensitivity of his estimates to special
assumptions about functional forms

           aolt's   model of labor market dynamics, while not derived                     from an

 explicit optimizing odei (but see Toikka), offers another axanole of

 a continuous tine labor market aodei. Holt works with the probability that

an individual will be in one of a set of labor market states at a point in

 tine. For convenience of exposition, we consider only a two state todel and

we designate       those states by 'a' and             'u"   —   shorthand   rv tation for employment

                       -
and    unemployment.       We   assume all workers participate in the labor force at

each    point in time.
           The first passage time or exit time distribution from the employment

state is f(t). The first passage time from the unemployment state is

f(t). The labor             market h±s tory of an          individual     is governed by these two

distributions.       Given the initial              stat; labor
                                                      histories are generated

by realizations of these first passage distributions, By assuming no duration

dependence (or constant hazard) in either labor market state, Holt specializes
these distributions to

argument the     probability of exit from the .inemployment state to the employ-

ment state is (a At). The conditional probability of remaining                              in   the

unemployment     state is l_(aAt). As At-O, the probability                           of remaining       in the

larger the exit rate (or hazard) a from the unemployment state relative to
the exit rate from       the   employment state, a, the more likely is the person to       be

found in the employment state at a point in time. In equilibrium, the odds

                     (b) Introducing Heterogeneity Into the Model

              aeterogeneity is defined as unmeasured and ceasured exogenous variables
that       differ among individuals and that nay differ over time for the same
individual.                 The       tern is usually reserved f or unobser-vables as per-
ceived by the data analyst. This paper considers both types of variables.
L'ncorrected      heterogeneity leads to biased estimates of duration dependence.

If         individual exit time distributions are exponential but individuals have

different exponentIal parameters, estimated hazard functions exhibit negative

duration      dependence.
              To see this, let the exit time                density         be a[exp-(—at)]. The

density       of a in the population is g(a). Assuming an ideal                      data   set in which

all spells are completed, for a large random                    sample      of individuals the estimated

empirical dIstribution function                 of   exit times K(t)        converges    to the population

by the Cauchy—Schwartz inequality.              Intuitively, high a individuals are the

first to exit       the state leaving behind        the low a individuals. This shows

up as negative duration dependence in the fitted distribution.

           By a theorem of Barlow and Proschan (p. 37) if each individual

exIt time distribution exhibits negative duration dependence over the entire

range of values of exit time the fitted hazard function also exhibits negative

duration    dependence. The only way for the fitted hazard            to exhibit positive

duration dependence is for some (but not necessarily all) individual exit

time distributions to have positive duration dependence over at least some

portion    of the domain of the distribution of exit times.
           This   paper controls for heterogeneity in observed and unobserved
variables by parameterizing the hazard function in a general way. The strategy
adopted here is to write

                                                   xi_i +        A2_i ÷

This treatent of the duration terms is clearly analogous to the Box—Cox
transformation       used in regression analysis. Unobserved varab1es V(t+r)                        are per-

mitted   to be functIons of time (ttr). By exponentiating the term in brackets,
we    ensure that h(t) is positive as required since h(t) is a conditional density
function.
             This formulation of the hazard is more general than any we have seen.

It dontains, as special cases, virtually all                    of the    commonly utilized hAzard

functions. For example, setting all elements of a                       equal to zero except for
the intercept term 8, and         assuming V(t+t) —             0   for all t and r,a variety      of inter-

esting special cases widely used in           the       literature on reliability theory can be

generated. If we set            — 0 and

          Our model (1) extends previous work by penitting     the   exogenous variables

to vary freely 'thin      spells.1    Although time varying variables are a

computat±onal nuisance they are a fact of life. In the empirical work reortad

below we demonstrate that this extension makes an important difference in our

estimates of the impact of key economic variables on turnover probabilitIes and

enables us to generate sensible parneter estimates.

           Finally, our treatment of heterogeneity generalizes previous work by

permitting      unobserved components to be correlated across spells.
Work by tuna, Hannan and Groeneveld assumes that unobserved components are
uncorreIated across
spells. However, in this paper, our treatment of heterogeneity components
is soaewhat restrictive. We assume that within each spell V(t+t) a v i.e. that
heterogeneity' components       are constant within spells. Heterogeneity components

ar permitted to vary across spells. There is no particular reason to assume

that   unobserved components behave the way we assume they do unless unobserved
heterogeneity     components are immutable person—specific effects. It is l±kely

that unobserved components change within spells. This assumption is made

solely    to simolify the coutacona1 procedure discussed below. Its relaxa-
tion   is a major goal of our future     research.
           In   order to simplify the exposItion we have thus far confined our

attention to the fonulacion of the hazard function for a sing'e ste1l of an

event,     ma procedure    outlined above can be extended to multiple episodes of

the    event. La: j    index   ce episode number. The hazard for the j:h episode

         This   section presents the likelihood function for a two                         state version
of   our nodal. The general likelihood function is presented in AppendbcA.

          Individuals are observed for a time interval of length T. At the
start   of the interval, the individual is in one of two states "e'or '? To                           coni—

rnence the analysis        we   adopt the simplifying assumption that the beginning of
the observation interval           is also the       initIal entry date of the individual into
the work   force. This assumption permits us to postpone discussion of the

problem of correct treatment of initial conditions for the process until the

next section. The data analyzed below are consistent with this assunption.

         To   simplify the notation, write hazard function (5) with
heterogeneity        specification (6) as

the soell is left implicit. Recall that Z = e or u and that i denotes the serial

gratidn with respect to V eliminates the conditioning.Integrating out V is
formally equivalent to integrating out nuisance parameters. n alternative
approach to estimation would be to treat V as a fixed effect for each individual.
Except for some very special cases, the latter approach leads to a serious incidental
parameters problem (see, j., Heckman), and results in inconsistent
parameter estimates in short panels. For this reason we adopt a "random effect"
approach in our empirical analysis.

of V across spells. In later work, we plan to experiment with a variety

of densities for V in order to check the sensitivity of the estimates to

alternative specifications of the density of heterogeneity components.

work by permittIng (a) introduction of time varying explanatory variables, (b)
correction for heterogeneity components correlated across spells. (a) estimation

to    change across different spells of    the event, we can estimate   a model of

"stia" or"occurrence         dependence" of the sort discussed inBecican and       Zorjas
and    derIved   in Apoendlx C. Lagged values of lengths of previous spells

can also be introduced as explanatory variables in the model to capture the

notion of "lagged duration dependence" advanced by 5ecloan and          Sorjas.
Since    the likelihood function accounts for each unit of time spent in the sapling

interval 0 — T, it naturally corrects for incomplete or censored spells of events

that are a consequence of the spliag scheme.

      Testing       for the presence   of   heterogeneity   raises certain delicate

statistical   problems that arise in testing for values of parameters at the
boundaries of parameter spaces (Moran, 1973). A straightforward test for
the presence of seriafly correlated unobserved components can be constructed
that avoids these problems.
      The following test procedure is proposed. Under the null hypothesis
that there is no serial correlation in unobservables. Future values of
duration variabLes should not be statistically significant determinants of
current duration distributions if heterogeneity is ignored in estimating the
parameters of current duration distributions. Standard (asymptotic) signifi-
cance tests on the estimated coefficients of future duration variables
estimated without correcting for heterogeneity can be used to test the hypothesis
of no serial correlation in unobservables for any two spells of the event)
This test is not informative on the presence or absence of heterogeneity
components distributed independently across spells.
       It is possible to estimate both A1. and A2. (subject to the restriction
that A1 <       and the associated coefficients  and 12j• Using the estimated
              A2)
information matrix one can construct a joint confidence interval for these coeff i
cients and determine whether or not certain restricted models lie within the
confidence interval. If they do, the data are consistent with the restricted
models. Thus, for example, if the estimated confidence interval includes                       0

and     —
            1,   a Gomvertz hazard is consistent with the data for spell .              If
the confidence interval      includes         — 0 and       —
                                                                0,   the data are consistent

with a Weibull hazard. By examination of the confidence interval for the general

model it may thus be possible to select a more parsimonious model.


       1We advocate use of Cuture values rather than lagged values in constructing
the test because of the possibility that lagged duration variables may be present
in the structural model. See Hecican and Borjas (1980).

              It is a rare data set for which the beginning of the sample observation

interval is also the beginning of the individual's entry into the workforce —

the assumption made in the last section. More typically, a sample begins
with individuals caught midstream in an employment or uneploynent spell. It

is coonly the case that we know which state an individual occupies at the

beginning of the sample, and possibly the serial order of the spell but we do

not know the length of time spent in the spell before the individual is observed.

This section presents methods for adjusting the likelihood function presented

in the preceding section to account for this problem.

              In order to focus on the essential aspects of the problem, we coence

the analysis under the assumption of a strictly stationary economic environment,
and under the further assumption that the process is in equilibrium.
People can be in only one of two states: employed or unemployed. The density

of exit time from employment, f(te) is the same across people and across time

for the same person. The same is true of the density of exit time from unem-

ployment, fu(tu)             The process is assumed to have been in operation for a long time

for each person. Let Le and s be the mean time in employment and unemployment,

respectively. These means are assumed to be fnLte. We abstract from occur-

rence and lagged duration dependence, but permit duration dependence.

              Suppose that we first observe the process for each individual at calendar

 time :   .     The probability that a randomly selected person will be found to be

 time we       expect   to find an individual employed over a long observation period.

               Given that a person is employed at time                       what is the distribution

 of a completed employment spell spled at r?                                     The completed spell

 length includes the portion observed after the start of the observation period

 at to and the uuobaerved portion completed prior to r. The distribution of
 exit   times from the sampled spell is not the distribution fCc). This is so
because the completed lengths of spells sampled at r are on average longer
 than the typical spell. Longer spells are more likely to be sampled than
 shorter spells. Amplifying an heuristic argument due toCox and Lewis (pp.
 61—63), the density of the sampled completed spell, denoted

 can    be derived in the following way)'

The mean of the sampled employment distribution exceeds the mean of employment

   so long as the variance of t (2) is positive.                         The   mean of the sampled

distribution is a2 + p       which is clearly greater than e since the mean is


always positive. For exponential exit time distributions this mean is twice

    the mean value of an employment interval. By randomly sampling across

time for a single person or across people, we overestimate the population mean

length of employment (and unemployment) duration.

scheme is the sum of the log of density (10) for each individual in the sample.

Maximizing this function with respect to the parameters of the model produces
                                                                                  the number
consiscent and asymptotically normally distributed estimators as

of event histories becomes large.


          This procedure produces an exact solution to the probln of initializing

the likelihood in a stationary environment if the process is in stationary eq.zili—

brium. It is not a general solution. In many cases the two key assumptions —

equilibrit     and a stationary environment — are unlikely to be even approximately

correct. tn this case the procedure just presented is not valid.

          We postpone a general discussion of this probl to a later occasion.

Here we sketch two solutions, both of which are patterned after a discussion

by one of us in a previous paper (Hectcnan). In a general nonstationary

environment, in order to correctly initialize the process, we require the prob-

ability distribution of the first spell in our saple. Its derivation depends

on the rule used to select the saple being analyzed, the probability that the

individual is in a given state at the time he is sapled, and the distribution

of   the length of time spent      in the first spell in the observed sample period

given   the   state that the individual is in when the sapling begins. The density

of the first spell duration                         written as

we can approximate it using the             flexible     functional Eons for the hazards given

in equations (5) and (6). One strategy for empirical work is to parweterize

the first spell in the sple differently from that of subsequent spells and

utilize density \            in place of            in equation (10).

           A practical difficulty with this solution to the problem of initial

conditions     is that aresaaple values of the exogenous variables are required

to form the density of the exit time from the first svell in the sample,

While   such   data may     be   available for some samples, this is unlikely in

most cases.

           there are two approaches to this probleD. Denote the density function

for the exogenus variables by k(Zx) where x is a vector of parameters of the

density generating the data. The first approach estimates this density from

data. The exogenous variables within the sample period might be used to

animate the density or else auxtliary data sources might be utilIzed. GLvn

consistent estimates of the density function of the missing data, denoted

k(Zx), one can form               defined    as



                     *             —o                2.0

converges to the true likelihood and maximum likelihood estimators based on the
estimated likelihood converge to the true maximum likelihood estimators.'
          The second approach is to jointly estimate the data density and structural
parameters      of the modal. Given the exogeneity of Z, no                           advantage accr3es to
this    comoutationafly more demanding             approach.
          A second solution to the problem of initial conditions proceeds conditionally

on V. Substituting A               -for           in   density (10) and gjven V                  v,   the   probability

and does not depend on the parameters of the initial exit time     distribution.
Maximizing   the conditional likelihood function with respect to the parameters
of the model (including a value of v for each person in the sample) generates
consistent   parameter estimates as number of spells per person becomes large

(K +   K   • to). However, in the case of short panels, it is in general not
possible to consistently estimate v, and due to the nonlinearity of the model

estimated parameters win not be consistent because the maximum likelihood

estimator will   involve   joint estimation of v and the structural parameters.

The inconsistency in the estimator of v will    be   transmitted to the estimator

of   the structural parameters (Heckman).

                 II CONTINUOUS TINE vs. DIRETE ThIS MODELS

         The principal, advantage of continuous tine models for discrete panel
data over more conventional discrete tine models for discrete panel. data
is that the parameters generating the continuous time model are invariant
to the time unit used in empirical work. Commonly utilized discrete tine
models such as logit and probit lack this invariance property. A. probit
model for the occurrence of an event in a time interval of a specified
length does not imply a probit model for the probability of events in time
intervals of different length. Dependence of the parameters and functional
form of the model on the data.used to estimate it is an undesirable feature
of discrete time time models that is avoided by use of the continuous tine
approach. Put differently, a continuous tine model can always be used to
generate a discrete time model while         a    discrete tine model is critically
dependent for its paraneterization and interpretation on the particular time
interval on which it     is   estimated.
      To demonstrate this point, we consider the first passage time asso-
ciated with a single spell of an event. We do not observe the process
continuously but    we lmow   in   which   of a series of discrete, equispaced
intervals the    first passage occurs •      To    silify the exposition, we ignore
heterogeneity in    unobserved components         and   initially assume that   measured
variables stay constant within each spell. The stochastic process starts
'at time "0". We observe the occurrence of the event only in equispaced
time intervals of length a.
      For a continuous time model with hazard    function h(u)', the probability
that a   first passage   occurs in the ith interval is

      'For simplicity we do not explicitly note the dependence of the
hazard function on exogenous variables.

 This is simtly   the probability chat the first passage occurs sometime

 between (j—l)A and      jt.    (" F(Ja)—?(Q—l)A)).             No matter how wide or stall

 the intervals are defined and irrespective of whether or not successive

 intervals are of equal length, the first passage time probability is

 generated by the same structural hazard function h(u). Thus                        if A iS the
 width of the Lth interval, the probability of a first passage in the jth

 interval is simply

or Mecian and Willis;            assumes chat there is a '!true" time interval of
length A.       is the   probability that an event does not occur in the interval.

For example, if   the    probit   model         15 adopted it   is   assumed that

                                              31



        Suppose that in another data set the interval widths are longer

(e.g., quarters and not months). For the continuous time model this enlarge-

ment of the interval creates no problem and the probability of first passage

can be expressed as a function of the underlying h(u) function by        a straight-
forward modification       of expression (14).

        For the discrete time niodel to be defined at all on the new time scale,

that scale must be a positive integer multiple of the original scale. For the

discrete   time model, unlike the continuous time model, fractional intervals
have no meaning because the discrete time model is silent on the behavior of
the process within any       interval.   If in fact the new time scale is m times the
old scale (with ni    a   positive integer), the probability of a first passage in
the j th new interval is



(15)                      ()(i-l)n(1_
                                    t=

                                         I.




The second term in the expression on the left hand side is the probability that

at least one event occurs in the jth tine interval measured on the new

scale. NeIther the probability of occurrence of at least one event in the

new    interval (l—(P ))       nor   the probability of occurrence of exactly one

event   in the new inter7al(l_((p)m (1P)) are probit f'nctior             if the

orobabtilty   of occurrence of the avert in the old interval is ;robt. Of

 course, in this sinvle exannla, it is possible to nta these probabilItIes
 in tens of the underlying probIt nodel for the old intervals. Sun note
 than   it will   be necessary to modify a lIkelihood function t.sed to compute

parameter estizatas to account for the nod1ficaton of the intar;al width.

        as noted above, there is no legitinate procedure available to
                                                                               nodify
the discrete time model to account for non—integer               expansion or shrinkage

of the original inteal length. It .s necessa' to postulate a new

model——which might be asstned to be probit in the new intaa1s——with new

parameters    that   cannot be. derived from the original parameters of the model

defined on the original interval.

         Continuous time models can be used       to   generate discrete tine models.

Indeed, in light of the discussion in this sectIon, the models consisting of equations

(5 ),    (6) and (7)      can be interpreted as providing a general algorithm

for producing a class of discrete tine models for the analysis of discrete

panel data. In contrast with          conventional   approaches in econometrics,

the approach offered in this paper provides a parameterization of discrete

tine models that     is   independent of the tine scale in which the occurrence

of dIscrete events is measured.

         We do not want to overstate the case for ccrttnucus tine models.

As   noted by Singer      and Spilerman, Phul±ps and      others, aggre-
gation of cttinucus tine' fata into interval            data tf the sort described

in this section may       lead   to non—identification of the hazard function h(u).
This    is clearLy the case if the hazard is arbitrarily specified.           If suf-

ficient smoothness is       iosed     on the hazard, as is done for the hazards

utilized in this paper (s'e equations (1), (4) and (5)), this idanti—

fi:ation Droblam does not arise. NonetheLess, it            is   iortant to note
that    without icsing infonation of some sort, tine aggregated data tay

advantage in using continuous time dels in place of a conventional discrete

time approach. Put differently, in the absence of such identifying assumpticns,

and in the presence of ti aggregated data, the relative merits of the

continuous time approach fade, and the mdels advanced in this paper must

be interpreted as just one of a variety of discrete time models that          might
be used to analyze discrete panel data.

      Appendix B presents a derivation of the procties of a Waibull.
regression model    that can be used   to analyze duration   data   and estimate

duration dependence parameters.         This section considers two    important
problems that   arise    in usin; standard regression analysis to analyze duration

data. The first problem is one of sample selection bias.1 The second

problem    is the difficulty that arises fron introducing time varying explanatory
variables into regression models. The first problem arises because most
panel samples are short. In the course of a panel, some ithividuals never
complete   a single spell of an   event while others will have multiple spells
and even those iivi&als will usually have        one   unfinished spell   in the

course of the panel. Coonly used    procedures, such as utilizing only
completed spells of events for regression analysis, impose a sample selection
criterion on the sanvle used to execute the emviric.al rk. Failure to


           1This problem is discussed in Tuna and aannan.

ac:ount   for such conditioning   results      itt   biased   parameter estimates. The

resulting bias depends on the particular rule chosen and on the length

of the panel. The dependence of the bias on the length of the panel makes

regress ton   estimates from panel samples of different lengths r.oncompaable

even when the saute selection rule is employed for generating data to estimate

models.

       The   second problem—introducing tine varying exogenous variables into
a regression analysis for duration data—arises because the appropriate
functional form of    the regression    equation depends op the        time profile     of the
exogenous    variables.   Conditioning duration regressions on "exogenous'
variables    measured after a spell begins nay induce simultaneous equations

bias   in the regression estimators. Ad hoc solutions to these problems
convert truly exogenous     variables   into endogenous variables and hence result
in biased estimates. This section considers both of these problems starting
with the first one.
        To focus on essentIal ideas, consider a regression analysis of duratidn
data for a particular type of event—e.g., the lengths of               time   spent in
consecutive jobs. To simpli.fy the analysis we assume that no time elapses
between   consecutive jobs. The density of duration in a given job for an

individual    with fixed characteristics       Z is

length T. To avoid inessential detail suppose that at the origin of the
sample — "0" — everyone begins a spefl of the event. This assumption
enables us to ignore problems with initial conditions.
        We would like to use this data to estimate E(tIZ). But in our panel
sample the expected value of the length of the first spell is not E(tIz)
but is rather

(20)         E(tIZ,T)    -      tf(tZ)dt + I              f(tIZ)dt    <   E(tZ).

Thus, in the exponential example


(21)                      E(tfz,T)          z [i    -    e_h/2Z

                                                     36

Clearly, a least squares regression of t                     on   2 will not estimate S. As T-c,
the bias disappears. In the exponential example, as T becomes big relative
to   the mean     duration, 1/0(2), the bias becomes small.
           One widely   used method utilizes only completed first spells. This

results in another type of selection bias. The expected value of t                       given
that       t<   T is


                                                              T

                                                              ff(tJZ)dt


In our exponential example


(23)                    E(tIZ,   T,   t<T) —
                                                            (i._e_Tet'82)

Again, a least squares regression of t on Z does not estimate 8 for this
sample. As Te, the bias disappears.
    Clearly there is also selectIon bias when we analyze the expected
duration        of a completed second spefl of the event. Denote the length of

spell i by        t±. The   expected length of the second spell is

           The key point to extract from this discussion is that for short panels
In which T is tismaflit, regression estimators do not estimate the parameters
of regression function (18). Least squares estimators are critically
dependent on both the sample selection rule and the length of the panel.
Two studies that utilize the same sample selection rule for generating
"usable" observations will produce different regression coefficients if the
studies are based on panels of different length.
           It is possible to estimate the true structural parameters of the model.
The maximum likelihood estimator discussed in section (1) automatically
corrects for the panel length bias. Moreover, it is obvious from our
exponential examples that by use of non—linear regression it is possible to
retrieve the structural parameters of interest.
           The sane main conclusions can be obtained if we relax the simvlying
assumption that the process starts up at the origin data of the panel.                In

      1Thus in testing for "mean occurrence dependence" (i.e., different
regression ftrnctioas -for- consecutive spells), the sample selection bias
discussed in the text does not bias the test based on regression methods.
This result is critically dependent on the assumption that the 2 variables
r'nn constant both within and across spells, and of course, that the same
rule is used to generate first and second spells.

duration dependence regression estimators that     do   not correctly account for

thelength of tine spent in a spell prior to the time the panel begins are
subject to a further source of bias. Except for exponential duration
distributions, the distribution of a left censored first spell is not the
sane as the distribution of an uncensored spell. (See equation (11)).
the   conditional expectation of a left censored distribution is     not the
sane as the conditional expectation of the uncensored distribution. As
noted in section (t.d), the maximum likelihood estimator can be used to
correct for this source of bias as wefl.
        Regression methods for the analysis of duration data also break down
in    the   presence of time varying explanatory variables. The functional
forms of the regression equations depend on the tine paths of the explanatory
variables. Even if the lengths of consecutive spells of an event are
generated by hazard functions of identical functional form, the regression
functions for durations of consecutive events will, have different functional.
forms. In the presence of unmeasured heterogeneity components, regression
equations fit conditional on the "exogenous variables" measured starting at
the onset of a spell may generate biased coefficients. This is so because
the particular values assumed by the explanatory variables selected in this
fashion may depend on the lengths of the preceding spells. This is certainly
the case for tine trended explanatory variables like age, and in the
enpirical work we report below, it is also the case for our national
unemployment rate variable. Assuming that unmeasured heterogeneity components
are correlated across spefls, the initial values of time trended varIables
in a - spell will be correlated with the regression error term, and will, become
eztdogenous     variables • For the usual reasons, least squares estimators will
be biased.
                                                 39


        To focus on the essential aspects of the problem, suppose that we have
access to a very long panel data set (T-) so that we can safely ignore the
length of panel bias previously considered. As before, there is only one
type of event and we assume that the stochastic process begins at the
beg4.mlng of our sample. The duration tine distribution depends on time
varying variables Z(t) where r          denotes        calendar time measured from the
origin of cur sample.
      A coon functional form for the hazard function, h(.), is assumed for
all spells. "V'1 is a heterogeneity component common across all spells.
The density of duration tine in the first spell, t1, is

                                                          ti

The density     for   the duration tine in        the    second spell t2      given   that the

first   spell   ends at calendar tine .a          is


        Conditional Second Spell: h(t2, Z(t2 +                 ti), V)exp— f h(u,       Z(u +t1), V) du.

Othenjise the marginal second spell density will be                     of   a different functional

 fan than the marginal first spell density, and the regression functIon for

 the second spell wifl have a functional-form different from that of the first

 spell regression function.

         A snple example may serve to clarify the main points. We fIrst

 demonstrate         that the functional form of the regression will depend on the
 time path of the exogenous             variables     that drive the model. Consider the
 following         exponential model for the first spell of             an event:


                       f(tjlZ,   V) —   6(Z,V)e'1,

 where 8(Z,V) —                  ,   and Z remains constant over the entIre spell. The

 regression         function for duration in the fIrst spell is


(26)                                 E(tiIZ,     •            —     + V.

The funct±onal fan of the regression equation (27 )                    differs         dramatIcally
from that      of (26 ),    and   the problems of       inference   and parameter estimation
differ    greatly    between the two equations. In general, different tine paths

for the exogenous variables will result in different functIonal forms for

the    regression equations.
         A coonly used regression procedure far the                  analysis of duration

data   computes regression equations conditional               on the values           of exogenous
variables that occur at or after the start date of a spell. The Intuition
that underlies this procedure is that it is only the variables that occur
during a spell that can explain the duration of a spell. In the presence
of unobserved heterogeneity components correlated across spells this
procedure      is inherently dangerous. In the presence of heterogeneIty,

selection      of   explanatory   variables in      this fashion converts exogenous

variables into endogenous ones, and guarantees simultaneous equations bias

in least squares estimators.

         to show this,      assune      the sane functIonal fan for the hazard function

in   all spells of the event. The conditional expectation of duration in the
second spell given values of the exogenous variables that confront the
individual after the end of the first soell is• f or a case of no time varying

        Although equations (29 ) and           (27 )   are oi the sane functional fo,
there is one important dfferenc2: in equation (29 )               t   is   an explanatory

vartable. Since unobserved heterogeneity cornponent V is correlated across

spells, t1     is   an endogenous variable in a regression model that treats V as

a component of the error ten of the model (i.e., a model that is not

computed conditional on 7). Partitioning the data on the basis of ti                 < t1
raises further problems. By           Bayes theorem, the conditional mean of V Lu

equations    (29 )    and   (30 )   depends   on ti and the explanatory varLables so
that the error term (inclusive of V) associated with regression specifications
for equations (29) or (30) does not in general have a zero mean. A standard
least squares assution is violated and least squares estimators of duration
equations will be biased and inconsistent.
        The maIn point is quite general: whenever there are tine trended
or nonstationary explanatory variables in the modal, condItioning the
durations of subsequent spells on exvlanatory varIables measured from the
onset of those spells induces correlation between the explanatory variables
and the heterogeneity component in the odelJ
        One solutIon to these problems is to use the marelnal second spell

within a spell in a standard linear regression format • 1 This procedure
ignores the change in functional form that results from different paths for
regressors. It fails to capture the essential dependence of first passage
time densities on the entire sequence of exogenous variables, not just those
realized      in a spell. Exogenous variables that are selected in this fashion
become endogenous     variables. To demonstrate this final point by way of an example
consider a strictly positively treaded explanatory variable. The average
value of the variable within a spell is simply the multiple of the length of
the   spell, and is learly endogenous.

        A.   second ad hoc procedure for introducing time varying variables into
a regression format is to use exogenous variables measured at a start of a
spell. Again, this procedure results in a misspecification of the true
conditional expectation function and for nonstationary explanatory variables
manufactures simultaneous equations bias         for models with heterogeneity
components by selecting "explanatory" variables on the basis of prior
realizations of the process.
        The standard regression approach to the analysis of duration data is
thus seen to be a rather fragile empirical procedure. Only in the case of
long panels in stationary economic enviroents does it produce valid
parameter estimates •     These   conditions are unlikely to be realized in the
analysis of microeconomic labor market data. The likei.iiaood approach corrects
for length of panel bias and suitably modified corrects for other sampling rules.
Tine varying explanatory variables can readily be accommodated in the
likelihood approach. For both reasons, we strongly prifer the likelihood
approach to the regression approach In the analysis of labor market duratIon
data.

      1Cox and Lewis suggest this approach but only for explanatory
7ariables that are not strongly time treaded.

          This   section reports the results of two     empirical analyses.   Sub-

section A compares empirical results obtained from regression and maximum
likelihood procedures used to analyze spells of employment and nonemployment
for a sample of young men. Our results from this analysis are of considerable
substantive interest, and also serve to illustrate the biases inherent in
using regression technicues to analyze duration data. Subsection B presents
tests of the proposition that it is legitimate to aggregate the "unemployment"
and "out of labor force" states into one state called nonemployment. This
proposition is of interest given recent claims that the distinction between
the two nonemploynent states is artificial (see, e.g., Clark and         SummerS).


We find   that the states are empirically distinct.

            sample used to perform all the empirical work reported here is
          The

selected from the National Longitudinal Survey of Young Men, and is the same
as that previously employed by Hecican        and   Borjas. We follow 122 young men

for thin consecutive months, from the         time they graduate from high school.
                                                               criteria
The small size of our sample is due to the stringent selection
 imposed. to be included in the sample an individual must (1) be

white; (2) have received a high school diploma in the spring or early suer

of 1969; and (3) not have returned to school in the period beginning in the

fall of 1969 and ending        in   December of 1971.

            The sample was selected in this manner in an attempt to minimize the

initial     conditions problem discussed in part d of Section I. By using indi-

viduals     who have   recently completed schooling, we have selected individuals

with    little or no previous labor force experience. The vast majority of
individuals in our sample have not worked in full time jobs during high school.
We can safely ignore the initial conditions problem in deriving the maximum
likelihood estimates presented here.                                              I




A.  Comparison of Regression and Maximum Likelihood
Estimates of Employment and ?cnemployment
SoeJ.l Duration
            The regression specification employed here is similar to the !eibull
model used by Heckman and Borjas. A more complete discussion of the
Weibull regression model and its statistical properties is presented in
Appendix B •     We assume   that duration tines conditional on heterogeneity com-
ponents are Weibull distributed, and consider the first two completed spells
of employment and nonemploymenc. In terms of hazard (5)' the specification
estimated is obtained by setting 1•—                    — 0, and   Z(u + t1) Z1   for

o    <u c    t,   j 1, 2,    where   1 — employment "e" and 2 — nonemployment "ix."
            that t. is the date in calendar tine at which the j        spell of event
(Recall
.1   begins.)   The last   condition imposes the requirement that the values of the
exogenous variables are fixed over the duration of a spell. In our empirical
analysis the values of the exogenous variables are fixed in two different ways.
In    the first way, we fix the exogenous variables at their beginning of spell

values, so that

           As noted in   Section III restricting attention in the empirical

analysis    to completed spells of events generates sample selection bias. In
our empirical work, we lose apprwd.mately two—thirds of our sample by imposing
this sample selection requirement.
           We include only two regressors in the empirical results presented
here; the first is a duny variable set to one if the individual is married
with spouse ptesent (ItlSP)    and   zero otherwise and the second is the national
unemployment rate for prime age white males. The second variable is a proxy
for aggregate demand. In addition to the first—differenced specification
described above, we also present estimates of a two equation system of first
and second spell completed log duration times using generalized least squares.
           A topic of considerable interest in estimating the regression equations
is the      determination of the sensitivity of parameter estimates to the
method used to select spefl constant values for the time varying exogenous
variables. For the regressors used here, the national unemployment rate varies
by month, while marital status is observed yearly. In our sample period
(1969—1971) the within spell, variation of the unemployment variable is likely
to be far greater than that of marital status. We thus expect to find that
the parameters associated with unemployment wifl show more sensitivity to
the method of selecting spell constant exogenous variables.
           Since the regression approach has been shown to yield biased parameter
estimates (see Section In) it is difficult to isolate the effect of fixing
the exogenous variables over spells using the two regression methods examined
here. To provide a benchmark we present maximum likelihood estimates of the
Weibull duration model using both methods of fixing the exogenous variables.
We then incorporate time varying variables. Differences among the estimates
are considerable.
                                           49

        Regression results for log employment durations are presented in
table 1. The top panel contains the estimates of the two spell aS model,
while the lower panel contains estimates from the first difference specif i—
cation. On tl left side of the table the values of the regressors is the
average value over the spell          and on the right side of the values are
those observed in the first month of the spell (zr.       As   discussed in Section
In the second method of fixing the regressors cay also produce biased co-
efficients because the values of the "exogenous variables" at the start of
the second spefl of an event will depend on the lengths of previous spells
of events if the true exogenous variables are tine treaded. In our sample of
thirty months the memployment measure has an extreme positive time trend.
        The two methods for fixing the regressors produce large differences
in parameter estimates. Although most parameters are not significantly dif-
ferent from zero by conventional standards, the coefficient of the imemploy—
meat rate in the first spell GLS equations using      is three tines as large
as the coefficient based on      . The sign of estimated second spell co-

efficient enployment rate differs depending on the method used to fix time
varying variables •   The   coefficients associated with marital status are
statistically insignificant and are much less sensitive to the method of
selecting explanatory variables.
        The two regression specifications yield very different parameter esti-
mates. For the model using       the estimate of the coefficient of unemploy-
ment for second spell duration is .531 in the aS system as opposed to .858
from the first difference specification. The coefficients of the unemploy-
ment rate on first spell, employment duration are 9.31 in the first difference
specification and-6.523 in the GLS system. These disparities and the generally
poor fits demonstrate the difficulties inherent in the regression approach.

rate is time trended in our sample, using the aveage value of the emloyment
rate as a regressor causes longer duratIon tines to be associated with higher
within spell unemployment rates for purely echanica.L reasons. A strong
empirical, relationship is found not because of any causal -link, but only
because the unemployment measure is a transformation of the dependent variable.

       We now discuss estimates obtained from maximum likelihood estimation
of the parameters of the hazard function (5). In order to compare these
estimates to those from the regressions, we initially adopt a Weibull speci-
fication. The coefficient associated with the log of the duration in the

parameterization of duration dependence and compare results from this model
with those from the Weibull.

in virtually all transitions. However, spurious negative duration dependence
can be generated by not properly accounting for population heterogeneity.
In fact, when heterogeneity is introduced in the model there is no evidence of
duration dependence in the employment to nonemployment transition (see table 4).

spell results in a parameter estimate almost one half as large ft absolute
value as the coeff±c±ent value that results from using the average spell
value in the employment to nonemoloyment transition. In the nonemploynent—
piovm        equations   the method of introducing exogenous variables has little

effect on the value of the MSP parameter, though in all cases the coefficient
is approximately equal to its standard error. In all three panels the inter-
pretation of the effect of marital status on exit tines is the same: mdi-
viduals married with spouse present have lower rates of transition out of
employment and higher rates of transition from noneloyment than others.
-
       The   differences in parameter estimates are much more extreme for the
coefficients of the prime age male unemployment variabla. Recall that this
variable is strongly time treaded. The coefficients of the unemployment
variable in both panels A and B are highly significant for the employment—
nonemploymant transition, but are of opoosite Ei2n. Allowing the variables
to change over the spell results in an estimate which is positive but not
statistically significant. Use of spell constant regressors leads to dra-
matically different interpretations depending on the technique employed to
arrive at a spell constant value. This same remark is true with regard to the
unemployment rate coefficients in the nonemployment-employment transition.
Taken as a whole, these results demonstrate the seriousness of the biases intro-
duced into the parameter estimates by restricting the vartability of exogenous
variables. These findings cast considerable doubt on the value of regression
nethods for estimating duration models.
        We next turn to an investigat±on of the effects of not controlling
for heterogeneity on estimates of duration dependence. The specification of
the one factor scheme we adopt is given in equation (6) in Sect±on I. The same
set of regressors is used as was used in the estimatIon of the model in table

          It is interesting to note that unobservable heterogeneity is                 an   impor-
tant determinant of the rate of transition out of the employment state, but has
little effect on the rate of leaving nonemployment. There has been much attention
given to separating the effect of heterogeneity and state dependence in the
length of nonemployment spells, but our estimates suggest that for young nen
estimates   of duration dependence are not affected by the inclusion of                 hetero-
geneity into the model. However, the duration dependence            Effect vanishes with
the introduction of heterogeneity in the employment-nonemployment transition.
The introduction of heterogeneity reduces the agnitude of                all   the parameters
(with the excation of the constant) in the emoloynent equation, while the
coefficIents in the nonemployment equation are barely affected.
          These findings indicate that employment—nonemploynent transitIon
prcbabili:Ies are non{arkovian and call into question the standard dLscreta
tine 24arkcv assumption widely used        in   Labor   arket analysts    (see, e.g.,
                                         Do

aarston,    1976). The source of departure from the Markov model differs be-

tween the    employment to noneraployment transition and the rtonemployment tO
employment transition. The former transition is non—Markovian because of tin—
controlled heterogeneity which gives rise to the classical mover—stayer
problem. The latter transition is     non—Markovian because of   structural dura-
tion dependence.
           All the estimation done up to this point has been predicated on the
assumption that the exit time distributions are Weibuil. We now relax this
assumption. We estimate a model which allows for general- forms of duration
dependence. This specification is obtained by letting            —   1   and   —   2

for all values of j and £ (see equation 5). Empirical results are presented
in table 5 f or models estimated with and without heterogeneity corrections. The
models estimated without heterogeneity show some evidence of linear duration
dependence in the E to N transition, while the hazard associated with the N to E
transition appears to be nonmonotonic in duration. Except for the unemployment
rate coefficient in the E to N transition, the estimates of the coefficients of
the explanatory variables do not differ much from the estimates obtained in the
Weibull model. When the heterogeneity correction is added, there is no evidence
of duration dependence in the rate of leaving employment. Recall that a similar
result was found in the Weibuli. case. Fot the nonernployinent to emDloyment transi-
tion, the exit rate to employment also appears to be a linear function of duration.
In our data we do not reject the null hypothesis that the squared duration term is
insienificant in each of the transition densicies. Assuming that this is so, it
then become possible to test between the Weibull (X .        0) and Gompertz (X .,       1)

specifications. The difference in log likelihoods between the two models
is neglIgible (—739.2 vs —740.6). The evidence suggests a slight preference
for the Weibull specification. The estimates of the coefficients of the explana—
tory varSables do not change much between those specifitat±ons, and for the sake
of brevtty we do riot report the detailed empirical results from this odel.

the labor force" into a conon "nonenployed" category. There- is considerable
controversy         in the literature over the issue of whether or not the      categories
"unemployed" and "out of the labor force" are behaviorally distinct labor
force states (Lucas). This issue is particularly relevant in the study of the

labor market dynamics         of youth.    Given the range   of   nonmarket options available

to       many youths, and given practices of many state unemployment compensation
agencies which affactively limit the eligibility for unenoloyment compensation
of many youths, it seems especially likely that there is no distinction between
"unemployment" and "out of the labor force" status for young people. Recent


     1Corents by Gary Chamberlain have greatly improved this section of the paper,
and eliminated several errors that appeared in previous drafts.
                                       58

papers by Clark and Suers and Eliwood have made this claim. In this section
of the paper we present a test of this proposition and reject it. We find
that distinct behavioral equations govern transitions from out of the labor force
to employment and from unemployment to employment.
        Recent theory suggests that being "imemployed" and   "out of   the labor force"
describes different    behavior. Por example, in search theory (e.g., Burdect and

Mortensen)   a key difference between unemployed individuals and those out of the
labor force is that the former are at an interior point with respect to the
optimal amount of tine they devote to search while the latter are at a corner and
spend no time searching.     Separate behavioral equations generate observations in
these two    states.

          Even   though these theoretical distinctions are widely accepted, many
economists claim that the empirical distinction between reported "unemployment"
and reported "out of the labor force" is so arbitrary that it is of little
or no analytical value. This point would seem to have some merit after examining
the official current population survey definitIon of unemployment, which defines
those individuals as unemployed !twho had no employment during the survey week,
were available for work, and (1) had engaged in any specific job seeking activity
within   the past four weeks, (2) were waiting to be called back to a job from which

they   had been laid off, or (3) were   waiting to report toa new wage or salary
job scheduled to start within the following 30 days." Because there is no
stipulation as to the quality or quantity of searches made within the month,
the unemployment—out of the labor force distinction may be of little value in
predicting employment probabilities for the nonemployed.
           In this lection we present a test to determine whether pr not the classi-
fications "u" (unemployed) and "o" (out of the labor force) are behaviorally
meaningless distinctions. The idea underlying the test is as follows: controlling
for    heterogeneity if the hazard rate for exit   to employment    from unemployment
(h) is the same as the hazard rate for exit to employment out of the labor force
        the origin state ("o" or "u") is irrelevant in determining the rate at
which individuals leave nonemployment to go to employment. In a simple 3 state
Markov model, this test is equivalent to testing the proposition that the two
nonemploynent states can be aggregated into a single state and a properly specified
two state Narkov model can be defined for employment and nonemployment. To simplify
the exposition we assume that there is no heterogeneity in observed or unobserved
characteristics. This assumption is not essential and is not used in performing
the empirical work reported below.
           To motivate the test, we consider two cases. The fIrst case assumes that
                                               60

individuals exit      employment    at a rate governed by density f(t). The
probability that a person teninating employment classifies himself as a
'u"   or   "o" is determined by tossing a coin that comes up "u" fraction T
of    the time and   110?!   fraction 1—it of the time. Once acquired the person
keeps   these labels as long as he is nonemployed so there is no switching
between "o" and "u" states (a patently counterfactuai. case). The density
of duration in the nonemployment state is governed by density f(t).
The associated hazard h     is


                                    h
                                                    f(t)

The hazard rate for entry to employment will be the same whether or not the
nonemployed individual is classified as an "o" or an "u".1
        In the second case considered here, individuals are allowed to switch
their reported nonemployment status "randomly't. By this we mean that initial
nonemployment classification is random (governed as before by a toss of the
coin) and that individuals switch randomly between "o" and "u". The continuous time
analogue of discrete time independent Bernoulli trials is an exponential waiting tine
model (Cox, 1962). Write the hazard for durations from "o" to "ti'   hoiland the
                                                                     as

while the density of time spent going from u to e (t) is


                           hue exp -(h+h)t }
Individuals may change among reported nonemployment states for whatever reason. All
that is required for the origin state (o or u) to be irrelevant for characterizing
transitions from nonemployment to employment is for h— h.

     1The proof is triv±al. Assume fn(tn) is not defective so that
            1. The hazard rate for exit from unemployment to employment is

                          htie
                                       Tf(t)

                                  if   —if P(t)    n

The term in the denominator is the probability that the exit occurs from u
to e after time t. A parallel argent demonstrates that hoe            h

To demonstrate this it is most convenient to work with the state probability
representation of the three state Markov model. Define PJt) as the probability
that state j is occupied at tine t and P(t) as the instantaneous rate of change
of this probability. The three state generalization of the two state model
presented in Section I.b is

        This interpretation of the test is also informative in that ft makes
precise the sense in which o and ii are "irrelevant". Aggregating o and
u into a single state for the purpose of statistical analysis does not alter
the Narkov property of the model. The rate at which indl':iduals leave nonem—
ployment to enter employment does not depend on which nonemployment state in-
dividuals are in.
        It is tempting to extend this type of reasoning to consider transitions
from employment to the two nonemploynent states. Thus it might be argued that
U u and o are "irrelevant" distinctions, the rate of transition from e
to u (heu) whould be the same as the rate of transition from e to o Clieo ).

magnitude of the parameters is to be expected given that we are attempting to
estimate twenty parameters with so few degrees of freedom. The parameter signs
are generally consistent with our earlier results from the employment—nonemploy—
ment model. Only the constant tens and the factor loading of the employment
to unemployment transition are greater than twice their standard errors.

       This paper presents new econometric methods for the empirical analysis
of individual labor market histories. The techniques developed here extend
previous work on continuous tine models in four ways: (1) A structural
economic interpretation of these models is presented. (2) Time varying
explanatory variables are. introduced into the analysis in a general way.
(3) Unobserved heterogeneity components are permitted to. be correlated across
spells. (4) A fleble model of duration dependence is presented that accom-
modates many previous models as a special. case and that permits tests among
competing specifications within a unified framework. In addition, longer
range types of state dependence can be introduced into the model and their
empirical importance tested with our model.
        We contrast our methods with more conventional discrete tine and
regression procedures. The parameters of continuous time models are invariant
to the sampling time unit used to record observations •   Parameters   of discrete
time models defined for one time unit are not in general comparable to para-
meters of discrete time models defined for other tine units. Two problems
plague the regression approach to analyzing duration data which do not plague
the likelihood approach advocated in this paper. The first problem is that
standard regression estimators are ill equipped to deal with censored spells
of events that arise in short panels. The second problem is that the regres-
sion approach cannot be readily adopted to accoimnodate time varying explana-
tory variables. The functional forms of regression functions depend on the
                                      66
                                       67

time paths of the explanatory variables. Ad hoc solutions to this problem
can make exogenous variables andogenous to the nodel and so can induce simul—
taneous equations bias. The likelihood approach advocated in this paper can
readily accoodate time varying explanatory variables.
        Two sets of empirical results are presented. The first set is an
analysis of employment and nonemployment data using both regression and
maximtnn likelihood procedures. Standard regression methods are shown to
perform rather poorly, and to produce estimates wildly at variance with the
estimates from our maximum likelihood procedure. The maximum likelihood
estimates are more in accord with a priori theoretical notions. A major con-
clusion of this analysis is that, the discrete time Markov modal widely used
in labor market analysis is inconsistent with the data.
        The second set of empirical, results is a test of the hypothesis that
"employment" and "out of the labor force" are behaviorafly different labor
market states. Concraty to recent claims, we find that they are separate

             The Likelihood Function for a Xultistate—Multievisode model.

            In this appendix we discuss general issues in the estimation of con-

tinuous time probability models and the pirticular features of the Likelihood

function we employ in the empirical work presented in the text. Since our

data start at the beginning of the labor market history of individuals, we

can safety ignore the initial conditions problem discussed in the text.                      tie


defer a general discussion of this problem to a later paper.

            Let there be N states the individual can occupy at any moment of
        -

time.       If
             the individual begins "life" in              state I there are N—l "latent times"

with    densities

and h1(.) is the associated hazard function. The jcint density of the N—I

This tern enters the likelihood function for, spells uncompleted as of the end
of sample period T. In this mazner all spells, not only completed ones, are
used in the estimation of the parameters of the hazard function. This is not
the case in regression analyses of durations in a state (or some transforma-
tion of duration) on ccogenous variables, there only completed spells can be
used in a straightforward fashion.

        We now describe in some detail the specific form of the likelihood
 function used in the analysis performed here. Let Z (u + r ' be a K x 1rm             rm
vector of explanatory variables of the rt individual in his th spell at time
 (u + t), where u is the duration of time spent in the current spell,                           and

 t   is the date in calendar tine at which the individual, began his th spall.
Included among the explanatory variables are functions of the spell duration
variables. In          particular, the form of Z'(u +            rrm) is
                 [1 ZIrm(u+T       rut
                                         )...    Z

                                                               (u+t )V]

 The      last element of Z is an unobserved heterogeneity term, invariant over
 tine for the Individual, which is assumed to have a standard normal
 distribution,          i.e.

The Weibull Regression Model
                                             82




            This appendix presents a brief derivation and discussion of the

Weibull regression model utilized by Rectan           and Borjas    and employed

in this paper as well. We derive the conditional regression function of

the log of duration in the jth spell of state L, Zn t, discuss the distri-

bution of the regression errors and demonstrate how it is possible to estimate

duration dependence parameters using regression analysis. The efficiency

of least squares estimators relative to maximum likelihood is derived for

a special case.
                                -




            The regression model derived here is the conditional regression

function   computed with respect to the density generated by hazard function
(3)   in the text with exogenous variables assumed to be fixed within each
spell   at value Z1 and with              a 0 and      —   0.   To simplify notation tje define

      in    place of        in      the more general model. The hazard function that
generates the density of duration times is

Thus   the characteriscic function does not depend on B1 as asserted and
the moments of              are not functions of Z., 3jL' or V. Differentiating
the haractaristic function              produces       the moments stated above.

          The density of               can   be     obtained by a direct application of the

                   Estimation and Identification in the Weibull Model

              Under standard assumptions, least squares estimators of           derived

from samples of durations of the jth spell of event L are unbiased, consistent

but not efficient. Consistency is achieved in the usual cross—sectional

sense: by letting the number of individuals in the sample become large.

The lack of efficiency is due to the highly nonnormal skewed distribution

of        and is proved in the next section for an instructive special case.

              Provided that the intercept term in        is zero, it is possible

under certain conditions to estimate l4-. The intercept term in the re—

parameterized model is

                        Tjz+l
 If the estimated intercept is negative, it is possible to solve for

 uniquely from the estimated intercept in the reparameterized
                                                                      model. If

 the estimated intercept is positive, and less than or equal to exp{r'(l)l},

 a solution exists but is not unique unless it equals exp{r'(l)l}.

               In the general case, it is not possible to consistently estimate
                                                                          that further

Given consistent estimators of these parameters, it is clearly possible to

           These estimators   of the duration dependence parameters are sensitive

to   measurement error in the dependent variable that is independently dis-

These attributes cannot be diráctly observed.       Because of fixed costs of hiring.

or may not be smaller hence the expected search tifle in spell n—i ay be shorter

or longer than for spell n. However, if it is assumed that the distributions

differ only in the mean, then workers with n—I jobs necessarily search lass on

the average than workers with it                    or   more jobs.

This   generates   structural occurrence dependence.

           This mode],   can be extended to account    for   age although it      is   not
especially illuminating to do so. However, it           is   obvious that employers
would utilize age to       estimate   mismatch and   turnover   propensities. Holding
P fixed,    older workers will    hold   more jobs than   younger    workers. Moreover,
it   isalso clear    that the length of previous employment          spells may also

provide information about expected worker productivity. This gives rise to
lagged duration dependence as defined by Hecknian and              Borjas   (1980).
