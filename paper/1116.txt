        The Impact of Right—to—Work Laws on Union Organizing



                              ABSTRACT



     In contrast to previous studies which have examined the impact of

Right—to—Work (RTW) laws on the level or stock of union membership, this

paper examines their impact on the most updated flow into membership and

the organizing of workers through certified elections. Since detailed

annual data are available by state, we are able to estimate an accelerator

model of the flow into unionism, and adjust for possible omitted variable

and simultaneity bias. The results show dramatic falls in organizing

immediately after the passage of a RTW law, with more moderate declines

in later years, just as an accelerator model could predict. Overall, the

results are consistent with a 5—10 percent reduction in unionism as a

result of the passage of RTW laws.

     Perhaps no controversy in recent American labor relations has

catalyzed such confrontation or stirred such strong emotions as the

battle over 'right-to-work" (RTW) laws. The 1947 Taft-Hartley amendments

to the Wagner Act granted states the power to pass laws which outlaw the

union shop -- a contract provision which requires new employees to join

and pay dues to the union.1 Table 1 displays the states where laws have

been passed and the date of passage. A few states passed laws prior to

1947 but their legal status ws in jeopardy until Taft-Hartley.

     The philosophical debate turns on the classic confrontation between

freedom and free riders. Unions certified by the National Labor Relations

Board (NLRB) as the bargaining acient for a group of workers known as the

bargaining unit must represent all the employees in the unit in negotiations

and grievance handling, whether or not they join the union. Dependinci

on one's perspective then, union security clauses either ensure that

workers pay their fair share of representation costs or force them to

join an organization which they do not necessarily favor.

     The controversy over these laws is a puzzle to many labor economists

because most recent studies have found that RTW laws have little real

impact on the level of union membership in a state.       Most authors

conclude, to paraphrase the words of Fredrick Meyers in l959, that the

laws are symbol not substance.

     The important academic question involves the quantitative impact of

RIW laws on unions. Most previous studies have examined the impact of

these laws on the level (or stock) of union membership in a state.

In contrast we explore the impact of the laws on union organizing --

a flow into organizing. By focusing on the flows rather than stocks, we

can simultaneously examine two questions. We can of course collect

evidence of the impact of RTW laws on organizing itself. And we can qain

considerable insight into the impact of the laws on the level of unionism

since adjustments to the stock must come in the form of flows. Moreover

our emphasis on organizing provides us with an opportunity to overcome

some of the methodological problems which have confronted previous authors.

     It is our finding that the number of workers in newly organized

bargaining units is substantilly reduced in the first decade after

passage of a right-to-work law, particularly in the first five years.

The reduction arises largely from a shrinking in the number of certifi-

cation elections held and from a reduction in the average number of workers

in each new unit.   In later years the effects are relatively small.

Our results suggest that a decade after passacie, the reduced organizing

will have lead to a 5% reduction in the number of union members, and our

results are consistent with a prediction that the 5% reduction is permanent.

Nonetheless our data does not allow definitive statements about the long

term effects the laws have on the level of unionism in a state partially

because we do not observe flows out of unionism and partially because

of uncertainty about the exact size of the long term impact on new organizinq.

     We begin with a discussion of stock models of union membership and

a discussion of some of the problems which have confronted previous authors.

We discuss an alternative approach which focuses on flows. We describe

our model and its specification. We present results for all fifty states

and then for seven states where data are available to allow controls

for fixed effects and for a rough test for simultaneity/exogeneity.

Next we decompose our dependent variable into several components to
                                            -4-




examine the mechanisms whereby unionism is reduced. We conclude with

a discussion of the results and their implications.


Stock Models of Unionism

        We take as our starting point the standard reduced form' model of the

stock of union membership which 'is common in the literature on the level

of union membership and which has been used commonly in the right-to-work

research. The proportion of workers who are union members in a state

is thought to be a function of a variety of exogenous variables including

demographic characteristics of the labor force, the tastes and preferences

of both workers and employers, economic conditions, and the presence

or absence of a right-to-work law. For simplicity of exposition we

represent this function as linear. Obviously this function could be

modeled as a logistic or any other non-linear fashion.

RTW coefficient is typically moderately sized (around -.10) and significant.

There are several obvious problems with such a specification, most notably

omitted variable bias and simultaneity.


Omitted Variable Bias

     The first problem is that measured variables included in the spec-

ification may not fully capture differences across states in attitudes

toward unions. Since a populous with strong anti-union attitudes is likely

to resist union organizing attempts and is also more likely to support

the passage of a RTW law, the RTW coefficient may spuriously capture the

impact of omitted attitudes, tastes, and preferences. The law itself

might have no impact, but states with such laws tend to be hostile toward

unions and thus we see a non-zero coefficient.

     The obvious solution to this problem is to exploit time-series

cross sectional data and allow for fixed state effects.4 In a two

period regression this amounts to a before/after type experiment. Unfor-

tunately, comparable data on the stock of union membership before and

after the passage of RTW laws are not available in most states. Membership

data published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) become available

only after 1964, nearly twenty years after the passage of many of the laws.

Prior to that the only state data available are those created by Troy

for 1939 and 1953. Comparisons between the BLS and Troy data are difficult

because Troy gathered his data from the financial records of unions whereas

the BLS data are based on union self-reporting of their membership. The

BLS figures are likely to overstate union membership relative to Troy,

particularly in RN states where many workers are covered under collective
bargaining contracts negotiated by unions but do not pay union dues.

Indeed, Troy specifically cautions against comparison of his data and

BLS information in assessing the impact of RTW laws.5

     Even ignoring these comparison problems, it seems unreasonable to

assume that omitted state differences in attitudes were roughly constant

between 1936 and 1964. Small impacts caused by the law might easily be

lost in the changing attitudes of the populous.


Simultaneity

     Other authors have wrestled with issues of causality and simultaneity.

The fear is that in states where unions command a larger share of the

work force, their political power is greater and thus they can influence

whether or not a right-to—work law is passed. Although this is arguably

similar to the omitted variable bias problem, it is conceptually distinct,

     The solution proposed by several authors is to estimate cross sectional,

simultaneous equations models where the level of union membership and the

probability of the state having a RTW law is estimated simultaneously.

The problem with these models is that identification is achieved either

through   the exclusion of one or several variables or by exploiting functional
form assumptions. Both methods have troubling implicatons. For example,
Moore and Newman6 include the percentage of the work force which is non-

agricultural and the population density in their equation which predicts

the presence or absence of a RTW law, but exclude these in their second

equation which explains the level of union membership. This exclusion

does not have obvious economic appeal. By contrast Warren and Strauss7

estimate a mixed logit model which requires no exclusions where identifica-

tion can be made by exploiting non-linearities in the system. Identification
                                    -7-


through functional form is always troubling. And in this case the esti-

mation technique constrains the coefficient on the RN variable to be

exactly equal to the coefficient on union membership in the RTW equation

times the variance of the error term in the union equation, a restriction

which also lacks economic appeal.


A Flows Approach

     We propose an alternative to the stock approach which exploits the

fact that data are available annually on the number of workers organized

under union certification elections certified by the National Labor Relations

Board (NLRB). Because our data are consistent over time, and because

flows can be a very sensitive indicator of a changed environment, this

approach allows us to conduct a more powerful test of the impact of RTW

laws than might be achieved with stock models. We are able to control

for omitted variable bias and to test for simultaneity bias.

     Potential bargaining units are established by the NLRB in particular

plants or for particular crafts. A union is certified by the NLRB as

the sole bargaining agent for a unit either by winning a certification

election or, much less comonly, through voluntary recognition of a union

by the employer. Under the election process, when at least 30% of the

workers in a potential bargaining unit sign organization cards asking to

be represented by a union, the NLRB will supervise a certification election.

If the union captures a majority of the votes cast, the union is certified

as the sole bargaining agent for all the workers in the unit regardless

of whether or not they join the union. Data on the number of elections

are available yearly by state after 1946, and on the number of workers

in newly certified bargaining units after 1950.
                                     -8-




Once established, these units remian unionized until the firm moves,

goes out of business, is sold to an employer who does not recognize the

union, or until a union decertification election is held.     In a state

with a constant labor force, unions can grow either by having new units

certified, or by growing along with firms that have already been organized.

Unions    decline when they are decertified and when the firms or trades
to   which they are linked shrink. If the   labor force is growing, unions
will   decline relatively if tftey are unsuccessful in organizing the new

workplaces and the workers in them. Even in steady state equilibrium

then there will be a need for new organizing since declines caused by

old firms shrinking or closing must be offset by organizing.

         When conditions change, and the equilibrium level of union membership

is higher or lower than the existing level, the stock must adjust somehow.

In many ways, the adjustment process is similar to that in a putty-clay

model of capital. Once established, bargaining units tend to remain in

place and decay or depreciate slowly because the units fortunes are largely

tied to the fortunes of the firm. Each year a few union plants go out

of business. The stock would be reduced if organizing did not compensate.

Just as in such models of capital, organizing (or new investment in union

capital stock) will be sensitive to changes in the union climate. And

changes which lead to a permanent reduction in the equilibrium level

of unionism will lead to dramatic falls in new organizing until the

stock has adjusted.

         We envision a partial adjustment accelerator model whereby:

                       =
                           "Decay" rate of existing units

        Suppose for example that passage of a RTW law actually caused the

equilibrium level of union membership as a percent of the labor force

to fall by 3 percentage points, say from 33% to 30%. Suppose the decay

rate was 5%, and that the size of the labor force is unchanaing. Then

prior to passage of the RTW law, 1.65% of the workforce would have to be

organized each year to maintain a steady state. After the law is passed,

if the rate of adjustment was .4, we would expect to see new organizing

fall to .45% in the year immediately following passage. (See Figure 1).

After the initial fall, organizing would increase slowly and would ultimately

stabilize at a new level of 1.5%. Thus in the first five years after

passage, organizing would be depressed by nearly 40% on average.       In the

next five organizing would be reduced about 20%. And ultimately it ought to

be 10% lower overall than previously. Such large changes in organizing

ought to be easy to observe and measure.

        By contrast the stock of union workers would decline by just

.6 percentage points or 2% in the first years and the decline would reach

10% only asymtotically. These smaller changes will be much harder to

detect. A primary advantage of the organizing data then is the much

greater sensitivity of flows to a changed environment. In addition, the

fact that annual data are available starting in 1951 means that in seven

states we can perform strong tests for omitted variable bias and simultan-

eity. We can easily allow for fixed effects over a relatively short time

series to control for omitte variable bias. And we can exploit the basic

ideas behind Granger/Sims causality tests to explore the seriousness of

simultaneity problems in the specification.

     We can estimate a model of new organizing and allow for fixed

state effects. This controls for any time invariant state to state

differences in tastes which might account for the passage of RTW laws in

some states, but not in others. Data are available on oroanizing both

before and after passage of RTW laws in the seven states which passed

such laws after 1955. For these states, we can estimate a fixed effects

model to examine the importance of omitted taste variables in the results

of the 50 state equation.

     It is possible, though, that tastes had changed over time in these

seven states or that unions lost power. These changes could explain why

a RTW law was finally passed. Thus, we might expect to see less organizing

in the period following passage of a RTW law because the mere passage

of the law indicates that anti-union sentiments were rising. Here again,

the law need have no real impact; it might merely reflect omitted variables

which influence union organizing. Since the omitted variables are changing

over time, fixed effects models will not adequately capture them.
                                    -12-



       The basic idea behind Granqer/Sims type causality tests is that events

cannot have an impact before they have occurred. If RTW laws have a real

impact on unionization, then their impact ouqht to be felt only after

the passage of the laws. By contrast, if passage of a RTW law indicates

the culmination of growing anti-union sentiments, organizing declines ought

to be as significant in the years just prior to passage as just after

passage. Assuming these new anti-union sentiments level off and a new

lower equilibrium level of union membership exists, the alternative pattern

is illustrated in Figure 2. So the important test is whether or not

organizing was diminished in the period just prior to passage as well

as the period just afterward.

       With annual data, then, we can impose rather strict tests of both

omitted variable bias and simultaneity. Fixed effects can be used to

test for omitted variable bias. A leading indicator of impending RN

passage can be used to test for simultaneity. If we do in fact observe

the pattern displayed in Figure 1, rather than some other pattern, it

is powerful evidence that RN laws do in fact have real impact.

       In fact since stock and flow models always have a correspondence,

these same methods could be applied to accurate annual data on the stock

of membership. The advantages to using an organizing model rather than

one based on stocks is that annual data are available and thiss flow

ought to be very sensitive to changes in the union environment. A 50%

change in a measured variable is much easier to capture than a 5% change.


A Model of Union Organizing

       We can begin with a simplistic model derived from equations (1) and

(2).    If we assume instantaneous adjustment we can derive:
                                   -13-




        ORGIt/LFt = LXitB + &RTW +               +           +
(3)                                  (LLFt/LFt       5)XtB       uft
      Although this instantaneous adjustment model is unrealistic, it

does point out that new organizaton is influenced by changes in exogenous

variables (including RTW), by the need to organize new workers when

the labor force is growing, and by the need to replace members lost to

the various flows out of unionism. A model that allows for non-instantan-

eous adjustment would look stmilar but it would include many lagged values

of X and RTW and LF.

      We experimented with a variety of specifications involving a consider-

able number of laqged independent variables, non-linear functional forms,

and multiple interactions. Ultimately we found a straightforward log-

linear specification, which included both levels of the explanatory

variables (the Xs) and the change in these variables in the previous

five years as the independent variables, to be the most stable and intelliq-

ible. For obvious reasons, we concentrated particular attention on our

RTW variable.

      We ran state cross-section annual time-series regressions for the

period from 1951 to 1977. Our primary dependent variable is the natural

log of ORG/LF --   the number of employees in bargaining units where unions
won an NLRB election divided by the non-agricultural labor force in the

state. As independent variables we have included variables which measure

demographic and industrial structure, local tastes and preferences, economic

conditions, and the governmental/legal environment.

      Demographic characteristics of workers are emphasized as important

determinants of the levels of union membership by virtually every student

of union membership.

The most commonly cited factors are sex and race. Women typically display

weaker labor force attachment than men. If their expected tenure is

shorter than that of their male counterparts, the present value of long

term gains to unionism is reduced so that the up-front organizational

costs are likely to be a greater deterrent to organizing a union.8

Blacks, on the other hand, may be more inclined toward unions as a defensive

reaction to employer discrimination.9 In addition, urban residents are

generally considered more likely to organize)0 Apparently, small towns

suffer diseconomies of scale and/or different attitudes toward unionism.

In our models, %FEMALE and %BLACKS and %URBAN represent the proportion of

the non-agricultural labor force which is female, black, living in urbanized

areas, respectively.

        Structural differences in the nature of the product or factor markets,

the nature of technology, and the "strategic position" of workers is the

cornerstone of the work of Dunlop, Shuster, and many others who analyze

union              These variables have obvious impact on the short and

long-run elasticity of demand for labor plus important implications for the

dynamics of relations between labor and management. The proportion of workers

in each one digit industry and occupation was therefore included in many of

our regressions. We also tested a more crude structural variable --      %BCW   --

the percentage of the state's non-agricultural work force which is in

blue—collar occupations.

        None of the demographic and structural variables are available

annually in the early period of our sample. Therefore, we collected the

information from the decennial Census of Population and used straight

line extrapolation to fill in the missing data. This methodology is
                                   —l 5-




unlikely to create a severe errors in variables problem since these

measures change only slowly over time.

      Local tastes and preferences have generally been cited to account

for the large differences in the level of unionization across states.

Studies of right-to-work laws have emphasized the importance of local

attitudes in stimulating RTW laws and in holding down the level of unionism.

This is the heart of the simultaneity issue and requires particular attention

in any RTW study even though o-ur methodology allows for a correction of these

problems. Ashenfelter and Pencavel used the percentage of a state's

Congressional delegation which was Democratic as a measure of attitudes

towards unions.12 We chose to use a similar but more sophisticated proxy.

The AFL-CIO publishes a so-called COPE rating for each Congressman based

on his/her voting record. Using this information, we derived our

own COPE rating for each state over five year periods based on the voting

behavior of a state's Congressional delegation on key labor issues over

that five year time. The variable was detrended so that the variable measures

preferences in the state relative to the national average over any five

year period. Changes in organization caused by movements in the national

average will be picked up on our time dumies as described below.

      Freeman and Medoff have pointed out that an important feature of

local tastes and preferences which has been ignored in most empirical

work, is local employer oppostion.' In our work we include a variable,

TOUGH, which represents the number of unfair labor practice charges

filed against employers divided by the number of elections in each state. We also

include a five year average change in both TOUGH and COPE in our models.
                                   -16-




      Finally, in our fifty state regression, region dummy variables are

 also included to attempt to capture any differences in attitudes prevalent

 in a particular region. The unique environment of the South may negatively

influence union organizing. This region may be difficult to organize

because of the nature, composition, and location of industry, the surplus

of low—income agricultural workers, the influence of racial prejudice,

the prevailing ideology, and the strong anti-union attitude existinq among

Southern workers, employers, .and the community at large. We include

four region dummies to control for any geographic variation. In later

seven state reqressions we allow for individual state effects eliminating

any stationary differences across states.

     Commons and Davis both pointed to economic conditions and cyclical

swings in employment and prices to explain union growth.14 Davis

postulated that grievances built up in downturns and could be acted upon

in the upswing. Both Davis and Ashenfelter—Pencavel suggested that sharp

price rises contributed to union growth. This latter finding is present

in several other works including Dunlop, Adams, and Krisklov.15 The

usual explanation for this findinc is that real wages fail to keep pace

with inflation and workers organize as a "defensive reaction." Price

changes may also be capturing business conditions or they may be co-

linear with the periods of "fundamental unrest," as emphasized by Dunlop.

     Individual year dummies were included to capture effects of national

business cycle swings. It is difficult to capture the business cycle by

state because unemployment rate data are not available until late in the

period. Our principal proxy is the percentage change in the manufacturing
                                  —17-




weekly wage. Presumably this variable captures relative tightness of the

labor market in an area. We used two versions of this variable. The

five year average rate of growth in wages, TRENDW, is an attempt to

capture something of the long-run tightness of the market. %CHGW is

the change in wage relative to this lonq-run trend. This latter variable

is introduced to capture the cycle within the state.

     No price indexes are available by state until late in our sample

period, thus we cannot test the hypothesis that rapid price increases

spur union organization. The impact of differences over time in the

national rate of inflation are captured by the individual year dummy

variables.

     In states where there is long term employment growth, unions will

have to engage in more organizing if they are to keep pace. Thus we

created a long term growth rate of employment, EMRATE. To minimize

the cyclical component of any measure of employment growth we created

five year moving average annualized growth rates.

     A partial adjustment accelerator model predicts a sharp fall in

organizing imediately after a RN law is passed and smaller declines

from the pre-law level in later years. We have separated the RTW

variable into a series of mutually exclusive dunrty variables designed to

capture the impact in five year intervals following passage of the law.

RTW1-5YR was 1 if and only if a RN law had been passed in the state

in the past five years. RTW6-1OYR was unity if a law was passed between

6 and 10 years previously and so on.
                                       -18-




        We began by running regressions for all fifty states without additional

controls for fixed effects or a leading RTW      indicator   to test for simul-

taneity. We then explored the potential problems that omitted variables

or simultaneity could be causing in these fifty state results by running

a separate set of regressions on the group of seven states where data

are available both before and after passage of a RTW law.


Fifty State Empirical Results

        The results presented on Table 3 are consistent with the model we

have advanced. The dernooraphic variables performed as expected. In

states with fewer women or more blacks in the labor force there is

more organizing. A five percentiqe point change in these variables

will lead to a ten and three percent increase in organizing respectively.

Similarly, states with five percentage points more urban workers have four

percent more organization.

        When structural variables representing the percentage of the work force

in one digit occupations or industries are included in the equation,

their coefficients are erratic and their effect on other variables minor.

The simple variable %BCW, representing the proportion of the work force

in blue collar occupations, performed better and was therefore included

instead of the more detailed measures.

        The   taste and preference variables captured a sizable proportion of
the explained variations in organizing. TOUGH performed exceptionally
well.    States with one standard deviation higher level of TOUGH show

organization rates almost 10% lower. Morever, changes over time are

also quite important. States where employers are becoming increasingly

hostile   to unionism, according to this measure, show reduced organiza-

tion. COPE, on the other hand, performed poorly. Neither levels or

changes seemed to affect organizing. TOUGH appears to dominate COPE.

If TOUGH is removed from the equation, COPE's performance improves con-

s iderably.


      The region dumies show a surprising pattern. When controls,

we used for demographics, structure, tastes and preferences, and the

presence of a RTW law were included, SOUTH no longer has a negative

coefficient. Indeed the coefficient was higher than those for North

or West. Without these controls the variable was strongly negative.

The lower rate of organizing in the South therefore can apparently be

 'explained" by the factors included in the equation.

     The short run cyclical variable %CHGW, the difference between the

annual wage change and the long run trend, had the expected positive

sign d was significant. Wage growth which is 6% higher than average,

yields a 10% increase in organizing. The long run trend in wages had

no influence here. Je experimented with a variety of functional forms

using lagged values of %CHGW; none yielded satisfactory results.

     As expected states with greater employment growth had higher levels

of organizing. A 10% growth rate in employment caused organizing to

grow by l7%.16 The yearly time dummies are not reported here, but

they show a strong negative trend. Relative to 1950, the 1977 dummy

shows that organization has fallen by 40%, other things equal.

     Finally we turn to examine the impact of RN laws based on the

fifty state regression.
                                     -23-




The Effects of RTW

     The coefficients on the RTW variables are quite consistent with

the hypothesis that the passage of a RTW law diminishes the equilibrium

level of unionism and that a partial adjustment model characterizes the

resulting changes in organizing. In the first five years following

passage of a RTW law in a state, organizing is reduced by 50%.      In


the next five years, it is reduced by roughly 25%.     In later years it

appears to be reduced somewh&t, though we do not have sufficient data

to conclude that the reduction is statistically significant.

     Over our sample period, employees in new bargaining units average

2% of all union workers --   i.e.   the flow is roughly 2% per year. If

organizing falls by 50% for five years and 25% during the next five,

then after 10 years, membership will be roughly 7% lower than it would

have been otherwise. If 7% was the true long run reduction, then once

the new equilibrium is achieved organizing should be permanently depressed

by 7%.   In our data, the standard errors on the dumy variables capturing

the impact of the laws after 10 years are typically around 8%. Thus

the modest 7% long term reduction could not show up as statistically

significant. The actual coefficients for the later years average closer

to 3 or 4%, though the coefficient designed to capture the period after

20 years is almost exactly what we would predict if RTW laws ultimately

caused a 7% decline in unionism (and organizing).

     Thus, these results seem to be consistent with an interpretation

that RTW laws ultimately diminish membership by 5 to 10% --    or   union

workers as a fraction of the total work force falls by between one and

three percentage points in most states. (This impact would be in addition

to the loss of membership that might occur if members of existing bargaining
                                    _2i1..




units choose not to be union members when union shop rules are eliminated.)

It is possible, however, that organizing is depressed only in the short

run. Then the stock would also be diminished only in the short-run. We

think it is more plausible that the stock is permanently reduced by 5 to 10%,

but other interpretations of the lonq-tern impact are possible.

     If there is a permanent reduction in the stock, it is easy to

see that with the relatively small sample sizes available for the stock

equations estimated by previous authors, a statistically significant

impact amounting to 5% might not be detected. After all, the standard

errors in our equations which have considerably more observations make

measurements that precise impossible.



     It is possible, however, that the results reported in these fifty

state regressions are spurious, and that either omitted variable bias

or simultaneity contaminates the results. We turn then to an examination

of these issues by exploring the impact of RTW laws in the seven states

where sufficient data on organizing is available both before and after

passage of the law to allow fixed effects and simultaneity tests.


Seven State Empirical Results

     It seems unlikely that time invariant differences across states

could account for the results we have observed. Generally we would not

expect   that fixed state differences could generate the pattern of a
declining impact of RTW laws as time    since   passage increases. Nonetheless
our first step was to determine the impact of fixed effects on a regression
based only on these seven states. Those results appear on Table 4.

Because of the smaller number of observations, we needed to make some

minor changes in our specification. We collapsed our RTW variables to

cover a longer interval. We allowed five year time dummies rather than

the individual year dummies we used in the fifty state regression. As

an additional test, in these regressions we also controlled for first

order serial correlation and for heterskedasticity using the Parks method.

     The   fixed effect results are remarkably similar to those found in
the fifty state regressions. In the first 10 years after passage, organ-
izing is   diminished 32% -- a figure very similar to the 39% average for

the first decade obtained by averaginq the first two five year coefficients

in the fifty state regression. After a decade, the impact is insignificant,

as in the fifty state case. And once again a large standard error

leaves open the possibility that organizing remains depressed by

5 or 10% in the long run.

     Thus, time invariant state differences do not seem to account for

the results we find. A second concern is that declining union strength

may allow passage of a RTtJ law. Thus reduced organizing and passage of

the law are both indications of recently reduced union power.   In this

case, a leading indicator of impending passage of a RTW law provides

an important test. If declining union strength leads to reduced organizing

and to the passage of the law, then the period prior to its passage

ought to be one where organizing is depressed reflecting the declines

in union power. If the RTW law itself causes the declines, then there

ought to be no reduction in organizing in the period prior to passage.

     We included a leading indicator, labeled PRE-RTW, as a exogeneity/

causality indicator in our seven state regression. This dummy variable
                                    -27-




took on the value of one only in the period five years before the passage

of a RTW law.    It thus captures any changes in organizing just prior to

passage of a RTW law.

      The results shown on Table 4 are quite striking. In the period

before the passage of RTW laws, organizing is not depressed. Indeed,

in these seven states, organizing was actually somewhat above average,

though the coefficient on PRE-RTW is not significant. The decline in

organizing seems to follow the passage of a RTW law, not precede it.

Indeed it is even possible that RN laws are passed when unions appear

to be becoming stronger (as evidenced by increased organizing) in order

to diminish their strength.

      A look at two states where RTW laws were recently passed or repealed

offers some final evidence. In the three years prior to passage of

Louisanaa RTW law in 1976, an average of 4,024 workers were organized

each year; in the three years after, the figure averaged 2,380.

        Indiana offers an ideal natural experiment because it is the only

state where a law was first passed and later repealed. Figure 3 reveals

a final bit of evidence that the effects of the law are real. Displayed

is   the number of workers in newly certified bargaining units per 1,000
non-agricultural workers. Two year moving averages were used to reduce
the variability of year-to-year fluctuations. There is a clear downward
trend    in organizing in the state over the period before the RN law

was passed. The trend was interrupted by a sudden drop in organizing

in the period when the law was in effect. It promptly resumed after

the law was repealed.

     Thus it appears that the results presented earlier are not the

product of omitted variable bias or simultaneity. They strongly sucigest

that organizing is dramatically depressed for roughly a decade after

passage of a right-to-work law and quite possibly is slightly reduced

permanently. The stock of union memberhsip falls between 5 and 10%

initially and this reduction may be permanent.

     The obvious question remains as to how or why RTW laws have the

impact they do. We cannot infer the exact reasons why laws diminish

organizing so sharply in the short run. We can, however, decompose

the decline and shed some light on the mechanism.


Decomposition of RN Laws Impact

     It is possible to decompose MEMB into several components and consider

the impact of RTW laws on each of these. The decomposition can be per-

formed as follows:


          ORG/LF = #ELECTIOS/LF X WON/ELECTIONS X ORG/#WON


          ORG/LF = ELECT X PERC X WINSIZE


     The number of new members (per 1,000 non-agricultural workers)

obtained through elections is the product of the number of elections

times the percent of elections won by the union times the average size

of the bargaining unit where elections are won. We ran separate regres-

sions on all fifty states for each of these variables. The RN coeffi-

cients from the fifty state regression are provided in Table 5.

     Right—to—work laws seem to have their most important impact in

reducing the number of elections held. Over half of the decline in

new membership in the ten years after passage can be attributed to a

decline in elections. The remainder of the effect is accounted for

largely by a reduction in the average size of units won. Over the

first decade after passage WINSIZE is reduced by roughly 16%.    Interest-

ingly, the laws have only a small effect on the proportion of elections

won.




       If employees are oraanied up to some threshold where expected benefits

equal expected costs, an increase in costs or reduction in benefits

will surely cause a decrease in elections.    If larger bargaining units

are more difficult to organize, presumably a change in the organizational

environment could result in the medium and smaller units being organized

first.    In general, we would not expect much change in the winning per-

centage. Presumably, unions organize plants up to some point where they

have a certain probability of winning. Organizers almost never call

elections until they have 65 percent of the workers to sign cards in

support of the unions. If this is the stopping rule, then the winning

percentage is unlikely to vary substantially.

       Thus organizing is clearly reduced in the short-run with fewer

elections and smaller winning unit sizes. The ultimate question is

why? The most obvious explanation is simply that passage of a RTW

law makes union membership less attractive. Without the ability to

enforce payment of dues or to fine those who cross the picket line,

unions may prove less powerful. Their strike threats are diminished

both by reduced financial resources and by less certain participation.

As a result after a right-to-work law is passed, membership is sharply
                                      -32-



 reduced as plants formerly at the margin are now far removed from it.

      There is a second interpretation which arose in discussions with

those on both sides of the controversy. A major part of the law's

impact may be through the pyschological/symbolic effect passage of a

RTW law may have on workers. Successful organization requires that a

few workers inside a plant take a highly visible and activist role.

The costs to these activists can be enormous, ranging from harrassment

to loss of their jobs. Even those who are not activists must take the

highly visible step of signing an authorization card. And in considering

whether or not to vote for a union, workers often fear they will lose

their jobs or suffer other costs if their company is hostile. Thus

the perceived strength of the union may be critical to the willingness

of activists and others to become involved in an organizing drive. A

highly visible defeat such as the passage of a RTW law (or the crushing

of PATCO) may severely damage the union's credibility and appeal to

workers. There is at least some evidence that the psychological impact

may be important. In Missouri, for example, after a RTW law was defeated,

new organizing jumped dramatically.


Conclusion

      Our results show a strong short-run reduction in union organizing

following the passage of a RTW law. Ommitted variable bias and simul-

taneity problems do not skew our findings. Organizing is reduced by

nearly 50% in the first five years after passage of a RN law and by

half that amount in the subsequent five. Overall our results suggest

that membership in unions is reduced between 5 and 10% after passage.

The findings are consistent with a permanent reduction of this magnitude

in the stock though it is also possible that the stock gradually recovers

over many decades.   It appears that right-to-work laws are not merely

symbols. They have real significant effects.

16.   This result does not imply that new organization is more common
      among new workers. On the contrary, it suggests a very low rate of
      organizing among new workers. With no employment growth, roughly
      2 percent of the work force are organized each year. With 10 percent
      annual growth in employment, unions should organize a third of the
      new workers—-or 3 percent of the labor force—-in addition to the pre-
      vious 2 percent, just to maintain their relative share of the work
      force. Instead organizing rises only to 2.5 percent. This result
      may in part reflect simultaneity. Firms are moving to the areas
      where organizing is difficult.
