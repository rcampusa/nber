Who Ran on Repo?

                                                ABSTRACT

The sale and repurchase (repo) market played a central role in the recent financial crisis. From the
second quarter of 2007 to the first quarter of 2009, net repo financing provided to U.S. banks and broker-dealers
fell by about $1.3 trillion – more than half of its pre-crisis total. Significant details of this “run on repo”
remain shrouded, however, because many of the providers of repo finance are lightly regulated or
unregulated cash pools. In this paper we supplement the best available official data sources with a
unique market survey to provide an updated picture of the dynamics of the repo run. We provide
evidence that the run was predominantly driven by the flight of foreign financial institutions, domestic
and offshore hedge funds, and other unregulated cash pools. Our analysis highlights the danger of
relying exclusively on data from regulated institutions, which would miss the most important parts
of the run.

1. Introduction
               Repo finance is a multi-trillion dollar market that plays a central role in the
modern financial system.1 From the second quarter of 2007 to the first quarter of 2009,
net repo financing provided to U.S. banks and broker-dealers fell by about $1.3 trillion –
more than half of its pre-crisis total. We argue in a series of papers (Gorton (2010),
Gorton and Metrick (2010a, 2010b, 2012)) that this “run on repo” played a crucial role in
the recent financial crisis. Significant details of this run remain shrouded, however,
because many of the providers of repo finance are lightly regulated or unregulated cash
pools. In this paper we supplement the best available official data sources with a unique
market survey to provide an updated picture of the dynamics of the repo run.                                                                                                   We
provide evidence that the run was predominantly driven by the flight of foreign financial
institutions, domestic and offshore hedge funds, and other unregulated cash pools. Our
analysis highlights the danger of relying exclusively on data from regulated institutions,
which would miss the most important parts of the run.
               Repo is divided into two different components – “tri-party repo” and “bilateral
repo” – with only tri-party having reliable data. In tri-party repo, a clearing bank stands
between borrowers and lenders. 2 The tri-party segment is dominated by regulated
institutions, and thus the data on tri-party repo is relatively complete.                                                                                     In contrast,
bilateral repo is the home of hedge funds, many types of offshore institutions, and other
unregulated cash pools. This data gap is significant, with an industry survey (discussed
below) finding that bilateral repo was about three times as large as tri-party repo in 2004.
               Section 2 uses Flow-of-Funds data to explore the dynamics of repo funding since
1999. These data combine all the main sources for tri-party repo with the available

  	  A	   repo	   contract	   is	   an	   arrangement	   in	   which	   one	   party,	   the	   depositor	   or	   lender,	   provides	   cash	   to	   the	  
other	   party,	   the	   borrower	   or	   bank.	   	   The	   contract	   is	   often	   overnight	   and	   is	   collateralized.	   	   So,	   the	  
borrowing	   bank	   provides	   bonds	   with	   a	   market	   equal	   to	   or	   great	   than	   the	   amount	   of	   cash	   the	  
depositor	   is	   providing.	   	   If	   the	   deposit	   is	   overcollateralized,	   there	   is	   said	   to	   be	   “haircut.”	   	   E.g.,	   if	   the	  
borrower	   deposits	   $90	   million	   dollars	   and	   the	   backing	   bonds	   are	   worth	   a	   market	   value	   of	   $100	  
million,	  then	  there	  is	  a	  10	  percent	  haircut.	  	  Other	  aspects	  of	  the	  repo	  contract	  are	  described	  in	  Gorton	  
and	  Metrick	  (2012).

  	  Industry	  terminology	  uses	  the	  terms	  “repo”	  and	  “reverse	  repo”	  to	  refer	  (not	  always	  consistently)	  to,	  
respectively,	  the	  sender	  and	  receiver	  of	  collateral.	  	  	  In	  the	  interest	  of	  clarity,	  we	  will	  avoid	  these	  
terms,	  instead	  using	  the	  traditional	  terms	  of	  “borrower”	  for	  the	  party	  that	  receives	  cash	  and	  provides	  
collateral,	  and	  “lender”	  for	  the	  reverse.	  	  “Borrowers”	  then	  have	  “repo	  liabilities”	  and	  “lenders”	  have	  
“repo	  assets”.	  	  


                                                                                                                                                                                   1
sources for bilateral repo.3 Because the borrowers are mostly banks and broker-dealers,
the flow-of-funds data on total repo liabilities should be relatively complete, even from
bilateral repo. In contrast, the lenders come from both regulated and unregulated sectors,
so that the official totals for liabilities (borrowers) typically exceed those for assets
(lenders), often by a significant amount. This “statistical discrepancy” was the single
largest contributor to total repo lending on the eve of the crisis, with an almost $1 trillion
difference between reported assets and liabilities. Over the subsequent seven quarters,
this discrepancy completely disappeared. So, a first-order (unsatisfying) answer to “who
ran on repo?” is that “the statistical discrepancy ran on repo”. We will attempt to
improve upon this unsatisfying answer in Section 3. But even without the discrepancy
there are some interesting findings from the flow-of-funds. In particular, the reporting
institutions from the “rest of world” reduced repo assets by about $400 billion, while
money-market-mutual funds – the largest reporting category pre-crisis – actually
increased repo assets by more than $100 billion from 2007Q2 through 2009Q1.
Furthermore, gross funding by broker-dealers fell significantly more than did net funding,
so that estimates of market size based only on net funding changes will understate the
dislocations in repo markets during the crisis.
             Section 3 attempts to shed light on the statistical discrepancy by comparing the
flow-of-funds data with survey evidence from the Bond Market Association (BMA). The
BMA surveyed its members on their use of repo as of June 30, 2004. This survey asked
major market participants about the identity of their counterparties, and then provided
estimates of market size by counterparty-type. Counterparty data is not available in the
flow-of-funds. The BMA did not distinguish between borrowing and lending and did not
reveal its methodology for its market-size estimates, so it is not possible to make a direct
comparison to aggregate data in the flow-of-funds. Nevertheless, the survey is invaluable
for the view it gives into the composition of counterparties, particularly those that do not
report through official sources. For our purposes, the key findings from the survey –
subject to caveats explained in Section 3 – are (1) bilateral repo is about three times the

size of tri-party repo; (2) money-market mutual funds comprise only about two percent of
bilateral repo; and (3) hedge funds and other unregulated capital pools represent a
significant fraction of the counterparties to dealers in bilateral repo. Section 4 concludes
the paper, and an appendix supplements the text with a summary of data sources used for
repo in the flow-of-funds.
             Since the financial crisis, there have been several proposals for reform of repo
markets, and a nascent debate about the role of repo in the financial system. 4 The most
related paper to ours is Krishnamurthy, Nagel and Orlov (2012), who perform a detailed
analysis of the tri-party and securities-lending market, focused most extensively on
money-market mutual funds. Analyzing the same raw data that is used to build the
summary statistics in the flow-of-funds, they find that money-market funds did not run on
repo during the crisis. Based on this evidence, they conclude that repo runs were not
central to the financial crisis, dismissing other possible contributors because “our own
cursory investigations of other possible repo lenders has not turned up any other
significant sources of funding” (p. 7).                                       The evidence in our paper shows that this
conclusion is premature, as it ignores the role of non-reporting institutions. Since money-
market mutual funds make up only about two percent of the bilateral market, and the
bilateral market is the main contributor to the $1 trillion statistical discrepancy that
disappeared during the crisis, it is not possible to draw conclusions about the repo run by
focusing only on money-market mutual funds and other regulated institutions.


2. Flow-of-Funds Evidence
             The Federal Reserve flow-of-funds is the most comprehensive available source of
repo data. Table L.207 from the flow-of-funds provides summary data from each of the
following sectors: securities brokers and dealers, banks, rest of world, money market
mutual funds, (all other) mutual funds, pension funds, insurance companies, nonfinancial
corporate business, state/local governments, real-estate investment trusts, the monetary
authority, and government-sponsored enterprises. In each category, flow-of-funds data is

derived from a different primary source. For example, bank data is from call reports,
mutual fund data is from SEC filings, and rest-of-world data is from the Treasury
International Capital System. The appendix to this paper summarizes the sources used
for each category of L.207.
             The largest repo borrowers – collectively with the vast majority of all repo
liabilities in all periods – are banks and broker-dealers. Exhibit 1 plots the combined level
of net repo liabilities for these two groups since 1999.5 After holding steady at about $1
trillion for the first few years of the 2000s, financing grew to be over $2.2 trillion by the
eve of the crisis in the second quarter of 2007. During this buildup, broker-dealers had
become very reliant on repo, with approximately 50 percent of their assets funded
through these markets. Repo finance to broker-dealers and banks then fell in each of the
next seven quarters, reaching a local minimum of $900 billion in the first quarter of 2009.
             Exhibit 2 shows the main holders of repo assets in 2007Q2, just before the first
panic phase of the financial crisis, and in 2009Q1, after the worst part of the post-Lehman
panic phase was over. In 2007Q2, the largest category by far is the “statistical
discrepancy”, with just under $1 trillion. As discussed above, this discrepancy arises
because official sources are much better at capturing repo liabilities (mostly at large
regulated institutions) than repo assets (which occur at a wide variety of regulated and
unregulated capital pools.) Later we will explore the possible sources of this discrepancy,
for now we note only its very large size on the eve of the crisis. (The totals in Exhibit 2
are for all repo assets, and thus do not match the totals in Exhibit 1 for the liabilities of
just banks and broker-dealers.)
             Of the remaining categories, the two largest are money market mutual funds
(MMFs) at $426 billion and rest-of-world (ROW) at $422 billion. MMFs are the main
domestic funders of repo, with such funding taking place almost exclusively in the tri-
party market, where transactions are intermediated by clearing bank. The ultimate source
of ROW data in the flow-of-funds is the Treasury International Capital System, which is
itself compiled from a variety of sources. As with other parts of the flow-of-funds, the
ROW data necessarily rely on regulatory filings, and will not capture information from

unregulated capital pools. Thus, any missing data from ROW will end up counted as part
of the discrepancy.
        The three categories of “discrepancy”, MMFs, and ROW constitute about 80
percent of the total repo assets.       Together, the remaining categories contribute
approximately $500 billion, with the largest components from domestic municipalities
($154 billion), GSEs ($146 billion), and other (non-money-market) mutual funds ($129
billion).   We note that the contributions are relatively small from non-financial
corporations ($9 billion), insurance companies ($6 billion), and pension funds ($53
billion).
        The last set of columns in Exhibit 2 shows analogous information from 2009Q1.
The three main categories from 2007Q2 all show striking changes. First, the discrepancy
has changed sign, with a $992 billion positive discrepancy in 2007Q2 completely
eliminated and turned into a $7 billion negative discrepancy in 2009Q1. Essentially, $1
trillion of financing from non-reporting sources disappeared during the financial crisis.
        The other major category with a large reduction is ROW, which dropped from
$422 billion in 2007Q2 to $33 billion in 2009Q1. This drop represents only the reporting
component of the ROW, with any non-reporting capital pools (foreign and domestic)
swept into the discrepancy. In contrast, MMFs actually increased their repo funding
during the panic phases of the financial crises, with $426 billion in 2007Q2 rising to $562
billion in 2009Q1. At first glance, the increased funding from MMFs may appear
inconsistent with the near-runs that occurred in MMFs themselves following the Lehman
bankruptcy in September 2008. A resolution of this puzzle is easier with a more dynamic
picture of the repo funding during the crisis. Exhibit 3 illustrates this dynamic for the
three major categories of MMFs, ROW, and the “discrepancy”.
        Looking first at MMFs, we see a gradual rise in repo funding from about $200
billion in 2000 to over $400 billion just before the crisis. Then, during the crisis, MMF
dynamics were closely intertwined with panics in other short-term debt markets. The
first panic, in August 2007, manifested itself most clearly in runs in asset-backed
commercial-paper (ABCP) markets, as documented by Covitz, Liang, and Suarez (2012).
As MMFs were major holders of ABCP, many funds faced pressure to maintain par value,
and at least 44 funds received material support from their sponsors (McCabe, 2012).



                                                                                            5
After that support, MMFs appeared to be a safe haven and received an inflow of cash that
was exiting other short-term investments. Some of that inflow made it into repo. In the
panic that followed the Lehman bankruptcy, however, such sponsor support was
insufficient. When the Reserve Fund was unable to maintain parity on September 16 and
thus “broke the buck” by falling below $1 per share, an incipient run on MMFs was only
averted by unprecedented government intervention. When this intervention arrived, the
MMF industry stabilized, with its repo funding still above its 2007Q2 levels.
       As with MMFs, funding from the ROW peaked in 2007Q2, in this case at $422
billion. This funding fell steadily during the crisis to be $33 billion as of 2009Q1. Repo
funding from the ROW turned later to a deficit in 2009Q3, and reached a nadir of
negative $120 billion in 2010.
       In addition to the net funding losses coming from the ROW and the discrepancy,
repo markets also suffered large reductions in gross interdealer funding. Exhibit 4 shows
both repo assets and repo liabilities for broker-dealers. Repo liabilities peak over $3
trillion in 2007Q2, and stay above that threshold for the next four quarters before falling
steadily during the crisis to below $2 trillion in 2009Q1. At the same time, repo assets
also drop. Standing at $1.59 trillion in 2007Q2, assets rose to $1.78 trillion in 2008Q2
during the first phase of the crisis before dropping to $1.29 trillion following the Lehman
failure in 2008Q3. These dynamics are consistent with an initial shift from unsecured
(commercial paper) funding to repo funding in interdealer markets following the first
panic in August 2007, with even the secured repo funding facing a run after Lehman.
       All together, the flow-of-funds data shows a significant drop in repo funding to
banks and broker-dealers during the financial crisis.     The drop was rapid, with net
funding to banks and broker-dealers falling from $2.2 trillion in 2007Q2 to $900 billion
in 2009Q1. This drop came in part from a reduction in funding from the “Rest-of-World”,
which reduced its overall repo funding (not just to banks and broker-dealers) by $400
billion during this period. In contrast, money-market mutual funds actually increased
their funding to repo by more than $100 billion, as they saw assets surge after the first
panic of August 2007. Also, although it is washed out in the net funding numbers,
broker-dealers reduced both gross repo assets and gross repo liabilities, with the former




                                                                                         6
dropping by about $500 billion just in 2008Q3, the quarter of the Lehman failure. So
broker-dealers contributed to the run on liabilities by withdrawing funding themselves.
            Notwithstanding the large drops in reported repo funding from the institutions
reporting in these categories, the most significant drop occurred for non-reporting cash
pools. These pools end up as part of the statistical discrepancy in the flow-of-funds
accounts, which saw a drop of about $1 trillion from 2007Q2 to 2009Q1. These non-
reporting pools could be both foreign and domestic, and it is necessary to turn to non-
official sources to get some sense of the composition of these pools. We turn to this task
in the next section.


            3. Survey Evidence
            The Bond Market Association (2005) conducted a dealer survey in September
2004 of bilateral repo, tri-party repo, and securities lending and borrowing. The Bond
Market Association sent questionnaires to all the primary dealers, asking them to estimate
their outstanding volume by counterparty as of June 30, 2004 for bilateral repo, tri-party
repo, and direct institutional securities lending. Fifteen primary dealers responded.6 The
Bond Market Association (2005) explained that:


            The survey focused on activity in the U.S. market, distinguishing between
            U.S. and non-U.S. counterparty types. As the survey is U.S.-focused, the
            survey asked for finer distinctions and thus more categories for U.S. than
            was requested for non-U.S. counterparties. The level of detail also reflects
            efforts to minimize the reporting burden on participating institutions.


            The U.S. counterparty types identified in the survey were dealers, agent
            banks, the Federal Reserve Bank, U.S. government agencies, state and
            local governments, corporations, ERISA pension funds, non-ERISA
            public pension funds, hedge funds, insurance companies, foundations and
            endowments,                and        a     miscellaneous                “other         category.”            Non-U.S.

       counterparties included supranational, sovereign governments and central
       banks, sub-sovereign government entities, off-shore hedge funds and the
       miscellaneous category. (p. 4)


       Exhibit 5 reproduces the summary data from the survey. We first note that the
total market for secured borrowing is estimated at $7.838 trillion in June 2004. This total
includes bilateral repo, tri-party repo, and securities lending. The securities-lending
category is conceptually and legally similar to repo, but occupies a different table in the
flow of funds and is not included in the totals discussed in the Section 2. We focus
instead on the totals for bilateral and tri-party repo, which are estimated as $3.857 and
$1.350 trillion, respectively. In the flow-of-funds data, assets (lending) and liabilities
(borrowing) are counted separately, but the BMA survey does not distinguish between
them and thus can have some double counting in the totals. Given this limitation, we
cannot directly compare the survey aggregates with the flow-of-funds. Instead, we focus
on the percentages of the total, particularly for the non-dealer categories, where the ratios
of borrowing to lending are likely to be similar across counterparties.          Under any
reasonable assumption for the proportion of borrowing and lending by counterparty, there
is significantly more bilateral than tri-party repo. For example, even if there is no
double-counting of tri-party repo and full double-counting for bilateral repo, the latter
would still be nearly 50 percent larger than the former.
       Within bilateral repo, interdealer transactions count for 40.6 percent of the overall
total and about 56 percent of the domestic total. Outside of dealers, the largest category is
“Other Investment Managers, Hedge Funds”, with 9.0 percent of the total. If we also
include off-shore hedge funds (8.3 percent), then more than 17 percent of bilateral repo
comes from hedge funds and other unregulated investment managers. These hedge funds
may represent a significant component of the statistical discrepancy from the flow-of-
funds, because hedge funds do not report their repo activity and are swept as a residual
into the household sector of the flow-of-funds accounts.
       The other major categories of bilateral repo are “Other U.S.” (6.8 percent) and
“Other Non-U.S.” (15.9 percent).      “Other U.S.” represents all domestic counterparties
that have been left unspecified by survey respondents. “Other Non-U.S.” is a catch-all



                                                                                           8
category intended to lower the paperwork burden on survey respondents, by asking for
less detail in the foreign section than the domestic section. This category includes
foreign affiliates, foreign dealers, corporations, insurance companies, and managed funds.
In general, most of these capital pools would not be captured in the underlying flow-of-
funds data, and would also show up as part of the statistical discrepancy.
        Overall, 40 percent of the bilateral repo in the BMA survey is in the categories of
hedge funds or “other”, with more than half of this amount coming from foreign sources.
Very little (if any) of this amount comes from known sources in the flow-of-funds. The
statistical discrepancy of $1 trillion in the flow-of-funds repo accounts 2007Q2 is also
about 40 percent of the total repo liabilities from reporting sources.


4. Conclusion
        This paper analyzes the “run on repo” during the recent financial crisis using data
from the Federal Reserve flow-of-funds, supplemented by a unique market survey done
by the Bond Market Association. Among banks and broker-dealers, repo liabilities fell
by about $1.3 trillion from 2007Q2 through 2009Q1. The only part of this decline that is
clearly captured in the flow-of-funds is a $400 billion reduction in funding from the “rest-
of-world”. The remaining decline shows up as a reduction in the “statistical discrepancy”
between repo assets and liabilities.    Evidence from the BMA survey suggests that the
flow-of-funds is missing about 40 percent of the bilateral repo market, which (in dollar
terms) is approximately the same magnitude as the statistical discrepancy. This missing
data comes predominantly from foreign and domestic hedge funds and other unregulated
capital pools. The run on net funding from these sources was also exacerbated by a $500
billion reduction in gross repo assets by broker-dealers in just the third quarter of 2008.
        Our analysis demonstrates the danger of relying exclusively on official sources of
data for repo markets. While it is tempting to focus where the data are strongest, such
analyses can be misleading. For repo, the best data are for tri-party transactions, and the
most detailed tri-party data exist for money-market mutual funds. As it turns out, MMFs
were not at all representative during the crisis, with repo assets actually increasing for
MMFs by more than $100 billion at the same time that overall repo liabilities were falling
by $1.3 trillion.
