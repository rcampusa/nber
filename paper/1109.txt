                      Survey Response Variation in
                      the Current Population Survey


                                ABSTRACT


     This paper investigates the problem of   response   and coding errors in

the Current Population Survey. It draws upon a potentially rich source of
information for verifying survey answers, a three month matched sample of
CPS respondents, to analyze whether individuals' questionnaire responses in
adjacent months are mutually consistent.
     We focus primarily on reported durations of unemployment spells. For
individuals who were coded as unemployed in two consecutive months and who
                                                                   their
experienced no intervening labor market withdrawal or employment,
reported duration in the second interview should exceed the first interview
duration by about four weeks. However, this is not what survey responses
show. In more than three quarters of all cases, reported durations in
successive months are logically inconsistent. The reporting problem is not
confined to spell durations. In 25 percent of all cases, the professed
reason for unemployment changes as the unemployment spell progresses.
Furthermore, analysis of labor force entrants shows that reported changes
in labor force status between unemployment and not-in-the labor force are
not reliable guides to actual behavior.
     We conclude that reported durations of unemployment, and to a lesser
extent, reasons for unemployment, may be very misleading indicators of
future behavior. Econometric analyses which focus on changes in individual
behavior over time are likely to be badly flawed by spurious changes due to
reporting errors. These problems with the Current Population Survey, one
of the best sample surveys available, may suggest far greater difficulties
in interpreting other sources of panel data.

                                                                   of data
     The Current Population Survey is one of the principal sources

about labor markets in the U.S. economy. It has been used in numerous

investigations of unemployment, since it provides descriptive information

about the characteristics of jobless workers and about their unemployment

experience. The duration of unemployment spells, and the factors affecting

reported unemployment spell lengths, have been subject to particularly intensive

study. A substantial body of work has examined how public policies can affect the
                                                       research has also analyzed how
time which workers spend in unemployment. Previous

the reason for an individual's entry   into   unemployment affects his subsequent


unemployment experience.

     Although major policy recommendations are often based upon analyses of

data from the CPS and other surveys, relatively little is known about the

frequency of survey response errors and their possible implications for

empirical research. CPS Reinterview surveys provide some indication of

response variation and their results have been analyzed by statisticians.

The Reinterview Survey helps to determine whether individuals consistently

answer questions in a particular survey month, but it does not indicate


*After completing this paper we became aware of closely related research by Bowers
and Horvath (undated).
                                                                               2

 whether individuals provide logically consistent survey responses in

 different   months. The recent advent of panel data sets containing

 information on survey participants in    several   consecutive months makes the

 second question particularly important. Do individuals answer similar questions in

 similar ways on   different   surveys? This paper draws upon a potentially
 rich   source of information for verifying survey answers, a three month
matched sample of CPS respondents, to analyze whether individuals'
questionnaire    responses are mutually consistent.

        Our results are very troubling. Reported unemployment durations in successive

months are logically inconsistent for three out of four survey respondents. In 25

percent of all cases, the professed reason for unemployment changes as the

unemployment spell progresses. Furthermore, analysis of the reports of' labor force

entrants suggests that reported changes in labor force status between unemployment

and not-in—the-labor force are not reliable guides to actual behavior.

        Several conclusions follow from our analysis. Reported durations of

unemployment, and   to   a lesser extent, reasons for unemployment, may be

misleading indicators of future behavior. Analyses which focus on changes

in individual behavior over time are likely to 'be badly flawed by spurious

changes due to reporting errors. The character of the data gathered in the CPS,

and the procedures used in administering the survey, make response and coding

errors less likely in this data source than in many others. Further investigation

of the reliability of other frequently used sources of economic data may be

warranted. Future research should also examine improvements in survey techniques

to minimize response errors, and the development of statistical techniques to treat

them.
                                                                               3


     Our    analysis is   divided   into four parts. Section I reviews evidence from the
Reinterview Survey   on individuals' reported labor market status. Section II

examines the consistency across time of reported unemployment durations       and

considers    the salience of the unemployment/not in the labor force (NILF)

distinction. Section III presents evidence on the consistency over time of

individuals'   reported reasons for unemployment. The paper's final section
considers    the implications of our results for empirical research in labor

economics, using both the CPS and other data sets.



I.    Employment Status Misreporting

      Reporting errors are a substantial problem in the CPS. The incidence

of errors due to response and coding mistakes is well docwnented by the

Census Bureau's Reinterview Surveys, which reinterview a subsample       of the
households   included in each month's CPS.1 These secondary interviews

typically occur about a week after the original survey. Respondents are

asked, however, to describe their activities in the preceeding week. In

some cases, the "non—reconciled" component of the Reinterview Survey, there

is no attempt to determine which, if either, of two different responses on the

original and reinterview surveys is correct. However, for the "Reconciled"

subgroup of the Reinterview Survey which typically constitutes about one third of

the reinterviewed households, the second interviewer actually compares the

responses on the first survey with the reinterview answers. Then, before leaving

the household, he attempts to determine which, if either, of any conflicting

Technical Report #19 (1969).
                                                                             4

 responses is correct.1 The Reinterview responses for those in the reconciled

 subsample, therefore, are   the   "truth" as determined by the second interviewer.

       The reconciled Reinterview Surveys permit analysis of employment

 status coding errors. Table I shows the fraction of individuals in each

 labor market category, after reconciliation, by their category on the first

 survey. While most of the employed CPS respondents are correctly

 classified, a substantial fraction of the unemployed individuals are

 reported in other categories. Ten percent of the truly unemployed were

 classified as not in the labor force (NILF) on the first survey. A

 further 3.6 percent were recorded as employed. The accuracy of responses

by those truly out of the labor force was also quite high, with 99.2

percent correctly classified. There is some evidence that the mismeasurement

problem is greater for women than for men.

      The finding that many unemployed individuals are misclassified is

important for studies of unemployment dynamics. If nearly fifteen

percent of unemployed individuals are incorrectly classified in a given

month, then many of the transitions between labor force states may be

spurious. Studies of labor market behavior based on the Gross Flows

data or investigations using panel data from the CPS may therefore be subject to

substantial error.2

       The table suggests that there may be confusion between the states

of "unemployment" and "not in the labor force". As we show later, many

incorrect, responses in both months.

 individuals   whose labor market status is U—NILF—U report themselves as experiencing

 one ongoing spell of unemployment. While the Reinterview Survey reveals that only

 one quarter of one percent of individuals originally classified as NILF are

 actually unemployed, this is because many individuals are genuinely not in the

 labor force and are rather unlikely to be experiencing an unemployment spell.

However, conditional upon having been unemployed the month before, the measurement

error rates for the NILF category may be large -    far   larger than those in our

table .

     Flinn   and Heckman (1982a) argue that the states of unemployment and NILF are

well—defined and distinct. They draw evidence from the clear differences in models

explaining the probability of someone who is unemployed, and of someone who is

NILF, becoming employed. However, this evidence is not relevant to understanding

whether a large fraction of those who are unemployed drift in and out of the "NILF"

category with little or no change in behavior. The explanation of Heckman and

Flinn's finding is that there are a large number of individuals, classified as

NILF, who are not casual entrants to the labor force. Many persons are disabled,

retired, or otherwise unfit or unable to work. They are conceptually distinct from

the unemployed, who are searching for work. A small fraction of NILF respondents,

but a substantial fraction of those who were unemployed in the preceding month, may

actually be searching for work and ready to accept a job. They are the

miscategorized workers on whom we focus.

II. 1eported Unemployment Spell Durations

     The Current Population Survey interviews individuals in several

consecutive months, and the CPS match files contain data on all interviews

with a group of survey participants. These data may be used to examine

month-to—month changes in individuals' reported unemployment spell

durations. Survey respondents who report that they are unemployed are

asked how many weeks they have been "without a job and looking for work".

If individuals accurately reported their labor market experience, then the reported

unemployment spell duration in the second of two consecutive CPS interviews should

exceed the first reported duration by four or five weeks.1

     We obtained data on survey participants who were unemployed in May 1976, and

interviewed again in June 1976. These data were used to compute the difference

between each individual's reported unemployment spell durations in May and June:

                          DLBT = DUR          -   DUR
                                       June             May

The measurement of DIFF is complicated by several factors. First, some survey

participants may be unemployed on both survey dates but report a much lower spell

duration in the second interview because at some point between surveys they either

found a job or stopped searching. Since there is no way of determining whether

inconsistent reports with second-interview durations of less than five weeks are

spurious, we report results which both include and exclude this group (DURJune <


1Between the May and June surveys which are the focus of our work, 4.43 months
elapsed.
                                                                          9



 from the calculations. Second, some respondents may appear to make inconsistent

responses because they have been unemployed for so long that both duration values

are coded as 99. Duration is recorded in a two—digit data field so that spells of

more than 99 weeks are not reported exactly. However, this problem did not appear

to be substantial: only 1.7% of the respondents whose durations did not change had

reported '99" on the May survey, and a negligible fraction had Nay durations of

between 96 and 98 weeks.

     Summary statistics for DIFF are displayed in Table II. Table TI—A shows

calculations which exclude all individuals for whom DURYIJNE < 5, while the results

in Table TI—B include these respondents. Only one—third (31.8%) of the individuals

in the match sample reported spell durations which differed by between three and

five weeks. Nearly three quarters of the respondents made inconsistent claims

about their unemployment experience, and over twenty percent reported no increase,

or a decrease, in their spell duration. Thirty-seven percent of the sample

reported unemployment spell durations in June which exceeded their May durations by

more than five weeks, and many reported much longer spells. More than ten percent

of our sample reported that the length of their unemployment spell had increased by

over four months.

     Workers who have experienced long spells of unemployment are particularly

unreliable in reporting spell durations. We discovered this by dividing the sample

into two groups. Individuals in Group I had reported being unemployed for at least

20 weeks in May; those in Group II had been unemployed for less than 20 weeks.

The duration—difference calculations for these subgroups are also shown in Table

II. Twelve percent of the long-spell individuals report the same duration both

     Notes: Calculations based on May 1976 CPS questionnaire participants
             who were classified as unemployed, and were more than 16 years
             of age. A total of 1447 such individuals were available on the
             May-June match.
                                                                           12




months.1 Only twenty-five percent added between 3 and 5 weeks to their initial

reported spell length, and over one quarter of the Group I respondents claimed a

shorter spell duration in June than in May. These findings

indicate substantial variation in the reported unemployment durations of

survey participants experiencing ongoing unemployment spells.

     Regression models can be used to determine those factors which are

related to substantial aberrations in the reported spell durations. Table III

reports regressions of duration differences on individual's demographic

characteristics and reasons for unemployment. There are two equations in the

table. The first equation was estimated using reported duration differences as the

dependent variable, while the second equation was estimated on data for which the

outlying values of DIFF were "trimmed". Observations for which DIFF exceeded 25

weeks were replaced with 25, and observations for which DIFF < -5 were replaced

with —5. Similar results obtain for both sets of data. The average value of the

duration differences by reasons for unemployment are: job losers, 6.24, job

leavers, 5.64, workers on layoff, 4.69, reentrants and new entrants, 7.74.      These

values are drawn from the "trimmed" regression; all are larger than the four-and-

three—sevenths weeks which actually separated the two surveys. There is little

evidence that demographic factors change reported duration differences. The one

exception is teenage women, who appear to systematically underreport their duration

increment. The reason for unemployment also has a large effect in predicting

duration differences. Workers who are on layoff report differences which are up to

two weeks less than those of other unemployed individuals while reentrants and new


Only a small fraction (1.7%) of the no—change respondents were in the no—
change category because they had been unemployed for more than 99 weeks in
Nay. Ninety-nine weeks is the maximum spell duration which can be reported
on the CPS questionnaire.

entrants have the greatest tendency to overstate duration differences.1

     Besides knowing the average increment to the unemployment duration, we might

be concerned about errors of any type, either overstatement or understatement. To

analyze this issue, Table IV reports regressions explaining the absolute value of

(DURju_ (DIJRNAY+ 4)). The reported cause of unemployment affects the error in

reported durations in a significant and important way. Job losers are about two

and one half weeks more accurate than the "control" group ofre—entrants and new

entrants. Job leavers are two weeks more accurate than the controls, on average,

and persons on layoff have still smaller response errors. For individuals on

layoff workers' errors are on average between three and six weeks less than the

control and as much as three weeks less than either losers or leavers. The salary

which the individual earned at his last job also has a statistically significant

but economically small impact: a ten dollar per week rise in wages reduces an

individual's predicted inconsistency by about one one tenth of a week.2


i-We also experimented by adding the individuals' reported May duration to the
regression models. This had a substantial negative effect on the reported duration
difference. However, it is difficult to determine whether this is genuinely the
result of the longer-duration unemployed responding with smaller differences. An
alternative explanation is that the finding is purely a statistical artifact.
Conditional on a high reported May duration, the difference between the June and
May durations is likely to be less than if the value of DTJRMaYiS low. This means
that in a regression model for DIFF, DT.TRMaY will have a negative coefficient. This
hypothesis also predicts that, by similar reasoning, DURJune should have a positive
coefficient. Some support for this view was provided when we substituted DURJune
in place of DURMaY and observed a significant positive coefficient. Therefore,
since the results appear spurious, we have not reported equations which include
duration variables.
2Our equations also include control variables for the respondents' rotation group
in the CPS. These variables, although reported in the tables, never proved
statistically significant. Rotation Group I indicates individuals who particpated
in the Survey in May, June, July, and August; Rotation Group II denotes those who
participated only in May, June, and July. The omitted dummy variable for those who
participated only in the May and June surveys.

       The most important finding is that the duration of the unemployment spell

affects the consistency of the individual's responses. An additional

month of unemployment increases the absolute value of the difference between the

reported duration difference and "truth" (43 weeks) by about five days. However,

the effect of duration is more complicated than this simple model suggests. We

included three linear segments in specification III to capture the possibly

different duration effects of short and long spells. The duration—related "error"

in the spell length difference based on these regressions is calculated below

for several different durations.

                50 weeks                        6.34 weeks

Additional weeks of unemployment spell duration are particularly poorly reflected

in responses of individuals who have been unemployed for a very long period. For

spells   lasting more than a year, the predicted absolute value of the response error
is   over six   weeks.
      Further    evidence on the reported spell durations of "new entrants" to

unemployment can be obtained by studying the individuals who were

categorized as employed or NILF in May and became unemployed in June. Of

those experiencing B—U transitions, seventy—six percent reported June spell

durations of not more than four weeks. About eight percent of this newly
                                                                            17



4nemployed group, however, reported durations of over 25 weeks after not

more than four weeks of unemployment. Findings for the N-U transitors were

 similar: seventy—one percent reported spells of less than five weeks, but

seven percent reported very long spells (>25 weeks). This latter category

may comprise some U—NILF—U individuals.



III. The Distinction Between Unemployment and Not-in-the-Labor Force

     A third, but closely related, problem of response error concerns the reported

unemployment spell durations of individuals making labor market transitions.

Forty—four percent of unemployment spells end when job-seekers choose to leave the

labor force.1 However, there are frequent transitions between the states of

unemployment (u) and Not in Labor Force (NILF). Of the individuals who were

unemployed in Nay 1976 and for whom three consecutive CPS questionnaires were

available, 81, or three percent, were reported as NILF in June and unemployed again

in July. By comparison, 544 individuals (21 percent of the Nay unemployed sample)

were reported as unemployed for three consecutive months.

     An individual who leaves the labor force is technically considered to

have completed his spell of unemployment. If at some later date he chooses

to re—enter the pool of the unemployed to search for work, he begins a

second unemployment spell. If survey respondents adhered to this

convention, individuals who were out of the labor force in June would not

report spell durations which exceeded four weeks. As the lower panel of Table V

                        Prob(transition from unemployment to employment or NILF)

and Summers (1979).

Notes: All calculations based on the May—June-July 1976 CPS Match Tape. A total of
        81 individuals were classified as unemployed in May, not-in—the—labor—force in
        June, and were "unemployed" again on the July questionnaire. The reported
        statistics are based on these individuals' responses in May and July to
        questions about the length of their present unemployment spell.
                                                                                19


 4emonstrates, however, only twenty-six percent of the U-N-U survey respondents

considered themselves to have begun new spells. One—third of the U-N—U group

reported lower spell durations in the second survey, but this is not appreciably

different from the fraction of shorter spells discovered in the one month match

reported in Table II. However, it would also be incorrect to characterize the data

as suggesting that time out of the labor force is treated as the equivalent of time

spent unemployed. Less than thirty percent of the group added a full eight weeks

to their reported May unemployment spell duration. When we focus on those

individuals who did not report short spells (<5 weeks) in July, the share of

responses for which Dur    —   DtTR         is between seven and nine weks is only 12
                       July           May
percent.

     About two thirds of unemployed individuals who are classified as experiencing

U—N—U transitions appear to view themselves as in the midst of an ongoing

unemployment spell. This supports the conclusion that there is a substantial

amount of "hidden unemployment" and that for many U-N—U transitors, the state of

"not—in—the—labor force" is functionally equivalent to unemployment. This

emphasizes the ambiguity of current measures of labor market status, and helps to

explain the strongly procyclical behavior of labor force participation.



IV. Reasons for Unemployment

     The match file also affords an opportunity for making inter-month

comparisons of respondents' stated reasons for entering unemployment.

Using the May—June Match file, we cross—tabulated the respondents' May
                                                                        20



"reason" with their June "reason".' Table VI shows that only about seventy

percent of the respondents cited the same reason for unemployment in both May and

June. The correlation between the two responses is lowest for those originally

reported as job leavers; only fifty-six percent of the May job leavers reported

themselves as leavers again in June. Of those who changed classification, fifty-

eight percent moved to the category of job loser and thirty—four percent became re-

entrants. The groups with the highest inter-month correlations were job losers,

and new entrants: roughly eighty percent of the May respondents in these groups

provided similar responses in the June survey. The largest inter-category movement

was from layoff to job loser: thirty percent of those reported to be on temporary

or permanent layoff in May reported themselves as job losers in June. There also

appears to be a surprisingly large amount of movement between re-entrants and job

losers.

     The large incidence of reported changes from the layoff to the job loser

category is of particular significance. Although the empirical importance of

temporary layoff unemployment has been proclaimed by several authors, the evidence

here suggests that its significance may well have been overstated. A natural

interpretation of the large change in the responses of persons initially on layoff

is that they realize that they cannot return to their original employer. If this

interpretation is correct it implies that even the 9.2 percent of unemployment

attributable to layoffs substantially overstates the proportion of the unemployed

who will be able to return to their original employers.


1 Job losers and leavers were categorized on the basis of the "why
did.. .start looking for work?" question. Workers who explained that they
were on permanent or temporary layoff in response to the question "why
was. . .absent from work last week?" were classified as on layoff. New
entrants were those non—leavers, non-losers who claimed either that
(i) they had never worked at all, or (ii) they had never worked full—time
for more than two consecutive weeks. Any worker who did not fall into any
of these four categories was classified as a re—entrant.

      These results suggest the unreliability of individual responses to fundamental

parts of the monthly CPS questionnaire. They buttress the evidence from

Reinterview Surveys suggesting that a great deal of misreporting or misrecording

takes place. While information of the type presented here cannot be used to

evaluate the bias in CPS responses, it does suggest that any sort of behavioral

change is likely to be greatly overstated because of response error.

      This analysis of the Current Population Survey sheds light more generally on

problems of response error in survey research. For a number of reasons, the CPS is

likely to generate more accurate and consistent responses than other sample

surveys. The CPS questions ask only about recent behavior, rather than behavior

over the course of a year or longer interval. More safeguards are used to ensure

reliability than in most other studies of labor market behavior. To a greater

extent, CPS questions probe objective behavior rather than subjective intent. Our

focus on the CPS is motivated by its widespread use by researchers and policymakers

and the availability of data necessary for consistency checks.

      We believe that our findings suggesting the need for caution in performing

statistical analysis of these data are applicable to other surveys of labor market

behavior, though more research on this question would be valuable.

Especially when investigations focus on changes, errors in variables problems are

likely to be enormous. Unfortunately, most of the methods used to examine aspects

of dynamic labor supply behavior are not at all robust with respect to errors in

variables. Future research should examine more thoroughly the causes of

misreporting and examine alter-native techniques for developing consistent data. In

the meantime statistical techniques for adjusting data, and for
                                                                           23



estimating   in   the presence of errors in variables, should be developed. Work on

this task is   underway.
