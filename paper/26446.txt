                                         ABSTRACT

Using the firm-level data of 33 countries over 10 years (from 2008-2017), we find that the listed
firms, on average, have lower marginal products of capital (measured by return on assets) than
the unlisted firms in many countries. This implies that the listed firms face less financial
constraints. Moreover, we investigate the institutional factors that exacerbate or mitigate the
listing advantages across the countries. The listing advantages seem enlarged with better
corporate governance and narrowed with stronger creditor's rights.

1        Introduction

Using the firm-level data of 33 countries of 10 years (from 2008­2017) for both listed and
unlisted firms, we find that the listed firms, on average, have lower marginal products of
capital than the unlisted firms in many countries. We call it listing advantages.


    For each country, we estimate the listing advantages by the average treatment effect on
the return on asset (ROA) using the propensity score matching technique. We find that, for
the majority of the countries in our study, listing lowers ROA, which is proportional to the
marginal products of capital under typical assumptions on production functions. In other
words, the marginal product of capital of the listed firms are lower than those of the unlisted
firms that have similar characteristics.


    This finding supports a simple theory, which says that the listing firms should be less
financially constrained. As long as diminishing marginal returns prevail, any financial con-
straints limiting investments raise the marginal product of capital of a firm more than its
unconstrained level. Indeed, in many countries, listing is negatively correlated with debt-to-
asset ratio, implying that equity finance works as a source of financing. And, firms maintain
lower leverage, which makes listed firms less likely to hit the prohibitive borrowing con-
straints.1


    Next, we investigate the institutional factors behind different levels of listing advantages
across countries. We find that better corporate governance tends to improve the listing ad-
vantages, while stronger creditor's rights, and perhaps easiness of starting up business, seem
to narrow them.


    Although cross-country studies are rare, several country-specific studies, so far, identify
    1
        Ueda et al. (2019) more robustly find these results in a detailed study focusing on Japanese firms.


                                                        1
the advantages of listing. Ueda et al. (2019), using Japanese firm-level data over the period
1995­2014, find that listing can mitigate the financial constraints of firms. Compared to
a similar unlisted firm, a listed firm has a lower marginal product of capital, especially in
recessions. Schoubben and Van Hulle (2011), using the Belgian firm-level data (from 1992
to 2005) with consolidated financial statements, find that listing provides more flexibility in
financing and reduces the financial constraints. Gilje and Taillard (2016), based on panel
regressions, show that listed natural gas firms in the U.S. have a higher sensitivity to gas
price movements (i.e., growth opportunities) than the unlisted rivals in the same industry.
The difference is more pronounced in shale gas investments, which are more capital inten-
sive. For British firms, Saunders and Steffen (2011) find that the listed firms enjoy lower
bank loan rates. In their European cross-country study, Mortal and Reisel (2013) report
that the listed firms have higher investment sensitivity on growth opportunities (proxied by
sales growth) and such tendencies are higher for countries with more developed stock markets.


   Other authors find that listing results in tightening of financial constraints. Stein (1989),
argue that it may be possible theoretically as a result of the worsening of agency problems
under sparse ownership. For the U.S. firms, Asker et al. (2014), show that U.S.-listed firms
are more short-termist in nature, that is, they are less sensitive to growth opportunities
(proxied by sales growth). Sheen (2016), also shows that the U.S. listing firms in chemical
industries have a lower sensitivity of capacity investment on demand shocks.


   Mixed evidences are sometimes reported by several authors. For British firms, Brav
(2009), shows that listed firms have lower leverage, but with lower fluctuations in the capital
structure. In their European cross country study, Goyal et al. (2011) also report that listed
firms have lower leverage, but with more active management on leverage. They find that this
difference between the listed and the unlisted firms are more pronounced in countries with
stronger creditor's rights. For Japanese firms, Orihara (2014) presents univariate pictures


                                               2
that show the listed firms have lower investments on average but with lower fluctuations in
investment over business cycles. Orihara and Isobe (2014), report that the listed firms have
lower leverage, though with minimal control variables in their regressions.


    Based on listed firms' data, many authors have explained the cross-country differences in
financial frictions based on the differences in institutional factors. Claessens et al. (2014),
using an improved version of the standard investment model, estimate how institutions af-
fect financial frictions at the firm (micro) level and, through the required rate of return,
at the country (macro) level. Based on listed firm-level panel data from 40 countries over
the period 1990 to 2007, they show that shareholder rights affect financial frictions while
creditor's rights do not. Abiad et al. (2008), show that the cross-sectional dispersion of
listed-firms' Tobin's Q, which is regarded as a measure of the ex-ante efficiency of capital
allocation, improves with financial liberalizations.


    Few, if not none, so far, have studied the role of institutional factors on financial con-
straints between the listed and the unlisted firms using the cross-country panel data. In
this paper, using both listed and unlisted firms data, we thus try to find extensive margins
of institutional factors on listing, compared to intensive margins found so far in previous
studies based on listed-firm panel data in cross-country setting.



2     Data

2.1    Firm-level Data

We use two levels of data--country-wise firm-level and country-level data. For the country-
wise firm-level data, we use the ORBIS database which is provided commercially by Bureau
van Dijk (BvD). The ORBIS database includes balance sheets and income statements to-
gether with information on firms' ownership structures for over 300 million companies across


                                               3
the world. In terms of downloading and cleaning the data from ORBIS, we follow Kalemli-
Ozcan et al. (2015) as much as possible to prepare nationally representative data with
minimal missing information. For our purpose, we use the data from 33 countries for manu-
facturing firms from 2008­2017. We restrict our attention to the firms with at least 2 years
of consecutively available data points. In other words, this data set is an unbalanced panel.
We also eliminate the pure subsidiaries, i.e., if a firm's immediate shareholder owns more
than 50 percent of the shares.


   Following the literature (Hayashi, 1982), we take it as granted that the marginal product
of capital (MPK) is proxied by the average product of capital, assuming typical production
functions exhibiting constant returns to scale in factor inputs. We use the return on assets
(ROA, %) as a benchmark proxy for the average and marginal products of capital because a
firm should utilize all the assets efficiently. We estimate the ROA by earnings before interest
and tax payments (EBIT) divided by T otal Assets(TA), i.e. ROA = EBIT /T A.2


   In reality, to ease the financing constraints, especially for possible liquidity needs in case of
distress, firms may save and hold some amounts of cash and equivalents, which yield very low
returns in general. If so, it makes sense to exclude liquid assets from the T otal Assets(TA)
and to focus on the return on fixed assets (ROK , %) as another proxy for the marginal
products of capital, that is, ROK = EBIT /F ixed Assets.


   We use dummy Listing = 1 if the firm is listed on the stock market and Listing = 0
otherwise. This is the listing variable. We use T otal Assets a measure of the Size of a firm
and the total number of years from the year of incorporation as the Age of the firm. For
Leverage, we use the debt-to-asset ratio (D/A Ratio).


   2
       The ROA given in the ORBIS database is profit and loss before tax but after the interest payments.



                                                     4
   We drop outliers based on ROA and ROK . That is, samples showing smaller (or larger)
values than three standard deviations from the averages in terms of the return on asset
(ROA) and the return on fixed assets (ROK ). We present the number of firm-year obser-
vations by country in Table 1a.


2.2      Country-level Data

At the country-level, for each year, we take several institutional indicators for corporate
governance, institutional quality, product market competition, and financial development
from various sources. They are explained below and summarized in Table 1b. We present
the correlation table for the cross-country analysis in two parts in Table 1c (part a and b).
Notably, Table 1c shows that the average difference of marginal products of capital between
the listed and the unlisted firms is negatively associated with the majority of the institutional
indicators. We report the country-wise summary statistics and correlation tables of these
variables in Appendix A1.


2.2.1     Corporate Governance

For corporate governance, we use six different indicators, namely, Self-dealing Index, Corpo-
rate Governance Quality Index, Anti-Directors Rights Index, Extent of Directors Liability,
Corporate Board Efficacy Index, and Protection of Minority Shareholders Index.


   · Self-dealing Index: Self-dealing index provided by Djankov et al. (2008). It is a
        measure of legal protection of minority shareholders against expropriation by corporate
        insiders (for example, owner's transactions with related parties). This index predicts
        a variety of stock market outcomes, and is generally known to work better than other
        measures of corporate governance e.g. anti-director rights.

   · Corporate Governance Quality Index: We take this data from De Nicol`
                                                                        o et al.
        (2008). It is a composite indicator related to accounting transparencies. It measures


                                                5
        strength of auditing and accounting standards conflict of interest regulation and share-
        holder governance.

   · Anti-director Rights Index: We take this indicator of minority shareholder's pro-
        tection from Spamann (2009) which is a revised and improved version of La Porta et al.
        (1998). It has six components. Three are concerned with shareholder voting--voting
        by mail, voting without blocking of shares, and calling an extraordinary meeting, and,
        three with shareholders' voices--proportional board representation, preemptive rights,
        and judicial remedies.

   · Protection of Minority Shareholders: This indicator is a measure of whether
        minority shareholders are protected by the legal system of the country. This is con-
        structed on the basis of opinion surveys of business leaders around the world. We take
        this indicator from World Economic Forum.

   · Corporate Board Efficacy: This indicator measures how well we can characterize
        corporate board by investors and boards of directors. We take this indicator from
        World Economic Forum.

   · Extent of Director's Liability: The extent of director's liability index measures
        when board members can be held liable for harm caused by related-party transactions
        and what sanctions are available. We take this indicator from World Bank's Doing
        Business Reports.


2.2.2     Creditor's Rights

We use four different indicators of Creditor's Rights. They are, Creditor's Rights, Strength
of Legal Rights, Strength of Insolvency Framework, and Time to Resolve Insolvency (years).


   · Creditor's rights: We use the creditor's rights as given in the Djankov et al. (2008).
        The creditor rights index first proposed by La Porta et al. (1998). The index measures


                                                6
        the legal rights of creditors against defaulting debtors in different jurisdictions and has
        been previously interpreted as a measure of creditor power.

   · Strength of Legal Rights: We take this indicator from World Bank's Doing Business
        Reports. This index measures the degree to which collateral and bankruptcy laws
        protect the rights of borrowers and lenders and thus facilitate lending. This measure
        weigh borrower side compared to Creditor's Rights.

   · Strength of Insolvency Framework: Strength of insolvency framework index mea-
        sures the time, cost, and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic entities
        as well as the strength of the legal framework applicable to judicial liquidation and
        reorganization proceedings. We take this indicator from World Bank's Doing Business
        Reports.

   · Time to Resolve Insolvency (years): It is the number of years from the filing for
        insolvency in court until the resolution of distressed assets. We take this indicator from
        World Bank's Doing Business Reports. This one and the one above measures overall
        efficiency of bankruptcy procedures.


2.2.3     General Institutional Quality

We use three different indicators of General Institutional Quality. They are--Property
Rights, Rule of Law, and Trust in People.


   · Property Rights: We use the property rights index data published by the World
        Economic Forum. This data is part of Global Competitiveness Report and is collected
        through survey of different stakeholders across the world. It takes into account the
        protection of property rights including financial assets.

   · Rule of Law: This indicator captures the perceptions of the extent to which agents
        have confidence in and abide by the rules of society, and in particular the quality


                                                 7
        of contract enforcement, property rights, the police, and the courts, as well as the
        likelihood of crime and violence. We take this from the World Governance Indicators
        published by the World Bank.

   · Trust in People: We take this data from two different waves of the World Value
        Surveys (Wave 5 (2005-2009) and Wave 6 (2010-2014)). The World Value Survey
        publish time series investigation of human beliefs and values across countries. We take
        the indicator constructed by response of the respondents on--whether most people can
        be trusted in your country.


2.2.4     Financial Development

We take four different indicators of financial development. They are, Credit-to-GDP Ratio,
Sum of stock market capitalization, private bond market capitalization, and bank credit to
Private Sector (% of GDP), Market Capitalization (% of GDP), and Prevalence of Foreign
Ownership.


   · Credit-to-GDP Ratio: We take private sector Credit-to-GDP ratio (%) from the
        World Bank database. Credit here refers to the domestic credit to private sector which
        includes financial resources provided to the private sector by financial corporations
        through loans, purchases of non-equity securities, and trade credits and other accounts
        receivable, which establish a claim for repayment.

   · Sum of stock market capitalization, private bond market capitalization and
        bank credit to private sector (% of GDP): We take bank credit to private non-
        financial sector data and outstanding corporate debt securities issued by the private
        non-financial corporations data given by the Bank for International Settlements (BIS)
        and market capitalization of the listed companies data from the World Bank and CEIC
        Database and take the sum of them and divide it by current GDP at market price of
        that year to obtain this ratio.

                                                8
   · Market Capitalization (% of GDP): We take this data from the World Bank and
        the CEIC Database. Market capitalization (also known as market value) is the share
        price times the number of shares outstanding (including their several classes) for listed
        domestic companies.

   · Prevalence of Foreign Ownership: We use Prevalence of Foreign Ownership index
        provided by the World Economic Forum. It is constructed on the basis of responses
        from the survey of the stakeholders in each country on how prevalent is foreign own-
        ership of companies in their respective countries.


2.2.5     Product Market Competition

We take three different indicators of product market competition. They are, New Business
Registered (new registrations per 1,000 people ages 15-64), Cost of starting a Business(% of
income per capita), and Trade Barriers.


   · New Business Registered: We take new business registrations in the calendar year
        per 1000 people in the age group of 15-64 years published by the World Bank. Business
        refers to limited liability corporations. This measure captures easiness of starting up
        business, together with the measure below.

   · Cost of Starting a Business (% of income per capita): We take this data from
        the World Bank. This is constructed by normalizing the cost to register a business by
        the gross national income (GNI) per capita.

   · Trade Barriers: This index is constructed based on the responses of the stakeholders
        in each country to the question--to what extent do non-tariff barriers (e.g., health
        and product standards, technical and labeling requirements, etc.) limit the ability of
        imported goods to compete in the domestic market? We take this data from the World
        Economic Forum.



                                                9
2.2.6       Macro Volatility

We take three measures of macroeconomic volatility--Standard Deviation of Inflation from
Last 5 Years Average Inflation, Standard Deviation of GDP growth from Last 5 Year Average
GDP Growth, and Coefficient of variation of Exchange Rate. We use the annual average
consumer price index to calculate inflation. For calculating the GDP growth, we use GDP at
constant market price (in USD million). We take nominal effective exchange rate to calculate
the coefficient of variation of the exchange rate. We use the World Bank database to obtain
these variables.



3        Within-Country Estimation of Average Treatment

         Effect on Treated: Propensity Score Matching

3.1        Benchmark Within-Country Estimation

Following Ueda et al. (2019) study on Japanese firms, we conduct a propensity score match-
ing estimation (PSM) to identify the listing advantages for each year for each of the 33
countries. Specifically, we first predict the probability of firms to be listed based on Size
(total asset), Age, Industry (2-digit level) and Leverage (D/A Ratio). Second, we match
the listed and the unlisted firms, one to one, if they share the (almost) same probability
of being listed.3 We confirm that covariates are well balanced in matched samples (report
omitted). Third, we compare the difference in the variables of interest i.e ROA between two
matched samples to determine the effects of listing.


    The marginal product of capital, is proxied by the return on asset (ROA). The key
variable is the binary variable, Listing , taking value one if listed and zero otherwise. For
the matching conditions, we use Size and Age. We also include lagged Leverage to control
    3
        We use STATA 14 command psmatch2 with caliper 0.1.



                                                  10
for possible default risks, debt overhang, and ROE targeting behaviors.


   In Table 2, we present the average treatment effect on treated (ATT) which is the average
difference of in the ROA as a result of being listed, for each year and each country. In Figure
1, we report the year-average ATT for each country based on at least 10% level of significance.


   We find that, on average, the difference of the ROA as a result of Listing is mostly
negative for almost all the countries. In other words, on an average, the listed firms tend to
have a lower ROA compared to the unlisted firms. This difference is more pronounced in
the case of Australia, Ireland, Romania, Sweden, the U.S. and the U.K.. For some countries
like Brazil, Finland, Hungary, Greece, India, Malaysia, Norway and Taiwan, this difference
is not found to be statistically significant. There are few exceptions (namely, Vietnam and
Iceland), where this difference turns out to be positive.4




3.2       Robustness Checks for Within-Country Estimation

We notice a caveat for our propensity score matching estimates. On the one hand, Age and
Industry can be regarded as pre-determined or almost exogenous to the firm's decision on
Listing . On the other hand, Size (total asset) may be endogenous to Listing . However,
it is a slow-moving variable which is less likely to affect the Listing decision in each year.
We restrict our sample to firms that are more than 5 years of age to eliminate young firms,
which are more likely to face the listing decision. We do not find any difference in our results.


   Still, we care about possible endogeneity of listing. We note that the treated and the
controlled are switched, in a sense, at 50 percent probability of being listed. For firms higher
than 50 percent score, they should be listed according to the statistical model. The differ-
   4
       Similar results are obtained when we pool all years observations for each country.



                                                      11
ence between the listed and the unlisted can be interpreted as the opportunity loss for the
unlisted firms not being listed, though they should be. On the other hand, for firms lower
than 50 percent score, they should not be listed according to the statistical model. They
may pick up distressed firms, which may exaggerate the benefits of listing. Also, these listed
firms may be close to being delisted, so, even though listed, they have difficulties in obtaining
funds. Hence, the bias is uncertain. In other words, randomness of listing seems to appear
more clearly among those samples above the 50 percent threshold.


   Note that the underlying assumption for justifying propensity score matching estimation
is that the listing status is not based on the economic reasons, at least not on the current
economic factors. And, assignment of such non-economic reasons across firms are assumed
to be random, at least on the basis of observed characteristics (Age, Size, Industry , and
Leverage). For example, some owner-managers of the unlisted firms may enjoy non-economic
benefits and adamantly refuse to be listed. The assignment of these non-economic benefits
to owner-managers of firms can be considered as random. These firms appear more when
we take firms with 50 percent or more propensity score of Listing.


   We investigate whether the beneficial effects based on all firms are similarly found in firms
with more than 50 percent propensity score. We find that correlation coefficient between
the overall ATT and the ATT estimated based on more than 50 percent propensity score
is around 0.861. These estimates are reported in Appendix Tables A2.1­2.3. Among the
firms with higher than 50 percent propensity score, the listing effects are broadly consistent
with our benchmark results. This is also in line with Ueda et al. (2019) on Japanese data.
Therefore, theoretically, although the random assignment assumption of listing status might
not be perfectly solid, we can regard the benchmark results based on all firms as if it is
having a random assignment.




                                               12
    Depending on the macroeconomic conditions, listing advantages may change. Indeed,
Ueda et al. (2019) report that the listing advantage is more pronounced in recessions. To
purge the recession-boom effects, it would be better to look at the annual estimates. Also,
we surmise that the institutional changes over time may matter. Below, we use cross-country
panel regressions to allow for these time-varying possibilities.


3.3     Robustness Check Using Fixed-Effect Panel Estimation

As another robustness check, we also run the fixed-effect panel estimation for listing advan-
tages for each country. Note that the distribution of the listed firms is skewed towards larger
ones while that of the unlisted is towards smaller ones.5 This asymmetric distribution po-
tentially causes bias to fixed-effect-regression estimates because the error terms of the listed
and the unlisted might not be randomly distributed even with Listing binary variable and
other control variables in the regressions:

    In Figure 2, we present the estimates (statistically significant) of  M (the marginal effect
of Listing on the M P K ).6 The estimation results show that the listed firms face less
financial frictions as in PSM estimates of ATT in many countries. We also find that the
average difference of M P K due to the listing based on ATT of PSM and coefficient of
listing in the fixed effect regression (i.e.  M in equation (1)) are positively correlated, with
correlation coefficient 0.614 (Table A2.4, Appendix A2).

for almost all the countries when we control for Size, Age and Leverage.

4       Cross-country Panel Regressions to Investigate the

        Underlying Factors

4.1     Benchmark Cross-country Regression

To investigate the factors affecting listing advantages, we regress the annual ATT estimates
on corporate governance, creditor's rights, institutional quality, product market competition,
financial market development, macroeconomic volatility, inflation and interest rates.

                     + 7 Inf lationk,t + 8 InterestRatek,t + k,t ,

where k denotes country and t year, and k represents the country fixed effect. We report
robust standard errors with clustering at the country-level. Note that, for the cross-country
study, we did not use ATT for countries in which more than 90 percent of the sample firms
are listed, namely, India, Taiwan, and the U.S..


    We present the benchmark regression results in the column 1 of Tables 3.a to 3.f for easy
comparison with the other formulations. For the benchmark regression (2), we use the follow-
ing variables: Self-dealing Index for Corporate Governance; Creditor's Rights for Creditor's
Rights; Property Rights for Institutional Development; Credit-to-GDP Ratio for Financial
Development; Number of New Business Registered for Product Market Competition; and
Standard Deviation from last 5 years Average Inflation for Macroeconomic Volatility.7


    We find that the countries with better self-dealing index have larger difference in ROA
    7
    Not all the institutional variables are time varying, specifically, Anti-director's rights index, Corporate
Governance Quality Index, Self-dealing Index, and Creditor's Rights Index.


                                                      14
due to listing. This implies that in the countries where the legal protection of minority share-
holders against expropriation by corporate insiders (for example, owner-manager's related
party transactions) is better, the advantage due listing is more. In the countries where the
creditor's rights are stronger, the difference in ROA due to listing is smaller. The number
of new business registered, which measures easiness to start up business, also narrows the
listing advantages. This implies easier the of starting up of business, narrower would be the
listing advantages. Other variables, that is, general institutional quality, financial market
development and macroeconomic volatility are found to be statistically insignificant.


4.2    Robustness Checks: Cross-country Regression

To verify that our results are not driven by the specific firm and country measures as well as
by the characteristics of the sample, we examine a number of alternative specifications. For
this, we change the indicators of each of the variables one-by-one and compare the results
with the benchmark.


   In the benchmark, we use the ATT estimates using the propensity score match based on
all firms in each country. However, as we discussed above, listed firms with the probability
of listing less than 50 percent are likely financially distressed, and low ROA for those firms
might not be regarded as random assignment. So, we run a regression focusing only on firms
with a probability of listing more than 50 percent. We obtained almost the same result
(report omitted).


   Next we use five more indicators for Corporate Governance, they are, Corporate Gover-
nance Quality Index, Anti-Director's Rights Index, Extent of Director's Liability, Corporate
Board Efficacy Index, and Protection of Minority Shareholders Index, in addition to Self-
dealing Index. Results are shown in Table 3a, columns 2­6. Overall, estimates does not
seem robust--some are positive others are negative and the rest are statistically insignifi-


                                              15
cant. However, among these indicators, (anti-)self dealing index and corporate governance
quality index measure more directly the restrictions on owner-manager behaviors. For these
direct measures, corporate governance do matter.


   For creditor's rights, we use four different indicators--Creditor's Rights, Strength of Le-
gal Rights, Strength of Insolvency Framework, and Time to Resolve Insolvency (years). The
results are shown in Table 3b. Recall that the Strength of Legal Rights reflect not only cred-
itor's rights but also borrower's rights, while Strength of Insolvency Framework and Time
to Resolve Bankruptcy capture the overall efficiency of the bankruptcy procedure. The re-
sult shows that more borrower's rights seems to enlarge the listing advantages. The overall
efficiency of bankruptcy procedure seem to narrow the listing advantages. These results are
consistent with the benchmark results, that is, the Creditor's Rights have narrowing effect
on the listing advantage.


   For the product market competition, we use two other indicators that reflect the ease of
market entry, namely, the Cost of Starting Business and Trade Barriers but we do not find
these variables to significantly affect the listing advantages (Table 3.e).


   Other variables are statistically insignificant. For institutional quality, we use the Rule
of Law instead of Property Rights and find essentially the same insignificant result (Table
3c, column 10). For the financial market development, we use three different indicators--
the Sum of Stock Market Capitalization, Private Bond Market Capitalization and Bank
Credit over GDP; The Stock Market Capitalization (over GDP); and Prevalence of For-
eign Ownership. Results are given in Table 3d. For the macroeconomic conditions, macro
volatilities, the level of the real interest rate and inflation does not seem to matter (Table 3f).




                                                16
5     Conclusion

Based on propensity score matching estimations for annual data for each country, we find
that listed firms enjoy greater access to finance, which lowers marginal products of capital
on average in 23 countries out of 33 sample countries. Other countries show little listing
advantages, except that listed firms in Vietnam (and perhaps, Iceland) seem to have less
access to finance. The effect is essentially the same for those less endogenous samples, that
is, the set of firms with 50 percent or more propensity of being listed. The fixed-effect re-
gressions broadly replicate these findings too. We surmise that, in the majority of countries,
the private firm owners adamantly resisting listing would have some benefits to do so, but
at the same time, we confirm that they face tighter financial constraints.


    We gauge the listing advantages as the average treatment effect on treated (ATT) on ROA
for each sample country. We then investigate factors behind the listing advantages based on
cross-country panel regressions. Better corporate governance, especially those which directly
restrict the owner-manager behaviors, increase the listing advantages. Stronger creditor's
rights (and weaker borrower's rights) lower the listing advantages. Easiness of starting up
new business has a similar effect. However, other factors like macroeconomic instability and
general institutional quality have no significant effects on the listing advantages.


    These effects on the extensive margin is partially in line with the intensive margin of
credit allocation efficiency among listed firms reported by Claessens et al. (2014), which
shows that the primary factors affecting financial frictions for listed firms is country-specific
corporate governance as well as the positive impact of product market competition. How-
ever, Claessens et al. (2014) find no effect of creditor's rights.


    In essence, the listing advantages are the extensive margin of the financial constraints.
They are the costs for a firm remaining private. Our results show that such a wedge exists

                                               17
almost everywhere in the world. Moreover, the wedge between the listed and the unlisted
seems more extensive in a country with better corporate governance, whereas they are nar-
rower in a country with stronger creditor's rights.

                   Table A2.1: Propensity Score Matching Estimates
                   Propensity scores for the listing probability are used to match the treated (i.e., the listed) to the controlled (i.e., the unlisted), based
                   onone-to-one nearest neighbour matching restricting to the common support. Size (logarithm of total assets), Age(the years since
                   incorporation), and Industry(2-digit level) areused to compute propensity scores. Differences (ATT) of MPK (ROA) between the
                   treated and controlled are reported here. Upper Half refers to 50%<=Propensity Score<=75% and the Lower Half refers to
                   50%<=Propensity Score

     Table A2.2: Propensity Score Matching Estimates
     Propensity scores for the listing probability are used to match the treated (i.e., the listed) to the controlled (i.e., the unlisted), based
     onone-to-one nearest neighbour matching restricting to the common support. Size (logarithm of total assets), Age(the years since
     incorporation), and Industry(2-digit level) areused to compute propensity scores. Differences (ATT) of MPK (ROA) between the
     treated and controlled are reported here. Upper Half refers to 50%<=Propensity Score<=75% and the Lower Half refers to
     50%<=Propensity Score

     Table A2.3: Propensity Score Matching Estimates
     Propensity scores for the listing probability are used to match the treated (i.e., the listed) to the controlled (i.e., the unlisted), based
     onone-to-one nearest neighbour matching restricting to the common support. Size (logarithm of total assets), Age(the years since
     incorporation), and Industry(2-digit level) areused to compute propensity scores. Differences (ATT) of MPK (ROA) between the
     treated and controlled are reported here. Upper Half refers to 50%<=Propensity Score<=75% and the Lower Half refers to
     50%<=Propensity Score
