The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act: Which Firms Won? Which Lost?

                                          ABSTRACT

The Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) slashed corporations' median effective tax rates from 31.7% to
20.8%. Nevertheless, 15% of firms experienced an increase. One fifth of firms recorded
nonrecurring tax costs or benefits exceeding 3% of total assets. Proxies that existing studies
employ to assess the TCJA's impacts account for just half of actual impacts. Stock prices
impounded those proxies during the legislative process. Total impacts were impounded the
following year, once firms published their financials. These results indicate that investors find it
hard to predict even large and immediate changes to company cash flows due to unfamiliar
events.

1 Introduction
The 2017 tax reform was the first comprehensive reform of the US tax code in thirty years. The
legislation, commonly referred to as the Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA), changed the Internal
Revenue Code in far-reaching ways. Statutory rates for both personal and corporate taxes were
slashed. Various deductions were raised or lowered, introduced or eliminated. On the corporate
side, our focus, the most significant changes included: a cut in the statutory tax rate from 35% to
21%, expensing of capital expenditures, changes to net operating loss (NOL) rules, a switch to
territorial taxation of multinationals coupled with measures targeting income shifting by
multinationals, and a one-time "deemed repatriation tax" on the unrepatriated foreign earnings of
multinationals.
   Although corporate tax reform had been on legislators' agendas for over a decade, it took
barely three months from the release of the "Unified framework for comprehensive tax reform"
on September 27, 2017 to a final bill signed by President Trump on December 22, 2017. The
combination of a short timeframe and steadily changing provisions made it difficult for firms to
adjust their behavior to specific measures before the reform became law.
   The reform was expected to have major financial consequences for firms, and it did. However,
its breadth (detailed in Section 2) made it difficult to predict which firms would be big
beneficiaries, which little, and which would actually be hurt.
   This paper conducts a detailed analysis of the actual financial consequences of the TCJA for
US corporations. In parallel, it investigates in detail how accurately the stock market anticipated
these consequences. Prior studies used firms' anticipatory stock price responses to assess actual
consequences. By contrast, we use firms' financial statements to directly quantify the impact of
the reform. Specifically, we compare the before-and-after TCJA effective tax rates (ETRs) for
each US public corporation and examine what nonrecurring charges occurred when the law was
enacted.
   This paper's first contribution, detailed in Sections 3 and 4, is to show how to quantify the
TJCA's recurring and nonrecurring impact on firms, and to provide detailed descriptive evidence
on its magnitude. It finds that the corporate tax reform had a large impact on firms. Between 2016
and 2018, the overall amount of corporate taxes paid went down by about 16%. The aggregate
GAAP ETR across firms (that is, the sum of total tax expenses over the sum of total pre-tax


                                                                                                 1
     
income across all firms) was 26% before the reform and 19% after. Similarly, the aggregate Cash
ETR fell from 24% to 20%. However, the impact on firms was highly heterogeneous. That is true
for both recurring and nonrecurring tax elements. To illustrate, from the year before the reform to
the year right after, the median GAAP ETR plummeted from 31.7% to 20.8%, and the median
Cash ETR fell from 21.9% to 16.7%. Most firms experienced a decrease in ETR from pre-TCJA
average levels to the first post-TCJA year. However, about 15% (in the case of the GAAP ETR)
or 30% (in the case of the Cash ETR) of firms experienced an increase. Notably, despite
widespread concerns about disparate treatment and disparate corporate aggressiveness in tax
planning before the reform, the fractional drop in the standard deviation of ETRs was less than
that in the average ETR. In other words, the TCJA did not reduce inequality in ETRs.
   The nonrecurring impact on firms, a critical element often neglected in discussions of the
reform, was also distributed very unequally across firms. While its median and average amounts
across firms were modest, 20% of firms had nonrecurring tax benefits or expenses that exceeded
3% of their total assets. Firms that did relatively well in terms of the nonrecurring impact also did
well in terms of the recurring impact.   
   The paper's second contribution, developed in Section 5, is to analyze the factors explaining
this variation in impact. It is noteworthy that although the statutory tax rate was reduced from
35% to 21%, for many firms ETRs fell considerably more than 14 percentage points, and for
many firms considerably less. The reduction in ETRs tended to be larger for bigger firms. A
firm's past ETR is by far the most important driver of the change to its ETR following the
reform, with high-ETR firms experiencing a larger reduction in taxes. This may reflect the fact
that some of the other TCJA provisions made tax planning harder for firms that previously
enjoyed low ETRs. Nevertheless, proxies reflecting the TCJA's main provisions ­ obviously
including tax rates ­ explain only about half of the variation in ETR changes. Even averaging
across industries, differences of several percentage points in ETR changes remain after
accounting for such provisions. For example, average ETRs for the medical equipment,
measuring and control equipment, and electronic equipment industries fell by more than 4%
above expectation. Real estate, rubber and plastic products, and printing and publishing
experienced unexpected ETR increases of 4% or more.
   As one would expect, the nonrecurring impact mostly affected firms with large deferred tax
assets or liabilities, and those with large, previously lightly taxed, unrepatriated foreign earnings.


                                                                                                    2
     
The remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities resulted in large nonrecurring tax
expenses in the defense, recreation, and trading industries, and in large tax benefits in
transportation, beer and liquor, and entertainment. The largest average deemed repatriation taxes
are found in apparel, candy and soda, and recreation. The industries least affected by the
repatriation tax are the domestically focused healthcare and real estate, as well as insurance.   
    The actual gains and losses for individual firms due to the TCJA can be observed to a
reasonably precise extent from financial statements. This is an advantage compared to most
regulatory changes, where direct observations of firm-level effects are not available. In Section 6,
we capitalize on this attractive and unusual feature to analyze how effectively the stock market
impounded the actual recurring and nonrecurring impacts of the TCJA. Prior studies of stock
price responses to the passage of the TCJA (reviewed below) used proxies for the expected effect
of the Act's various provisions as explanatory variables. Hence, they could not assess how
effectively stock prices anticipated the actual effects. That question could only be answered once
companies released their 2018 financial statements (or indeed, until the companies who had fiscal
years that started in the course of 2018 released their financial statements). With this benefit of
hindsight, we can now conduct the first assessment of the quality of the market's crystal ball as it
predicted corporations' future taxes.
    We find that during the passage of the TCJA, market prices reflected the proxies, but that the
part of actual tax changes that is unexplained by the proxies was not significantly associated with
stock returns. In other words, market participants appear to have found it too hard to fully
anticipate the consequences during the passage of the TCJA. The TCJA's actual impact was
highly relevant to firm value, but much of that impact was only impounded into prices as it
became visible in firms' financial statements in early 2018.1 This is striking because the stakes in
getting the estimates right over the coming year were enormous.
    Overall, the findings show that the TCJA, which is often portrayed as a boon for corporations,
had far more complex consequences than commonly considered. Specifically, the TCJA created
winners of highly varying degrees, but it also created significant losers. Moreover, tax rates
remained highly unevenly distributed. Finally, even the fairly comprehensive set of proxies used

 The fact that the proxies do not fully explain the actual changes in effective tax rates and nonrecurring benefits and
expenses is arguably also due to firms changing their behavior (e.g., by adjusting leverage) after the TCJA in order to
mitigate the impact of tax increases (or maximize the benefits of tax decreases). While investors should have
anticipated such moves, our evidence shows that such anticipation was at best modestly successful.  


                                                                                                                                                                                            3
      
in prior scholarly studies predicts only half of the variation in firm-level TCJA impacts. The
finding that market prices initially mainly reflected these proxies rather than the actual impacts
raises a cautionary flag regarding the ability of market participants to readily impound the
consequences of unfamiliar events into stock prices, even when those events are known
unequivocally and widely publicized. Pandemics and civic disruptions are contemporary events
that fall into this category.    
    Our analysis contributes to the growing literature on the consequences of the TCJA for firms
and on how changes in tax laws affect firm value and stock market prices. Corporate taxes are
conceptually of first-order importance for firm behavior and value (see the surveys by Graham
(2003) and Hanlon and Heitzman (2010)). In this respect, the TCJA is "a wonderfully generous
gift because it provides scores of natural experiments that could help provide credible estimates
of the causal effects of tax policy" (Slemrod 2018).2 Reaping the gift's benefits, however,
requires some effort. In particular, the actual benefits or losses to individual firms from the TCJA
need to be estimated. A major contribution of this paper is to show how to estimate these
important quantities. These actual estimates reveal that the proxies that have been used for this
purpose capture only about half of the variation of the consequences to firms.
    A few studies estimate the impact of the TCJA on firms. In contemporaneous work, Dyreng,
Gaertner, Hoopes, and Vernon (2020) document that after tax reform, the Cash (GAAP) ETRs of
public US corporations fell by 7.5 (11.4) percentage points on average. They also show that US
domestic firms benefited more than US multinationals, and that the tax savings of multinationals
stemmed from lower taxes on domestic operations. Thus, the switch from worldwide to
nominally territorial taxation did not result in a more favorable taxation of foreign income
overall. Donelson, Koutney, and Mills (2020) consider nonrecurring income taxes, both in
general and after the TCJA's enactment in particular. They find that a large part of the variation
in the TCJA's one-time impact on earnings can be explained by the prior quarter's deferred tax
assets, deferred tax liabilities, and prior-year permanently reinvested earnings.
    The present study simultaneously considers both recurring and nonrecurring taxes and the
relation between the two. It also decomposes nonrecurring taxes into repatriation tax and

 The TCJA also has important aggregate effects for the economy. See, for example, Auerbach (2018) and Barro and
Furman (2018). These macroeconomic studies do not address heterogeneity among firms.  


                                                                                                                                                                                            4
      
DTA/DTL remeasurement. This distinction proves to be important empirically, as the stock
market reaction to the TCJA concentrated predominantly on the repatriation tax.
    Several studies analyze specific real effects of tax law changes. That is, they assess how firms
adjusted elements of their behavior in response to such changes. For such investigations, the
advantage of the TCJA over previous reforms is that the law passed so quickly that companies
could hardly respond in advance.3 Studies on the firm behavior consequences of the TCJA
include Bennett, Thakor, and Wang (2019), Carrizosa, Gaertner, and Lynch (2019), Kalcheva,
Plecnik, Tran, and Turkiela (2019), Hanlon, Hoopes, and Slemrod (2019), Luna, Schuchard, and
Stanley (2019), De Simone, McClure, and Stomberg (2019), and Edwards and Hutchens (2020).4
Some studies, such as Beyer, Downes, Mathis, and Rapley (2019), Olson (2020), Atwood,
Downes, Henley, and Mathis (2020), and Albertus, Glover, and Levine (2019) focus specifically
on what firms do with repatriated foreign cash.5
    Our analysis draws on and is relevant to all these studies given two of its major findings: First,
it shows that the effects of the TCJA were very heterogeneous across firms. Second, it

  This is important because companies also respond to anticipated tax changes (see, e.g., De Simone, Piotroski, and
Tomy (2019) for the case of anticipated repatriation tax changes, and Hanlon and Hoopes (2014) for the case of
anticipated changes to dividend tax law). Real responses such as repurchases and firm investment after earlier tax
reforms are studied by, for example, Blouin and Krull (2009), Dharmapala, Foley, and Forbes (2011), and
Faulkender and Petersen (2012).   
4
   Bennett, Thakor, and Wang (2019) find that highly levered companies with high income taxes reduced their
leverage, and that companies increased their investments, especially if they are capital-constrained. Carrizosa,
Gaertner, and Lynch (2019) find that firms affected by the limitation on interest expense deductibility introduced by
the TCJA trimmed their leverage. Kalcheva, Plecnik, Tran, and Turkiela (2019) examine investments, and find no
effects. Both Bennett, Thakor, and Wang (2019) and Kalcheva, Plecnik, Tran, and Turkiela (2019) find that firms
increased share repurchases. Hanlon, Hoopes, and Slemrod (2019) also find increased repurchases and further show
that such increases are concentrated in a small number of firms; moreover, they document that firms with the highest
ETRs before the TCJA were the most likely to announce increased payments to workers and plans to increase
investment. Luna, Schuchard, and Stanley (2019) find that the change in the deductibility of CEO compensation
boosted base salaries, but decreased overall compensation. By contrast, De Simone, McClure, and Stomberg (2019)
find no effect on either. Edwards and Hutchens (2020) find that initial public offerings following the passage of the
TCJA took place at higher valuations, but less so for firms with net deferred tax assets and US-based multinational
firms.   
5
  Beyer, Downes, Mathis, and Rapley (2019) find that multinational firms with greater levels of pre-TCJA foreign
cash increased their post-TCJA repurchases but changed neither their dividends nor capital expenditures on average.
However, firms with more foreign cash did increase their investments if they were capital-constrained. Olson (2020)
documents that a finer measure of "unlocked" trapped foreign cash predicts increases in repurchases and dividends.
Atwood, Downes, Henley, and Mathis (2020) find that while US firms on average conducted fewer acquisitions after
the TCJA, firms that faced higher repatriation taxes prior to the TCJA conducted more as more cash became
available. Albertus, Glover, and Levine (2019) estimate a dynamic model and find that the switch from worldwide to
territorial taxation reduces foreign investment by 10.2% on average. More broadly related to these studies is the
literature on why and how firms "stash cash abroad" (Foley, Hartzell, Titman, and Twite 2007), on foreign
acquisitions (Hanlon, Lester, and Verdi 2015), on income-shifting (Dyreng and Markle 2016), the practice of placing
innovation assets in foreign corporations to avoid domestic taxes (Bennedsen and Zeume 2017).   


                                                                                                                                                                                            5
      
demonstrates that proxies used in several of these studies, such as the effective tax rate before the
tax reform, or foreign cash holdings, only capture about half of the variation in the treatment
intensity that might explain the real behavior changes of firms. This suggests that to gauge the tax
consequences of changes in firm behavior documented in the aforementioned studies, future work
can relate the differences between proxies and actual impacts to identifiable behavior changes.
      Stock price responses around the key events leading to the passage of the TCJA were first
analyzed by Wagner, Zeckhauser, and Ziegler (2018b).6 Kalcheva, Plecnik, Tran, and Turkiela
(2019) extend these findings in a more detailed analysis. They also test (but do not find support
for) the idea that financially constrained firms benefited from the TCJA. Gaertner, Hoopes, and
Williams (2020) study international stock price reactions to the TCJA. Chen and Koester (2020)
show that although analysts' GAAP earnings forecasts and revisions failed to incorporate the vast
majority of the deferred tax adjustment that could be expected based on firms' past financials,
investors did impound this adjustment into prices during the period of the TCJA's enactment. All
these studies consider how investors responded to the passage of the reform using proxies based
on financial variables that were observable at the time of the events. The innovation in the present
study is to investigate to what extent ex ante proxies as opposed to ex post outcomes are reflected
in stock prices, first up through the TCJA's passage and then thereafter.



2 Main Elements of Corporate Tax Reform
The main provisions of the corporate tax reform are:
(i)                             Reduction in the statutory corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%;
(ii)                            Full expensing of capital expenditures (sunsets in 20% increments between 2023 and
                                2027);
(iii)                           Limitation of the deductibility of interest expenses to the sum of business interest income
                                and 30% of adjusted taxable income (corresponding to EBITDA for tax years beginning
                                after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2022, and to EBIT thereafter);

  The last major US federal corporate tax reform dates back to 1986. Papers studying how that reform affected stock
prices include McGrattan and Prescott (2005), Cutler (1988), Shevlin and Porter (1992), Downs and Hendershott
(1987), Downs and Tehranian (1988), Bolster and Janjigian (1991), and Givoly and Hayn (1992). Wagner,
Zeckhauser, and Ziegler (2018a) show that stock prices anticipated tax reform during the days following the
surprising outcome of the 2016 Presidential election.  


                                                                                                                                                                                              6
        
(iv)                            Elimination of NOL carrybacks and limitation of NOL utilization to 80% of pre-NOL
                                taxable income;
(v)                             Starting in 2022, capitalization of R&D expenditures;
(vi)                            Elimination of the corporate alternative minimum tax (AMT);
(vii)                           Switch to territorial taxation of multinationals;
(viii) Measures targeting income shifting by multinationals (so-called base erosion provisions),
                                comprising the base erosion and anti-abuse tax (BEAT) and a tax on global intangible
                                low-tax income (GILTI);
(ix)                            A one-time "transition tax" on past unrepatriated foreign earnings (also called the
                                "deemed repatriation tax") at a rate of 15.5% if held in cash and liquid assets and at a rate
                                of 8% if held in other assets. Foreign taxes paid on such earnings can, to a limited extent,
                                be credited against the US tax. The tax can be paid over an eight-year period.


      These changes are generally effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, with
three notable exceptions. First, the expensing of capital expenditures applies to property
purchased and placed into service after September 27, 2017. Second, for their first tax year
ending after December 31, 2017, fiscal year taxpayers are subject to a blended corporate income
tax rate based on the number of days in their fiscal year that lie in 2017 (to which a 35% rate
applies) and in 2018 (to which a 21% rate applies). To illustrate, a fiscal year taxpayer with a
March 31 fiscal year end would face a corporate tax rate of around 31.5% for the fiscal year
ending on March 31, 2018 (being a 35% rate for three quarters and a 21% rate for one quarter).
Third, the deemed repatriation tax on foreign subsidiaries' previously untaxed foreign earnings is
determined as of November 2, 2017 (the date where the TCJA was introduced in the House) or
December 31, 2017, whichever is higher. Importantly, the revised NOL utilization rules only
apply to NOLs arising after 2017.7

  The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act ("CARES Act"), which became law on March 27, 2020,
changed certain provisions in the TCJA. First, the CARES Act eliminates the 80% taxable income limitation for
NOLs utilized in taxable years beginning before January 1, 2021 and introduces a five-year carryback period for
NOLs incurred in taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017 and before January 1, 2021. Second, the CARES
Act increases the limitation on the deductibility of interest expenses from 30% to 50% of adjusted taxable income for
taxable years beginning in 2019 and 2020. In addition, firms can elect to compute their 2020 limitation using their
2019 adjusted taxable income, which benefits companies experiencing a drop in 2020 EBITDA because of the
COVID-19 pandemic. These changes occur outside our sample period and so do not affect the analysis in this paper.

   As mentioned above, the comprehensiveness of the TCJA makes estimating the effect of the
reform on individual firms challenging. It is even difficult to predict which would gain and which
would lose, particularly in light of the sometimes massive amounts of nonrecurring tax
consequences for individual firms from the reform.
     


3 Estimating the TCJA Impact from Financial Statements
This section provides a method to estimate the impact of the TCJA using financial statements.
Throughout the paper, we consider firms that were members of the Russell 3000 index and had a
stock price no less than $5 at the beginning of our sample period (November 1, 2017). We
exclude Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITS) because they pay no income tax. Most of our data
are from Compustat (supplemented by Audit Analytics, Bloomberg, and CRSP in later sections).
Supplementary Appendix Table A-1 provides the definitions of all variables using the
mnemonics of the different databases. Table A-2 provides summary statistics of all variables.


3.1 Overview
The enactment of the TCJA has effects of two types: a recurring effect on annual taxes moving
forward, and a nonrecurring effect. The recurring effect is the result of multiple factors: the lower
corporate tax rate, capex expensing, limitation on interest deductibility, etc. All of these will
affect a firm's effective tax rate, but how strongly will depend on that firm's situation. The
nonrecurring effect arises from two sources. First, firms must remeasure their deferred tax assets
and liabilities to account for the reduction in the statutory tax rate. Second, firms may be subject
to the deemed repatriation tax.
   Our estimation task is made feasible by a provision in the GAAP rules that says that the effect
of any changes in tax laws should be recorded in the financial statements in the accounting period
in which they are enacted. The TCJA was signed into law on December 22, 2017. Hence, the
entire nonrecurring effect showed up in the accounting period including that date. The annual
recurring effect showed up in the financials of the following tax year. (A minor exception is the
capitalization of R&D expenditures, which only takes effect in 2022.)

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
They also clearly were not anticipated. Future work will be able to analyze consequences of and market responses to
these new provisions.   


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            8
     
3.2 Recurring effects
Given the GAAP rules, the recurring effect of the TCJA on a given firm can be computed as the
change in its effective tax rate between the first fiscal year beginning after the enactment of the
reform and the last (or last five) fiscal year(s) ending before the enactment of the reform. For
example, for calendar year taxpayers, the magnitude of the recurring effect can be assessed using
the change in the ETR between 2016 and 2018. Note that it is essential to leave out 2017 when
quantifying the recurring effect because the nonrecurring effects will be recorded in that year.


3.3 Nonrecurring effects
Firms have to report the nonrecurring effect of the reform in the financial statements for the
accounting period containing December 22, 2017. The overall nonrecurring effect is included in
"nonrecurring income taxes", which is disclosed by many firms and is available in the quarterly
Compustat file. This field also contains other nonrecurring tax items, such as audit settlements.
However, for the quarter including December 22, 2017, this field likely provides a reasonably
reliable estimate of the overall nonrecurring effect of the TCJA on firms. First, there were 3,600
such items during the quarter in which the reform was enacted, versus fewer than 500 per quarter
during the remainder of the 2016-2019 period. Second, the standard deviation of nonrecurring
income taxes for the quarter including December 22, 2017 was six times larger than during the
remainder of the 2016-2019 period (US$ 1.101 billion versus US$ 179 million).  
    As mentioned above, the nonrecurring effect has two components: the remeasurement of
deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the lower statutory tax rate, and the deemed
repatriation tax. Some firms separately report these two values in the tax footnotes, but the format
of the disclosures is not uniform.8 Other firms do not report these two values separately, making
it necessary to estimate them. To consistently estimate the two components for all firms, we use
the fact that firms have to record the deemed repatriation tax in their current income tax expense
or benefit, while the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities is recorded in the
deferred income tax expense or benefit.9 Thus, an estimate of these two components can be

  Chen, Erickson, Harding, Stomberg, and Xia (2019) hand-collect data from 121 calendar year taxpayers in the S&P
500 index. Out of these 121 firms, 93 report the effect of remeasurement and the transition tax.

  Note that any deferred tax liability for taxes on earnings of foreign subsidiaries that the company had recorded prior
to the reform appears as a deferred tax benefit (i.e. negative deferred income tax expense for 2017). Hence, current


                                                                                                                                                                                            9
      
obtained as the difference between the values reported in the financial statements for the
accounting period containing the TCJA enactment date and their expected values (described
below) without the nonrecurring effect.
3.3.1 Remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities
Consider first the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. We estimate it as the
difference between the deferred tax expense or benefit in the financial statements of the
enactment period (denoted 2017 for simplicity) and 21/35 of the value in the previous year
(denoted 2016):

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 21
                                                                     DTA/DTL Remeasurement = Deferred taxes2017 -                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Deferred taxes2016                                                                                                                                                                           (1)
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 35


   The intuition behind this expression is that absent the nonrecurring effect, the deferred tax
expense for 2017 would be roughly 21/35 of its value in the previous year, as the impact of any
deferral arising in 2017 would be reduced by the lower tax rate. Importantly, since the reported
amount refers to taxes to be paid in the future, the 21% rate would apply to both calendar year
taxpayers and fiscal year taxpayers. Admittedly, our estimate is not perfect, since capital
expenditures expensing kicked in on September 27, 2017. Such expensing potentially leads to an
increase in the 2017 deferred tax expense driven by the recurring impact of the TCJA rather than
by the nonrecurring one. As was the case for the overall nonrecurring impact, however, the
variation of deferred taxes during the enactment period is much larger than that in other periods,
which suggests that the exact form of the second term in (1) should have only a modest impact.10
As we show below, our estimation scheme works very well in practice.


3.3.2 Deemed repatriation tax
We now turn to the estimation of the deemed repatriation tax. Considering calendar year
taxpayers first for simplicity, our estimate is the difference between current taxes for the year of
enactment (2017) and what one would have expected these taxes to be based on the firm's past
effective tax rate:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       
year taxes will include the entire repatriation tax amount, regardless of what the firm had previously recorded in its
financials.  
10
   In the year the TCJA went into force, the standard deviation of the deferred tax expense is 874.7 million, versus
217.7 million during the remainder of the 2016-2019 period.   


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      10
     
                                                                                        Current taxes 2016
                  Repatriation = Current taxes 2017 - Pretax income2017                                                             (2)

      Fiscal year taxpayers, who face a blended corporate tax rate, require more complex
calculations. Two approaches can be used. The first accounts for the blended rate by scaling the
past ETR based on the number of months of the fiscal year containing December 22, 2017 that lie
in calendar years 2017 and 2018. That produces:


                  Repatriation = Current taxes2017
                                                        nMonths 2017 +
                                                                      21
                                                                         nMonths 2018    Current taxes2016                          (3)
                                 - Pretax income2017                  35
                                                         nMonths 2017 + nMonths 2018
                                                                                         Pretax income2016      


      Importantly, this rescaling also handles the case of firms (of which there are a few in the
sample) whose fiscal year has more or fewer than 12 months. This measure has the advantage of
only using the past ETR. Its disadvantage is that it neglects the fact that the tax rate change does
not apply to foreign income. This problem can be circumvented by using the weighted average of
the ETRs in the year before and after the enactment of the reform. That leads to the estimate:

             

                  Repatriation = Current taxes 2017
                                                        nMonths 2017
                                                                       Current taxes 2016
                                                                                          + nMonths 2018
                                                                                                         Current taxes 2018         (4)
                                                                       Pretax income 2016                Pretax income 2018
                                 - Pretax income 2017                       nMonths 2017 + nMonths 2018
                                                                                                                                


      This measure has the advantage that it is not affected by the relative importance of foreign and
domestic income. Its disadvantage is that the ETR for 2018 is affected by elements of tax reform
beyond the change in the statutory rate. While neither of our two estimators is perfect, their
limitations seem minor in the sample, as the correlation between both measures is 0.9966. We
compromise and use the average of the two values throughout our analysis.




                                                                                                                                    11
        
3.3.3 Quality check
To assess the quality of these estimates, we apply the procedure above to estimate the two
components for each firm using Compustat annual data and then regress the reported
"nonrecurring income taxes" for the quarter containing the TCJA enactment date from the
quarterly Compustat file on these estimates. If our scheme works well, the coefficient of both
remeasurement and the repatriation tax estimate should be close to one. The results of this
analysis are reported in Table 1. Both slopes are very close to one, and statistically
indistinguishable from that value. The R2 for the regression is above 94%, an impressive value
given that nonrecurring income taxes contain items besides the nonrecurring impact of the TCJA.
Hence, we are confident in the accuracy of our decomposition.

4 Impact of the TCJA on Firms
This section employs the method developed in Section 3 to quantify the impacts of the TCJA on
firms. Section 4.1 considers recurring taxes, Section 4.2 studies the nonrecurring impacts, and
Section 4.3 relates these two impacts across firms.

  

4.1 Impact of the TCJA on recurring taxes
The recurring impact of the TCJA can be assessed by examining the change in a firm's effective
tax rate (ETR) between the first fiscal year after the reform was enacted and the last (or last five)
fiscal year(s) prior to the reform.


4.1.1 Effective tax rates before and after the TCJA
We rely on two standard ETR measures, the GAAP ETR and the Cash ETR. The GAAP effective
tax rate (GAAP ETR) is tax expenses relative to current year pretax income. The cash effective
tax rate (Cash ETR) is the percent cash taxes paid relative to current year pretax income (adjusted
for special items).11 The GAAP ETR is in principle more appropriate for identifying the overall
effect of the TCJA than is the Cash ETR. That is because the deemed repatriation tax can be paid
over an eight-year period, so the Cash ETR may well reflect these payments for several years.
      Between 2016 and 2018, the aggregate GAAP ETR across firms (that is, the sum of total tax
expenses over the sum of total pre-tax income across all firms) fell from 26% to 19%. Similarly,
the aggregate Cash ETR fell from 24% to 20%. The aggregate amount of taxes paid decreased by
about 16%.
      This aggregate development is also visible when considering individual firms. Figure 1 shows
the distribution of ETRs in the first post-TCJA year (solid, blue bars) compared to the typical,
average 5-year ETRs before the TCJA (white bars). A massive shift to the left is evident for both
the GAAP ETR and the Cash ETR. The shift is somewhat stronger for the GAAP ETR.




                                                                                                                               
11
  As in Dyreng, Hanlon, Maydew, and Thornock (2017), we restrict the sample to those firms with positive pretax
income as well as a tax rate above 0% and below 100%. We trim all ETRs at the 1% and 99% levels.  


                                                                                                                                                                                              13
        
                                                                                                

                  Figure 1: Effective Tax Rates before and after the TCJA


  Table 2 reports the summary statistics of the GAAP and Cash ETRs for the pre-TCJA and
post-TCJA periods. The median GAAP ETRs in the year and the five years before the reform
were 31.65% and 30.41%, respectively. In the year following the reform, that value fell to
20.77%. The median Cash ETR fell from about 22% in both the year and the five years before the
reform to less than 17% after. Notably, the coefficient of variation of the GAAP ETR after the
reform (9.10 / 20.5 = 0.44) exceeds that before (10.67 / 29.61 = 0.36). This indicates that the
reform did not reduce inequality in ETRs. This observation also holds for the Cash ETR.

4.1.2 Change in effective tax rates
The distribution of the ETR indicates that overall tax rates decreased massively, as has been
widely reported. In a much less well known finding, the TCJA's various provisions actually led
to higher tax rates for a substantial number of firms in the first post-TCJA year than in the
average of the five years before the reform. Figure 2 plots histograms of the change in the GAAP
and Cash ETRs at the individual firm level. Table 3 presents the descriptive statistics.
   Figure 2 shows that most firms experienced a decrease in ETR from pre-TCJA average levels
to the first post-TCJA year, but about 15% (in the case of the GAAP ETR) or 30% (in the case of
the Cash ETR) of firms experienced an increase.

                 Figure 2: The distribution of Effective Tax Rates Changes


   It is noteworthy that the correlation between the changes in the GAAP ETR and those in the
Cash ETR are only 0.25 for the one-year change and 0.28 for the five-year change.
(Supplementary Appendix Figure A-1 shows a scatter plot of the two measures for the change
compared to the five-year average.) These values are surprisingly low at first glance. However,
upon reflection, one would not expect a high correlation for several reasons. First, the GAAP and
Cash ETRs are not that highly correlated in the first place: The correlation is 0.32 when looking
at the year prior to the TCJA, and 0.52 when considering the average of 5 years before the TCJA.
Second, the deemed repatriation tax is a one-off in the GAAP ETR, but is potentially spread over
up to 8 years in the Cash ETR. Third, capex expensing will initially affect the Cash ETR but not
the GAAP ETR as the reduction in current tax expense will be offset by an increase in deferred
taxes.



                                                                                              16
     
4.2 Nonrecurring impact of the TCJA
Consider now the nonrecurring tax impact of the Act. Figure 3 reports the distribution of
effective tax rates during the year of enactment, and of the average ETRs over the previous five
years.




                                                                                                      

         Figure 3: The distribution of effective tax rates in the year of the TCJA enactment
                             compared to the previous five-year average

   Strikingly, the nonrecurring impact resulted in very large GAAP ETRs for a sizable fraction of
firms, suggesting large nonrecurring charges. By contrast, the distribution of Cash ETRs is quite
similar to that during the previous five years. That similarity is expected given that both
components of the nonrecurring impact have no short-term effect on cash. The remeasurement of
DTAs and DTLs relates to taxes in future years, and firms can pay the deemed repatriation tax
over an eight-year period.




                                                                                               17
     
   Table 4 reveals considerable heterogeneity in the nonrecurring impact. The median firm
recorded a minor nonrecurring charge of 0.04% of assets or 0.05% of pre-TCJA (September 30,
2017) equity market value. However, the firm at the 25th percentile recorded a tax benefit of
1.10% of total assets and 1.14% of market value, and the firm at the 75th percentile recorded a tax
expense of 0.90% of total assets or 1.01% of market value. The 10th and 90th percentiles are -
3.01% and 3.03%, respectively. Thus, 20% of firms had a nonrecurring tax expense or benefit
exceeding 3% of assets, a meaningful amount.
   Both components of the nonrecurring impact show considerable variability. Details of the
distribution of DTA/DTL remeasurement and the repatriation tax relative to total assets are
reported in Figure 4. The 25th percentile of the DTA/DTL remeasurement is a tax benefit of
1.38% of assets or 1.28% of market capitalization, while the 75th percentile is a tax expense of
0.62% of assets or 0.54% of equity value. While the distribution of DTA/DTL remeasurement is
almost symmetric and centered only slightly below zero, the distribution of the repatriation tax is
highly skewed. About half of firms incurred virtually no repatriation tax, but firms at the 75th
percentile had a related tax expense of 0.58% of assets or 0.52% of equity value. The 90th
percentile was at 1.69% of total assets or 1.62% of equity value.

           Figure 4: Distribution of the two components of the nonrecurring impact



4.3 Relation between the recurring and nonrecurring impact
Did firms that fared relatively well in terms of the nonrecurring impact also do relatively well in
terms of the recurring impact? Figure 5 provides the answer. It shows a binned scatterplot of the
change in the GAAP ETR against nonrecurring income taxes expressed as a portion of total
assets. There is a striking and highly significant (p < 0.01) positive relation between the two
quantities. Positive and significant relations are also found when relating the change in the GAAP

                                                                                                 19
    
ETR to each of the two components of the nonrecurring impact. Thus, firms that did better in one
area of tax changes tended to do better in each of the others. These correlations obviously do not
reflect any causality. Rather, they reflect the fact that the recurring and the nonrecurring impact
have a number of common determinants, the subject to which we now turn.12




                           Figure 5: Empirical relationship between the recurring and nonrecurring impacts




5 Determinants of the Impact of the TCJA on Firms
Section 4 established that most firms enjoyed large tax savings on a recurring basis; many others
suffered large losses. The nonrecurring impact also produced winners and losers. A natural
question is: Can pre-TCJA financial statement information and firm characteristics explain who
fell where? Section 5.1 answers this question for the recurring impact. Section 5.2 investigates
the determinants of the Act's nonrecurring impacts on individual firms, separately considering
the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the deemed repatriation tax.


                                                                                                                              
12
  Indeed, the positive relation between the recurring and the nonrecurring impact vanishes when controlling for the
determinants considered in Section 5.  


                                                                                                                                                                                             20
       
5.1 Determinants of tax rate changes
Table 5 presents OLS regressions of the changes in effective tax rates on features affected by the
TCJA and firm characteristics (firm size, sales growth, return on assets, and industry).13 Panel A
reports the results for the GAAP ETR. Panel B reports them for the Cash ETR.
     The statutory tax rate fell from 35% to 21%. However, GAAP ETRs hardly fell by 14
percentage points across the board. The reductions tilted strongly. Firms that started with a large
ETR experienced a larger decline. This may reflect the fact some of the other TCJA provisions
made tax planning harder for previously low-taxed firms.
     A firm's past ETR is by far the most important driver of the change in its ETR from before to
after reform. This pattern prevails for both the GAAP ETR and the Cash ETR, in all
specifications. Moreover, the coefficient values vary little when adding other explanatory and
control variables. Those variables include proxies for other TCJA provisions (columns (2) and
(3)), controls for firm characteristics (columns (4)-(6)), and industry fixed effects (columns (7)-
(9)).
     Although industry fixed effects explain part of the ETR change, they contribute relatively
little. As can be seen in columns (7)-(9), adding Fama-French 48 industry fixed effects to the
specification only slightly enhances R2 values.14
     Turning to the other explanatory variables and TCJA provisions, firms with a large share of
foreign revenue experienced a relative tax increase. This reflects two factors: foreign profits do
not directly benefit from the reduced US statutory tax rate, and the Act contained various anti-
income-shifting provisions.15
     Limitations on interest expense deductibility have no discernible impact on ETR changes. This
finding probably arises because this provision only affects about 11% of firms in the sample.
ETR changes are also unrelated to NOL carryforward balances. The reason is that, as noted in
Section 2, the revised NOL utilization rules do not apply to pre-2018 balances.



                                                                                                                              
13
   For robustness, we also estimated all regressions including market leverage as an additional control. The results
change little.   
14
   Regressing ETR changes on industry fixed effects only yields R2 values of 7.36% for the GAAP ETR and 11.28%
for the Cash ETR.  
15
   Dyreng, Gaertner, Hoopes, and Vernon (2020) conduct a detailed comparison of the TCJA's impact on domestic
and US multinational firms. They show that the combination of the switch to territorial taxation and the introduction
of the anti-income-shifting provisions left the US federal tax burden on foreign income essentially unchanged.


                                                                                                                                                                                             21
       
      As one would expect, large capital expenditures led to a reduction in the Cash ETR, but had
no effect on the GAAP ETR. This reflects the fact that capex expensing defers taxes, but does not
affect overall tax expense over an asset's life as recorded in accord with GAAP rules.
      Firms with high R&D expenditures experienced a stronger decrease in ETRs. This may be
surprising at first, as R&D capitalization would boost cash taxes, and that clause does not kick in
until 2022. To some extent, this result reflects R&D tax credit rules: if a firm has large R&D
expenses, that credit will now offset a larger chunk of its pre-credit taxes. That is, in relative
terms that firm gains more than would another firm with the same ETR before the reform but
with little or no R&D.
      Finally, large firms enjoyed a larger reduction in tax rates than did small ones. That finding
strengthens when foreign revenue is included, reflecting the fact that larger firms tend to be more
internationally oriented.
      While the signs on the coefficients of these various proxies make sense, it is noteworthy that
even the most complete specification explains just half of the variation in the actual recurring
ETR change. In other words, half of the actual effects of the TCJA come from firm-specific
factors that scholars have hitherto not considered. This could reflect both intricacies of the tax
code and changes in firm behavior (e.g., adjustments in leverage) after the TCJA. It is
conceivable that investors and analysts, too, focused on these proxies, imperfect as they were;
alternatively, it is conceivable that they could indeed observe or predict the firm-specific factors
driving actual impacts. The analysis in Section 6 investigates this issue further by comparing how
proxies and actual ETR changes were impounded into stock prices over time.
      As noted above, industries are not the primary determinant of ETR changes. Nevertheless, it is
instructive to consider the average ETR change by industry. The results are reported in Panel A
of Figure 6. All industries experienced a decrease in ETR. Of industries with at least five firms in
the sample, utilities, retail, and transportation enjoyed the largest reductions. Textiles, mining,
and printing and publishing received the smallest decreases.16 As can be seen in Panel B,
controlling for the pre-TCJA effective tax rate, foreign revenue, and firm characteristics (firm
size, sales growth, and ROA) leads to a very different conclusion. (We include these variables,
but not the proxies for the other TCJA provisions as those provisions could have been targeting
specific industries.) Of industries with at least five firms in the sample, medical equipment,

     There are only two coal firms and three agriculture firms in the sample.  


                                                                                                                                                                                              22
        
measuring and control equipment, and electronic equipment become the biggest winners. Real
estate, perhaps surprisingly, and rubber and plastic products as well as printing and publishing are
the biggest losers. Most importantly, as Panel B shows, and consistent with Table 5, a range of
several percentage points in the actual differences in ETR changes across firms remains
unexplained by the proxies.



                             Table 5: Determinants of the change in recurring taxes
This table presents OLS regressions of changes in effective tax rates on features affected by the
TCJA and firm characteristics (firm size, sales growth, return on assets, and industry). Panel A
reports the results for the GAAP ETR, panel B those for the Cash ETR. The sample includes
Russell 3000 firms as of November 1, 2017 with a stock price of at least $5. All variables are
defined in Supplementary Appendix Table A-1. Robust standard errors are shown in parentheses.

5.2 Determinants of nonrecurring taxes
We now consider the drivers of the Act's nonrecurring impact on individual firms. Recall that
this impact has two components: the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities, and the
deemed repatriation tax.17
     For the former, one would expect firms with net deferred tax liabilities in the previous year to
record a nonrecurring tax benefit, and those with prior net deferred tax assets to incur a tax
expense. Predicting the amount of the deemed repatriation tax based on information from prior
financial statements is much more challenging. That tax is assessed on unrepatriated foreign
earnings that were not previously subject to US tax (i.e., not included in subpart F income in
previous years), but foreign taxes paid on such earnings can, to a limited extent, be credited
against the US repatriation tax.18   In short, the requisite information for an accurate prediction is
not readily available.
     The TCJA requires that firms record unrepatriated foreign earnings and profits (E&P) that
have not previously been subject to US tax (i.e. that were not part of the subpart F income
inclusion in previous years) in their subpart F income inclusion for the last taxable year beginning
before January 1, 2018. However, a deduction is allowed to the extent necessary for the foreign
E&P attributable to cash and other liquid assets to be taxed at an effective rate of 15.5 percent
and the remaining foreign E&P to be taxed at an effective rate of 8 percent. Foreign tax credits
for the portion of earnings subject to the tax can be used to offset it. In effect, this rule means that
foreign tax credits are reduced in the same proportion as income, with the consequence that the


                                                                                                                              
17
   Donelson, Koutney, and Mills (2019) investigate whether information from past financial statements allows
predicting nonrecurring income taxes both in general, and specifically in the quarter of the TCJA's enactment. They
show that DTA and DTL for the quarter preceding the TCJA's enactment and permanently reinvested earnings for
the previous year strongly predict overall nonrecurring income taxes for the quarter of the TCJA's enactment.
However, their analysis does not separately consider the predictability of DTA/DTL remeasurement and the deemed
repatriation tax.  
18
   Prior to the TCJA, firms were taxed on worldwide income, but with the exception of so-called subpart F income,
the taxation of foreign earnings was deferred until these earnings were repatriated back to the US. When repatriating
foreign profits, firms got a credit for the foreign taxes paid on that income, but typically incurred an extra tax cost
because the pre-TCJA US corporate tax rate exceeded the tax rate in virtually all countries (so that credits brought in
with the distribution were usually lower than the incremental US tax before credits). Under the subpart F rules,
certain types of income earned by a foreign subsidiary are taxable to the US parent in the year earned even if the
foreign corporation does not distribute the income to its shareholder in that year. Broadly speaking, Subpart F
income includes investment income such as dividends, interest, rents, and royalties; income from the purchase or sale
of personal property involving a related person; and income from the performance of services by or on behalf of a
related person.   


                                                                                                                                                                                             26
       
repatriation tax cost is proportional to the difference between the US tax rate and the effective
foreign tax rate.
     Thus, to estimate the size of the repatriation tax cost based on past financials, we use the
product of (1) the amount deemed to be repatriated under the TCJA, which we proxy by foreign
earnings that were classified as indefinitely reinvested in firms' financial statements,19 and (2) the
difference between the pre-TCJA US corporate tax rate of 35% and the average effective tax rate
that firms paid on their foreign earnings during the previous five years:
                                                                                                                                                                                             T -1

     Table 6 shows regressions of nonrecurring income taxes and its two components on a firm's
estimated repatriation tax cost and its total net deferred tax liabilities expressed as a portion of
total assets. One would not expect the TCJA provisions affecting recurring income taxes to be
important drivers of nonrecurring income taxes. Nevertheless, we include them as controls to
maintain consistency with the previous analyses, and to account for the effect of some provisions
of the deemed repatriation tax rules discussed below.21 Estimating the repatriation tax cost
requires data on both indefinitely reinvested earnings and foreign taxes paid. That requirement
would reduce the number of observations to between about 650 and about 900 depending on the

   Accounting rules require the US parent to record a deferred tax expense and a corresponding deferred tax liability
reflecting the incremental US tax (i.e., net of the credit for foreign taxes) that will be due on foreign earnings upon
repatriation. An exception to this rule applies to earnings that the company does not intend to bring back to the US.
In this case, Accounting Standards Codification Section 740-10-25 provides that the company must designate the
earnings as indefinitely reinvested for accounting purposes, and no deferred tax liability (nor deferred tax expense) is
recorded. The result is a lower tax expense, lower GAAP ETR, and higher after-tax income than if the designation
were not made. While not all unremitted foreign earnings are designated as indefinitely reinvested, Graham, Hanlon,
and Shevlin (2011) survey tax executives and find that more than half of the firms in their sample designate all of
their unremitted earnings as indefinitely reinvested, and that three-fourths of all accumulated foreign earnings are
declared indefinitely reinvested.  
20
   This computation follows Hanlon, Maydew, and Saavedra (2017), who also employ a long-run (five-year) measure
as an alternative to the one-year measure used in Foley, Hartzell, Titman, and Twite (2007) and Lester and Verdi
(2015). Since the deemed repatriation tax rate is larger for the foreign E&P attributable to cash and other liquid
assets than for the remaining E&P, we also consider an alternate measure of the repatriation tax cost where the
measure shown in the text is multiplied by the sum of 15.5/35 times cash holdings as a percent of assets and 8/35
times one minus cash holdings as a percent of assets. The results are very similar to those reported in Table 6.  
21
   Including both net deferred tax liabilities and NOL carryforward balances is justified both theoretically and
empirically. NOL carryforward balances are reflected in deferred tax assets, but only after being multiplied by the
domestic or foreign tax rate (as the case may be), and conditional on the company's assessment of whether their
utilization before expiration is likely. These quantities therefore do not translate one-for-one into deferred tax assets.
Empirically, NOL carryforward balances exhibit a slightly negative correlation of -0.09 with deferred tax assets and -
0.05 with net deferred tax liabilities.   


                                                                                                                                                                                                              27

missing, and mark the corresponding observations using a dummy variable. (Similar inferences
are obtained when dropping firms where the repatriation tax cost is missing.)

     The results reveal that data from past financial statements enable reasonably accurate forecasts
of both the overall nonrecurring tax impact and its two components.22 Net deferred tax liabilities
and the estimated repatriation tax cost alone account for almost half of the variation in the
nonrecurring tax expense. As one would expect, and confirming the quality of our decomposition
of the nonrecurring tax expense, DTA/DTL remeasurement is almost entirely driven by a firm's
net deferred tax liability position. Moreover, the repatriation tax is highly correlated with the
estimated repatriation tax cost. It is noteworthy that once one accounts for the estimated
repatriation cost, a firm's past ETR does not contribute to explaining the repatriation tax. The
share of foreign revenue contributes to explaining the repatriation tax, reflecting the fact that
foreign earnings and profits are subject to the tax whether or not firms had designated them as
indefinitely reinvested for accounting purposes.23
     The perhaps surprising negative coefficient on tax loss carryforwards is explained by the fact
that pursuant to the TCJA, the subpart F income inclusion on which the deemed repatriation tax is
assessed can be reduced by the deficits of certain foreign subsidiaries. Thus, to the extent that
some of the NOL carryforward balances carried by foreign subsidiaries reflect accumulated
deficits when applying US tax rules to foreign income, they lower the repatriation tax.24
     Figure 7 reports average nonrecurring income taxes as a percent of total assets by industry.
Among industries with at least five firms in the sample, the largest nonrecurring tax expenses
arise in the electronic equipment, pharmaceutical products, and apparel industries.25 The largest
tax benefits (depicted as negative tax amounts) occur in transportation, food products, and
communication. Considering the two components separately (see Figure 8), the remeasurement of
deferred tax assets and liabilities (Panel A) resulted in large nonrecurring tax expenses in the
defense, recreation, and trading industries, and yielded large tax benefits in transportation, beer
and liquor, and entertainment. The largest average deemed repatriation taxes (Panel B) are found

                                                                                                                              
22
   The results for the overall nonrecurring tax impact are similar to those in Donelson, Koutney, and Mills (2019),
who use permanently reinvested earnings instead of the expected repatriation tax cost.  
23
   To take a notable example, Apple Inc. had recorded a deferred tax liability of $36.4 billion for taxes due upon
repatriation of the earnings of its foreign subsidiaries.  
24
   This distinction is somewhat technical. NOL carryforward balances reported in firms' financial statements contain
both US and foreign balances. Foreign NOL balances are computed by applying foreign tax rules to foreign
subsidiaries' income and expenses. The accumulated deficits of foreign subsidiaries that the US parent can use to
offset the income subject to the deemed repatriation tax are computed by applying US tax rules to foreign
subsidiaries' income and expenses. Thus, these accumulated deficits are not visible in firms' reported financials, but
are likely to be correlated to foreign NOL balances.

   There are only two precious metals, three agriculture, and three tobacco firms in the sample.

the domestically focused healthcare and real estate, as well as insurance.

6 How Effective was the Market in Anticipating the TCJA's
  Impact?
As the introduction mentions, for a study of information processing the TCJA has the unusual
feature that its actual impacts, both recurring and nonrecurring, can be quantified quite well ex
post. This section assesses to what extent the market anticipated these effects by contrasting the
explanatory power of ex ante available proxies for the TCJA's impacts and the ex post observable
actual impacts for the cross-section of stock returns. Section 6.1 considers firms' stock price
reactions as the TCJA advanced through the legislative process. Section 6.2 studies post-
enactment returns.   
  

6.1 Returns during the TCJA passage
To investigate stock price behavior during the TCJA passage, we use firms' cumulative returns
from November 2, 2017 (inclusive) through December 22, 2017.26 We primarily use CAPM-
adjusted returns. The size and value factors only exhibited small moves in the time period under
consideration. Indeed, CAPM-adjusted returns and returns that also control for the Fama-French
size and value factors exhibit a correlation of 0.98. Table A-2 in the Supplementary Appendix
shows that all inferences hold when using Fama-French-adjusted returns.
               We run three specifications. The first, the "proxy" specification, employs ex ante available
proxies for the expected impact of the different provisions of the TCJA on firms as explanatory
variables. The second, the "actual" specification, includes the actual recurring and nonrecurring
impacts of the TCJA that can be quantified ex post from financial statements as explanatory
variables. The third specification conducts a horse race by including both sets of variables. If
investors had better estimates of the TCJA's impact than those provided by the proxies, the
coefficients of the variables capturing actual impacts should be statistically significant when
included together with the proxies.

                                                                                                                               
26
   We obtain stock return data from CRSP. To compute CAPM-adjusted returns, we first estimate each stock's
market beta from an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression of daily stock returns in excess of the risk-free rate on
the market excess return obtained from Ken French's website for the period from September 30, 2016 through
September 30, 2017 (estimation window). The risk-free rate is that from Ken French's website. We then compute
abnormal returns for all days as the daily excess return on the stock minus beta times the market excess return. We
compound daily returns to obtain cumulative ones. To avoid our results being affected by unstable beta estimates, we
only include firms for which at least 126 daily returns are available during the estimation window. We proceed
analogously to compute Fama-French-adjusted returns.   


                                                                                                                                                                                              32
        
              Whether industry fixed effects should be included in our setting can be debated.
Conceptually, the purpose of including industry fixed effects would be to eliminate the impact on
returns of factors that are unrelated to the effects under investigation. As seen in Section 5, there
was substantial heterogeneity in both the recurring and nonrecurring impacts across industries. If
tax reform drove average returns by industry during the period studied, including industry fixed
effects might be controlling excessively. Not taking a stand, we report the results for both cases.
              Table 7 shows the results, utilizing the same control variables as in the rest of the paper
(profitability, log market cap, and sales growth). The coefficients on those controls are not
reported for brevity. Since the variables capturing the nonrecurring impact lead to a much smaller
sample size, for each of the three specifications described above, we estimate two regressions.
One includes only the recurring impact, and the other includes both the recurring and the
nonrecurring impact.27
     Consider first the "proxy" specification. The results employing proxies for the recurring
impact without industry fixed effects are consistent with those reported in the literature. High-tax
firms and firms with large capital expenditures benefited, while those with a large share of
foreign revenue and those with large R&D expenditures lost. The finding that firms with large
NOL balances outperformed may seem puzzling at first. Since the TCJA NOL rules only apply to
NOLs arising after 2017, one may have expected a coefficient of zero. As mentioned in Section
6.1, however, the deficits of certain foreign subsidiaries can be used to reduce the subpart F
income inclusion on which the deemed repatriation tax is assessed. Thus, to the extent that some
of the NOL carryforward balances carried by foreign subsidiaries reflect accumulated deficits
when applying US tax rules to foreign income, they lower the repatriation tax, and hence support
a higher share price.
     When including Fama-French 48 fixed effects, the past 5-year GAAP ETR is the only variable
that remains significant at the 5% level. When including the proxies for the nonrecurring effect as
explanatory variables, the expected repatriation tax cost is significant whether or not industry
fixed effects are included. By contrast, a firm's net DTL position is only weakly related to returns
(and with an unexpected sign) in the case without fixed effects, and insignificant when fixed
                                                                                                                              
27
  We also investigate the robustness of the findings by estimating the specifications that include only the recurring
impact for the subsample of firms where the explanatory variables capturing the nonrecurring impact are also
available. The results are fairly similar to those reported in Table 7, although the statistical significance of the
coefficients is somewhat weaker due to the smaller sample size.  


                                                                                                                                                                                             33
       
effects are included.28 The addition of the proxies for the nonrecurring impact affects the
coefficients on the proxies for the recurring impact only slightly; in particular, the past GAAP
ETR remains significant both without and with industry fixed effects.
     In the "actual" specifications, the repatriation tax is the main driver of returns, but it is only
significant at the 10% level when including industry fixed effects. Similar to the "proxy"
specification, the remeasurement of DTA/DTL is not significant. Surprisingly, in the case without
industry fixed effects, the R2 values are lower when using the actual impact than when using the
proxies.
     When both sets of explanatory variables are included, most proxies retain their significance in
the specification without industry fixed effects, but the actual tax impacts become insignificant.
With fixed effects included, the only significant driver of returns is the repatriation tax cost
proxy. Overall, these results show that during the passage of the TCJA, investors priced the effect
of tax reform using proxies rather than more precise estimates of the actual impact.

   When omitting observations with net DTL above 10% of assets, this variable is insignificantly related to returns
throughout. Givoly and Hayn (1992) find that the market priced DTLs as liabilities when the corporate tax rate was
cut in the 1986 reform. However, reviewing the literature overall, Graham, Raedy and Shackelford (2012) note that it
is an open question whether deferred tax accounts are priced. (Holthausen and Watts)

   Table 8 performs a similar analysis for abnormal returns on December 4, 2017, the first
trading day after the Act passed in the Senate. This day is of particular interest because in light of
the Republicans' slim majority in the Senate, many observers viewed the Senate vote as the
"make or break" moment of the reform. Moreover, the legislative text of the Senate version
differed in several important respects from the House version. Notably, the Senate version
included the anti-income-shifting provisions (BEAT and GILTI) and a higher deemed
repatriation tax rate (7.5% and 14.5% in the Senate version versus 7% and 14% in the House
version). It also introduced the provision to capitalize R&D expenditures.
   These changes are reflected in the regression coefficients in the "proxy" specification: firms
with a large GAAP ETR gained, reflecting the increased likelihood of tax reform being passed;
firms with a large expected repatriation tax cost, those with large foreign revenue, and those with
large R&D expenditures lost. In the "actual" specification, firms with a large repatriation tax and
those with a large tax cost from the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities both lost
significantly. As was the case for the overall period, the market priced the repatriation tax much
more strongly than it did the remeasurement of deferred tax assets and liabilities. In addition, the
R2 values are lower when using the actual impact than when using the proxies. When performing
the horse race between both sets of variables, most of the proxies for the expected benefits and
costs of the reform for firms remain significant. Net DTL becomes significant, but not with the
expected sign. However, the variables capturing the actual impact of the reform have either much
lower significance or, in the case of the change in the GAAP ETR, even have the wrong sign.
This last result means that the stocks of firms that ended up facing a tax increase relative to what
would have been expected based on the proxies outperformed. The cross-section of returns for
the day following the Senate vote, therefore, confirms the finding that investors priced the impact
of the TCJA on firms utilizing proxies rather than through more precise estimates of the actual
impact.
   A likely reason that investors priced stocks using proxies is that it would have been extremely
cumbersome to make better estimates of the actual impact of the Act that would later materialize.
If so then we would expect the part they missed to get priced in later on, as the financials became
available. We now turn to this issue.

6.2 Post-enactment returns
As discussed above, once information on the actual impact of the TCJA becomes available to
market participants, the part of that information not captured by the proxies should become
reflected in stock prices. When that information becomes available differs somewhat between the
recurring and the nonrecurring impact. Specifically, as discussed previously, firms have to report
the nonrecurring impact in their financials for the period of the Act's enactment. Hence, that
information becomes known as firms publish their quarterly results for the fiscal quarter
containing December 22, 2017. That would be results for the last quarter of 2017 for calendar
year taxpayers and results for quarters ending January or February 2018 for fiscal year taxpayers.
Accordingly, most of the information on the nonrecurring impact can be expected to reach market
participants during the first calendar quarter of 2018.
   By contrast, a complete picture of the recurring impact only becomes available once firms
publish their full-year financials for the first taxable year that begins after December 31, 2017.
However, market participants will already obtain gleanings about the recurring impact as firms
publish their first quarterly financials for quarters that end during 2018. Thus, prices during the
first quarter of 2018 (as firms with quarter-ends in January or February 2018 publish their results)
should start to reflect recurring impacts, and most of those impacts should be impounded in
prices by the end of the second quarter of 2018 (as the results for the first quarter of 2018 for
calendar year taxpayers are published).
   When and to what extent did markets price in the actual impact of the Act on firms after its
passage? To answer, we estimate OLS regressions of CAPM-adjusted returns for different
periods on the proxies for and the actual impacts of the Act. Those regressions employ the same
control variables as in Table 7. Table 9 shows the results. (Results for Fama-French-adjusted
returns are in Supplementary Appendix Table A-3.) To facilitate comparison with the previous
analysis, column (1) reports the estimates for the period of the TCJA's passage (corresponding to
column (6) in Table 7). Columns (2)-(5) show the results for the four calendar quarters of 2018,
and column (6) those for the full year 2018.
   First, consider the results without industry fixed effects. Columns (1) and (2)-(5) reveal a stark
contrast. During the passage of the Act, many proxies, but none of the actuals, are significantly
related to returns. The opposite holds in the first quarters of 2018. Specifically, during the first
quarter, firms' stock returns are negatively related to the actual change in the GAAP ETR, but the


                                                                                                  40
     
proxies are either insignificant or (presumably because investors previously gave the proxies
excess weight) have a sign opposite from what the law change would have suggested.
   During the second quarter, there is again a strong negative relation between stock returns and
the change in the GAAP ETR. That is, the market strongly revised downwards the value of firms
that would turn out to experience higher recurring tax rates. In fact, the negative relation between
the actual change in the GAAP ETR and stock returns is so strong that it proves significant in
cumulative returns over the entire year 2018.
   The pricing of nonrecurring items proved somewhat erratic. During the first quarter, the actual
repatriation tax and the hit from the remeasurement of DTAs and DTLs affect stock returns
negatively, as expected. However, the first quarter also saw a negative relation between returns
and net DTL, which reversed by an equivalent amount in the fourth quarter. In the second
quarter, the repatriation tax has an unexpected positive relation with returns. We do not have a
compelling explanation for these counterbalancing intra-year results for nonrecurring items. Over
the whole year, none of the proxies or actuals related to such items was a significant determinant
of stock returns.
   When including industry fixed effects, the negative relation between returns and the change in
the GAAP ETR is significant at the 10% level during the first quarter, and at the 1% level in the
second. In this specification as well, the negative relation between the actual change in the GAAP
ETR and stock returns is significant in full-year returns. The puzzling net DTL result vanishes,
whereas the surprisingly positive relation of returns with the repatriation tax in the second quarter
remains, albeit with lower significance.
   Overall, the results show that investors impounded the TCJA's actual impact into prices
during the months following the TCJA's enactment, once that impact became visible in firms'
financial statements. This was the case especially clearly and in a sustained fashion for the
recurring impact of the TCJA. The findings highlight how difficult it can be for market
participants to price accurately even large, immediate and continuing changes in the cash flows of
a company.

                                        and after its enactment
This table presents OLS regressions of cumulative abnormal returns (CARs) during the passage
of the TCJA (November 2, 2017 - December 22, 2017) and during 2018 on proxies for the
different TCJA provisions, actual tax benefits/losses, and a combination. The sample includes
Russell 3000 firms as of November 1, 2017 with a stock price of at least $5. All variables are
defined in Supplementary Appendix Table A-1. Robust standard errors are shown in parentheses.

7 Conclusion
The 2017 Tax Cut and Jobs Act (TCJA) was the first comprehensive reform of the US tax code in
thirty years. It changed the Internal Revenue Code's provisions for corporations both broadly and
deeply. This study examines how the TCJA affected the taxes of individual corporations, and
how investors reacted to these effects. It makes three contributions.
   First, it separately quantifies the recurring and nonrecurring tax impacts of the TCJA by
combining financial statement information from the pre-enactment, enactment, and post-
enactment periods. Estimating the recurring impact ­ that is, the way the TCJA affected tax rates
going forward ­ is straightforward. It is just the difference between firms' effective tax rates for
the pre-enactment and post-enactment periods. However, calculating the TCJA's two
nonrecurring impacts ­ that is, the one-time repatriation tax and the remeasurement of deferred
tax assets and liabilities ­ is more challenging. We provide simple but accurate methods to
estimate these two components. Contrary to naïve conjecture, quite a few firms experienced a
non-trivial increase in their effective tax rates after the TCJA. Moreover, 20% of firms had
substantial nonrecurring tax expenses or benefits that exceeded 3% of their total assets.
   Second, it investigates how effectively proxies for the TCJA impacts used in the extant
literature are able to predict the actual impacts. Proxies for these impacts ­ such as the prior-
year(s) tax rate(s), foreign exposure, interest expenses, net DTLs, and so on ­ explain only about
half of the variation in each of the actual effective tax rate changes, DTA/DTL re-measurement,
and the repatriation tax. This leaves half unexplained. The unexplained portion of the actual
impact of the TCJA reflects both intricacies of the tax code and the changes it induced in firm
behaviors. The study's findings should provide a base for the growing body of research
examining changes in firm behavior after the TCJA. Specifically, future work may be able to
quantify the tax consequences of changes in firm behavior by relating them to the differences
between the impact predicted by the proxies and those actually experienced.
   Third, this study investigates how effective the market was in anticipating the actual impact of
the TCJA on firms. As prior work has shown, during the passage of the TCJA, stock prices
moved quite unevenly, as investors conjectured its effects and as uncertainties about its
provisions were resolved. Those initial price movements show that investors relied on readily
observed proxies to forecast how the TCJA would affect companies' fates and to guide their


                                                                                                 44
     
investments. This suggests that in the face of complex legislative changes, investors resorted to
these proxies to estimate those changes' consequences, presumably because they could discern no
better way to estimate the actual impacts of the Act. Reinforcing this interpretation, as
information on the actual impacts of the TCJA became available in early 2018, stock prices
impounded the part of the actual impact the proxies failed to capture. The overarching message of
the analysis is that market participants are only mildly successful in predicting the consequences
of rare events that affect core elements of firms' cash flows, even when those events are widely
publicized.
