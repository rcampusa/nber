Smoke Signals: Adolescent Smoking and School Continuation

JEL No. I12, I2

                                           ABSTRACT


This paper presents an exploratory analysis using NLSY97 data of the relationship between the
likelihood of school continuation and the choices of whether to smoke or drink. We demonstrate that
in the United States as of the late 1990s, smoking in 11th grade was a uniquely powerful predictor
of whether the student finished high school, and if so whether the student matriculated in a four-year
college. For economists the likely explanation for this empirical link would be based on
interpersonal differences in time preference, but that account is called in question by our second
finding -- that drinking does not predict school continuation. We speculate that the demand for
tobacco by high school students is influenced by the signal conveyed by smoking (of being off track
in school), one that is especially powerful for high-aptitude students. To further develop this view,
we present estimates of the likelihood of smoking as a function of school commitment and other,
more traditional variables. There are no direct implications from this analysis for whether smoking
is in some sense a cause of school dropout. We offer some speculations on this matter in the
conclusion.

A. Introduction

       Smoking initiation by adolescents has been analyzed by economists as a choice

reflecting prices, tastes, and subjective evaluation of the long-term risks of addiction and

disease. What is missing from this account is the fact that smoking is a social activity

and subject to peer influence. Peers may serve as a source of information about why and

how to smoke, and how to obtain cigarettes. Peers also serve as an audience, observing

and evaluating others’ behavior. That evaluation is mediated by the long association in

popular culture between smoking and a variety of attributes prized by adolescents. Like

choice of fashion in hair and clothing, body piercing, comportment, and so forth,

smoking by adolescents connotes information about identity. Knowing that, the decision

of whether to smoke is partly a decision of what identity to project.

       Smoking has long been linked in popular culture to such attributes as autonomy,

rejection of mainstream values, sophistication, and being “cool.” These cultural links are

no doubt strengthened for adolescents by the fact that smoking is illegal for those under

18, banned by many schools, frowned on by adults, and known to be potentially harmful.

While these attributes make smoking more attractive to many adolescents, it is also true

that smoking sends a signal of being off track in school that would generally be perceived

by peers as negative.

       In particular, in this paper we demonstrate that in the United States as of the late

1990s, smoking in 11th grade was a uniquely powerful predictor of whether the student

finished high school, and if so whether the student matriculated in a four-year college.

For economists the obvious explanation for this empirical link is interpersonal differences

in time preference. Smoking offers immediate benefits (to those who enjoy it) with long




                                                                                               3
delayed costs in the form of disease, disability, and early death. Dropping out of school

also offers immediate benefits (for those who would rather have more leisure or earnings)

with delayed costs in terms of limited career options. That smokers drop out early is

then simply a reflection of their high rate of time discount. This explanation is satisfying

because it is based on well-established concepts relating to time preference (Hoppe 2001;

Menger [1871] 1976; Mises [1949] 1998; Böhm-Bawerk [1884-1921] 1959; Strigl 2001;

Rothbard [2004] 1963). Time preference rates are deemed subjective and to differ

among individuals (Smith 1988: 5). These differences have been identified as central to

explaining the socioeconomic class structure (Banfield 1974) and explaining differences

in criminal propensities (Banfield 1974; Banfield 1977; Wilson & Herrnstein 1985).

       What confuses this simple account is our finding that a parallel activity, drinking,

is not predictive of school dropout – despite the fact that its temporal payoff is quite

similar to smoking. If adolescent decisions about health-related behaviors are generally

guided by concern for the future, then why doesn’t adolescent drinking follow the same

pattern as smoking? That anomalous finding opens the door to other kinds of

explanation, including social status concerns. (While economists may be uncomfortable

with this line of explanation, social psychologists would accept status sensitivity as a

fundamental of human nature.) When it comes to social status, both the costs and

benefits of smoking are immediate but differ among individuals according to whether

they would otherwise be perceived by peers as being on track to college, and whether

they are in fact on track. We suggest that the decision to smoke is being driven in part by

the fact that youths are aware of the messages it conveys to their peers. The smoking

signal conveys more information for high-aptitude youths than those with low aptitude,




                                                                                            4
and hence carries a greater social cost for the former. It turns out that both aptitude and

commitment to school appear to influence smoking decisions.

       In what follows, we describe the data set, present results demonstrating the

predictive power of smoking and drinking, and then estimate a demand function for

smoking by high-school juniors that includes whether they are destined to graduate and

go on to college. We offer an explanation for the empirical findings that rests on

smoking as one signal of being unlikely to continue in school, the power of which is

conditioned on aptitude.

       There are no direct implications from this analysis for whether smoking is in

some sense a cause of school dropout. We offer some speculations on this matter in the

conclusion.



B. The Data

       Our data source is the 1997 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY),

sponsored by the Bureau of Labor Statistics of the US Department of Labor. The sample

of 8,984 individuals surveyed is representative of the US population in 1997 that was

born between 1980 and 1984 (Center for Human Resource Research 2002). Data were

gathered through hour-long interviews with the participants and questionnaires completed

by the parents in that year. Additional data have been collected from the participants

every year since; the Labor Department has released these data from the six waves

through 2002.




                                                                                              5
        The NLSY data include detailed information on respondents’ demographic

characteristics, family, work, criminal activities, and health status. Of particular relevance

to our work are the items on drinking, smoking, and schooling.

        Our estimates are based on a sub-sample of 3,915 NLSY respondents who were

juniors in high school in 1997, 1998, or 1999. (We excluded those who were relatively

old for this grade, and in particular those who were over 18.) Key outcome measures

include whether the respondent graduated from high school the year following junior

year, and whether the respondent matriculated in a four-year college or university

thereafter.

        Definitions and summary statistics for all variables used in the analysis are

presented in Table A1.



C. Smoking as a Predictor of School Continuation

        Respondents who said that they had smoked at least one cigarette in the previous

30 days were designated “smokers.” Those who had at least one drink of alcohol in the

previous 30 days were designated “drinkers,” and those who admitted to having 5 or

more drinks on at least four occasions in that period were designated “frequent binge

drinkers.”

        Another key variable in our analysis is the respondent’s score on the math

component of the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB). This test was

given to most of the NLSY respondents in 1997. Together with modules testing other

aptitudes, it was developed by the US military to guide placement of new recruits into




                                                                                            6
alternative specialties. It is also valid as a predictor of school achievement (Roberts, et

al. 2000).

           Tables 1 and 2 compare smokers and non-smokers for various subgroups of

respondents with respect to high-school graduation rates, and college matriculation rates.

For the entire sample, the high school on-time graduation rate for males is 60% for

smokers and 75% for nonsmokers; the college matriculation rate is 12% for smokers and

30% for nonsmokers, a more than two-to-one difference. For females, the high school

graduation rate is 71% for smokers and 80% for nonsmokers; the college matriculation

rates are 21% and 37%.1

           The results presented in these tables make clear that the “smoking signal” applies

not only to the population of high-school juniors as a whole, but also to each of several

subgroups. Non-smokers are more likely than smokers to continue their education: for

respondents with low ASVAB as well as those with high; for youths with mothers or

fathers who are high school dropouts, as well as those who are college graduates; and for

each of three groups defined by race (black, Hispanic, and all others). These results are

depicted in Figure 1 as well.

           We refined this analysis by running multivariate logit regressions for males and

females. These regressions analyze the effect of smoking on the odds of high school

graduation and college matriculation controlling for demographic and family

circumstances. Full results are reported in Table A2. Partial results of two specifications

are reported in Table 3: the first specification includes the smoker dummy variable, but

nothing on drinking, while the second specification adds two drinking indicators -- an

indicator of whether the respondent is a drinker and an indicator of whether the
1
    These results are based on counts of respondents, and do not employ the sample weights.


                                                                                              7
respondent is a frequent binger. Each coefficient reported in the table includes the z-

statistic, the ratio of the estimated coefficient and standard error, which in the limit has a

normal distribution.

        The logit regressions demonstrate that smoking is strongly (negatively) predictive

of high school graduation and especially college matriculation for both males and females

even after adjusting for family structure, socioeconomic status, academic ability and

other characteristics of the respondent. On the other hand, drinkers have about the same

chances as nondrinkers when smoking is held constant. The exception is the small group

of females who are frequent bingers, who have a reduced likelihood of school

continuation.

        The predictive importance of smoking is suggested by the fact that the estimated

effect on the log odds of college matriculation of smoking is larger than the effect of

having a father who is a dropout rather than a college graduate (other things equal).

        While smoking status is a strong predictor of school continuation, the most

powerful predictor is the math ASVAB score. The coefficient estimates and z statistic

are reported in Table 3. As an example, consider the estimated effect of moving up by

one standard deviation on ASVAB score. For males, that would increase the odds of

graduating from high school by a factor of 1.7, and the odds of matriculating by a factor

of 3.4. For females, moving up one standard deviation on ASVAB would increase the

odds of graduating from high school by a factor of 2.0, and increase the odds of

matriculating by 2.8.2


2
  We experimented a bit with the sample and specification. The estimated effect of ASVAB is almost
identical in baseline equations (not shown) that have no drinking or smoking variables. Table A3 presents
the results of the same regressions run for the sub-sample of respondents who are white or “other” races –
neither black nor Hispanic. Isolating this group is of interest because there does appear to be a strong


                                                                                                             8
         Since the logit specification is multiplicative, the absolute effect of smoking on

the odds of school continuation increases with ability. That fact is illustrated by Figure 3,

which depicts the effect of being a smoker in junior year on the probability of college

matriculation the following year over a wide range of ASVAB scores (four standard

deviations). At two SDs below the mean the likelihood of college matriculation is very

small for both smokers and nonsmokers. Even though smoking is a negative signal, it is

of little consequence given low ability. Above the mean the smoking gap becomes wide.



D. Alternative perspectives on adolescent smoking

         Given that smoking is negatively linked to school continuation among 11th

graders, we expect that 11th graders will take that fact into account when deciding

whether to smoke. Which of the following is important in a 16- or 17-year-old deciding

whether to smoke?:

    •    Tastes: the intrinsic pleasure of inhaling smoke and blowing it out again

    •    Price and availability of cigarettes and related commodities

    •    Concern about the possibility of becoming habituated to tobacco and someday

         suffering adverse health consequences

    •    Assessment of what peers and adults will think

         The traditional economics literature has focused on the first three concerns.

Tastes and price are considerations for any commodity. The fact that smoking has health

consequences suggests that the decision to smoke is part of the portfolio of investments

“race” effect in smoking and drinking. As it turns out, however, the prediction equations are quite similar
with respect to the key coefficients. We also experimented with adding an interaction term (ASVAB *
Smoking) to the prediction equations, but none of the coefficient estimates on this interaction term had a
statistically discernible effect. (Most of the z-statistics were less than one.)



                                                                                                              9
and disinvestments in “health capital” (Grossman 1972), and for that reason preferences

concerning time and risk also become important. Because smoking is addictive, there are

an additional set of delayed consequences associated with smoking including tolerance

and habituation; these consequences may also influence current decisions (Becker &

Murphy 1988; Chaloupka 1991; Becker, Grossman & Murphy 1991). Some evidence

from this analysis points to a conclusion that youthful smoking decisions reflect a higher

rate of time discount – greater “myopia” -- than for adults (Chaloupka 1991).

       A series of studies by Joni Hersch and her associates have produced evidence that

adult smokers as a group tend to be risk takers, careless of their health and life in domains

other than smoking (Hersch & Viscusi 1990; Hersch & Pickton 1995; Hersch & Viscusi

1998). “In terms of the level of risk, smokers are less likely to perform preventive health

activities such as seatbelt use, flossing, and checking their blood pressure. They choose

riskier jobs, are more likely to be injured on their jobs controlling for objective measures

of risk, are more likely to have an accident at home, and are more likely to have an

accident overall (Hersch & Viscusi 1998).”

       Following this line of logic, an explanation for the negative link between smoking

and school continuation among adolescents is that both are influenced by the time

preferences of the individuals – other things equal, youths who are more present-oriented

will be more likely than their peers to smoke (because they discount long-term negative

consequences) and more likely to end their schooling early.

       But if youths care about the opinions of their peers, then the logic is not so clear.

For 11th graders, smoking, as demonstrated in the previous section, is a signal of being

off track and unsuccessful in the school domain. That message may cause smokers to




                                                                                           10
lose standing with peers, most of whom aspire to graduate from high school and obtain a

college education (Cook & Ludwig 1997). That loss of standing will be an immediate

cost and hence of particular salience to present-oriented youths. On the other hand, the

cost of being identified as “off track” is less for those who are in fact off track, than for

those who are. For one thing, classmates will probably have reason to suspect the truth

already from other behaviors, and in any event it will soon be revealed when the

individual does terminate schooling.

         Part of the “signaling” story, then, is that those who are disaffected from school

and inclined to terminate will find smoking more attractive than those who intend to

continue, because the “off track” identity signal is less costly in terms of peer standing

than for those who are on track. But there is more to the story, a positive benefit as well

as a reduced cost. In popular culture, not to mention tobacco advertising, smoking has

long been associated with being “cool”, independent, sophisticated, and rebellious – all

values that are prized by adolescents, and which may get them off track in their school

careers (Abaum, et al. 2002; Aloise-Young & Hennigan 1996; Luke, et al. 2001; Kobus

2003). Many teens valued the smoking image enough to wear promotional items from

the cigarette companies when such items were permitted (Wakefield, et al. 2003). But

while these associations are generally attractive to adolescents, they are disinclined to

project an image or claim an identity that is too far out of line with reality (McKennell &

Bynner 1969; Chassin, et al. 1981; Grube, et al. 1984; Chassin, et al. 1985; Burton, et al.

1989). The psychologists have established that identification with the images associated

with smoking is a strong predictor of becoming a smoker (Aloise-Young & Hennigan

1996).




                                                                                                11
         In sum, those youths who smoke and thereby assume the image associated with

being a smoker incur the reputational costs of being considered off track and the benefits

of being associated with an activity that connotes cool, sophistication, and rebelliousness.

The cost is less for those who are genuinely off track, and the image of cool detachment

or rebellion is likely to be more appealing and successful for those who genuinely

identify with it.3

         Finally, there is good reason to believe that the reputational costs of smoking are

less for students of low ability than for those who are above average, simply because, as

we have seen, the “smoking gap” in the likelihood of school success is so much larger for

high-ability students.4

         Bringing together these conceptual strands, we propose that the smoking decision

by adolescents is made in a social context where being a smoker conveys a signal about

their personality (“cool”) and their likely success in school (questionable). The smoking

decision is made in circumstances where their peers may observe other signals of

schooling success; in particular their academic ability is somewhat visible, and for that
3
  This story may be developed somewhat differently based on Akerlof and Kranton’s theory of identity and
economic behavior (Akerlof & Kranton 2000; Akerlof & Kranton 2002). They note that the school social
scene is highly structured into groups or social categories, such as the leading crowd, nerds, and burnouts.
Students have certain attributes that determine the utility payoffs from membership in each group, and then
select one accordingly. Complying with the behavioral norms of the group has an immediate payoff from
identification with that group even when the behavior conflicts with other interests of the individual. If
smoking is a valued behavior among the burnouts, then those who select the burnout category for other
reasons (a lack of interest in or ability for schoolwork) may begin smoking.


4
  An interesting possibility is that the members of the student body who are most clearly destined for
success will choose to smoke as a “counter signal” that separates them from the middle range of on-track
students. In an article with the perfect title “Too cool for school?,” Feltovich, Harbaugh and To note that
“high types sometimes avoid the signals that should separate them from lower types, while intermediate
types often appear the most anxious to send the ‘right’ signals. The nouveau riche flaunt their wealth, but
the old rich scorn such gauche displays….Mediocre students answer a teacher’s easy questions, but the best
students are embarrassed to prove their knowledge of trivial points (Feltovich, Harbaugh & To 2002: 631).”
This effort by the elite to separate from the middle is possible, they note, in a circumstance where there are
other signals of success.



                                                                                                          12
reason the negative connotations of the signal – its cost -- are inversely related to

academic ability. The cost of the signal also depends on whether they are in fact off

track; those who are off track and have embraced an oppositional identity will find it less

costly (or perhaps even rewarding) to signal that identity.

       To translate this framework into symbols, we have:



V = student’s intrinsic taste for smoking

C = social cost of smoking to the student (positive or negative)

A = aptitude

P = extent to which the student is “on track” (committed to continuing school)

F = financial cost of smoking

H = current valuation of smoking cost to present and future health

r = rate of time discount

s = the strength of the statistical link between smoking and likelihood of school

continuation

V = V(r), with V’>0 (higher rate of time discount enhances valuation of smoking)

C = C(A, P: s), increasing in both A and P conditional on a negative association s

P = P(r), with P’<0 (commitment to school declines as discount rate increases)

H = H(r), with H’<0 (concern about health consequences declines as discount rate

increases)

       The student will choose to smoke if



V > C[A,P(r): s] + F + H(r)




                                                                                         13
       Assuming that taste for smoking V is distributed in the student population

independently of the other variables, then the likelihood a particular student will choose

to smoke depends on aptitude (negatively) and commitment to school (negatively) to an

extent that is influenced by the strength of the smoking signal; the likelihood of smoking

is positively related to rate of time discount, both because of the salience of future health

effects, and the commitment to continuing in school.



E. Empirical determinants of smoking and drinking

       We estimated standard equations for smoking participation among the 11th

graders in the NLSY sample, and report partial results in Table 4 (and complete results in

Table A4). The unusual feature of the specifications is that they include indicators of

subsequent events, namely whether the respondent graduated from high school the

following year and whether he matriculated in a four-year college. These indicators are

intended as proxies for the extent to which the respondent is on track or off in 11th grade.

One alternative is to utilize contemporaneous reports from the respondent about how far

she expects to go in school (Gruber & Zinman 2001), but such reports are not available in

the NLSY.

       The main results come as no surprise given the previous findings. Those who are

on track to graduating from high school are less likely to smoke, and those who are on

track to matriculating in a 4-year college much less likely to smoke, in comparison to

their classmates. That is true despite the fact that the specifications control for a number

of variables which may influence smoking, including socioeconomic status, race, family




                                                                                           14
characteristics, and cigarette prices. We also find that ability, as measured by ASVAB,

has a strong, independent negative effect on the likelihood of smoking, as suggested by

the signaling story.

        The respondent’s report on the prevalence of smoking among her peers has a

strong positive association with whether or not the respondent smokes.5 This may reflect

peer influence, or it may be an artifact of the well known pattern that smokers choose to

associate with other smokers and may get a biased impression of their overall prevalence

as a result. In any event, it is interesting to note that controlling for peer smoking has

little effect on the coefficients for high school graduation and college matriculation.

        For drinking, the influence of being on track is less consistently evident, as shown

in Table 5. High school graduation is statistically irrelevant, while college matriculation

has a modest negative effect on the likelihood of drinking. ASVAB has a weak effect.

Interestingly, the percentage of peers who smoke is quite closely linked to the drinking

decision.

        These results on smoking and drinking are compatible with both the “time

discount” story and the “social cost” story for the smoking decision – and indeed, we

believe they both have some validity. The fact that ability has a strong independent effect

on smoking (even after controlling for whether the student is on track) is better captured

by the “signaling” story than the “rate of time discount” story.

        The fact that being on track to high school graduation has no effect on whether

the 11th grade respondent drinks may also be relevant in distinguishing between the two

stories. Drinking is an activity that has much in common with smoking for an 11th grader

– it is illegal, frowned on by authorities, and has the potential to do harm over time

through addiction and direct risks to health and safety. (Recent research suggests that

drinking can do permanent damage to the developing brain of an adolescent.) It would

seem, then, that if time preference influenced the likelihood of smoking, it should also

influence the likelihood of drinking. The lack of a finding in this respect adds credence

to the second “signaling” perspective on smoking.



F. Concluding thoughts

       Our analysis has documented the strength of smoking as a signal of being off

track for juniors in high school. That signal conveys much more information for youths

who are likely to graduate and go on to college, than for those who are likely to exit early

from schooling. If we make the plausible assumption that adolescents care about what

their peers believe about them, and that most youths do not want to be viewed by their

peers as “losers,” then smoking has a social cost. We have demonstrated that that cost is

lower for lower-ability students, and is likely to be lower for those who are genuinely

disaffected and off track. These observations provide an explanation for observed

patterns of smoking among 11th graders, including the strong link to ability and school

continuation. That explanation should not be viewed as a rival to the traditional “time

horizon” explanation in economics. “Peer reputation” and “time horizon” are both

plausible explanations. Our point is that the “time horizon” explanation is not complete,

and in particular does not explain the relationship between smoking and ability.




                                                                                           16
       Our analysis does not speak to the question of whether smoking has a causal

effect on schooling. For example, we can’t say whether an increase in the tobacco tax

would increase college matriculation rates. However, if peer effects are important to the

decision of whether to smoke, and the social processes described here result in a tight link

between smoking and oppositional culture, then it is not implausible that a youth with a

strong taste for tobacco might hang out with “bad company” just for companionship in

his smoking. That association in turn may push him off track with respect to schooling.

       Finally, we note that our results on smoking and schooling may not apply to other

times and places. To the extent that smoking patterns are influenced by peer-group

concerns, they are self-perpetuating, with the possibility of several stable equilibria. It

would be interesting to replicate this study using U.S. data from an earlier era, say the

1950s, when smoking among adults was much more prevalent and less closely linked to

education than now, or to analyze smoking and schooling patterns for other wealthy

nations where smoking may convey a more ambiguous social signal than in the United

States today.
