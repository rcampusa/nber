Comparing Price and Non-Price Approaches to Urban Water Conservation

                                              ABSTRACT

Urban water conservation is typically achieved through prescriptive regulations, including the rationing
of water for particular uses and requirements for the installation of particular technologies. A significant
shift has occurred in pollution control regulations toward market-based policies in recent decades. We
offer an analysis of the relative merits of market-based and prescriptive approaches to water conservation,
where prices have rarely been used to allocate scarce supplies. The analysis emphasizes the emerging
theoretical and empirical evidence that using prices to manage water demand is more cost-effective
than implementing non-price conservation programs, similar to results for pollution control in earlier
decades. Price-based approaches also have advantages in terms of monitoring and enforcement. In
terms of predictability and equity, neither policy instrument has an inherent advantage over the other.
As in any policy context, political considerations are important.

 6   1. Introduction

 7          Cities, towns, and villages around the world struggle to manage water resources in the

 8   face of population increases, consumer demand for water-intensive services, and increasing costs

 9   (including environmental costs) of developing new supplies. In this paper, we provide an

10   economic perspective on reducing urban water demand through pricing and non-price

11   conservation policies. We compare price and non-price approaches to water conservation along

12   five dimensions: the ability of policies to achieve water conservation goals, cost-effectiveness,

13   distributional equity, monitoring and enforcement, and political feasibility.

14          The worst drought on record continues to unfold in the American southeast, affecting

15   major cities such as Atlanta, Georgia, and Raleigh, North Carolina. In the arid Western U.S., the

16   Colorado River system faces the worst drought on record, lasting (thus far) from 1999 to 2008

17   and leaving Lake Mead (the source of more than 90% of Las Vegas’s water) about half empty.

18          Municipal water consumption comprises only about 12% of total freshwater withdrawals

19   in the United States; and agricultural irrigation, the single largest water use, comprises just over

20   one-third of all withdrawals (Hutson et al. 2004). While analysis suggests that re-allocating

21   water from agriculture to cities would be efficient in many regions, in the current legal and

22   political setting, large-scale transfers of water rights from agriculture to cities are relatively

23   uncommon (Brewer et al. 2007, Brown 2006, Howe 1997). Thus, cities often must reduce water

24   consumption during acute shortages due to drought, or in the long run due to constraints on their

25   ability to increase supply.



                                                      1
26          The efficient water price is the long-run marginal cost (LRMC) of its supply. LRMC

27   reflects the full economic cost of water supply – the cost of transmission, treatment and

28   distribution; some portion of the capital cost of reservoirs and treatment systems, both those in

29   existence and those future facilities necessitated by current patterns of use; and the opportunity

30   cost in both use and non-use value of water for other potential purposes. Many analysts have

31   noted that water prices, for many urban as well as agricultural uses, lie well below LRMC (Sibly

32   2006, Timmins 2003, Hanemann 1997), with significant welfare consequences (Renzetti 1992,

33   Russell and Shin 1996). In the short run, without price increases acting as a signal, water

34   consumption proceeds during periods of scarcity at a faster-than efficient pace.              Water

35   conservation takes place only under “moral suasion or direct regulation” (Howe 1997). In

36   contrast, if water prices rose as reservoir levels fell during periods of limited rainfall, consumers

37   would respond by using less water, reducing or eliminating uses according to households’

38   particular preferences.   In the long run, inefficient prices alter land-use patterns, industrial

39   location decisions, and other important factors. The sum of all these individual decisions affects

40   the sustainability of local and regional water resources.

41          Implementation of efficient water prices would be challenging, to say the least. Some of

42   the opportunity costs of urban water supply are exceedingly difficult to quantify. What is the

43   value of a gallon of water left instream to support endangered species habitat, for example?

44   While economists have developed a variety of useful methods for estimating such values, the

45   expectation that every water supplier will develop full individual measures of the LRMC of

46   water supply is unrealistic. If LRMC represents an ultimate water pricing goal, there are smaller,

47   less ambitious steps toward efficiency that can be accomplished more readily.




                                                      2
48          Even with inefficient prices, injecting better price signals into the processes of water use

49   and allocation can result in important improvements. For example, given a particular public

50   goal, such as the conservation of a particular quantity of water or percentage of current

51   consumption, various policies can be employed, some more costly than others. Choosing the

52   least costly method of achieving some water-provision goal is characterized in economic terms

53   as cost-effective water management. Even if the water conservation goal is, itself, inefficient,

54   society can benefit from the minimization of costs to achieve it.

55          We focus on this issue of policy instrument choice for water conservation, summarizing

56   research from the economics literature, including both our own work on this issue and that of

57   other economists. Given the strong theoretical cost advantages of market-based approaches to

58   water conservation over conventional alternatives, and the emerging empirical evidence for the

59   potential cost savings from moving to market-based approaches to conservation, the time is ripe

60   for a discussion of the relative strengths and weaknesses of these policy instruments.

61

62   2. Cost-effectiveness of water conservation policies

63          Decades of theoretical and empirical economic analysis suggest that market-based

64   environmental policies are more cost-effective than conventional policies, often characterized as

65   command-and-control (CAC) or prescriptive approaches. Market-based regulations encourage

66   behavior through market signals rather than through explicit directives regarding conservation

67   levels or methods. These policy instruments, if well-designed and implemented, encourage firms

68   and households to undertake conservation efforts that are in their own interests and collectively

69   meet policy goals. CAC approaches, in contrast, allow little flexibility in the means of achieving




                                                      3
70   goals and often require households and/or firms to undertake similar shares of a conservation

71   burden regardless of cost.

72          In the area of pollution control, the cost-effectiveness advantage of market-based

73   approaches over CAC policies has been demonstrated theoretically (Pigou 1920, Crocker 1966,

74   Dales 1968, Montgomery 1972, Baumol and Oates 1988) and empirically (Keohane 2007,

75   Teitenberg 2006). Perhaps the best-known application of these principles to environmental

76   regulation is the U.S. SO2 trading program, established under Title IV of the Clean Air Act

77   Amendments of 1990, which has produced cost savings on the order of $1 billion annually

78   (Stavins 2003). Dozens of other market-based policies have been applied to air and water

79   pollution control, fisheries management, and other environmental problems in industrialized and

80   developing countries (Kolstad and Freeman 2007, Stavins 2003, Sterner 2003, Panayotou 1998).

81          Economists’ attention has only recently turned to examining the potential economic gains

82   from adopting market-based approaches to water conservation, rather than CAC approaches.

83   Whereas the gains from market-based approaches to pollution control depend critically on

84   heterogeneity in marginal abatement costs across firms (Newell and Stavins 2003), the cost

85   savings from market-based approaches to water conservation derive largely from heterogeneity

86   in households’ marginal benefits from water consumption (Mansur and Olmstead 2007). This is

87   because current CAC approaches to water conservation are essentially rationing policies. This

88   makes the application similar to other cases in which rationing has been replaced with price-

89   based allocation, such as traffic congestion on roadways (Parry and Bento 2002) and at airports

90   (Pels and Verhof 2004).       Recent studies demonstrate how raising prices, rather than

91   implementing non-price policies, can substantially reduce the economic cost of achieving water

92   consumption reductions (Collinge 1994; Krause et al. 2003; Brennan et al. 2007).




                                                    4
 93          In order to illustrate the basic economics, we can examine one typical CAC approach to

 94   water conservation – a citywide required demand reduction achieved by uniformly restricting

 95   outdoor uses. Figure 1 portrays two households with the same indoor demand curves, but

 96   different preferences with respect to outdoor demand. The difference in slopes of the three

 97   demand curves is associated with differences in elasticity – the percentage change in demand

 98   prompted by a one percent price increase. (For all but one specific class of demand function,

 99   price elasticity varies along the demand curve, thus while we can speak broadly about

100   comparisons across demand curves, there may be points on a relatively steep demand curve at

101   which price elasticity exceeds that on some parts of a flat demand curve.) Here we assume that

102   indoor demand (frame C in Figure 1), the steepest curve, is inelastic, because indoor uses are less

103   easily reduced in response to price changes, reflecting the basic needs met by indoor water use.

104   For outdoor demand, there is a relatively elastic household (Panel A), and a somewhat less

105   elastic household (Panel B). The more elastic household is more likely to reduce outdoor demand

106   in response to a price increase – perhaps because it has weaker preferences for outdoor

107   consumption (e.g., in the short run, it would rather allow the lawn to turn brown than pay a

108   higher water bill to keep it green).

109          Unregulated, with price set at P , both households consume QC units of water indoors, the

110   less elastic household consumes QBunreg outdoors, and the more elastic household consumes QAunreg

111   outdoors.   Outdoor reduction mandated under a CAC approach (which leaves indoor use

112   unchanged, and reduces outdoor uses to QBreg and QAreg ) creates a “shadow price” for outdoor

113   consumption (λ) that is higher under the current marginal price ( P ) for household B than for

114   household A, because household B is willing to pay more for an additional unit of water than

115   household A. If instead the water supplier charges price P*, that achieves the same aggregate



                                                      5
116   level of water conservation as the prescriptive approach, consumers would realize all potential

117   gains from substitution within and across households, erasing the shaded deadweight loss (DWL)

118   triangles. Consumption moves to QC* indoors for both types of households, and to QA* and QB*

119   outdoors. The savings from the market-based approach are driven by two factors: (1) the ability

120   of households facing higher prices rather than quantity restrictions to decide which uses to

121   reduce according to their own preferences; and (2) allowing heterogeneous responses to the

122   regulation across households, resulting in substitution of scarce water from those households

123   who value it less, to those who value it more.

124          How large are the losses from non-price demand management approaches when

125   examined empirically?      We know of only three cases in which the welfare losses from

126   prescriptive water conservation policies have been estimated. Timmins (2003) compared a

127   mandatory low-flow appliance regulation with a modest water price increase, using aggregate

128   consumption data from 13 groundwater-dependent California cities. Under all but the least

129   realistic of assumptions, he found prices to be more cost-effective than technology standards in

130   reducing groundwater aquifer lift-height in the long run.

131          Another study of 11 urban areas in the United States and Canada compared residential

132   outdoor watering restrictions with drought pricing (Mansur and Olmstead 2007). For the same

133   level of aggregate demand reduction as implied by a two-day-per-week outdoor watering

134   restriction, the establishment of a market-clearing drought price in these cities would result in

135   welfare gains of approximately $81 per household per summer drought. This represents about

136   one-quarter of the average household’s total annual water bill in the study.

137          Using a different approach, Brennan et al. (2007) constructed a household production

138   model to estimate the welfare cost of urban outdoor water restrictions in Perth, Australia, and



                                                       6
139   arrived at similar conclusions. The household welfare costs of a two-day-per-week sprinkling

140   restriction are just under $100 per household per season, and the costs of a complete outdoor

141   watering ban range from $347-$870 per household per season.

142          Based on both economic theory and empirical estimates, the inescapable conclusion is

143   that using price increases to reduce demand, allowing households, industrial facilities, and other

144   consumers to adjust their end-uses of water is more cost-effective than implementing non-price

145   demand management programs.

146

147   3.     Predictability in Achieving Water Conservation Goals

148   3.1     Effects of Price on Water Demand

149          If policymakers are to use prices to manage demand, the key variable of interest is the

150   price elasticity of water demand. Because an increase in the price of water leads consumers to

151   demand less of it, all else equal, price elasticity is a negative number. (Elasticity figures may

152   also be reported in absolute value, and the negative sign is then implicit. We use the more

153   conventional negative sign in this paper.) An important benchmark in elasticity is –1.0; this

154   figure divides demand curves into the categories of elastic and inelastic.

155          There is a critical distinction between “inelastic demand” and demand which is

156   “unresponsive to price”.    If demand is truly unresponsive to price, price elasticity is equal to

157   zero, and the demand curve is a vertical line – the same quantity of water will be demanded at

158   any price. This may be true in theory for a subsistence quantity of drinking water, but it has not

159   been observed for water demand more broadly in fifty years of empirical economic analysis.

160          That said, water demand in the residential sector is sensitive to price, but demand is

161   inelastic at current prices. In a meta-analysis of 124 estimates generated between 1963 and




                                                       7
162   1993, accounting for the precision of estimates, Espey et al. (1997) obtained an average price

163   elasticity of –0.51, a short-run median estimate of –0.38, and a long-run median estimate of –

164   0.64. Likewise, Dalhuisen et al. (2003) obtained a mean price elasticity of -0.41 in a meta-

165   analysis of almost 300 price elasticity studies, 1963-1998. And a recent, comprehensive study of

166   water demand in eleven urban areas in the United States and Canada found that the price

167   elasticity of water demand was approximately –0.33 (Olmstead et al. 2007). The price elasticity

168   of residential demand varies substantially across place and time, but on average, in the United

169   States, a 10% increase in the marginal price of water in the urban residential sector can be

170   expected to diminish demand by about three to four percent in the short run. This is similar to

171   empirical estimates of the price elasticity of residential energy demand (Bohi and Zimmerman

172   1984, Bernstein and Griffin 2005).

173          There are some important caveats worth mentioning. First, elasticities vary along a

174   demand curve, and any estimate represents an elasticity at a specific price, in particular, actual

175   (current) prices. Were prices to approach the efficient levels discussed earlier, water demand

176   would likely be much more sensitive to price increases.

177          Second, consumers are relatively more sensitive to water prices in the long run than they

178   are in the short run, because over longer time periods, capital investments are not fixed. For

179   example, households might change appliance stocks, retrofit water-using fixtures, or alter

180   landscaping from lawns to drought-tolerant plants; firms can be expected to change water-

181   consuming technologies, increase recycling, or relocate to areas in which water is more plentiful.

182   In the long run, a 10% price increase can be expected to decrease demand by about six percent.

183          Third, price elasticities vary with many other factors. In the residential sector, high-

184   income households tend to be much less sensitive to water price increases than low-income




                                                      8
185   households. Also, price elasticity may increase by 30 percent or more when price information is

186   posted on water bills (Gaudin 2006). And price elasticity may be higher under increasing-block

187   prices (in which the marginal volumetric water price increases with consumption) than under

188   uniform volumetric prices (Olmstead et al. 2007). Price elasticities must be interpreted in the

189   context in which they have been derived.

190   3.2     Effects of Non-price Conservation Programs on Water Demand

191          Historically, water suppliers have relied on non-price conservation programs to induce

192   demand reductions during shortages. We consider the effects of such non-price programs in

193   three categories: (1) required or voluntary adoption of water-conserving technologies; (2)

194   mandatory water use restrictions; and (3) mixed non-price conservation programs.

195   3.2.1 Required or Voluntary Adoption of Water-Conserving Technologies

196          Many urban water utilities have experimented with required or voluntary adoption of

197   low-flow technologies. (Since the 1992 Energy Policy Act, U.S. law has required the installation

198   of low-flow toilets and showerheads in all new residential construction, but some cities have also

199   mandated or encouraged retrofitting.) When water savings from these programs have been

200   estimated, they have often been smaller than expected, due to behavioral changes that partially

201   offset the benefit of greater technical efficiency.    For example, households with low-flow

202   showerheads may take longer showers than they would without these fixtures (Mayer et al.

203   1998). The necessity of the “double flush” was a notorious difficulty with early models of low-

204   flow toilets. In a recent demonstration of similar compensating behavior, randomly-selected

205   households had their top-loading clotheswashers replaced with more water efficient, front-

206   loading washers. In this field trial, the average front-loading household increased clothes-




                                                      9
207   washing by 5.6 percent, perhaps due to the cost savings associated with the appliances’ increased

208   efficiency (Davis 2006).

209          Several engineering studies have observed a small number of households in a single

210   region to estimate the water savings associated with low-flow fixtures. But most of these studies

211   used intrusive data collection mechanisms, attaching equipment to faucets and other fixtures in

212   homes (Brown and Caldwell 1984). Study participants were aware they were being monitored as

213   they used water, which may have led to confounding behavioral changes.

214          One comprehensive study that was not characterized by this monitoring problem

215   indicates that households fully constructed or retrofitted with low-flow toilets used about 20

216   percent less water than households with no low-flow toilets. The equivalent savings reported for

217   low-flow showerheads was 9 percent (Mayer et al. 1998).               Careful studies of low-flow

218   showerhead retrofit programs in the East Bay Municipal Utility District, California, and Tampa,

219   Florida estimate water savings of 1.7 and 3.6 gallons per capita per day (gpcpd), respectively

220   (Aher et al. 1991; Anderson et al. 1993).          In contrast, showerhead replacement had no

221   statistically significant effect in Boulder, Colorado (Aquacraft 1996). Savings reported for low-

222   flow toilet installation and rebate programs range from 6.1 gpcpd in Tampa, Florida to 10.6

223   gpcpd in Seattle, Washington (U.S. General Accounting Office 2000). Renwick and Green

224   (2000) estimate no significant effect of ultra low-flush toilet rebates in Santa Barbara, California.

225          It is not surprising that studies of the water savings induced by such policies vary widely,

226   from zero to significant water savings – the scope and nature of policies vary widely, as well.

227   More important than the raw water savings induced by these programs, however, is the cost per

228   gallon saved, in comparison with alternative policies.        The costs of toilet retrofit policies

229   implemented in U.S. cities range from less than $100,000 to replace 1,226 toilets in Phoenix,




                                                       10
230   Arizona to $290 million for 1.3 million toilets in New York City (U.S. General Accounting

231   Office 2000). These can be expensive programs, but in most cases no analysis is done to

232   estimate the magnitude of price increases that would have induced demand reductions equivalent

233   to those observed with technology standards. Only with such information can price and non-

234   price demand management programs be compared as policy options on the basis of cost.

235   3.2.2 Mandatory Water-Use Restrictions

236          Non-price management tools also include utility implementation of mandatory water use

237   restrictions, much like the traditional command-and-control approach to pollution regulation.

238   These include restrictions on the total quantity of water that can be used, as well as restrictions

239   on particular water uses, usually outdoors, such as lawn-watering and car-washing. Empirical

240   evidence regarding the effects of these programs is mixed. Summer 1996 water consumption

241   restrictions in Corpus Christi, Texas, including prohibitions on landscape irrigation and car-

242   washing, did not prompt statistically significant water savings in the residential sector (Schultz et

243   al. 1997). However, a longer-term program in Pasadena, California resulted in aggregate water

244   savings (Kiefer et al. 1993), as did a program of mandatory water use restrictions in Santa

245   Barbara, California (Renwick and Green 2000).

246   3.2.3 Mixed Non-Price Conservation Programs

247          Water utilities often implement a variety of non-price conservation programs

248   simultaneously, making it difficult to determine the effects of individual policies. One analysis

249   of the effect of conservation programs on aggregate water district consumption in California

250   found small but significant reductions in total water use attributable to landscape education

251   programs and watering restrictions, but no effect due to non-landscape conservation education

253   information on customer bills (Corral 1997). Another study of southern California cities found

254   that the number of conservation programs in place in a city had a small negative impact on total

255   residential water demand (Michelsen et al. 1998). An aggregate demand study in California

256   found that public information campaigns, retrofit subsidies, water rationing, and water use

257   restrictions had negative and statistically significant impacts on average monthly residential

258   water use, and the more stringent policies had stronger effects than voluntary policies and

259   education programs (Renwick and Green 2000).

260   3.2.4. Summing up the predictability comparison

261          Predictability of the effects of a water conservation policy may be of considerable

262   importance to water suppliers, although in most cases the objective of water conservation

263   policies is water savings, without any specific target in mind. In this case, an estimate of the

264   reduction expected from policy implementation is necessary, but precision is less important.

265          If certainty is required, economic theory would suggest that the quantity restrictions

266   typical of traditional, prescriptive approaches to water demand management would be preferred

267   to price increases, particularly if water suppliers could be sure of near-total compliance, or at

268   least be able to adjust their water savings target upward to account for a reliable estimate of the

269   noncompliance rate (Weitzman 1973).         But suppliers generally cannot rely on substantial

270   compliance with quantity-based restrictions. In a comprehensive study of drought management

271   policies among 85 urban water utilities during a prolonged drought in Southern California,

272   analysts reported that 40 agencies adopted mandatory quantity restrictions, but also found that

273   more than half of the customers violated the restrictions (Dixon et al. 1996). Such non-binding

274   quantity constraints are common, but how are utilities to predict the water savings achievable

275   through quantity restrictions when less than half of consumers typically comply? In the same




                                                      12
276   study, about three-quarters of participating urban water agencies implemented type-of-use

277   restrictions (most of them mandatory). Few penalties were reported, and enforcement was weak,

278   again raising questions regarding compliance.        With such low rates of compliance with

279   traditional quantity-based regulations, neither price nor non-price demand management programs

280   have an advantage in terms of predicting water demand reductions.

281

282   4.     Equity and Distributional Considerations

283          The main distributional concern with a market-based approach to urban water

284   management arises from the central feature of a market – allocation of a scarce good by

285   willingness to pay (WTP). Under some conditions, WTP may be considered an unjust allocation

286   criterion. Think, for example, about the negative reaction to selling food and water to the highest

287   bidder in the aftermath of a natural disaster. This sense that there are some goods and services

288   that should not be distributed by markets in particular contexts is behind the practice of rationing

289   during wartime. A portion of water in residential consumption is used for basic needs, such as

290   drinking and bathing. “Lifeline” rates and other accommodations ensuring that water bills are

291   not unduly burdensome for low-income households are common.                   Thus, policymakers

292   considering market-based approaches to water management must be concerned about equity in

293   policy design.

294          What does the empirical evidence tell us about the equity implications of water pricing as

295   a conservation tool? Agthe and Billings (1987) found that low-income households exhibited a

296   larger demand response to price increases in Tucson, Arizona, but the study did not compare the

297   distributional effects of price and non-price approaches. Renwick and Archibald (1998) found

298   that low-income households in two Southern California communities were more price-responsive




                                                      13
299   than high-income households, reflecting water expenditures’ larger share of the household

300   budget. Thus, if water demand management occurs solely through price increases, low-income

301   households will contribute a greater fraction of the cities’ aggregate water savings than high-

302   income households. This is not surprising to economists – price elasticity tends to decline with

303   the fraction of household income spent on a particular good.

304          Importantly, the distributional implications of non-price policies vary by type.         For

305   example, requiring particular landscape irrigation technologies results in demand reduction

306   mainly among higher-income households (Renwick and Archibald 1998).

307          Mansur and Olmstead (2007) examined the distributional impacts of various demand

308   management policies, and found that raising prices to reduce consumption would cause a greater

309   consumption reduction for low-income than for high-income households. (If we return to Figure

310   1 and assume that households of type A are low-income and type B are high-income, we can see

311   why this happens.)

312          The fact that price-based approaches are regressive in water consumption does not mean

313   they are necessarily regressive in cost. Likewise, the fact that non-price programs are progressive

314   in water consumption does not mean they are progressive in cost. The impact of non-price

315   programs on distributional equity depends largely on how a non-price program is financed. And

316   progressive price-based approaches to water demand management can be designed by returning

317   utility profits (from higher prices) in the form of rebates. In the case of residential water users,

318   this could occur through the utility billing process.

319          Drought pricing, like LRMC pricing, would cause utilities to earn substantial short-run

320   profits (Mansur and Olmstead 2007). These profits would have to be returned to consumers in

321   some form, as regulated utilities usually are required to earn zero or very low profits. Profits




                                                       14
322   could be re-allocated based upon income, in order to achieve equity goals. Any rebate scheme

323   that is not tied to current consumption can retain the strong economic-incentive benefits of

324   drought pricing, without imposing excessive burdens on low-income households, relative to

325   traditional approaches.

326

327   5.     Monitoring and Enforcement

328          Price-based approaches to water demand management hold a substantial advantage over

329   non-price approaches in regard to administrative costs for monitoring and enforcement. Non-

330   price demand management policies require that water suppliers monitor and enforce restrictions

331   on particular fixtures, appliances, and other technologies that customers use indoors and out, the

332   particular days of the week or times of day that customers use water for specific purposes, and in

333   some cases, the quantity used for each purpose.

334          The great difficulty in monitoring and enforcing these types of command-and-control

335   approaches is one reason for the prevalence of outdoor watering restrictions – outdoor uses are

336   usually visible, and it is relatively easy to cruise residential streets searching for violators.

337   Overall, monitoring and enforcement problems explain the low rates of compliance with many

338   non-price demand management programs. Where low-flow fixtures are encouraged or required,

339   they are often replaced with their higher-flow alternatives if consumers are dissatisfied with

340   performance.

341          In contrast, non-compliance in the case of pricing requires that households consume

342   water “off meter,” since water consumption is metered and billed volumetrically in most U.S.

343   cities. Of course, higher prices generate incentives not only for conservation, but also for

344   avoidance.     However, at prevailing prices and even with substantial price increases, the




                                                        15
345   monitoring and enforcement requirements of price changes are likely to be far less significant

346   than those of a comparable non-price approach.

347

348   6.     Political Considerations

349          Water demand management through non-price techniques is the overwhelmingly

350   dominant paradigm in cities around the world. Raising prices, particularly for what people

351   perceive to be a “public service” (though water is supplied by both public and private entities),

352   can be politically difficult. After a two-year drought in the late 1970s, the city of Tucson,

353   Arizona was the first U.S. city to adopt marginal-cost water prices, which involved a substantial

354   price increase. One year later, the entire Tucson city council was voted out of office due to the

355   water rate increase (Hall 2000). Just as few elected officials relish the prospect of raising taxes,

356   few want to increase water rates.

357          Ironically, non-price programs are more expensive to society than water price increases,

358   once the real costs of programs and associated welfare losses are considered. A parallel can be

359   drawn in this case to market-based approaches to environmental pollution control, including

360   taxes and tradable permit systems. Cost-effectiveness has only recently been accepted as an

361   important criterion for the selection of policies to control pollution (Keohane et al. 1998).

362   Despite empirical evidence regarding their higher costs, political constituencies that prefer non-

363   price approaches have succeeded in preventing management through prices.             Some of this

364   resistance to using prices may be due to misinformation, since most policymakers and water

365   customers are not aware of the cost-effectiveness advantage of the price-based approach. For

366   example, a common misconception in this regard is that price elasticity is “too low to make a

367   difference”.




                                                      16
368          Non-price demand management techniques can create political liabilities in the form of

369   water utility budget deficits. Non-price conservation programs are costly. In addition, if these

370   policies actually reduce demand, water utility revenues decline. During prolonged droughts,

371   these combined effects can result in the necessity for substantial price increases following

372   “successful” non-price conservation programs, simply to prevent water utilities from

373   unsustainable financial losses. This occurred in 1991 in southern California. During a prolonged

374   drought, Los Angeles water consumers responded to the Department of Water and Power’s

375   request for voluntary water use reductions. Total use and total revenues fell by more than 20

376   percent. As a result, the Department requested a rate increase to cover its growing losses (Hall

377   2000). In contrast, given urban price elasticities common in the United States, price increases

378   will increase water suppliers’ total revenues. The extra per-unit revenues from a price increase

379   outweighs lost revenue from the decreased demand.

380          The costs of inefficient water pricing and the relative cost advantages of price over non-

381   price water demand management programs are clear. But like other subsidies, low water prices

382   (on a day-to-day basis, as well as during periods of drought) are popular and politically difficult

383   to change.   Some communities may be willing to continue to bear excessive costs from

384   inefficient water pricing, in exchange for the political popularity of low prices. In other cases,

385   rate-setting officials may be constrained by law, unable to increase water prices by a percentage

386   that exceeds some statutory maximum.         In these cases, the tradeoffs involved should be

387   measured and made explicit to water customers.

388




                                                      17
389   7.        Conclusions

390             Using prices to manage water demand is more cost-effective than implementing non-

391   price conservation programs. The gains from using prices as an incentive for conservation come

392   from allowing households to respond to increased water prices in the manner of their choice,

393   rather than by installing a particular technology or reducing particular uses, as prescribed by non-

394   price approaches. Price-based approaches also have important advantages in terms of monitoring

395   and enforcement.

396             In terms of predictability, neither policy instrument has an inherent advantage over the

397   other. Likewise, neither policy instrument has a natural advantage in terms of equity. Under

398   price-based approaches, low-income households are likely to contribute a greater share of a

399   city’s aggregate water consumption reduction than they do under certain types of non-price

400   demand management policies.           But progressive price-based approaches to water demand

401   management can be developed by returning some utility profits due to higher prices in the form

402   of consumer rebates. Such rebates will not significantly dampen the effects of price increases on

403   water demand, as long as rebates are not tied to current water consumption.

404             Raising water prices (like the elimination of any subsidy) is politically difficult, but there

405   may be political capital to be earned by elected officials who can demonstrate the cost-

406   effectiveness advantages of the price-based approach. At a minimum, communities choosing

407   politically popular low water prices over cost-effectiveness should quantify this tradeoff and

408   make it explicit. Where water rate-setting officials are constrained by law from raising water

409   prices, during droughts or in general, a discussion of the real costs of these constraints would be

410   useful.




                                                         18
411          We are reminded of the debate, beginning in the late 1980s, over market-based

412   approaches to pollution control. While some opponents of environmental taxes and tradable

413   permit systems still resist these approaches, policymakers have succeeded in implementing them

414   in many cases, achieving impressive pollution reductions at great cost savings over more

415   prescriptive approaches. A similar shift in the area of water conservation, where the principles

416   are essentially the same, is long overdue.
