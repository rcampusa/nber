I. INTRODUCTION
       For settings as diverse as large countries, memberships in
sizable        HMOs,     small        clinical         trials,       and      local       policy
interventions, one finds increasing interest in quantifying the
health status of the "population" of concern.                                 Kindig, 1997,
argues compellingly that for many practical purposes it is useful
to be able to reference a scalar summary measure of the health of
a population at a point in time, much like GDP or CPI measures
characterize the output or price levels of a nation's economy at
points in time.          A recent report of the Institute of Medicine in
the     U.S.    (Institute           of     Medicine,       1998),     noted      that     "The
development and application of summary measures of population
health present complex and intriguing methodological, ethical,
and political challenges."                    The consideration of some central
conceptual       and    empirical          aspects     of     the    pursuit      of     summary
measures of population health is the main purpose of this paper.


Some Recent Context
       Recognition        of        heterogeneity       in     the     health       of    broad
populations' members has become widespread, with some consequent
impetus    for       policy    intervention          (see     Shepard      and    Zeckhauser,
1982,    for    an     early    theoretical          treatment).           With   the    stated
objective of eliminating "disparities in six areas of health
status    experienced          by    racial     and    ethnic       minority      populations
while    continuing       the       progress    we     have    made     in    improving     the
overall    health        of    the        American     people,"      the     U.S.      National
Institutes of Health have launched a formal Program to Address
Health Disparities.             The NIH definition of "health disparities"
is    "differences       in    the        incidence,    prevalence,          mortality,     and


                                               1
burden of diseases and other adverse health conditions that exist
among    specific       population       groups."             Of    course,        "disparities"
amounts to the same thing as heterogeneity; the latter term is
preferred        here     given      its       neutral             rather     than       negative
connotation.
       In assessing the performance of the world's health care
systems in delivering health product, WHO's recent World Health
Report        2000     recognized        that          summarizing          the      health      of
heterogeneous populations in a single measure is problematic.
Among other things, the WHO report notes that both "the overall
level of health" as well as "the distribution of health in the
population" must be measured to be able to assess the objectives
of any given health system.                  Moreover, the WHO report recognizes
that for any given individual in a population health itself has a
multiattribute          character,      and        thus      proceeds        to    characterize
health        status       in     terms            of        disability-adjusted               life
years/expectancy.
       In a similar vein, the much-publicized Healthy People 2010
initiative of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is
designed to achieve two overarching goals: (1) increase quality
and years of healthy life; and (2) eliminate health disparities
among different segments of the population.                                 While interesting
(and controversial; see Kenkel, 2000, for instance) in their own
right, these HP2010 goals jointly serve to highlight key aspects
of the subsequent analysis.                  Specifically, the main concern here
is     with     quantification          of     health          measures           that    have    a
multiattribute character -- e.g. goal #1, regarding longevity
("live        long")       and      quality             of         life      ("live         well")
-- and that are simultaneously distributed heterogeneously in the
population (e.g. goal #2, regarding disparities of health status
in    the     population).1        Indeed,         a    recent       report        by    the   U.S.

     Aggregate       measures    like    the "Years            of     Healthy       Life"      (YHL)
                                        (continued)

National Institute on Aging (NIA, 2000) confirms that Americans
are     living    both     longer     and    healthier     lives      than   in    past
generations, as disabilities have become relatively less common
among older Americans over time.
      It should be emphasized that the conceptual and analytical
frameworks presented here are applicable not just in situations
where quantification of the health status of large populations is
of    concern     but     also   are       suitable     when    quantification       or
estimation of the health of more narrowly-defined "populations"
is the objective.         A leading example of such narrower populations
would be the treatment and control groups in a clinical trial
within    which    one    outcome     of    interest    might    be   health      status
measured in some multiattribute manner -- for instance, quality
of life and survival -- like the measures considered below (e.g.
Lamas    et   al.,      1998;    Hlatky     et   al.,    1997).         To   be   sure,
measurement       of     inherently     multiattribute         health    status     has
attracted increasing attention in the clinical literature (Testa
and Simonson, 1996; Wright and Weinstein, 1998).


The Issues and Plan for the Paper
      A common feature of the work described above is its reliance
on some summary measure or measures of the health status of the
population in question.          Such efforts must thus confront directly
the issue of how to "map" from a distribution of health that in
almost any interesting exercise will be heterogeneous in this
population and may also be multiattribute in its character into a
summary (scalar) measure of the health of this population (see
Wolfson, 1999, for an excellent and comprehensive discussion).

measure (Erickson et al., 1995) have been designed to monitor in
the aggregate these objectives in the United States (the YHL
measure will the the focus of the empirical exploration
undertaken in section V).




                                            3
This    paper    sets    out       to     develop      an     analytical         framework        for
characterizing         such       summary       measures          and    for    assessing      some
properties of empirical strategies used to estimate or quantify
these measures.
       The roadmap for the remainder of the paper is as follows.
Section II presents some fundamental conceptual and measurement
issues, addressing the first-order question of what a summary
measure of a population's health might entail when the health
status of a population's members is simultaneously multiattribute
in    scope     and    heterogeneous            in     its    distribution           across       the
population.      Section III considers from an analytical perspective
the    implications          of    quantifying            population          health    when      its
multiattribute          constituents            are        both         heterogeneous        in     a
population and may themselves covary across this population.                                       It
is suggested here that the concept of a statistical functional
provides a conceptually useful typology for quantification of a
population's health status.                 Related discussion on univariate and
multivariate stochastic dominance then points the way toward more
practical implementation of health measures based on low-order
moments,      with     particular         focus      on    population          health      measures
characterized by means or conditional means of scalar outcomes.
In    this    light    Section       IV     considers         conceptually           the   special
though       leading     case       of      health-          or        quality-adjusted        life
expectancy (HALE, QALE) and health- or quality-adjusted life year
(HALY, QALY) type measures of health.                        Key statistical properties
of these measures are discussed, and the implications of some ad
hoc    approaches       to     estimation            are    demonstrated.              Section     V
examines empirically issues involving standard measurement and
estimation      strategies          in    the    context          of    the    YHL   measure      and
implemented       with       data        from   the        1994        U.S.    National      Health
Interview Survey and 1993 U.S. life table data.                                        Section VI
concludes.

II. CONCEPTUAL AND MEASUREMENT ISSUES
       Suppose    the     health         status    of   each    member     of     a    defined
population       comprising          N     individuals         at    baseline2         can    be
characterized       by    an    m-vector          ai=[ai1,...,aim],        i=1,...,N,         of
measurable health "attributes" aij.                     (To fix ideas for the case
of m=2, it may be that ai1 is functional status or quality of
life, while ai2 might be life expectancy or survival.)                                 Neither
the precise nature of each attribute nor the peculiar manner in
which each is measured need be of concern at this juncture,
although some particular measurement issues will be of concern
later on.
       A scalar summary measure of "health" at the individual level
is given by the mapping (the "aggregator function") hi=h(ai),
though it should be emphasized that there is no a priori reason
that   any   particular         hi       should    be   more    interesting           than   the
constituent ai.          The discussion for the remainder of this section
presumes     that   the        hi    are    measurable       (i.e.    ai   observed          and
functional    form       h(.)       known),       although     much   of   what        follows
thereafter is devoted to assessing the problems that may arise
when the hi are not directly measurable (e.g. not all elements of
ai observable).
       Suppose    moreover          that    each     individual       in   this       baseline

2
  The reason "baseline" is emphasized here is that any population
whose health is monitored over time will experience attrition due
to mortality, emigration, noncompliance, etc..      Accommodating
such attrition in exercises like this is likely to be of some
empirical importance. For obvious reasons, restricting attention
to populations and samples of "survivors" is likely to be
problematic in situations where population health is of concern:
One would be hard pressed to claim that a population of size N=3
at baseline (t=0) having scalar health outcomes (say) {h1=.85,
h2=.90, h3=.95} has worse health than a population of size N=1
having health outcome {h1=.975} at t=1 when individuals 2 and 3
died between periods 0 and 1.



                                              5
population can be described by a two mutually-exclusive vectors
of observable covariates -- xi and zi -- and by a vector of
unobservables that can be summarized by the unobservable scalar
Θi.   In essence, the particular identity of an individual member

of the population is determined by the triple (xi,zi,Θi).                                 As
will be discussed below, considerations of time will also be
germane     in   some   instances,      so       that   the    "i"   subscripts        might
better be thought of as "i,t" subscripts, but this detail will be
omitted     unless      needed   for    clarity.              The    population        joint
distribution of (ai,xi,zi,Θi) is given by G(a,x,z,Θ), which has

the   corresponding        conditional           distribution        G(a|x,z,Θ)         (the
unsubscripted (a,x,z,Θ) are typical elements).3
      The    remainder      of   this    section          sketches     a   variety        of
conceptual approaches to population health measurement based on
these population distributions G(.) of health attributes (a) or
health status (h).         Some of this discussion will be familiar to
readers having exposure to the literature on economic inequality
(see Litchfield, 1999, for a survey); yet despite the parallels,
it should be emphasized that the main purposes of the inequality
literature are in many regards different from the purposes of
this exposition.


Population Health Functionals
      A most general summary scalar characterization (H) of the
health -- or perhaps the social value associated with the health
-- of this baseline population, conditional on its observed and
its   unobserved        covariates,     is        given   by     the   value      of     the
functional H=F[G(a|x,z,Θ)] or H=F[G(h|x,z,Θ)] (see Allen, 1938,

3
  A minor variation would be to view a as being determined
nonstochastically once (x,z,Θ) are given, i.e. a=a(x,z,Θ), so
that G(a|x,z,Θ) would be degenerate.

the    same    way      that       a    function        "values"       the   arguments        to   a
function. Allen, 1938, informally characterizes a functional as a
limiting case of a function when the number of arguments in the
function is permitted to go to infinity.
       With reference to figure 1, the functional F[.] would value
-- by assigning a larger and smaller value to population health H
-- the two population distributions of the scalar health outcome
h, G1(h) and G2(h).                    Importantly, though, this mapping is not
dependent      per       se    on       the     mean,     variance,      order       statistics,
quantiles,         or   any     other      particular          feature(s)      of    the    Gi(h).
Rather, it is based on the entirety of the respective probability
distributions, i.e. the positions of all the points constituting
G1    vs.    all    the       points      constituting          G2.      How   the        valuation
mechanism -- the functional -- is structured would depend on the
analyst's or the policymaker's sense of what constitutes a scalar
summary measure of the health of a population.
       While conceptually an ideal setup for quantifying the health
of    a     heterogeneous           population,          the    formidable          and    obvious
practical problem here is designing an operational way to rank
alternative         functions,           i.e.    what     is     the    "functional"         form?
Nonetheless, while likely to be of little practical use, it is
still     of   great      conceptual            utility    to    conceive      of     population
health quantification in terms of mappings from the space of
population health or health attribute distributions to scalar
measures of health via the tool of a functional.

  The functional is a concept used commonly, e.g., in expected
and non-expected utility analysis (see, e.g., Machina, 1988, on
"preference functionals").

Stochastic Dominance
      A more concrete way alternative distributions of population
health   can    be     compared       is     to       invoke      criteria          of   first-    and
second-order stochastic dominance in the scalar case -- i.e.
pertaining to distributions G(h;.)-- and corresponding notions of
multivariate          stochastic           dominance             for       considerations           of
distributions G(a;...).                Because the literature on stochastic
dominance     (at     least    for     the     univariate             case)     is       rather   well
developed the discussion here will be brief.                               The important point
to carry away here is that a stochastic dominance approach to
ordering population distributions of health or health attributes
is in many respects a middle ground between the unstructured
approach      of      population        health             functionals           and       the    more
restrictive (albeit more practical) approaches based on moments,
quantiles, order statistics, and tail probabilities sketched out
in the next section.
      In comparing two distributions defined on a scalar variate
(e.g. h), say G1(h) and G2(h), G1 exhibits first-order stochastic

dominance over G2 if G2(h)≥G1(h) for all h, with G2(h)>G1(h) for
at   least     some    h,     while    G1      exhibits           second-order            stochastic
                                           r                     r
dominance      over      G2     if         ∫−∞ G1(h)dh      ≤    ∫−∞ G2(h)dh ,       with        strict

inequality for at least some h.                            In terms of these stochastic
dominance measures, one distribution of population health would
be   judged     "better"       than    an      alternative                if   it    exhibited      an
appropriate j-th order stochastic dominance.
      Multivariate          stochastic         dominance             is    a   much       less    well
developed      concept,       but     would       be       the     appropriate           concept    in
assessing      the    relative        merits          of    competing          distributions        of
health attributes, say G1(a|x,z,Θ) and G2(a|x,z,Θ).                                        Arguments
fully paralleling those developed by Atkinson and Bourguignon,
1982,    in   their     analysis       of      multidimensioned                distributions        of



                                                  8
economic   status       would     be   appropriate        in   this    regard;     indeed
Atkinson and Bourguignon pursue an example that entails some
considerations of health (life expectancy).                        The analytics of
multivariate stochastic dominance are more formidable than those
applicable in the univariate setting, however.


Functions of Moments, Quantiles, Order Statistics, etc.
     Virtually         any     particular       summary    measure       of    population
health that can be or that has been conceptualized will be a
special    case    of    the     functional      F[.],    and     will    typically   be
represented by some function of the moments, quantiles, order
statistics,       or    tail    probabilities       of    Ga(a)    or     of    Gh(h(a)).

Ignoring for the moment conditioning on some set Ω, let µa and

Σa=[σj] denote, respectively, the finite m-vector and m×m matrix
of population means and covariances of the marginal distribution
Ga(a), i.e. µa=EGa[a] and Σa=E[(a-µa)(a-µa)'].                        Similarly let ξh

and νh denote the scalar population mean and variance of the

marginal distribution Gh(h(a)), and ξ(p) be the p-th raw moment
                                     h
of Gh(h(a)).
     Then some particular characterizations would be, e.g., a
general function defined on low-order moments of Gh(h(a)),

     H = ϕ(ξh, ξh ,..., ξh );                                                       (1)

        H = argmin{h(a1),...,h(aN)}.                                     (6)


III. HETEROGENEITY, MEANS, AND COVARIANCES
Decision Criteria Defined in Terms of Population Expectations
        Much of what follows will be based on the working assumption
that conditional or unconditional expectations (means) of some
quantity      are   the      main   concern   in    the   population    health
measurement exercise.           As noted above, this is by no means a
necessary focus and may -- for both the reasons indicated above
as well as for some additional reasons spelled out below --
distract attention from other aspects of the distribution of
population health that may be of concern.            Without reference to a
particular form of a social welfare function, there is no way to
judge whether a mean or some other parameter is the "appropriate"
parameter to summarize the health of a population.


                                        10
        One      prominent      area       where       conditional       and    unconditional
expectations play a key role is in medical technology evaluation,
i.e. cost-effectiveness                   or cost-utility analysis (CEA, CUA).
It   is    common        practice       in    assessing      a    new     technology's       (T)
desirability relative to a standard or baseline practice (B) in
terms      of     cost    (c)     and      health       effectiveness          (e)    to   define
parameters like the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)
or   the      incremental       net       benefit      function     (INHB;       Stinnett     and
Mullahy, 1998) in terms of the underlying marginal population
means of costs and health outcomes, e.g. ICER=[(µcT-µcB)/(µeT-

µeB)]      and    INHB=[(µeT-µeB)-(µcT-µcB)/λ]                   where    µc =E[ci|Ω]         and
                                                                            i
µe = E[ei|Ω], i∈{T,B}, λ represents the social value of the
  i
health     increment,        and      Ω      is   some    conditioning          set    involving
[x,z].5         While it is by no means necessary to assert such a
means-based definition, these definitions would appear to be the
concepts        referred     to    when       most     analysts    consider          statistical
characterizations of ICERs and INHBs.                      As such -- and despite the
interesting          intellectual             debates       surrounding              alternative
definitions (e.g. whether the ICER should be based on the ratio
of means or on the means of the ratios (see Stinnett and Paltiel,
1997, for discussion)) -- this paper will adopt the means-based
approach as the analytical centerpiece.6
        Of course, if interest is more in monitoring population
health status/outcomes than in technology assessment per se, then
the relevant comparison might simply be based on the differences

5
  Phelps, 1997, is an excellent discussion of the importance of
conducting conditional technology evaluation.
6
  While not a primary concern of this paper, it might be noted at
this juncture that the statistical/inferential properties of the
analogy estimators of ICER and INHB so defined have been assessed
in a series of recent papers (e.g. Chaudhary and Stearns, 1996;
Mullahy and Manning, 1995; Willan and O'Brien, 1996).

E[eT-eB|Ω] or, in the previous notation, E[HT-HB|Ω] themselves,
where HT and HB represent in such instances measures of health
status in different populations, or in a given population at
different     points   in    time       or   under    different     imagined      policy
initiatives.


Covariances of Health Attributes Across the Population
       As a general matter it would be expected that the population
variance-covariance         of    the    health      attributes     a,    Σa,   will   be

nondiagonal.      That is, at least for some attributes in ai it
would be unlikely if individuals having relatively high aij were
not also found on average to have relatively high (or, possibly,
low) aik for some (j,k) pairs.
       Take for the moment aij to be a measure of quality of life
and aik to be a measure of longevity.                      Should it turn out that
individuals having relatively high propensities to "live long"
also   have   relatively         high    propensities       to    "live    well,"   then
consideration     of   such       correlation         is   essential      in    properly
characterizing the outcome measures.                  This section describes some
simple   stochastic    frameworks            within   which      such    considerations
might be addressed formally, and then proceeds subsequently to
present some central implications of these results for conducting
empirical CEA/CUA,7 undertaking population health monitoring, or

7
  Such an endeavor is warranted in part because of a potentially
important friction between theoretical CEA and empirical CEA. In
particular, the use of QALY-type measures as von-Neumann-
Morgenstern utility functions has been shown to depend on a set
of conditions that require inter alia a form of preference
independence between quality of life and longevity (Pliskin et
al., 1980; Bleichrodt and Johannesson, 1997). QALY measures thus
rationalized provide a relatively more solid basis for welfare
analysis.    Yet regardless of whether individuals' utility
functions are structured in accordance with these conditions,
QALY measures will be used as outcome measures in CEA. Assessing

formulating public policies involving health interventions.
     Suppose k=2 so that hi=h(ai1,ai2), and suppose h(.,.) is
continuously differentiable.              Consider a measure of population
health akin to (3) with γ=1 and δ=0, i.e. H is expected or mean
population health ξh.           In many practical applications, focus will
be on such mean outcomes; not least in this regard are randomized
trials in which differences in mean outcomes between treatment
and control will often be the basis of regulatory efficacy claims
(e.g. FDA NDAs)
        To   understand      how   the   structure    of    H   depends   in   this
instance on the variance-covariance structure Ga(a), consider the
second-order Taylor expansion of h(ai1,ai2) around the vector

the empirical implications of how quality of life and longevity
may be related in the population -- i.e. their lack of
independence in the population -- is ultimately the major concern
of this paper.

Thus, to the extent that h(.,.) manifests nonlinearities in its
arguments (hij nonzero), then H -- characterized thusly as mean
population health -- will depend not just on the population means
of the component health attributes µa1 and µa2 via the term

h(µa1,µa2),    but    also       on    the   variance-covariance           structure    of

Ga(a), i.e. Σa.      The general result for m≥2 is


                        1                                 m −1

     Among other things (8) and (9) demonstrate that as a general
matter, information on (e.g. estimates of) more than just the
marginal    means    of    the    health     attributes      will     be    required    to
quantify H when the latter is defined in terms of mean population
health.
     Note     that   (8)     and       (9)   are    exact    if   h(.)      is   linear,
quadratic, or multiplicative in the sense of containing only
first-order interactions.               Specifically, for the case with m=2
where h(ai1,ai2)=ai1×ai2 one has exactly


     ξh = µa1×µa2 + σ12,                                                           (10)


which, upon inspection, is simply a restatement of the definition
of a covariance, i.e.


     cov(a1,a2|Ω) = E[a1×a2|Ω] - E[a1|Ω]×E[a2|Ω],                                  (11)

(10)    and     variants       thereon      will        be    shown       below    to   play    a
fundamentally important role in understanding the extent to which
QALE- or QALY-type summary measures of health -- as commonly
implemented -- in fact quantify a population's health as they are
ostensibly designed to do.                  Specifically, the remainder of the
paper will focus largely on population health measures along the
lines    of    E[a1×a2|Ω],          where   a1        will    generally      represent      some
measure of the quality of life at a point in time while a2 will
be some measure of survival, life expectancy, longevity, etc.,
whose precise definition will be context-specific.


Some Implications of Multiplicative Functional Forms
        Suppose, thusly, one takes a1=q to be "quality of life" and

a2=) to be some measure of "longevity" (defined suitably at the

individual      level).        Instead      of    E[q×)|Ω],         however,      suppose      one

argued for E[q|Ω]×E[)|Ω] as a population health measure.                                    Then

by definition this measure of health would be


        E[q|Ω]×E[)|Ω] = E[q×)|Ω] - cov(q,)|Ω).                                            (12)


There is nothing inherently incorrect about such a strategy.                                Yet
it is important to emphasize that such a "product of means"
measure       handles    in     a    different          way       certain    features     of    a
population's joint distribution of health attributes that may be
of   interest     from     a    welfare      perspective            than    does    the   "mean
product" measure.
       For     example,       an    Ω-population             of    size     N=3    with   (q,))

outcomes {(0.5,6),(0.9,10),(1.0,20)} would, by the standards of



                                                 15
(12), be judged to have the same level of population health
(equal        to          9.6)        as         would         the          population
{(0.75,13),(0.8,12),(0.85,11)}, whereas the health of the former
population would be judged to better than the health of the
latter population (10.67 vs. 9.57) under the E[q×)|Ω] measure.

For all practical purposes, only if q and ) are independently

distributed in the population (although zero correlation would in
fact suffice) would these distinctions become irrelevant.                          Since
such independence would seem tenuous to maintain a priori for
many measurement settings that can be imagined, allowance for the
implications of nonzero correlation seems the prudent analytical
course.8
       The seemingly simple multiplicative functional form q×) in

fact     provides         considerable          structure      (and,        therefore,
considerable restrictions) on the manner in which the various
attributes    combine       to     produce      "health"     in     a    heterogeneous
population.         For    given    marginal       means     E[q|Ω]       and    E[)|Ω],

expectations of the multiplicative form will reward (in terms of
their    measured    population       health      status)     populations         having
relatively    high    cov(q,)|Ω)       relative      to     those       having   low   or


8
   To   forestall    potential   confusion,   a   point   regarding
"independence" might be clarified at this juncture. The issues
described here are inherently statistical in nature. As noted in
the introduction and directly above, the concerns about issues
such as independence between quality and longevity when using
QALYs or related measures as utility or welfare measures are
essentially concerns about the structures of individuals' utility
functions (e.g. Pliskin et al., 1980; Bleichrodt and Johannesson,
1997).   "Independence" used in such contexts connotes something
potentially very different than would "independence" used, for
instance,   to   characterize  a   population   joint   probability
distribution (e.g. G(q,))=G(q)×G())).




                                           16
negative cov(q,)|Ω).          More general and flexible forms (e.g. the

second-order or quadratic form (8)) would allow one in principle
to mitigate or offset the implications of such reward structures,
but   whether    the    available      data       would      be   up    to    the    task   of
implementing such measures remains to be seen.
      To   close     this     section       it     is     worth    noting          that   with
multiplicative mappings of attributes to health -- and for many
other    functional        forms    that    might       be   imagined         as    well,   as
suggested by (9) -- it is intuitive that the population health
measure     would      demonstrate         some       reliance     on    the        variance-
covariance structure of the attributes, Σa.                       If all the elements

of a were perfectly correlated, then information on any single
element would convey just as much information as would the entire
vector.     Conversely, to work under a maintained assumption of a
diagonal Σa -- i.e. all elements perfectly uncorrelated -- would
be empirically unrealistic owing to the likely joint reliance of
the aij on a deep set of individual biophysical characteristics

("health    capital").         As    such,       the    prominence       of    Σa    in   many
interesting measures of population health should be considered
logical rather than surprising.


IV. HALE/QALE- AND HALY/QALY-TYPE MEASURES
        The last decade witnessed a burgeoning use of what will be
referred    to      here    generically          as     health-adjusted            life   year
("HALY") or health-adjusted life expectancy ("HALE") measures in
medical technology evaluation and population health monitoring.9

9
  See Fryback, 1997, for an excellent comprehensive overview.
The use of Quality-Adjusted Life Years (QALYs), Disability-
Adjusted Life Years (DALYs), Health-Adjusted Life Years (HALEs),
Years of Healthy Life (YHLs), etc., as the central outcome
measures in cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) -- or, perhaps more
accurately, cost-utility analysis (CUA) -- is both well-
                           (continued)


                                             17
An enormous amount of intellectual energy has been dedicated to
understanding the conceptual features of such measures, their
relationships       (or     lack    thereof)    to   welfare    economics,     etc.
Moreover,     much    intellectual       effort      has   been    dedicated     to
developing sound empirical methods for estimating both components
-- the health adjustment and the life year or life expectancy
measure -- of HALYs or HALEs (see Johannesson et al., 1996, for a
comprehensive survey).10
       Yet despite all this scholarly effort, remarkably little
attention     has    been    devoted    to     understanding    the      conceptual,
empirical, and statistical properties of HALY or HALE measures
themselves.     The "numbers" used in such enterprises to measure
life's quality and length and their ultimate aggregation into the
HALY/HALE measure necessarily derive from some source.                       Either
they    are   asserted       from     expert    opinion    --     thus    rendering
statistical analysis irrelevant -- or they are derived in some
manner from some data source or sources, in which case their
classical statistical properties (bias, consistency, efficiency,


entrenched in practice and advocated formally by the recent
report of the U.S. Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and
Medicine (PCEHM) (Gold et al., 1996). Quality-adjusted measures
of longevity and life expectancy have also become a centerpiece
of efforts to monitor the health status of large populations and,
ultimately, to base policy recommendations thereon (Erikson et
al., 1995; Cutler and Richardson, 1997).
10
   For the health- or quality-adjustment component, methods like
the standard gamble (SG), time tradeoff (TT0), rating scale (RS),
and others have been advocated and debated.    For the survival,
life expectancy, or longevity component (the "LY" part of HALY),
a substantial share of the research agenda has been devoted to
developing statistical methods for estimating the appropriate
hazard or survival models, with issues like whether proportional
or additive hazard models may be more appropriate in particular
circumstances occupying the center stage (see, for example, Beck
et al., 1982a, 1982b).      There has also ensued a debate of
considerable fervor about the merits, shortcoming, differences,
and similarities of alternative HALY measures (e.g. QALYs vs.
DALYs).



                                         18
etc.) become pertinent considerations.                      This section assumes the
second perspective and develops a framework within which the
properties of various HALE/QALE or HALY/QALY measures can be
assessed.
       The entire section works from two fundamental assumptions:
first, that health at the individual level is a multiplicative
function in attributes ai1 and ai2, i.e. hi=ai1×ai2; and second,
that   the     summary      measure       of    population    health   is   a    mean    or
conditional mean measure.             As noted above, while neither of these
assumptions      is       necessary   to       pursue    measurement   of   population
health, they do characterize what would be more-or-less agreed to
be "standard practice."
       The key issue thus becomes the practical one of estimating
population health measures on the basis of available data and
assessing such estimates by classical statistical standards, bias
being of greatest concern here.                      That is, do the estimates tend
on    average    to       describe    the       population     parameters       they    are
supposed to mimic?               As will be suggested in what follows, the
particulars          of    how     data        on    both   quality    of   life        and
longevity/survival/life expectancy are assembled and utilized --
given that data on one or both attributes are often not available
at the individual level -- will play a key role in assessing the
"bias" properties of the population health estimates so obtained.


HALE/QALE-Type Measures
       One aspect of population health measures based on "life
expectancy" ()) is that they are inherently not measurable at the

individual level.             "Life expectancy" is not observable at an
individual level as are outcomes like survival or systolic blood
pressure.       Rather, life expectancy, conditional on some set Ω
(e.g. age, gender, race), is typically estimated actuarially on
the    basis    of    recent      average       mortality    experiences    of     "like"



                                                19
populations, with the resulting estimates often summarized in the
form of life tables (e.g. Anderson, 1999).                             Measures akin to
Health- or Quality-Adjusted Life Expectancy (HALE, QALE) will --
even    if    ostensibly          individual-level           --     necessarily          entail
averages      of     one    or    more      measures       taken     over    some    related
population.         This holds true regardless of whether individual-
level measures of quality of life are available.
       It may be that in some situations individual-level measures
of quality of life are accessible in the data of interest, while
in   other        instances      it    will      be     necessary    to     rely    on     like
experiences, regression predictions, published results, etc. to
obtain factors that provide for estimates of the "QA" or "HA"
part of the QALE or HALE measure.                       Rosenberg et al., 1998, note
that:   "Different         approaches           for    calculating    HALE    use    quality
numbers based on an average of one measurement at one time-point
over    all        individuals,            an    average     over      all     individuals
longitudinally over time, or perhaps, measurements taken from
individuals at repeated time intervals."                         As will be seen in the
next section, the Years of Healthy Life (YHL) measure is an
example      of    this    type       of    measure:      Life     expectancy       data    are
obtained from life tables, while quality adjustments are obtained
on the basis of a large sample of individual-level responses to
two survey items that map into the so-called HALex index, with
the (estimated) parameters of the mapping themselves usefully
conceived as arising from some averaging procedure.
       The goal of this subsection is to present an analytical
structure          within        which           the      merits       of      alternative
computation/estimation strategies for HALE- or QALE-type measures
can be assessed given a population heterogeneous in (q,),x,z,Θ)

and one for which conditional or unconditional covariance between
q and ) may be nonzero (cov(q,)|...)≠0).                         It should be stressed

that the effort here is to develop a framework that is quite



                                                 20
general.          Specific       implementations     will     typically   require
                                    11
additional considerations.
      The general result is as follows.                  Suppose the population
health measure that is the objective of estimation is


      H = E{ E[q|Ωq] × E[)|Ω)] | Ω }                                        (13)

           = E{ ζ(Ωq) × ψ(Ω)) | Ω },



where Ωq, Ω), and Ω represent possibly different conditioning

information, such that {Ωq∪Ω)∪Ω}⊆{x,z,Θ}.                   (Whether this is the

ideal measure or the measure that is necessarily specified owing
to data restrictions is not essential here.)                  In particular, Ωq

and   Ω)    may   be   chosen      such   that   q   and/or   )   are   completely



11
   Indeed, it is instructive to read how one particular HALE
measure is actually computed; the following excerpt from the
Rosenberg-Fryback-Lawrence, 1998, study based on the Beaver Dam
Health Outcomes Study data:
      The quality and mortality numbers are combined to form
      the age-specific HALE by the following method. Assume
      that the HALE is desired for males aged 55. One-year
      mortality rates at each age (q55,q56,...) would be
      estimated until a limiting age, that where the
      probability of death is equal to 1. HRQOL numbers at
      each corresponding age (h55,h56,...) would also be
      determined.    Then: The mortality rates would be
      combined to form survival rates (1p55,2p55,...) to each
      age, where tpχ is the probability that a person aged χ
      will survive to age χ+t.
                             ∞
             HALE55 =   ∑t = 1 h55 + t −1   ×    t p55
      The HALE for the community would involve a weighting of
      the age-adjusted HALEs over those in the community.

determined     given           Ωq     and/or       Ω),    i.e.       "q"=E[q|Ωq]       and/or

")"=E[)|Ω)] so that E[q×)|Ω] can be taken here to be one special

case of (13) (see footnote 3 above).
        Equation (13) can be reexpressed as


        E{E[q|Ωq]×E[)|Ω)]|Ω} =                                                           (14)

          [E{Ωq∪Ω)|Ω}ζ(Ωq)]×[E{Ωq∪Ω)|Ω}ψ(Ω))] +

             cov{Ω ∪Ω |Ω}(ζ(Ωq),ψ(Ω))),
                  q  )


where    E{ν}[.]     denotes         the    expectation        of    [.]   taken    over the

distribution of ν.             In words, the expectation of interest is the
sum of two components: first is the product of the expectations
of ζ(Ωq) and ψ(Ω)) taken over Ωq∪Ω) given Ω; second is the

covariation        between          ζ(Ωq)    and       ψ(Ω))     that      arises    due   to

covariance between Ωq and Ω)                 in the Ω-population.              Note that if

{Ωq∪Ω)}⊆Ω          then        E{E[q|Ωq]×E[)|Ω)]|Ω}                 reduces     simply     to

ζ(Ωq)×ψ(Ω)).

        Concrete     examples          may        be     useful.           First,     suppose
Ωq={x,z,Θ}, Ω)={x,z}, and Ω={x}.                       Then (13) entails, inter alia,

a   consideration         of   how    z     and    Θ covary         in   the   x-population.
Alternatively, suppose Ωq={x}, Ω)={z}, and Ω={x,z}.                                Then there

is clearly no covariation between ζ(x) and ψ(z) over {x,z} since
conditioning is on {x,z} in the first place, so the expectation
defining H in (13) is simply the product of the expectations ζ(x)


                                                  22
and ψ(z).
       Of   course,     the    key    issue       here    is     that       just   because
E{E[q|Ωq]×E[)|Ω)]|Ω}           is    the    target        measure,          it     is     not

necessarily    feasible       to    implement      it.      That      is,    measures     or
estimates of E[q|Ωq] and/or E[)|Ω)] may not be available.                               What

"biases"    relative     to    the    target      measure      E{E[q|Ωq]×E[)|Ω)]|Ω}

would arise would clearly depend on the specific measures or
averages used in computation.              Obviously if the measure computed
was obtained as the product of the averages E{Ωq∪Ω)|Ω}ζ(Ωq) and

E{Ωq∪Ω)|Ω}ψ(Ω)), then from (13) estimate would be biased owing

to the covariance term:


       [E{Ωq∪Ω)|Ω}ζ(Ωq)]×[E{Ωq∪Ω)|Ω}ψ(Ω))] =                                            (15)


            E{E[q|Ωq]×E[)|Ω)]|Ω} - cov{Ωq∪Ω)|Ω}(ζ(Ωq),ψ(Ω))).



For a more concrete example, take Ωq=Ω)={Θ} and Ω={x,z}, with x

denoting    age   and   z     denoting     sex.      Thus,      the     target     measure

amounts to E[q×)|x,z]= E[q|x,z]×E[)|x,z]+cov(q,)|x,z).                             However,

suppose as above that the estimate actually used is based on
E{E[q|x]×E[)|z]|x,z}=E[q|x]×E[)|z],                i.e.        mean     q     given       age

(marginal over sex and Θ) times mean ) given sex (marginal over

age and Θ).       As a general matter, there is no reason to expect

that   E[q|x]×E[)|z]     would       approximate     well       E[q×)|x,z],        with    an

intuition being that the over-averaging entailed in the former



                                           23
would tend to mitigate variation in E[q×)|x,z] over {x,z}.                            The

following exhibit demonstrates this phenomenon by means of a
simple example:

     The upshot of the discussion in this subsection is that
unless the analyst has access to precisely the kind of data on q
and ) that correspond to the particular measure of population

health    of   interest,    estimation      or    averaging          methods   used    as
proxies    are     in   general   unlikely       to       describe    accurately      the
outcome of interest when populations are heterogeneous in their
quality of life and in their life expectancy.                         The covariation
between q and ) that one might expect to find in a population is

ultimately the main source of such discrepancies.

HALY/QALY-Type Measures
       At any time t, a "HALY" or "QALY" can appropriately be
thought of a the product of a 0-1 individual-specific survival
indicator at time t (st) and the individual's quality of life at
period    t      (qt).          One    imagines          then   a   joint      distribution

G(q,s,x,z,Θ)       where        q     and    s   are     vectors    of   health      outcome
                                                                         12
attributes comprising {qt} and {st} respectively.                              It is common
practice to normalize qt=0 as the quality of life equivalent to
being dead so that st=0 is sufficient for qt to be zero, but is

not necessary.           Conditional on some set Ω⊆{x,z}, the "expected
QALY" measure (ignoring discounting for present purposes) for an
individual whose quality of life and survival status would in
principle be measured13 over T+1 time periods from baseline (t=0)
to termination (t=T) is given by



                         ∑t = 0 E qt
                            T
       E[QALY|Ω] =                          × st | Ω                                  (16)

                    =


with the second equality following from the normalization that
"st=0"⇒"qt=0". A quantity akin to (16) is presumably what the
U.S.     Panel     on     Cost-Effectiveness               in   Health        and   Medicine
contemplated when it defined the QALY measure as




12
   A continuous-time setting where, e.g., survival time is
measured as a continuous scalar variable can be captured here by
imaging small time increments.
13
   "in principle" is noted here since QALY-type measures will
typically be most useful in ex ante contexts where individual-
level survival is not known.

       ...the sum of the quality weights for the various
       health states...multiplied by the duration (in years or
       fractions of years) of each health state. This is the
       number of QALYs gained without discounting. (PCEHM, p.
       92)

(See also Glasziou et al., 1990, and Zhao and Tsiatis, 1997.)
       Ignoring "t" subscripts, the typical term in the summand
(16) can be usefully decomposed as


E[q×s|Ω] = E[q×s|Ω,s=1]×Pr(s=1|Ω) + E[q×s|Ω,s=0]×Pr(s=0|Ω) (17)
           = E[q|Ω,s=1]×Pr(s=1|Ω).                                               (18)


As such, and in particular owing to the 0-1 measurement of s and
the "s=0"⇒"q=0" normalization, the "expected QALY" E[q×s|Ω] can
be obtained as the product of the mean q among survivors with Ω
(E[q|Ω,s=1]) and the probability of survival at time t for those
with Ω (Pr(s=1|Ω)).        This, of course, is tantamount to how QALYs
are measured when individual-level data are available in (say)
clinical trials, i.e. as areas under quality-adjusted survivor
curves (the thin curve in figure 2).
       An enormous advantage of the normalizations leading to the
result    (18)      is   that     separate      (consistent)         estimates      of
E[q|Ω,s=1] and Pr(s=1|Ω)=E[s|Ω] -- even though possibly obtained
from   different     sources     of    data   --   will     suffice   to   estimate
(consistently, owing to Slutsky's theorem) the proper conceptual
measure, E[q×s|Ω].         Since researchers do not always have the
luxury of access to data sources where both q and s are observed
for    individual    subjects,        this    result   is    obviously     of    some
practical importance.           As a general matter, combining separate
estimates   of    component      expectations      will     not   afford     such    a
solution.        Indeed,   it    must    be    emphasized     that    this      result




                                         26
requires estimation of E[q|Ω,s=1], not of E[q|Ω], in order to
work.
          Quite       generally,          it   is   useful      to    note       that      there     is    a
nonzero covariance (given Ω) between q and s:


          E[q|Ω]×E[s|Ω] =                                                                            (19)
          {E[q|Ω,s=1]×Pr(s=1|Ω) + E[q|Ω,s=0]×Pr(s=0|Ω)} × Pr(s=1|Ω),


implying


     cov(q,s|Ω) = E[q|Ω,s=1] × Pr(s=1|Ω) × {1-Pr(s=1|Ω)} > 0.                                         (20)


That      the     covariance          is       necessarily       positive        can       be    seen     by
examining         the       sample        space     depicted     in    figure         3.        A   linear
regression            of    q   on    s    will     obviously        have    a    positive          slope;
recognizing that the sign of the slope of the linear regression
of    q    on     s    has      the   same        sign     as   cov(q,s),        it     follows       that
cov(q,s|Ω)>0.14


V. AN EXAMPLE: MEASURING POPULATION HEALTH USING YEARS OF HEALTHY
LIFE
          The Years of Healthy Life (YHL) measure was developed and
reported          by       researchers         at    the    National        Center         for      Health
Statistics (Erikson et al., 1995, henceforth "the YHL report").
Two heralded features of the YHL measure are its ability to
monitor continually the health of the U.S. population (since its

14
   That this covariance is necessarily positive at any point in
time in the population is a matter separate from the fact that
medical technology interventions may result in changes in both
the survivor function as well as in its quality-adjusted
counterpart such that increases in survival probabilities may
arise either in lockstep with or at the expense of increases in
quality of life.

empirical basis is a battery of unchanging questions from the
annual       National     Health    Interview      Surveys   (NHIS))        and    its
computational ease (since it is based on a small number of items
from     the     NHIS     in    conjunction      with    standard     life        table
information).      See Gold et al., 1997, for additional discussion.
       An example of the output from the YHL measurement algorithm
is presented in table 1 (excerpted and abridged from Erikson et
al., 1995).        Columns 1, 2, and 3 display the five-year age
increments, the number of individuals alive at the beginning of
the    age    increment    from    an   imaginary    birth   cohort    of    100,000
individuals, and the stationary population in the full five-year
age range, respectively.            Columns 1-3 are derived from NCHS life
tables.       Column 4 depicts the within-age-interval sample mean QOL
index (the so-called Health and Limitations Index, or HALex),
derived from two survey items on the NHIS sample regarding self-
perceived health status (EVGFP) and limitations due to disability
(and supplemented with information on the institutionalized and
military populations).            Column 5 is the product of columns 3 and
4, and column 6 is the bottom-up cumulative of column 5 (i.e.

C6j=C5j+ ∑
           J
                   C5 ).        Column 7 is column 6 divided by column 1,
           k = j+ 1 k
and column 8 is taken from life tables.
       The key issue here concerns the computation used to generate
the figures in column 5 where the ostensible objective is to
obtain the total number of healthy life years within each age
interval.       That is, the QOL scores for each age interval are
obtained as averages within the age interval of the individual
QOL scores within the interval.                 For example, for ages 0-5 the
sample average QOL score of 0.94 accounts for a large percentage
of    young    children    in   "perfect    health"     (QOL=1.0)     and   a     small
percentage in sub-perfect health.




                                           28
An Analysis of Health-Adjusted Life Expectancy
       Unfortunately the NHIS data do not permit a comparison with
the YHL report's findings in light of the previous analyses since
NHIS    is    a    residential            survey       and    the     YHL    made      a       series    of
modifications            to        accommodate           institutionalized             populations.
Instead this subsection describes an illustrative analysis of the
computation of health-adjusted life expectancy based on HALex
data from the 1994 NHIS (sample size 47,719) combined with U.S.
life table data from 1993.                       The main thrust of this exercise is
to demonstrate the sensitivity of estimates of population health
summary      measures          (here        HALE)       to    alternative        strategies             for
obtaining         HALex    values          (q)    and       life expectancy ()) measures.

Specifically, different averaging strategies for both q and )

across       different         subpopulations                are    considered.                 The    HALE
measures          developed              here     are        purely     illustrative;                  more
sophisticated             measures               based        on      specific             demographic
considerations like mortality could be developed in extensions of
this work.
       As    indicated         above,           life     expectancy         is   not       a     variable
"observed"         at    an    individual           level.          Rather,      life       expectancy
measures      are       inherently          population         or   sub-population               averages
based on recent mortality experiences of similar populations.
The life expectancy measures used here from 1993 U.S. life tables
are    available        for        the    272     subpopulations        defined            by    age    (in
years; 18-85 are used here), sex, and race (white vs. nonwhite).
Conversely, the quality-adjustment measures (q) from the HALex
are, in some sense, "observed" at an individual level, although
as noted earlier the health state scores are based on parameters
from the HUI Mark-I index, with these parameters themselves being
summaries or averages.                     So for purposes of this analysis q is
treated as an individual-level measure, but in fact it may not be
as    "individual"            in    nature        as     would,     say,     a   systolic             blood

pressure readind or an FEV1 measure.
       For    purposes        of   this     discussion,            the     conditioning
information            (x,z)={age,sex,race};                  the              particular
characterizations of x and z will be specified below.                           From the
earlier discussion, the ideal measures of population health would
be parameters like E[q×)|x] or E[q×)|x,z].                    Of course, ) is not

observed at the individual level; the measures available from the
life tables are E[)|x] or E[)|x,z].               As such, the full range of

individual-level       conditional        variation      in    )    and     conditional

covariation between q and ) cannot be exploited.                         For instance,

were the objective estimation of E[q×)|x,z]=E[q×)|age,sex,race]

and        were    the        analysis         based      on         the         measures
E[)|x,z]=E[)|age,sex,race], then the estimand would be



      E[q×E[)|x,z]|x,z] = E[q|x,z]×E[)|x,z]                                         (21)

                               = E[q×)|x,z]- cov(q,)|x,z),


so that the ideal measure is over- or under-stated to the extent
that the covariance between q and ) in the sub-population defined

by (x,z) -- owing to sub-population heterogeneity in Θ -- is
negative     or   positive.        Such   discrepancies        might      be    taken   as
indicators of the "bias" resulting from the use of "average" or
"proxy" information.           For purposes of this particular exercise,
it    is   important     to    recognize       that    much    of    the       population
heterogeneity in life expectancy (were it in fact "measurable" at
an individual level) is likely be attributable to factors beyond




                                          30
{age,sex,race}, i.e. Θ.15            As such, the empirical results to be
discussed now should be interpreted thusly.
      Two sets of measures of population health are of concern.
The objective of the first exercise is estimation of the age/sex-
specific mean QALE E[q×)|x], with x={age,sex} and z={race}.                                For

the   reasons   discussed    above,          the    "best"      one   can     do    here   to
exploit     heterogeneity       in     q×)    beyond          that    owing    to     x     is

computation based on E[q×E[)|x,z]|x] since the life table data on

) are available only at the {age,sex,race} level.                          This exercise

will illustrate how results based on this approach compare with
those        obtained           when              alternatives              based          on
E{E[q|x]×E[)|x]|x}=E[q|x]×E[)|x] are used.                       The second exercise

is to estimate the unconditional population HALE/QALE, with the
same basic considerations about alternative averaging approaches
assessed as well.
      The detailed age-sex results are presented in table 2.                               It
is seen here that for virtually all age-sex sub-populations the
empirical    covariance     between      q        and    E[)|x,z]     is    positive,       as

expected, but small in magnitude.                       That these covariances are
small -- with the corollary implication that the differences
between E[q×E[)|x,z]|x] and E[q|x]×E[)|x] are small -- should not

be surprising since the only heterogeneity and covariation that
are     effectively     being        exploited           in    the     computation         of
E[q×E[)|x,z]|x] are those due to the fact that q and ) covary by

15
    Indeed, a linear regression of q on a quadratic in
{age,sex,race} gives an R2 of only 0.11 in the full sample.
Whether {age,sex,race} captures more or less of the variation in
) than in q (so measured) is not known.

race within each {age,sex} subpopulation.
     The    second      exercise,     computation       of        the   unconditional
E[q×E[)|x,z]]     vs.      proxying    by      E[q]×E{E[)|x,z]}            results    in

estimates E[q×E[)|x,z]]=28.63 and E[q]×E{E[)|x,z]}=27.73, with an

implied cov(q,E[)|x,z])=0.9.          The covariance is obviously larger

in this instance since covariation between q and ) across age,

sex, and race subpopulations influence the computations.


A Simulation
     This subsection provides a simulation exercise based on the
specific information from the YHL report.                         For simplicity of
exposition, the focus here is on the particular measure "Years of
Healthy Life for the Population Ages 85+."16                  (Note the relevant
conditioning x here is simply a single age category.)                         The idea
is to simulate under alternative correlation assumptions a set of
individual-level samples of N=31,892 observations consistent with
the marginals and averages appearing in the last row of table 1,
and then to assess how the corresponding measures (averages,
totals)    of   quality-adjusted      life     expectancies         taken    over    the
individuals in these pseudo-samples relate to the correlation
assumptions.
     Specifically,       let   ui1,       i=1,...,31892,          be    pseudo-random

N(0,1) variates and let ui2=αui1+ui3, where the ui3 are also
N(0,1) pseudo-random variates independent of ui1.                       The population
correlation      between     the    ui1     and   ui2        is     then     given    by


16
   The arguments advanced here            generalize, mutatis mutandis, to
the YHL measure for the entire            population as examined by Erikson
et al., but are most easily               exposited for a this particular
category so that cumulation can           be avoided.

Assume now that life expectancy is generated off the ui1 as the

lognormal variates Li=exp(µ1+ui1), where µ1 is chosen to make the
mean of these lognormal variates square with the sample mean life
expectancy 6.07=193,523÷31,892.                        The corresponding quality-of-
life     scores        are    generated           off        the    ui2     as    the     probits

Qi=Φ(µ2+ui2), where µ2 is chosen to force the mean of these
probits to equal the sample mean quality-of-life score 0.51.                                    The
sample    correlation             between    the        Qi    and    Li     is    denoted    ρ̂QL .

Finally,       the     individual-level           YHLs       are    given    by    the    product
Qi×Li.         Three    prototypical         joint          distributions        for    positive,

zero, and negative ρ are displayed in figures 4-6.
       The results of the simulation are summarized in table 3.
Column 1 displays the population correlations ρ12.                                       Column 2

reports the sample correlations ρ̂QL .                        Columns 3, 4, and 5 report

the sample means of the corresponding quality-of-life scores,
life expectancies, and YHLs, respectively.                                The row marked in
boldface font corresponding to ρ12=0 provides a useful baseline

reference.       Here are seen an empirical ρ̂QL correlation close to

zero and sample means of Qi, Li, and YHLi virtually identical to
those reported in (or implied by) the last row of table 1.
       The findings of primary interest are displayed in the last
column for the nonzero ρ12 correlations.                            Even though the sample
means of Qi (and, of course, Li) are essentially the same under
each correlation structure, the means of YHLi vary impressively
over     the     different         assumed        correlations.              Even       empirical
correlations         ρ̂QL    on    the    order        of    ±0.4    apparently        result    in

sizable divergences of the mean YHLs from the value obtained
under the naive zero-correlation assumption.
       The bottom line is that (sub-)population heterogeneity in q
and ) in conjunction with nonnegligible covariance between q and

)   have     potentially         dramatic          implications          for       health      status

measurement.


VI. CONCLUSION
       For      cost-effectiveness                  analysis,            population            health
monitoring, and other important practical pursuits, {H,Q,D}-AL-
{E,Y} measures have become the standard vehicles for quantifying
outcomes.            As     such,      it     is        critical        to     work         within    a
methodologically rigorous framework when such measures are used
for    evaluative         purposes.          In    the     context       of    a       very   general
stochastic       framework,         this      paper        has    exposited            a    range    of
analytical tools for quantifying population health outcomes --
functionals, stochastic dominance, and parametric functions of
moments, order statistics, quantiles, and tail probabilities --
and    pursued       in   detail      various       features        of       expectations-based
methods.            Estimating        such        expectations,          while         conceptually
straightforward, will often require in practice consideration of
the    covariance         structures         of    G(.),     thus       rendering           empirical
implementation perhaps less straightforward than might meet the
eye.         Moreover,      as     suggested            above,    whether          multiplicative
functional       forms      that    map      attributes          into     health           status    are
desirable -- from the perspective of characterizing usefully the
population       distribution          of     health       --    should        be      a    paramount
consideration          in    designing            measures       of      population           health.
Finally,       it    should      be    emphasized           that      only         a    handful      of
approaches to definition and estimation have been presented and
assessed here, and that other approaches might be considered
under particular circumstances.                     Whether or not the "covariance"



                                                   34
issues described above will pertain in such applications will
depend on the particular definition and estimator, but before
approaching any such alternative analytical structure, analysts
might do well to consider the prospect that without due caution
"lurking    covariances"   may   ensnare   empirical    analyses.     At    a
minimum, it is hoped that the analysis undertaken here will point
the   way   to   further   developments    in   the   important   field    of
empirical population health research.
