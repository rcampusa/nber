  WAS THERE A "PESO PROBLEM" IN THE U.S. TERM STRUCTURE OF INTEREST RATES:
                                 1979-1982?


                                   ABSTRACT

During the period following October 1979 through 1982. the U.S. Federal Reserve

allowed interest rates to fluctuate widely, in contrast to its previous policy

of targeting these rates in the 197C   The policy was abandoned in 1982 in favor

of an operating procedure that reduced the variation in interest rates.     This

paper implements an estimation method to identify from the term structure of

Eurodollar returns the market's beliefs that the Fed may revert to interest rate

targeting.   The model is not rejected and gives plausible estimates of the

probability of a switch in monetary regimes.
