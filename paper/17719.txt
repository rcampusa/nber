                                             ABSTRACT

A large amount of activity in the financial sector occurs in secondary financial markets, where securities
are traded among investors without capital flowing to firms. The stock market is the archetypal example,
which in most developed economies captures a lot of attention and resources. Is the stock market
just a side show or does it affect real economic activity? In this article, we discuss the potential real
effects of financial markets that stem from the informational role of market prices. We review the
theoretical literature and show that accounting for the feedback effect from market prices to the real
economy significantly changes our understanding of the price formation process, the informativeness
of the price, and speculators’ trading behavior. We make two main points. First, we argue that a new
definition of price efficiency is needed to account for the extent to which prices reflect information
useful for the efficiency of real decisions (rather than the extent to which they forecast future cash
flows). Second, incorporating the feedback effect into models of financial markets can explain various
market phenomena that otherwise seem puzzling. Finally, we review empirical evidence on the real
effects of secondary financial markets.

       I.       Introduction

One of the most important topics in financial economics is whether financial markets have an effect on

the real economy. This question has become particularly relevant in the light of the recent financial crisis.

An important line of research, exemplified by Bernanke and Gertler (1989) and Kiyotaki and Moore

(1997), studies how adverse selection or moral hazard problems affect primary financial markets by

limiting the ability of entrepreneurs and firms to raise external capital. This in turn constrains real

investment, and so frictions in primary financial markets end up reducing real economic activity.


However, there is an important feature of real-world financial markets that is missing in this line of

research, namely that a large fraction of activity occurs in secondary financial markets, in which

securities are traded among investors, without any capital flowing to firms. The archetypal example of a

secondary market is the stock market, in which capital flows to a firm only when it issues shares, but most

of the time, trading is conducted between investors and does not involve the firm at all. In this sense,

derivative markets are almost always secondary, and there is large amount of activity in secondary bond

markets as well. In most developed economies, substantial resources are devoted to secondary markets

such as the stock market. However, in the line of research mentioned above, the operation of secondary

financial markets has either no or very little effect on the real economy.1


How can one explain the attention devoted to secondary financial markets? Why do managers constantly

track the performance of their firms’ stocks? Why does the press so frequently report the developments in

the stock market? Can this be rationalized in a world where secondary market prices are passive (i.e.,

epiphenomenal), in that they merely reflect expectations about future cash flows and do not affect them,

as in many economic models, including most of those used in the asset-pricing literature? Related, is it

plausible that secondary-market prices are purely passive, and have no effect on real decisions, given that

a vast empirical literature documents how much information prices contain about future cash flows?

In our view, treating secondary market prices as a side show is a mistake. Instead, we will argue that one

should take seriously the idea that secondary market prices have an effect on real economic activity.

Since secondary financial markets do not lead to any direct transfer of resources to the firm, prices in

these markets have real consequences only if they affect the actions of decision makers in the real side of

the economy (henceforth, ‘real decision makers’). We can think of three reasons for which this may

occur. We argue that all of them originate from the informational role of prices.


First, real decision makers learn new information from secondary market prices, and use this information

to guide their real decisions. The idea is very natural, going back to Hayek (1945), who argued that prices

are a useful source of information. A financial market is a place where many speculators with different

pieces of information meet to trade, attempting to profit from their information. Prices aggregate these

diverse pieces of information and ultimately reflect an accurate assessment of firm value. Real decision

makers (such as managers, capital providers, directors, customers, regulators, employees, etc.) will learn

from this information and use it to guide their decisions, in turn affecting firm cash flows and values

(Baumol (1965)).       Ultimately, the financial market has a real effect due to the transmission of

information.


Some readers may wonder if it is plausible that real decision makers learn from prices. They are closer to

the firm than market traders, and so one might expect them to have better information. However, this

logic is incomplete.     The assumption needed for financial markets to have a real effect via the

transmission of information is not that real decision makers are less informed than traders, but only that

they do not have perfect information about every decision-relevant factor, and so outsiders may possess

some incremental information that is useful to them. Thus, real decision makers may be the most

informed agents in the economy about the firm, but there are still aspects about which they can learn from

outsiders. This is for two reasons. First, while an individual speculator may be less informed than the

manager, the market aggregates the information of many speculators who collectively may be more

informed (Grossman (1976), Hellwig (1980)). Second, optimal real decisions depend not only on internal

                                                     3
information to the firm (about which the manager may be more informed), but also on external

information, such as the state of the economy, the position of competitors, the demand by consumers, etc.


Consider, for example, a firm manager, who is arguably the individual most informed about the firm’s

fundamentals. The manager announces an acquisition bid for another firm. This decision is often made

after undertaking substantial internal analysis and seeking the external counsel of investment banks, to

assess whether the value of the target to the acquirer exceeds the offer price. As is well known, this

assessment is based on assumptions with a high degree of uncertainty. In particular, the desirability of the

deal depends on many factors other than the acquirer’s fundamentals and about which the acquirer may be

less than fully informed – such as the standalone value of the target, the likely synergies between the

acquirer and the target, and the future prospects of the industry (which affects whether it is optimal for the

acquirer to expand via acquisition). Hence, it is entirely plausible that, among the many speculators who

trade in the stock market, some have insights into the proposed deal that were missed by the manager and

his advisors. If participants trade on this information, their insights will be reflected in the price. Hence,

when a manager announces an acquisition and the market responds negatively, he may learn from this

response and cancel the deal. Empirical evidence on this channel was presented by Luo (2005).2


More generally, managers may learn from prices when making other decisions, such as investment, as

shown by Chen, Goldstein, and Jiang (2007) and Bakke and Whited (2010). Moreover, decision makers

other than managers are further removed from the firm and also lack decision-relevant information. Thus,

they are even more likely to use the information contained in market prices to guide their actions, which

affect the firm’s cash flows and values. Credit-rating agencies are known to be influenced by stock

prices, and their decisions have a large effect on the availability of credit to the firm. Regulators, who

take actions that affect firm cash flows (most prominently, in the case of banks), follow market prices

very closely (e.g., Feldman and Schmidt (2003) and Burton and Seale (2005)), and recent proposals in the

2
 As an analogy, assume that there exist stock prices on individual researchers, which reflect the views of the general
profession. If a researcher’s stock price fell upon starting a new project, many such researchers would choose to
abandon the project.

light of the crisis advocate increasing the reliance on market prices even further (e.g., Flannery (2009),

McDonald (2010), and Hart and Zingales (2011)). Similarly, employees and customers may base their

decisions on whether to work for the firm or buy its products on information they glean from the market.


Second, even if decision makers do not learn from market prices, they care about market prices because

they are party to contracts that are contingent on market prices. This is most relevant for firm managers,

whose compensation is tied to the firm’s share price. Then, the manager’s incentives to take real actions

will depend on the extent to which they will be reflected in the stock price. If the stock price is not

closely tied to firm value but instead driven by noise, the manager has weak incentives to exert costly

effort to improve the firm’s fundamental value.


Importantly, even though this second channel does not involve active learning from the price, it is

ultimately similar to the first channel, in that market prices end up having a real effect due to their

informational role. The reason that contracts are conditioned on prices to begin with is most likely due to

their informational role. Shareholders choose to solve agency problems with the firm’s manager by tying

his compensation to the stock price, because they believe that the stock price contains information about

firm value. If prices were uninformative, shareholders would not tie managerial compensation to stock

prices, and so managers would not care about stock prices.


Third, another possibility, favored by proponents of behavioral finance, is that secondary-market prices

have a real effect on economic activity because real decision makers irrationally follow the price and use

it as an anchor. While we do not deny that irrationality exists, the ultimate source of the effect is likely to

be the informational role of prices. Presumably, the reason that real decision makers look at the price,

rather than other public signals, is that the price often contains information. There may be over-reaction

due to bounded rationality, but the informational content is key for some reliance on the price to arise.

Note that even fully rational learning from the price can lead to inefficient decisions since price changes




                                                      5
sometimes arise from non-fundamental shocks (such as price pressure caused by fire-sales), which real

decision makers may misinterpret as arising from fundamental shocks.3


In this article, we survey models that feature a feedback effect from financial markets to the real economy

due to the informational role of prices.           Unlike the traditional approach, where prices only reflect

expected firm cash flows, in these models prices both affect and reflect firm cash flows. George Soros, a

prominent trader, has termed this feature "reflexivity," and summarized it as follows: “In certain

circumstances, financial markets can affect the so-called fundamentals which they are supposed to

reflect.”4 In reviewing the theoretical literature, we show that accounting for the feedback effect from

market prices to the real economy significantly changes our understanding of the price formation process,

the informativeness of the price, and speculators’ trading behavior.


We make two main points. First, if one accepts the idea that secondary prices have an effect for

informational reasons, it follows that the traditional definitions of price efficiency need to be augmented.

In particular, while financial economists typically study whether prices forecast future cash flows, a

potentially more important question to ask is whether prices accurately convey information about

underlying economic state or choice variables that are important for real efficiency. We show that the

two notions often diverge in models with feedback effects.5 In particular, market prices may convey less

useful information to decision makers than traditional notions of market efficiency would suggest. In

addition, the extent to which prices reveal information about an underlying state variable depends

critically on how decision makers will use this information. When using the information in the price,

decision makers might harm the informativeness of the price about the variable they wish to learn.

Second, we discuss the implications of the informational feedback from financial markets to real activities

for various topics of research in finance, and in particular show how it generates natural explanations of

  In contrast, note that it is quite possible for fluctuations in primary financial prices to have an effect, even if these
fluctuations come solely from irrationality on the part of investors: see the survey of Baker and Wurgler (2012).

phenomena – such as manipulative short selling, the asymmetric dissemination of bad news and good

news, financial-market runs, information-based trading, and the presence of non-controlling blockholders

– that otherwise seem puzzling.


The remainder of the survey is organized as follows. Section II describes models of learning by decision

makers from market prices.        Section III describes models in which financial markets have real

consequences due to their incentive effect. Section IV discusses the implications of feedback from

financial markets to real activity for various research topics in financial economics. Section V reviews

empirical evidence on the real effect of secondary financial markets. Section VI concludes.


    II.     Learning by decision makers

A central topic in financial economics is price efficiency, which is defined as the extent to which market

prices are informative about the value of traded assets. Financial economists often argue that price

efficiency is desirable because market prices guide real decisions (such as investment). Thus, informative

prices enable superior decision-making: price efficiency promotes real efficiency. For example, Fama

and Miller (1972) note: “(an efficient market) has a very desirable feature. In particular, at any point in

time market prices of securities provide accurate signals for resource allocation; that is, firms can make

production-investment decisions ..." (p 335).     This idea is quite natural: if prices are efficient and

aggregate information from various sources, then decision makers in the real sector, who are likely to be

only partially informed, will wish to learn from prices. This idea goes back to Hayek (1945), who argued

that prices are a useful source of information.      There is vast empirical literature documenting the

informational content of prices. Strikingly, market prices contain information even about events far-

removed from firm cash flows: Roll (1984) shows that futures markets improve weather-forecasting

relative to traditional meteorological forecasts, while a large literature on prediction markets (see Wolfers

and Zitzewitz (2004)) shows that markets provide the most efficient mechanism for predicting election

outcomes. As argued in the introduction, there are many types of decision makers who can potentially

                                                     7
learn from prices: managers, regulators, capital providers, customers, employees, etc. The assumption is

not that these agents (in particular, managers) are less informed overall than speculators, but simply that

speculators have some information that they do not have.


However, theoretical research on financial markets traditionally treats the real side of the firm as

exogenous. A large literature, starting from the seminal papers by Grossman and Stiglitz (1980), Hellwig

(1980), Admati (1985), Glosten and Milgrom (1985), and Kyle (1985), analyzes models in which

informed speculators trade on their information about firm value and studies the extent to which their

information is incorporated into prices – i.e., whether prices are efficient. Since firm value in these

papers is typically exogenous to trading in the financial market, these models do not allow us to study

how real efficiency is affected by price efficiency.


An exception is the early literature on the desirability of insider trading. Fishman and Hagerty (1992),

Leland (1992), and Khanna, Slezak, and Bradley (1994) present models where different types of

speculators – insiders and outsiders – trade on their information. Limiting insider trading reduces price

efficiency since information possessed by insiders is no longer impounded into prices. On the other hand,

it also reduces adverse selection and thus encourages outsiders to trade on their information, increasing

price efficiency. Hence, there is a tradeoff with respect to the effect of insider trading on price efficiency.

In these models, real decision makers learn from the price, and so the implications of the effect of insider

trading on price efficiency are automatically translated into implications on real efficiency.


Similarly, Boot and Thakor (1997) and Subrahmanyam and Titman (1999) use the feedback effect to

rationalize a firm’s choice to issue publicly-traded securities, rather than receiving private financing (e.g.

from a bank). In these models, public trading allows the firm to infer information from its stock price and

use it to improve its real decisions. Foucault and Gehrig (2008) extend this reasoning to explain the




                                                       8
decision of a firm to cross-list its shares in two different markets: cross listing enables the firm to obtain

more precise information from the stock market and improve the efficiency of its investment decisions.6


However, the link between price efficiency and real efficiency turns out to be more complicated, as was

shown by Dow and Gorton (1997). They study a model where managers learn from prices. There are

two equilibria. In the first equilibrium, speculators produce information and trade on it, so that their

information is incorporated in prices. Managers then base investment decisions on prices. In the other

equilibrium, speculators do not produce information, and investments are not made (because their

unconditional NPV is negative). Technically, in this second equilibrium, prices are efficient since they

fully reflect the fact that investment is not going to occur. However, real efficiency is low, since the

market does not provide information to guide real investment decisions. Hence, price efficiency does not

necessarily imply real efficiency.


We can express the tension between price efficiency and real efficiency as follows. The traditional focus

of price efficiency is whether the price of a given security accurately predicts the future value of that

security. However, what matters for real efficiency is whether the price reveals information necessary for

decision makers to take value-maximizing actions. To distinguish the two notions, we will refer to the

traditional notion - forecasting firm value - as forecasting price efficiency (FPE), while we term the extent

to which prices reveal the information necessary for real efficiency as revelatory price efficiency (RPE).

Dow and Gorton’s point is that it is quite possible for prices to be efficient in the forecasting sense, but

not in the revelatory sense. Revelatory price inefficiency immediately generates real inefficiency. In




6
 Other papers in the IPO literature have also used the assumption that stock-market participants have information
about some aspects of the firm, which is not available to the firm’s managers. See, for example, Rock (1986),
Benveniste and Spindt (1989), Benveniste and Wilhelm (1990), and, Biais, Bossaerts, and Rochet (2002).

                                                       9
contrast, forecasting price inefficiency affects real inefficiency only to the extent to which it is related to

revelatory price inefficiency.7


The papers discussed above assume that decision makers lack information about state variables whose

realization affects the value maximizing action. Thus, in our definition of RPE, the information necessary

for decision makers to take value-maximizing actions is information about these state variables. Here, the

distinction between RPE and FPE is reminiscent of Hirshleifer’s (1971) distinction between discovery

and foreknowledge. Discovery is important to uncover unknown information that can guide decision

making, while foreknowledge is information about something that will be found out eventually and hence

learning it early has no real implications. Hirshleifer (1971) emphasizes that foreknowledge has no social

value, while discovery is valuable, and argues that economic forces do not guarantee optimal information

production. Looking ahead to the next section, agency problems sometimes imply that the information

necessary for real efficiency is instead information about the privately-observable actions of decision

makers, and RPE relates to how accurately prices reveal these actions.


The literature has identified at least three distinct ways by which RPE can fail in the case that state

variables are unobserved by decision makers.


First, assume there is perfect FPE, in that the security price perfectly aggregates all information currently

available to market participants. RPE commonly fails if expected firm value is non-monotonic in the

state variable under the efficient decision. To see this, observe that in this case, real efficiency and FPE

imply the price is non-monotonic in the state variable. But then a given price level can be associated with

multiple different realizations of the state variable, and so RPE fails. Such non-monotonicity can arise

when the decision maker would like to take a corrective action that increases firm value when the state

variable falls below a certain threshold. For example, a board of directors may fire a badly-performing


7
  Although RPE is necessary for real efficiency, it is not sufficient. For example, firms may fall short of real
efficiency simply because limited enforceability makes it impossible for shareholders to force a manager to take a
particular action.

                                                       10
manager, a private-equity fund may buy out an underperforming firm, or the government may provide

assistance to an underperforming bank.        Bond, Goldstein, and Prescott (2010) analyze equilibrium

outcomes in this case. They show that in order to achieve the desirable outcome, the decision maker

cannot fully rely on the information in the price, but must have some independent information of his own.

In the context of monetary policy, Bernanke and Woodford (1997) observe that a similar problem

constrains inflation targeting. Sundaresan and Wang (2011) analyze the implications for the reliance on

contingent capital with market triggers.


Second, as in Dow and Gorton (1997), RPE can fail because a firm’s response to the information

conveyed in prices may destroy speculators’ incentives to collect information in the first place. In their

model, this occurs when a firm interprets security prices as being random and hence uninformative, and

so does not invest; but then foreseeing no investment, speculators do not find it profitable to collect

information, ensuring that prices are indeed uninformative. Bresnahan, Milgrom, and Paul (1992) present

a milder version of this general argument: speculators may have stronger incentives to collect information

about the future value of a firm’s assets-in-place than about cash flows that a firm’s current actions can

affect. Dow, Goldstein, and Guembel (2011) show how a similar mechanism can amplify bad economic

shocks. Bad shocks directly reduce firms’ investments, and this reduces speculators’ incentives to

produce information. As a result, firms’ investments decline further and so do their values (due to a

decrease in the amount of available information), amplifying the original shock. Faure-Grimaud (2002)

and Lehar, Seppi, and Strobl (2008) study another effect: if a regulator acquires information from market

prices, his incentives to acquire distinct information by himself are reduced, and so for some parameter

values, the regulator’s total information (from all sources) is reduced.


Third, even if speculators receive information costlessly, RPE may fail if prices do not efficiently

aggregate speculators’ diverse pieces of information. This possibility is analyzed by Bond and Goldstein

(2011), who characterize circumstances under which the act of using prices as an input to economic

decisions reduces RPE. The decision maker’s reliance on market prices affects speculators’ incentives to

                                                     11
trade on their information, in light of the traditional tradeoff they face between risk and return. The extent

of information aggregation also affects the traditional notion of FPE, but the two efficiency measures do

not coincide. Bond and Goldstein’s analysis highlights another dimension of RPE: even if a decision

maker could increase RPE by committing to completely ignore security prices, he would prefer instead to

put some weight on security prices. The reason is that RPE is a relevant metric only if prices are actually

used in making decisions. Hence the appropriate welfare-measure must combine RPE with the extent

prices are actually used in decisions.


In summary, the papers above explain why market prices may convey less useful information to decision

makers than is commonly assumed to be the case when markets are efficient in the traditional sense: in

our terminology, RPE may fail even when FPE holds. In addition, they show that the extent to which

prices reveal information about an underlying state variable depends critically on the uses to which the

information will be put by decision makers. When using the information in the price, decision makers

might harm the informativeness of the price about the variable they wish to learn.


While the above discussion focuses on the effect of financial markets on production efficiency, a distinct

welfare effect of financial markets relates to the possibility of sharing consumption risk. Under some

circumstances, increases in RPE lead to a reduction in risk-sharing possibilities, due to what has been

dubbed the Hirshleifer (1971) effect: one cannot insure against shocks after their realization has become

public.   Dow and Rahi (2003) develop a full welfare analysis of the effect of informed trading,

considering both production and consumption effects.


    III. Improved incentives

A second channel through which financial markets may have real effects is by affecting a decision

maker’s incentives to take real decisions. This effect was first discussed by Baumol (1965) and an early

formalization can be found in Fishman and Hagerty (1989). In their paper, a manager chooses the firm’s


                                                     12
investment level, which is unobservable to investors. By assumption, the manager’s aim is to maximize

the firm’s share price. If the share price perfectly reflected expected cash flows, the manager would

choose the efficient investment level, i.e., equate the marginal benefit of investment to its marginal cost.

However, since the investment choice is unobservable to market participants, prices do not reflect

expected cash flows: an investment that raises expected cash flows by $1 augments the expected share

price by less than $1. Consequently, the manager underinvests. If price efficiency increases, the price

more closely reflects the fundamental value of the firm and thus the benefits of any investment that the

manager has undertaken.      This reduces the underinvestment problem and increases real efficiency.

Fishman and Hagerty use this insight to examine a firm’s incentives to disclose information, and thereby

affect price efficiency.


In the incentives channel, decision makers such as the manager do not learn from prices. Instead, prices

affect the manager’s incentives as his contract is tied to them. Thus, in our definition of RPE, the

information that the price must reflect for the manager to take value-maximizing actions is information

about his actions. Put differently, the greater the extent to which the stock price reflects the manager’s

actions, the greater his incentives to take desirable actions and avoid undesirable ones. Thus, the role

played by RPE in the two channels is subtly different. In the incentives channel, RPE affects the decision

maker’s incentives to take the efficient action. In the learning channel, RPE affects his ability to take the

efficient action, by revealing to him what the efficient action is. As in Section II, RPE and FPE here need

not coincide. Paul (1992) theoretically demonstrates that efficient markets (i.e., markets that exhibit FPE)

weight information according to the informativeness about asset value, while for optimal incentives,

information should be weighted according to its informativeness about the manager’s actions. The fact

that FPE and RPE diverge is illustrated by Singh and Yerramilli (2010), who show that certain types of

transparency simultaneously increase FPE but decrease RPE.


A limiting case of Paul (1992) is that speculators have no information about the manager’s actions. Stein

(1989) analyzes a model of this type, and shows that even when financial markets are efficient in the

                                                     13
traditional (FPE) sense, managers who seek to maximize the stock price have the incentive to take non-

value-maximizing actions – in his model, earnings manipulation – that are not observed by the market.

Again, the real inefficiency reflects a failure of RPE. In the same vein, Brandenburger and Polak (1996)

show that managers who seek to maximize the stock price have the incentive to ignore their own

(superior) information about the best decision, and follow the market priors, again leading to non-value-

maximizing actions. Aghion and Stein (2008) make a related point, showing that managers will choose to

pursue the strategy expected by the market.


The above papers generally take as exogenous the dependence of the manager’s contract on the stock

price. Holmstrom and Tirole (1993) endogenize this dependence by solving for the optimal contract

between shareholders and the manager. In such a case, changes in stock market efficiency have a second

effect, in that they affect the equilibrium contract, and thus the extent to which the manager cares about

the price. In Holmstrom and Tirole, when price efficiency increases, the stock price provides a less noisy

signal of firm value. Thus, if the manager is risk averse, it is optimal to increase the weighting of the

contract on the stock price relative to non-price measures of performance, such as accounting profits.

Simply put, shareholders pay the manager according to the stock price since it reflects firm value. Hence,

it is effectively shareholders (the “principal”) rather than the manager (the “agent”) who learn from stock

prices. This endogenous response of the contract amplifies the effect of price efficiency on real efficiency

in their model. Separately, there are a number of other potentially important reasons why the manager

may care about the stock price, which is essential for the incentives channel to operate. For example,

shareholders may have short horizons themselves, and hence want to incentivize the manager with

contracts that depend on the short-term share price. Alternatively, the manager may care about the short-

term share price due to takeover threats, reputational considerations, or expecting to sell his own shares in

the short-run.


In all the papers mentioned above, the decision maker is the manager of a firm. In common with the

learning channel discussed in Section II, stock-market efficiency may also affect the actions of other

                                                     14
decision makers. For example, Faure-Grimaud and Gromb (2004) show that an increase in RPE raises the

incentives of a blockholder to take a value-augmenting action, the benefits of which may not materialize

until after a liquidity shock forces the blockholder to sell.


    IV. Implications for financial markets and corporate finance

Considering a feedback effect from financial markets to firms’ real decisions generates an array of

implications for the study of financial markets and corporate finance. Often, phenomena that are believed

to be puzzling can be rationalized in a model in which financial markets have real effects. We will

frequently draw a distinction with the “traditional” view of security prices, in which cash flows affect

prices, but prices have no effect on cash flows. Our focus here is on models that exhibit endogenous

feedback, i.e., via learning and/or incentives. Several papers in the literature generate related implications

based on models with exogenous feedback, i.e., where firm value or the firm’s investment decision is

assumed to be mechanically tied to the price; see: Khanna and Sonti (2004) and Ozdenoren and Yuan

(2008).


          IV.A Manipulative short-selling


Regulators and firm managers are often concerned about manipulative short-selling in financial markets,

whereby speculators drive down the price of a stock by short selling. Such concerns have led to

restrictions on short selling activities in different countries and at different points in time.       These

concerns, however, are difficult to rationalize in a traditional model of financial markets. First, in such a

model, the stock price has no real effect, so there is no reason to be concerned about artificially low stock

prices. Second, it is often hard to generate manipulation as an equilibrium phenomenon, since price

impact will cause a manipulator to sell at a low price and buy at a high price and hence lose money

overall (Jarrow (1992)).




                                                       15
Goldstein and Guembel (2008) consider a model where the manager of the firm learns from the stock

price about the profitability of an investment project. Due to this feedback effect, manipulation arises as

an equilibrium phenomenon. A speculator realizes that if she drives the stock price down, even when she

has no information, the manager might cancel the investment since he thinks that the price decrease may

have been due to negative information. Since the cancelation is based on no actual information, it reduces

firm value, allowing the speculator to profit from her short position. Interestingly, the effect cannot work

in the opposite direction. If the speculator buys without information, she causes overinvestment, which is

also bad for firm value, and so she loses from her long position.


Related to the distinction made earlier between RPE and FPE, this paper also shows that the feedback

effect can hamper the ability of decision makers to learn from the price about their optimal decision.

Here, the feedback effect generates the manipulative motive that makes it hard to infer the profitability of

the investment from the price. Khanna and Mathews (2011) allow a large blockholder to counter the

manipulators’ strategies, and identify more precisely when such manipulative strategies are likely to

succeed.


        IV.B Limits to arbitrage


In standard trading models in which firm value is exogenous, speculators can make profits by trading on

their information. Existing papers have identified limits to such arbitrage activities, typically based on

exogenous forces such as trading restrictions or agency problems between the speculator and her own

investors. Edmans, Goldstein, and Jiang (2011b) show that the informational role of prices generates a

limit to arbitrage that arises endogenously as part of the trading process. Consider a speculator who has

negative information about firm prospects. If she short-sells, this lowers the stock price. The manager

will observe the reduced stock price and infer that firm prospects are poor. Consistent with the models in

Section II, this may lead him to take a corrective action, such as reducing investment. Downsizing the

firm in response to poor firm conditions is efficient and improves the firm’s fundamental value, reducing


                                                    16
the profitability of the speculator’s short position. Thus, the speculator may refrain from short-selling in

the first place.


Interestingly, this feedback-driven limit to arbitrage is asymmetric: it deters informed selling, but

encourages informed buying. Trading on information in either direction increases price informativeness

and thus firm value, through guiding the manager’s action. This reduces the profitability of a short

position, but increases the profitability of a long position. This asymmetry originates from a similar force

to the one present in Goldstein and Guembel (2008): in the presence of feedback, a speculator who short-

sells benefits from hurting the firm, but loses from helping it. However, while Goldstein and Guembel

(2008) highlight that the feedback effect can lead an uninformed speculator to short-sell, Edmans,

Goldstein, and Jiang (2011b) highlight that it may deter an informed speculator from short-selling.


         IV.C The survival of irrational traders


An important question in asset pricing is whether irrational traders can survive in the long run. Under the

traditional view, irrational traders, who trade based on considerations unrelated to firms’ fundamentals,

will lose money, and hence disappear from the market over time. Hence, markets will be populated only

by rational traders, and so prices will be efficient, correctly reflecting firms’ fundamentals. However, as

pointed out by Hirshleifer, Subrahmanyam, and Titman (2006), when prices affect firms’ cash flows, this

traditional view no longer holds. Irrational traders can end up making a profit because their trades on

non-fundamental considerations end up affecting firms’ cash flows in a way that allows them to make a

profit on their trades.


         IV.D Runs in the financial market


Another type of market behavior that is puzzling under the traditional view is a self-reinforcing “run” on a

stock, where many investors seek to sell a stock because other investors are also selling. While many

commentators believe that such runs are commonplace, they are hard to explain in traditional models.


                                                    17
The reason is that self-reinforcing selling can occur only if selling exhibits strategic complementarity (i.e.,

the gain is larger when more people sell). However, traditional forces in financial markets generate

strategic substitutability: due to the price mechanism, when speculators sell, the price goes down,

increasing the incentive for other speculators to buy, rather than sell. Goldstein, Ozdenoren, and Yuan

(2011b), building on Goldstein, Ozdenoren, and Yuan (2011a), show that strategic complementarities

arise if capital providers base their decision on how much capital to provide to the firm on its stock price.

The reason is that if many other speculators sell, the fall in the share price leads to a reduction in

financing, and hence to a fall in firm value. This can create ‘trading frenzies’ that resemble ‘run’

phenomena.


        IV.E     Information-based trade


A long-standing puzzle in financial economics is the apparent existence of trade for purely informational

reasons. When cash flows are exogenous, no-trade theorems (see Milgrom and Stokey (1982)) imply that

such trade is impossible, and so the only way to generate trade is to assume that some people trade for

non-informational reasons (e.g., “noise traders” are present). However, Bond and Eraslan (2010) show

that trade based purely on informational differences can arise when decision makers observe the terms of

trade (such as volume or price), and use the information revealed to make real decisions that affect the

cash flows of the asset being traded.


        IV.F     Governance through financial markets and the value of blockholders


The traditional view of blockholders is that they exert governance through direct intervention in a firm’s

operations, otherwise known as “voice”. However, particularly in the U.S., blockholders appear to be too

small to intervene effectively: while Holderness (2009) finds that 96% of U.S. firms have at least one

blockholder with a stake exceeding 5%, La Porta, Lopez-de-Silanes, and Shleifer (1999) document that

only 20% (10%) of large (medium) U.S. firms contain a blockholder who owns at least 20%, which they

argue is the threshold required to exert control. The governance role of such blockholders, and thus the

                                                      18
rationale for their existence, appears puzzling in the light of existing intervention theories. However, the

incentives channel studied in Section III shows that blockholders can exert governance even in the

absence of control rights. By gathering and trading on private information - known as governance

through trading or “exit”8 – they increase price informativeness and thus the manager’s incentives to take

actions that improve firm value.


A central question is why blockholders have a special role in such informed trading compared to other

investors. Edmans (2009) analyzes the link between block size, information acquisition incentives, and

informed trading. In the presence of short-sales constraints, a trader with a zero position has little

incentive to acquire information, because if she receives a negative signal, she cannot trade on it. Up to a

point, the larger one’s stake, the more one can sell upon a negative signal, and thus the greater the

incentives to gather the signal to begin with. However, if the block becomes too large, liquidity becomes a

constraint and so the blockholder cannot sell her entire stake upon a negative signal. Thus, the optimal

block size is finite.


The particular managerial agency problem examined by Edmans (2009) is that managers may behave

myopically, and in this context he shows how blockholders, by increasing price efficiency, can help

augment long-term investment. In a contemporaneous paper, Admati and Pfleiderer (2009) study a

different specification of the firm’s agency problem, and show that, while the blockholder alleviates the

agency problem of the manager taking a “bad” action (e.g. shirking), she can sometimes make it more

difficult to motivate the manager to take a “good” action (e.g. exerting effort).


Goldman and Strobl (2011) study a different aspect of blockholder behavior. When blockholders’ time-

horizons are shorter than project horizons, they have the incentive to try to manipulate short-term share

prices upwards. A manager who is himself compensated on the basis of short-term share prices then

responds by extending the time horizon of the project. Consequently, the combination of short horizons

8
  The survey of McCahery, Sautner, and Starks (2011) shows that exit is the leading governance mechanism used by
institutions.

                                                      19
for both blockholders and managers can, counterintuitively, end up inducing managers to extend project

time horizons.


Viewing governance as occurring through financial markets, rather than the exercise of control, in turn

has new implications for the optimal blockholder structure. In voice theories, a single large blockholder

is optimal, as she has strong incentives to engage in costly intervention; breaking up the block into

multiple units weakens voice due to the free-rider problem. However, if governance occurs through exit,

Edmans and Manso (2011) show that multiple small blockholders can be optimal. The same free-rider

problems that hinder voice actually enhance exit: since multiple blockholders cannot co-ordinate to limit

their orders and maximize combined trading profits, they trade competitively, impounding more

information into prices. The optimal number of blockholders is thus a trade-off between the positive

effect on “exit” and the negative effect on “voice.”


Blockholder models also make precise a potential cost of price efficiency. Maug (1998) studies a

blockholder who is considering a value-adding intervention. Due to the free-rider problem, her stake in

the firm may be insufficient to induce her to bear the costs of intervention. However, she can profit from

intervention through a second source: the ability to buy additional shares at a price that does not fully

reflect the benefits of her intervention. Consequently, lower price efficiency facilitates blockholder

intervention, raising real efficiency. In a similar vein, Kyle and Vila (1991) and Kahn and Winton (1998)

show that when the price impact of trades is lower – often associated with low price efficiency – there is

more blockholder formation in the first place. This in turn improves real efficiency as the blockholder

subsequently engages in intervention.


        IV.G     Optimal disclosure policy


A key topic in accounting and finance is the extent to which firms should disclose their private

information to the market. The decision about disclosure changes fundamentally when there is potential

for two-way learning, i.e., the market can learn from the firm and the firm can learn from the market.

                                                       20
Bond and Goldstein (2011) show that a benefit of disclosure is that it reduces the uncertainty that traders

are exposed to, encouraging them to trade more aggressively on their information, and so enables the firm

to learn from the market more effectively. On the other hand, when the information available to the firm

is correlated with the information available to traders, disclosure reduces speculators’ informational

advantage and so they trade less aggressively, reducing the ability of the firm to learn. Overall, disclosure

is beneficial when it involves dimensions of information that speculators do not have access to, but may

be harmful otherwise. Gao and Liyang (2011) study a different tradeoff, whereby the disclosure of

information by the firm is beneficial because it reduces the adverse selection in the financial market, but

costly since it discourages speculators from producing their own information, and so the firm learns less.

Langberg and Sivaramakrishnan (2010) study a third tradeoff, based on the idea that the disclosure of

information by the firm is the trigger for feedback from the market. The benefit in disclosing is then the

ability to gain feedback from the market, while the cost is that it makes the manager appear uninformed

(as he is seeking feedback). In the paper by Fishman and Hagerty (1989), which we reviewed earlier,

disclosure enhances the efficiency of the firm’s investment, and is thus desirable for the firm. However,

due to externalities among firms, they end up disclosing too much in equilibrium.


        IV.H    Security design


Considering the effect of market information on real investment decisions can have important

implications for the firm’s choice of capital structure. In a model of primary markets, Fulghieri and

Lukin (2001) challenge the conclusion of the pecking-order theory by Myers and Majluf (1984),

according to which firms will issue debt rather than equity, because the former is less information-

sensitive and thus subject to fewer adverse selection costs. Fulghieri and Lukin note that because equity

is more information-sensitive, its issuance encourages speculators to acquire more information. This in

turn reduces information asymmetry between the market and the firm, rendering equity sometimes

preferable.



                                                     21
Chang and Yu (2010) study a related problem in a model of secondary markets. Informed speculators

create a benefit because the firm can learn from their information when making an investment decision.

However, this comes with a cost, due to the adverse selection between informed speculators and

uninformed investors, which increases the firm’s cost of capital. As a result, the firm will design its

capital structure to increase information production when it can benefit more from market information.

The firm does this by increasing leverage, which makes equity more information-sensitive and enables

informed speculators to profit more when they trade equity. Hennessey (2009) studies a similar tradeoff,

but endogenizes noise trading. This leads to different implications for the optimal capital structure.

Informed traders can no longer profit by trading on the most information-sensitive security since noise

traders will refrain from trading it. Hence, the way to generate market information is to create a debt

security that is risky enough to enable speculators to make a profit, but not too risky so that noise traders

still trade in it.


     V.        Empirical evidence

We now turn to empirical evidence of the real effects of secondary financial markets. Identifying this real

effect is a challenging task. It is obviously not sufficient to regress investment (or other real variables) on

stock prices and controls, for at least two reasons. First, a positive relation between stock prices and

investment does not imply causality from the former to the latter: it could arise from an omitted variable

that affects both, or reverse causality. Second, even assuming a causal explanation, it may result from

mechanisms other than the learning or incentives channels, such as a primary markets explanation.


One approach in the literature is to conduct cross-sectional analyses showing that the real effect is greater

in exactly those firms where theory would predict that the learning or incentive channels are likely to be

stronger. This can shed light on the mechanism behind the feedback effect, and also address endogeneity

concerns. For example, showing that the correlation between prices and real decisions is stronger when



                                                      22
the price contains information not available to managers suggests that causality is likely to go from prices

to real decisions.


An important case in which decision makers may learn from prices is in the evaluation of merger

opportunities, as discussed in the introduction. If a manager encounters a negative market reaction after

announcing an acquisition, he will likely realize that there is a collective view that the acquisition is

value-destroying, and may cancel it. In an early paper, Jennings and Mazzeo (1991) do not find evidence

consistent with this hypothesis. In a more recent paper, Luo (2005) uses new test specifications closer to

the underlying theory, combined with a much larger sample, and finds support for this hypothesis. He

shows that in those cases where learning is most likely, i.e., when the deal is irreversible and when the

market most plausibly has information that the manager does not, the probability of cancellation is much

higher after a low announcement return. Kau, Linck and Rubin (2008) extend his analysis and show that

such learning is more likely when governance mechanisms are in place to reduce the agency problem

between the manager and the shareholders.


Chen, Goldstein, and Jiang (2007) study all investments. They show that the sensitivity of investment to

price (or Tobin’s Q) is stronger when there is more private information injected into the price in the

trading process (based on market microstructure measures). This information is not related to proxies of

managerial information, and so their result suggests that managers glean new information from the price

and use it in their investment decisions. Bakke and Whited (2010) demonstrate that the effect of price

informativeness on the sensitivity of investment to Q continues to hold when correcting for measurement

error in Q. However, the relation between the sensitivity of investment to price and a measure of capital

constraints, which was documented earlier by Baker, Stein, and Wurgler (2003), ceases to hold when this

correction is in place. Foucault and Fresard (2011) show that the sensitivity of investment to price is

higher for firms that trade in two markets, especially if they can glean more new information from prices.




                                                    23
Relatedly, Durnev, Morck, and Yeung (2004) show that price informativeness is positively related to the

efficiency of real investment, which is consistent with both the learning and incentives channels.9


Kang and Liu (2008) directly examine the incentives channel. Consistent with theory, they show that the

extent to which CEO compensation is based on market prices is positively related to measures of price

informativeness. Ferreira, Ferreira, and Raposo (2011) posit that, if price informativeness increases

managerial incentives, there is less need for other disciplinary mechanisms such as board monitoring.

Consistent with this hypothesis, they find a negative relation between price informativeness and board

independence. With regard to the incentives of other decision makers such as blockholders, Norli,

Ostergaard, and Schindele (2010) show that liquidity increases the likelihood of contested proxy

solicitations and shareholder proposals, consistent with Maug’s (1998) predictions.


To further address causality concerns, a number of recent papers have used exogenous shocks to market

liquidity (a driver of price efficiency) to analyze the real effect of financial markets. Fang, Noe, and Tice

(2009) demonstrate a causal effect of liquidity on firm value (as measured by Tobin’s Q) using the natural

experiment of decimalization: in 2001, the U.S. stock exchanges moved from tick sizes of 1/16 to one

cent, leading to an exogenous increase in liquidity. They find a positive effect, consistent with both the

learning and incentive channels. This effect of liquidity on firm value is particularly strong for firms with

high managerial incentives, consistent with the incentive channel in particular. Bharath, Jayaraman, and

Nagar (2011) show that positive shocks to liquidity (e.g., decimalization) improve firm value, particularly

for firms with larger block ownership. As predicted by the incentives channel, the impact of liquidity

shocks on the blockholder-firm value association is increasing in managerial incentives.


While Fang, Noe, and Tice (2009) and Bharath, Jayaraman, and Nagar (2011) study the impact of

financial markets on firm value in general, other papers investigate the effect of financial markets on


9
  Another approach is to compare the investment behavior of public and private firms. However, it is difficult to use
this approach to distinguish between different channels. Examples of such papers include Mortal and Reisel (2011)
and Asker, Farre-Mensa, and Ljungqvist (2011).

                                                         24
specific channels through which financial markets can increase firm value. Jayaraman and Milbourn

(2011) demonstrate that CEO incentives are increasing in liquidity, using stock splits as an instrument for

liquidity. Edmans, Fang, and Zur (2011) show that liquidity increases the likelihood of a hedge fund

acquiring a block in a firm to begin with. Conditional upon acquiring a block, liquidity induces the

blockholder to choose governance through exit rather than voice. They use decimalization to document

causal effects, and both of these effects are stronger for firms with higher managerial incentives. Kim and

Kang (2011) use decimalization to show that liquidity leads to a less negative relationship between R&D

and the probability of CEO firing, consistent with the hypothesis that liquidity causes the benefits of R&D

to be more closely incorporated into stock prices.


The previous papers study the real effects of a shock to liquidity, which affects the efficiency of prices.

As discussed in Sections II and III, price efficiency matters for both the learning and incentive channels.

Another approach is to identify a shock to the level of prices, which is related to the learning channel in

particular.10 This is the approach of Edmans, Goldstein, and Jiang (2011a), who study the impact of a

firm’s market price on the likelihood that it will receive a takeover bid. While it is commonly believed

that firms, which trade at a discount to fundamental value, attract acquirers, it is difficult to detect this

relation in the data, since stock prices are endogenous and incorporate the anticipation of future takeovers.

Edmans, Goldstein, and Jiang address this issue and identify a negative causal effect of prices on takeover

activity, using mutual fund redemptions caused by investor withdrawals to identify an exogenous shock to

market prices. This effect could arise from a learning channel if target shareholders learn the value of

their firm from the stock price and are willing to sell their shares at a price that is close to that – thus, the

market price is not a sideshow but affects the price that they are prepared to accept in a takeover. This

assumes that they are unable to disentangle a stock price decline caused by mutual fund redemptions from

one that is driven by information.


10
   Under the learning channel, the level of prices reveals information about an underlying state and drives a real
decision; by contrast, in the incentives channel, it is only the informativeness of prices rather than their level that is
relevant.

                                                           25
Finally, while all the papers mentioned above test the extent to which markets affect real economic

activity, an important avenue for future empirical research to explore is how feedback from prices to cash

flows affects the price formation process. The papers reviewed in Sections II, III, and IV make numerous

theoretical predictions. In a recent paper, Davis, Korenok, and Prescott (2011) provide a first step in this

direction by performing a lab experiment to test the predictions of Bond, Goldstein, and Prescott (2010)

and Sundaresan and Wang (2011). They find results broadly consistent with the theory.


Before concluding this section, it is worth revisiting the well-known study of Morck, Shleifer, and Vishny

(1990, “MSV”). MSV investigate whether stock returns (CAPM alphas) predict investment, at both an

individual firm level and at the aggregate level.11 Consistent with the learning channel laid out above (the

”active informant,” in MSV’s terminology), MSV find that stock returns are a positively significant

predictor of investment in all specifications, both economically and statistically, and that this significance

is robust to the addition of firm fundamentals (cash flow and sales) as controls. However, the increment

in R2 that results from adding stock returns, when the investment regression already contains firm

fundamentals, is low. Thus, the authors conclude that the economic significance of the market is limited

and that it is somewhat of a “sideshow”.


The published discussions by Matthew Shapiro and James Poterba, included at the end of the article,

highlight potential issues with the empirical results presented in MSV; and using a different methodology,

Barro (1990) finds that stock market changes have a strong effect on investment. Moreover, even taking

MSV’s results at face value, it is not clear that they imply that the market is a sideshow, for three main

reasons. First, the results have no implications for the incentives channel discussed in Section III. Under

this channel, the level of investment is increasing in the informativeness, rather than level, of stock prices.

Second, MSV’s empirical design cannot detect important examples of the learning channel. For example,

11
  MSV also study the effect of stock returns on financing (debt and equity issuance). This is the primary-markets
channel that is outside the scope of this survey. The results are similar to the investment regressions in MSV. For
other papers that study the real effect of financial markets through the primary markets channels, see Baker, Stein,
and Wurgler (2003), Gilchrist, Himmelberg, and Huberman (2005), Derrien and Kecskes (2011), and Grullon,
Michenaud, and Weston (2011).

                                                        26
if a firm announces a takeover, its stock price subsequently falls, and then the manager cancels the

takeover leading to a stock price recovery, the MSV approach would find no abnormal return and no

change in investment. Third, MSV’s preferred R2 measure does not capture the possibility that when

firms do learn from the prices, the improvement in efficiency is very large. Instead, the relatively small

change in R2 merely shows that, most of the time firms do not respond to abnormal stock returns over and

above their response to changes in fundamentals. However, it is possible that the times firms do respond

to price changes are particularly important – for example, if they cut investment when the return will be

disastrously low. By analogy, most of the time an airline pilot may learn nothing from his instrument

panel over and above what he can see with his eyes. Thus, in a regression analysis of pilot actions, the

increment in R2 of including instrument readings in addition to visual evidence would be small.

However, if the instrument panel occasionally enables the pilot to avoid a crash, it is very far from being a

“sideshow.” Consistent with the idea that stock price changes have a large effect, MSV’s results imply

that a one standard-deviation change in 3-year alphas is associated with 31% higher investment growth,

even after controlling for their measures of firm fundamentals, which is economically significant

compared to the mean (median) 3-year investment growth of 48% (10%) (see table 1 and regression 2.3).


    VI. Conclusion

Over the last twenty years, a sizeable literature has emerged to analyze the ways in which secondary

financial markets affect the real economy. The literature is both theoretical and empirical, and lies at the

intersection of corporate finance, asset pricing, and market microstructure. In this article we have sought

to synthesize some of the main themes and insights of the literature; although we have made every effort

to widely survey the literature, it is also inevitable that our synthesis reflects our own research on the

topic.


Overall, we make two main points. First, precisely because the question of the real effects of financial

markets combines aspects of various sub-specialties in finance, it is necessary to augment the traditional

                                                     27
notion of price efficiency – what we have termed here as forecasting price efficiency – to take into

account whether prices reveal the information necessary for real efficiency; in our terminology, does

revelatory price efficiency hold? Second, taking seriously the real effect of financial markets helps shed

light on a range of phenomena that otherwise appear puzzling. Again, this is a consequence of combining

insights from various fields: block-holding patterns, traditionally a corporate finance topic, make more

sense once asset pricing considerations are added; and trading frenzies, traditionally an asset pricing topic,

make more sense once corporate finance considerations are added.


We began the survey by drawing a distinction between research on the real effects of primary versus

secondary financial markets. Looking ahead to future research, there is potential gain from combining the

two approaches.     First, the channels of amplification studied by Bernanke and Gertler (1989) and

Kiyotaki and Moore (1997) in the context of primary financial markets are developed in models where the

need for collateral constrains borrowing but with symmetric information about collateral value, whereas

the models of secondary financial markets that we reviewed here build on asymmetric information.

Introducing asymmetric information into models of primary financial markets may enrich these models

and potentially strengthen the quantitative effects that they generate. Second, primary financial markets

and secondary financial markets are sometimes blended in real-world situations, creating room for models

that combine the two approaches. For example, consider financial institutions that hold stocks of firms

traded in the secondary market and use them as collateral when borrowing from other financial

institutions. Here, trading in secondary markets and the collateral channel in primary markets work

together to generate the overall effect of financial markets on the real economy.


Another direction for future research is to combine the feedback effect reviewed in this article into

traditional asset pricing models to explain patterns in stock returns. In a contemporaneous survey, Kogan

and Papanikolaou (2012) review a literature that attempts to explain patterns in stock returns based on

firm behavior.    This literature, however, is based on a world of symmetric information where the



                                                     28
secondary financial market is essentially a side show that has no effect on the firm. We believe it will be

interesting to introduce the feedback effect reviewed here into these models.


Finally, the literature reviewed in this article is still in its early stages. There is substantial scope for

further research to advance our understanding of the implications of the feedback loop between financial

markets and the real economy, whereby financial markets affect and reflect the events in the real

economy. As we argued in this article, this has implications for regulation of banks and firms, for

managerial behavior and corporate governance, and for many other aspects of financial economics. We

hope that our review will help stimulate this research going forward.
