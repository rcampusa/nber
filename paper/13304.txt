                                           ABSTRACT

This paper examines the pathways by which individuals transition from healthy to disabled. Because
of the high prevalence and costs associated with disability, understanding these pathways is critical
to developing interventions to prevent or minimize disability. We compare two estimates of disabling
conditions: those observed in medical claims and conditions indicated by the disabled individual.
A small number of conditions explain about half of incident disability: arthritis, infectious disease,
dementia, heart failure, diabetes, and stroke. These conditions show up in medical claims and self
reports. A large number of elderly also attribute disability to old age and various symptoms. Because
so many of the most disabling conditions do not have clear medical treatments, the outlook for major
reductions in disability might be limited.

Introduction

       While disability declined over the course of the 1980’s and 1990’s (Crimmins,

Saito et al. 1997; Freedman and Martin 1998; Waidmann and Liu 2000; Cutler 2001;

Manton and Gu 2001; Schoeni, Freedman et al. 2001; Freedman, Martin et al. 2002;

Freedman, Crimmons et al. 2004; Spillman 2004), the prevalence of disability among the

elderly remains high (Waidmann and Liu 2000; Schoeni, Freedman et al. 2001; Manton,

Gu et al. 2006). Moreover, disability is associated with poor quality of life (Lamb 1996),

high medical spending (Komisar, Hunt-McCool et al. 1997; Liu, Wall et al. 1997; Fried,

Bradley et al. 2001; Guralnik, Alecxih et al. 2002; Chernew, Goldman et al. 2005) and

increased mortality (Manton 1988; Guralnik, LaCroix et al. 1991; Ferrucci, Guralnik et

al. 1996). Thus it is critical to understand the major clinical pathways through which the

health of the elderly declines to be able to develop effective interventions to prevent or

minimize disability in the elderly population.

       In this paper, we analyze data from the National Long Term Care Survey

(NLTCS), a longitudinal survey on a nationally representative sample of Medicare

beneficiaries that has been linked to Medicare administrative data, to identify the major

pathways through which the elderly become disabled. We compare two methods of

identifying disabling conditions. First, using administrative billing data, we evaluate 31

potentially disabling clinical conditions and estimate the proportion of incident disability

attributable to each condition. In order to better understand the association between

medical conditions and disability we consider both simple binary measure of any

disability in addition to measures that reflect severity (i.e. the total number of ADL and

IADL disabilities) and types of limitations (i.e. mobility-related, cognitive or self-care).




                                              3
We also examine the relationship between medical conditions and the use of supportive

and medical services. We hypothesize that different medical conditions lead to disability

of varying severity and type and need for assistance. Identifying these differences may

help to prioritize medical conditions for interventions to prevent or delay disability and to

help design appropriate interventions for different types of disability.

       In the second part of the paper, we compare these empirical results to

respondents’ self reported causes. We find that an important subset of newly disabled

elderly did not report a chronic condition or an acute medical event when asked to

identify the cause of their disability; rather, they cited symptoms or simply attributed

their disability to old age. We explore whether respondents who attributed their disability

to old age or symptoms differed from respondents who cited chronic or acute medical

conditions in both patterns of disablement and health care utilization to better understand

whether old age and symptom causes represent pathways to disability independent of

diseases and conditions.

       Our paper is structured as follows. First we discuss prior literature relevant to our

analyses. We then describe our data and analytic methods and present our results.

Finally we summarize our conclusions and discuss implications of our findings.



Background:



Heterogeneity in the Disablement Process




                                              4
           Disability in an elderly, non-working population is typically defined as the need

for assistance1 with one or more or self care tasks, such as bathing or eating, called

activities of daily living (ADLs), or tasks required to live independently, such as grocery

shopping or preparing meals, called instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs).

National surveys measuring disability in the elderly typically ask respondents about their

ability to perform a set of ADL and IADL tasks, and often also ask respondents about

physical limitations, such as difficulty walking long distances, going up stairs or grasping

small objects.

           Previous research has demonstrated that disability may develop as the result of a

catastrophic event such as a stroke or a hip fracture, or as a progressive process

associated with chronic and sometimes degenerative conditions such as arthritis or

dementia (Ferrucci, Guralnik et al. 1996; Ferrucci, Guralnik et al. 1997; Wolff, Boult et

al. 2005). Depending on the cause of disability, many elderly may recover from

disability (Gill, Robison et al. 1997; Gill, Allore et al. 2006; Gill, Gahbauer et al. 2006)

or they may progress to more severe states of disability. Among those who do not recover

from disability, both theoretical and empirical work (Katz, Ford et al. 1963; Kempen and

Suurmeijer 1990; Verbrugge and Jette 1994; Ferrucci, Guralnik et al. 1998) has suggested

a hierarchy in physical limitations, and ADL and IADL tasks where an elderly person

typically progresses from first having physical limitations to needing assistance with

complex tasks (such as cooking, grocery shopping or managing money), progressing to

needing assistance with some personal care needs such as getting out of bed and bathing,

and then finally needing assistance with the most basic personal tasks such as toileting

and feeding. However, there is disagreement across studies about the exact nature of the

1
    Some surveys ask respondents about the level of difficulty without assistance.

                                                       5
disablement process (Siu, D.B. et al. 1990; Lazaridis, Rudberg et al. 1994; Dunlop,

Hughes et al. 1997; Jagger, Arthur et al. 2001), which may be attributable to differing

patterns of onset (i.e. catastrophic versus progressive) and likelihood of recovery.

       Researchers have also demonstrated that disability, regardless of its cause, may be

characterized as a continuum of difficulty and dependency (Fried, Herdman et al. 1991;

Fried, Bandeen-Roche et al. 1996; Gill, Robinson et al. 1998; Fried, Bandeen-Roche et

al. 2000; Fried, Young et al. 2001). For example, Gill et al. (1998) examined the

relationship between difficulty and dependence in specific tasks and demonstrated that

separate questions about the use of assistance and difficulty could be used to classify

respondents into 3 ordered categories: independent without difficulty, independent with

difficulty, and dependent. Similarly the work by Fried et al. (2000, 2001) identified a

state of pre-clinical disability where respondents denied difficulty with a task, but

nevertheless reported having modified their performance of the task because of health of

physical problems. Respondents with pre-clinical disability were found to have

intermediate levels of physical functioning between that of respondents who reported

difficulty with tasks and those who reported neither difficulty nor modification,

suggesting that modification without reported difficulty represents early manifestations of

functional declines and a less severe form of disability.

       Other empirical studies have conducted factor analyses to identify the number and

types of underlying dimensions of disability (Fried, Ettinger et al. 1994; Spector and

Fleishman 1998). For example, Spector and Fleishman (1998) found a great deal of

correlation among 7 ADL and 9 IADL measures in approximately 3000 disabled

respondents to the 1989 National Long Term Care Survey, so that a single factor that




                                              6
combined 15 of the 16 items adequately described the observed patterns. Fried et al

(1994) examined 17 physical limitations, ADL and IADL items in 5,201 community-

based elderly adults living in one of four US communities; they found that self-reported

difficulty with these 17 items could be partitioned into 4 factors representing mobility

problems, difficulty with complex tasks, difficulty with self-care and upper extremity

limitations. These four factors explained 48% of the total variance in the 17 items.

Researchers have also used Grade of Membership models, an extension of latent class

models that hypothesize different underlying types of respondents with different patterns

of disability, to examine profiles of disability (Lamb 1996; Manton, Stallard et al. 1998).

       Prior research has also documented specificity in the associations between

conditions and specific types of limitations. Arthritis has generally been found to be

strongly associated with functional limitations and moderate ADL limitations

(Verbrugge, Lepkowski et al. 1991; Fried, Ettinger et al. 1994; Guccione, Felson et al.

1994; Manton, Stallard et al. 1998) while stroke and dementia have been consistently

linked with both IADL limitations and more severe disability in self-care tasks (Fried,

Ettinger et al. 1994; Guccione, Felson et al. 1994; Manton, Stallard et al. 1998). Similar

patterns are found in respondents self-reports of the causes of their limitations (Ford,

Folmar et al. 1988; Ettinger, Fried et al. 1994; Valderrama-Gama, Damian et al. 2002).

Arthritis was most often cited as the cause of limitations in mobility related tasks,

including getting out of bed and getting around inside; heart and lung diseases were the

most often cited causes for aerobic tasks, such as walking half a mile, while stroke and

dementia were most often associated with cognitive and self care tasks.




                                              7
       In this paper, we evaluate the association of specific diseases and conditions with

varying types and severity of disability to better understand the association between

medical conditions and the disablement process. We also use the total number of

limitations as a proxy for severity of disability, and evaluate whether severity varies

across conditions. We further examine reported medical care and assistive services used

by disabled respondents, hypothesizing that greater use of medical care and assistive

services may reflect more severe disability.

Chronic Conditions Leading to Disability

       A large body of research has demonstrated the importance of chronic disease as

the primary contributor to disability (Kosorok, Omenn et al. 1992; Guccione, Felson et al.

1994; Boult, Altmann et al. 1996; Ferrucci, Guralnik et al. 1997; Aguero-Torres,

Fratiglioni et al. 1998; Dunlop, Manheim et al. 2002; Wolff, Boult et al. 2005; Song J,

Chang RW et al. 2006). However, these studies often limit attention to the non-

institutionalized elderly population, thus omitting important conditions such as dementia,

or focus on a small number of conditions. Further, studies were often conducted on non-

representative samples. In this paper, we extend these prior results by examining the

share of disability attributable to a wide range of clinical conditions in a nationally

representative sample.

Characteristics of Disabled Respondents Attributing Disability to Symptoms or Old age

       The prior literature provides conflicting evidence on whether chronic disease is

responsible for the majority of disability attributed to “old age” or symptoms by elderly

respondents, or whether these respondents are identifying a pathway to disability that is

largely independent of chronic disease. Research supporting the idea that the elderly may




                                               8
attribute declines in health related to chronic conditions to old age or symptoms include a

study of 230 community dwelling elderly that found that those who attributed their

disability to old age were similar to those not reporting old age as the cause of their

disability in terms of age, gender and race, but were more likely to have chronic

conditions, such as arthritis, heart disease or hearing difficulties (Williamson and Fried

1996). In addition, several regional studies (Ettinger, Fried et al. 1994; Williamson and

Fried 1996; Leveille, Fried et al. 2002; Leveille, Fried et al. 2004) demonstrated strong

relationships between specific diseases and symptoms. For example, elderly who cited

pain as a primary cause of their disability were also likely to cite arthritis when asked for

a condition cause, and they had a high prevalence of arthritis confirmed by clinical

examination; disability attributed to fatigue and shortness of breath was associated with

lung and heart disease.

        In contrast, Leveille et al. (2002) found that women who were unable to cite

specific chronic conditions causing their disability were often better able to name

symptom causes. They also found little association between certain symptoms, such as

fear of falling and general weakness, and chronic conditions, suggesting that at least

some of the disability attributed to symptoms or old age is not directly related to common

disabling chronic conditions. The literature on frailty generally supports the notion of a

pathway to disability that is not a direct result of chronic disease, but instead is associated

with age-related loss of physical condition and reserve. For example, Guralnik et al.

(1995) found that objective measures of physical functioning among non-disabled elderly

predicted subsequent disability even after controlling for chronic conditions (Guralnik,

Ferrucci et al. 1995). Other authors have argued for the importance of frailty as a




                                              9
separate concept from comorbidity and have found that frailty is associated with

disability independently of chronic disease (Ferrucci, Guralnik et al. 1996; Lunney, Lynn

et al. 2003; Fried, Ferrucci et al. 2004).

             In this paper, we seek to resolve some of this conflict by further analyzing the

characteristics of respondents who attribute disability to either old age or symptom causes

as opposed to chronic or acute medical conditions. In particular, we compare severity of

disability and use of medical and assistive services to identify systematic differences

across these populations that may suggest a pathway to disability independent of diseases

and conditions.



Data and Methods

            We used data from the National Long Term Care Survey. The NLTCS is a

longitudinal, nationally representative survey of the Medicare population that was

designed to study changes in the health and functional status of elderly Americans.

Starting in 1982, a random sample of approximately 20,000 Medicare beneficiaries

completed a screening interview. Those found to have a chronic disability2 were then

asked to complete a detailed survey. Follow-up surveys were conducted in 1984, 1989,

1994 and 1999. Chronically disabled respondents who survived until the next survey

    Defined as residence in a long term care facility, the inability to perform one of 9 ADLs (eating, getting in

or out of bed, getting in or out of chairs, walking around inside, going outside, dressing, bathing, getting to

the bathroom or using the toilet, controlling bowel movements or urination) without personal assistance or

special equipment or one of 7 IADLs (preparing meals, laundry, light housework, shop for groceries,

manage money, take medicines, use the telephone) without help because of disability or health problem for

at least 90 days.



                                                         10
were automatically contacted for detailed follow-up surveys. In addition, at each

subsequent wave of the survey, a sub-sample of non-disabled respondents from the

previous wave were contacted for a new screener interview and those found to be

chronically disabled were asked to complete the detailed survey. Finally, at each wave a

random sample of approximately 5,000 Medicare beneficiaries who reached age 65

between waves of the survey were screened in order to maintain a nationally

representative sample of the Medicare population. Over the 5 waves of the survey more

than 90,000 screening interviews were performed, leading to over 32,000 detailed

interviews (Manton and Gu 2001). Approximately 20% of 1994 and 1999 surveys were

completed by proxy respondents (Freedman, Crimmons et al. 2004).

        The NLTCS has several important strengths. First, the longitudinal design with

age-in cohorts allows us to obtain national estimates. Second, response rates for both

screener interviews and detailed surveys were over 95% in each wave. In addition,

survey data has been linked to Medicare administrative data, providing detailed

information on the existence of clinical conditions for which respondents were receiving

care.

Study Cohorts:

        Our analyses are based on non-disabled respondents from the 1994 survey whose

disability and vital status is known in 1999. From the cohort of 12,366 participants in the

1994 survey who were not chronically disabled, we excluded a) 1,568 participants who

were not 65 years old on January 1, 1992, in order to assure complete claims data in the

baseline period prior to 1994, b) 10 participants who could not be matched to Medicare

data, c) 1,231 respondents whose disability status was unknown in 1999 because they




                                            11
were not re-sampled (n=752) or lost to follow-up (n=479), and d) 1,830 participants

enrolled in an HMO for 6 months or longer, leaving an analytic cohort of 7,727

participants.

Disability Measures:

           Subjects were considered newly disabled if they reported any ADL or IADL

limitations in the 1999 detailed survey3 or if they were institutionalized at the time of the

1999 survey. Limitations on 6 specific ADL tasks (eating, getting in and out of bed,

getting around inside, dressing, bathing, toileting) were obtained from the detailed

interviews of both community based and institutionalized respondents. Limitations on 8

specific IADL tasks (light housework, laundry, preparing meals, shopping for groceries,

getting around outside, managing money, taking medications, using the telephone) and 9

functional limitations (difficulty climbing a flight of stairs, walking across a room,

bending to put on socks, lifting a 10-lb object, reaching above the head, using fingers to

grasp and handle small objects, seeing well enough to read newsprint, speaking, and

hearing) were also obtained from the detailed interviews with community-based

respondents.

           We grouped the 14 individual ADL and IADL tasks into categories for several

analyses. To explore the empirical relationships among the specific tasks, we fit a

principal component model to the 5,787 non-disabled respondents in the 1994 NLTCS

who survived to 1999 and completed a screener interview. We found that 3 factors could

3
    Respondents were classified as disabled on an ADL task if they reported that someone helped them

perform the task, if someone stayed nearby in case they needed help, or if they used special equipment to

perform the task. Respondents were classified as disabled on an IADL task if they report that they cannot

do the task because of disability or health problem.


                                                       12
explain 85% of the total variance in the 14 items. Similar to Fried et al. (1994), one of

these factors was strongly associated with more complex IADL tasks requiring cognitive

abilities (cooking, laundry, light housekeeping, grocery shopping, managing money and

using the telephone). Also as in the Fried et al. analysis, difficulty getting around outside

(typically considered an IADL) was more strongly related to mobility-related ADL tasks

than the other IADL tasks. Thus, we used the aggregation of tasks employed by Fried et

al (1994) to summarize our 14 ADL and IADL measures into three major types of

disability: 1) mobility disability (getting out of bed, walking inside, walking outside the

home), 2) disability in complex tasks (cooking, laundry, light housework, grocery

shopping, managing money and using the telephone) and 3) disability in self-care tasks

(eating, dressing, toileting and bathing). Following theoretical and empirical work

suggesting hierarchies in the disablement process, we consider disability in basic self-

care tasks to represent the most severe type of disability and mobility disability to

represent early manifestations of loss of functional abilities.

       Detailed interviews of the community-based disabled also asked respondents to

report the heath conditions they believed were the cause of their disability. Respondents

were able to list up to 10 conditions, and eighty-nine percent of the community-based

respondents (n-892) provided at least one response. We developed a coding scheme that

summarized free text responses into: a) chronic conditions b) acute events c) physical

symptoms that were not directly linked to clinical condition (such as weakness, lack of

balance, or pain) or d) old age. These categories were not mutually exclusive, as

respondents often reported multiple causes. We also coded a set of binary indicators of

specific chronic conditions and acute events, and modified a recently validated taxonomy




                                              13
of self-reported symptom causes to classify symptom causes as pain, balance, weakness,

endurance or other symptom.(Leveille, Fried et al. 2004) Both authors independently

coded the free-text responses. Agreement was high, with kappas ranging from 0.7 to 1.0

for chronic and acute conditions. Agreement was slightly lower for symptom causes

(ranging from 0.3 for upper extremity pain to 1.0 for hearing). Final coding was based on

consensus when there was disagreement.

Other Variables:

           Mortality and information about the existence of 31 chronic conditions4 were

obtained from Medicare administrative data. We examined the prevalence of chronic

conditions over two time frames. Participants were coded as having the clinical condition

at baseline if there was at least one inpatient claim or 2 non-hospital claims (outpatient,

home health, SNF or hospice) with a primary or secondary diagnosis of interest between

January 1, 1992 and December 31, 19945. Similarly, participants were coded as

4
    These mutually exclusive categories were previously defined on the basis of prevalence of ICD-9

diagnosis and their observed relationship with disability (McClellan, M. and L. Yan (2000). Understanding

disability trends in the U.S. elderly population: The role of disease management and disease prevention.

Chicago Press: 161-184. See Table A1 in the Appendix for list of clinical conditions and associated ICD-9

codes.

    We examined several alternative coding schemes for clinical conditions. First we considered rules that

considered a respondent to have the condition if there were any claims for the condition (inpatient,

outpatient, SNF, home health or hospice). In addition, we examined a two-year window (Jan 1 1993-Dec

31 1994) for conditions existing prior to baseline. Based on examination of the prevalence of conditions,

the persistence of conditions across time frames and the association with self-reported conditions, in



                                                      14
developing the condition between surveys if they had at least one inpatient claim or 2

non-hospital claims with a primary or secondary diagnosis of interest between January 1,

1995 and December 31, 1999. We then combined these two timeframes and examined

the impact of having the condition either at baseline or developing the condition between

the surveys on the likelihood of developing disability6.

           Demographic variables (age, gender, race and marital status) were obtained from

the screener surveys. Detailed interviews with community-based disabled respondents

provided information on the use of health care and assistive services, including any

nursing home stays, hospitalizations in the past year, visits in the past month to the

emergency room, physicians, and physical, occupational, speech or hearing therapists, as

well as home health services in the past month, and the number of prescription

medications obtained in the previous month. The detailed survey also asked respondents

about their living arrangements, including whether they were living in an assistive living

setting with board and/or personal care services available.

Analyses:



addition to an examination of prior literature, we determined that a 3 year look-back for the baseline period

and the requirement of at least 2 non-inpatient diagnoses provided the best compromise between sensitivity

and specificity for a majority of the conditions.
6
    We included conditions developed between the surveys in order to study conditions such as dementia that

may be disabling over a short time frame. The associations between conditions and disability should be

interpreted cautiously as we do not know when the participant became disabled and thus some of the new

conditions may follow or even be a result of declining functional status (for example, a fracture may be the

result of weakness and/or loss of balance). However, for a majority of these conditions, the more likely

scenario is that the condition led to functional limitations and resulting disability.



                                                       15
Empirical Pathways to Disability

       We fit multinomial regression models to estimate the relative importance of the

31 clinical factors in explaining any disability and differing types of disability. We fit

four separate models for any disability, mobility disability, disability in complex tasks

and disability in self-care tasks. In each case, the dependent variable was a categorical

variable with three levels: disabled in at least one specific task in the group, alive and not

disabled in at least one task in the group, or died before the 1999 survey. All regression

models included age (in 5 year categories), gender, marital status in 1994, race (coded as

white, black or other), the set of 31 indicators variables for each of the clinical conditions

and a binary variable equal to 1 if the respondent did not have any medical claims during

the study period. In addition, we examined interaction terms to understand the extent to

which combinations of diseases have synergistic effects on disability. To focus the

exploration of interactive effects, we included all pair-wise interactions of conditions that

were each estimated to cause at least 5% of incident of any type disability as measured by

the adjusted attributable fraction.

       We used results from the multinomial regression models to compute adjusted

attributable fractions (Greenland and Drescher 1993). Attributable fractions estimate the

importance of the condition from a population perspective by combining the prevalence

of the factor with the strength of the association between the factor and future disability

status. Specifically, for each condition we estimated the reduction in each type of

disability that could be achieved by preventing the condition as the average predicted

probability of becoming disabled if none of the participants had the condition, holding all

other covariates at their observed values. A few clinical conditions were found to be




                                              16
protective for mortality, disability, or both. As these effects are likely markers for either

improved access to treatments or relative health that allows for treatment of milder

chronic conditions (Jencks, Williams et al. 1988; Iezzoni, Foley et al. 1992), we did not

estimate attributable fractions for conditions that were protective of both disability and

death. In cases where a condition was estimated to be protective for death but positively

associated with disability, we computed attributable fractions for disability by setting all

negative mortality coefficients equal to zero and rescaling the intercept terms to match

observed overall proportions in our data.

Characteristics of pathways

       We examined how the empirical pathways differed in terms number of limitations

and use of medical and assistive services to understand whether various pathways are

associated with more intensive medical and social service needs. We focused on the

conditions that were each responsible for at least 5% of incident disability. Note these

groups are not mutually exclusive, and in fact, there is a great deal of co-occurrence of

disabling diseases in this population. In these descriptive analyses, for each of the major

pathways, we compared disabled respondents with the condition to those without

evidence of the condition in their medical claims.

Self-reported causes of disability

       Our second set of analyses describes self-reported causes of disability in the

newly disabled community-dwelling cohort (institutionalized respondents were not asked

to report the cause of their disability). We also examined the distribution of the number

of functional limitations and limitations in IADL and ADL tasks and described reported

use of medical and assistive services. In all analyses, we compared newly disabled




                                             17
community dwelling respondents reporting old age or symptom causes to those who

reported only medical conditions as the cause of their disability.

       Analytic weights that account for complex sampling scheme were used in all

analyses to provide estimates that reflect the national population of non-disabled

Medicare beneficiaries aged 67 and older in 1994. Specifically, cross-sectional weights

that accounted for complex sampling scheme and non-response to the 1994 survey were

augmented to account for sub-sampling of healthy respondents for a screener interview in

1999, non-response to the 1999 screener interview, and exclusion of patients enrolled in

an HMO by redistributing weights for healthy respondents in 1994 who were excluded

from our analyses to the respondents in our sample within cells defined by age and sex.

Statistical tests and standard errors were also corrected for the complex survey design

using approximations based on Taylor-series linearizations.



Results

Empirical Pathways to Disability


       Sixty-six percent of non-disabled respondents in 1994 survived and remained

non-disabled to 1999, while 15.1% became disabled over the 5 year period and 18.9%

died between survey waves.     Twelve, ten, and eleven percent of non-disabled

respondents to the 1994 survey developed one or more mobility-related, complex task or

self-care disabilities respectively between survey waves. Death and incident cases of

disability were more common among older, African American, and unmarried

respondents (Table 1). Females were more likely to become disabled but less likely to

have died compared to males. Hip and pelvic fractures, dementia, Parkinson’s and



                                             18
related diseases, depression, and stroke had the strongest association with new cases of

disability. Most disabling conditions were also associated with death.

        Regression models with main effects for the 31 conditions identified six clinical

conditions – arthritis, infectious disease, dementia, heart failure, diabetes and stroke –

that contributed to at least 5% of new cases of disability. Only 17% of elderly

respondents did not have one of these six conditions and a majority (54%) had two or

more.

        Our final regression models included 15 pairwise interactions between the 6

largest contributors to overall disability. Regression results are presented in Table 2.

Several interactions were found to be important in these analyses. For any disability, the

interaction between diabetes and arthritis was positive, suggesting that these two

conditions have synergistic effects such that having both conditions was more disabling

than would be expected by the effects of each individual condition. In contrast, two

interactions with dementia were negative (stroke*dementia and heart failure*dementia),

suggesting that in the presence of a highly disabling condition like dementia, other

conditions have effects that are dampened relative to what would be expected when the

disease occurs in isolation. These general patterns were found in the analysis of each type

of disability, although the strength of the interactions (and their statistical significance)

varied some across the three types. In addition, several new interactions were important

for disability in complex tasks. In particular, stroke exacerbated the effects of both

diabetes and heart failure in disability in complex tasks.

        Dementia in the absence of heart failure, stroke, arthritis, infectious disease or

diabetes had the strongest association with new disability of all types in multinomial




                                              19
regression models (OR for any disability relative to remaining alive and health=8.0; 95%

CI=[4.6,13.8]). Other conditions with strong relationships with incident disability

included Parkinson’s and related disorders (OR for any disability =2.3 [1.8,3.0]), hip and

pelvic fractures (OR for any disability =2.1 [1.6,2.9]), colorectal and lung cancer (OR for

any disability =1.9 [1.4,2.4]), acute renal failure (OR for any disability =1.7 [1.1,2.7])

and heart failure in the absence of stroke, arthritis, infectious disease, diabetes or

dementia (OR for any disability =1.6 [1.1,2.4]). While many conditions were strongly

related to all three types of disability, the strength of the association varied for many of

these conditions. For example, infectious disease, heart failure and arthritis had the

strongest relationship with complex task disability, while hip and pelvic fractions were

strongly associated with mobility and self-care disability.

       In adjusted models, divorced, separated or never married respondents and females

were more likely to become disabled. Race was not significantly associated with future

status after controlling for the other factors. We found some differences in the effect of

demographic characteristics on disability. In particular, women were more likely than

men to report new disabilities in mobility and self-care tasks but not with complex tasks.

       Age, even after adjusting for a set of 31 clinical conditions and interactions

among the top six contributors, was strongly associated with disability. For example, the

adjusted odds of becoming disabled relative to remaining alive and non-disabled was 3.7

(95% CI=[2.7,5.1]) times higher for 80-84 year olds compared to 67-70 year olds. This

represents a 23% decline in the effect of age relative to a model that controlled only for

demographic factors.

Largest Contributors to Disability




                                              20
       Figures 1-4 display adjusted attributable fractions for each type of disability based

on regression results. Attributable fractions, a combination of the prevalence of the

conditions and their association with disability, estimate the proportion of disability that

was explained by each condition, holding all other characteristics of the respondents

constant. Although arthritis was only moderately associated with incident disability (OR

for any new disability=1.5 [1.1,2.1]), because it is common condition it was the largest

contributor, accounting for 13% of any new disability. Five other conditions --

infectious diseases, dementia, heart failure and arrhythmia, diabetes and stroke –

contributed to at least 5 percent of new cases of disability and these six top conditions

together explained almost half (48%) of new cases.

       We observed some heterogeneity in these pathways across the different types of

disability (Figures 2-4). Arthritis was the largest contributor to impairments in mobility

(explaining 17% of this type of disability), but played a much less prominent role in

disability in complex tasks. Similarly, stroke contributed most to less severe forms of

disability and explained only 4% of disability associated with self-care tasks. Dementia

was a large contributor to overall disability, was responsible for almost a quarter of

disability in completing complex tasks and was also the largest contributor to the most

severe form of disability, dependence in self-care tasks. Ischemic heart disease, which

was not found to be a prominent contributor to overall disability, explained more than

one in 20 cases of new disability in self-care tasks. Not all diseases, however,

demonstrated such specificity. For example, heart failure and infectious disease played a

prominent role in all three types of disability, each explaining between 10 and 15% of

each type of disability.




                                             21
Characteristics of pathways

       Almost all (96%) of newly disabled respondents had at least one of the top six

conditions leading to disability – dementia, stroke, heart failure, infectious diseases,

arthritis, or diabetes. Moreover there was substantial overlap among the six pathways:

only 12% of the newly disabled cohort had only one of the six conditions and two thirds

had three or more.

       Figure 5 displays the average number of functional limitation, IADL limitations,

and ADL limitations in newly disabled respondents according to diagnoses in their

medical claims (Table A2 in the appendix provides information on specific limitations).

The newly disabled cohort had a large number of each type of limitation. Physical

limitations in particular were quite prevalent with community-dwelling respondents

reporting 3.3 limitations on average. Even the most severe forms of disability, inability

to perform ADL tasks, were prevalent, with respondents reporting on average 2.6 ADL

limitations. Newly disabled respondents with dementia reported the largest number of

limitations of each type, including more than 4 IADLs on average. Newly disabled

respondents with each of the top six conditions were more likely to report functional

limitations compared to those not reporting the condition and most of the conditions

(dementia, stroke, heart failure and infectious diseases) were associated with higher

number of limitations of each type. However, neither arthritis nor diabetes was

associated with higher numbers of IADL limitations and diabetes was not associated with

a higher number of ADL limitations.

       We present self-reported utilization of health care and assistive services in Table

3. Approximately 20% of the newly disabled cohort was institutionalized, of those living




                                             22
in the community 12% reported past nursing home stays; however, only a small number

reported living in assistive living facilities Institutionalization and nursing home stays

were most likely among newly disabled respondents with dementia, stroke, heart failure

or infectious diseases. Those with dementia were also most likely to receive supportive

services, including physical and occupational therapy and home health services. In

addition, health care use was high among this cohort. Approximately half of newly

disabled respondents reported a physician visit in the prior month, over a third reported a

hospitalization in the prior year, and they reported filling an average of 4 prescriptions in

the past month. Health care utilization was highest among respondents with stroke, heart

failure and diabetes, and lowest among respondents with dementia and arthritis.

Self-reported causes of disability

       Over half of the newly disabled community-dwelling respondents reported a

chronic condition was a factor in their limitations, while 30% reported an acute event

(Table 4). Musculoskeletal problems and cardiovascular diseases were the most common

reported cause of disability. Dementia, lung diseases, diabetes, eye diseases, surgeries,

fractures and falls were also commonly cited causes of disability. While a majority of

respondents reported chronic or acute medical conditions as the cause of their disability,

30% reported symptoms that were not directly linked to a chronic or acute health

problem, and 14% of respondents reported that old age contributed to their disability.

       Respondents often cited multiple causes and those citing symptoms and old age

often cited specific acute and chronic conditions as well. We report conditions cited by

these respondents in Table 5. Among respondents reporting symptoms, 44% and 21%

reported at least 1 chronic or acute condition, respectively, while the remaining 41%




                                             23
reported only symptoms. Heart disease was the most frequently reported condition

among those citing symptom causes. Only 8% of those reporting symptom causes also

cited old age as a contributor. Old age was the only reported cause for forty-six percent

of respondents attributing their disability to old age. About a third of respondents citing

old age as a cause of their disability also cited a chronic condition and 13% cited acute

causes. Arthritis was the most commonly cited condition among those attributing

disability to old age.

        Table 6 reports characteristics of newly disabled respondents according to self-

reported cause of disability. Respondents citing old age were more likely to be female,

African American and widowed at the time of the 1999 survey and were approximately 4

years older (80.2 versus 75.8 years old) than those citing only medical causes. However,

they were no more likely to have any of most disabling clinical conditions, and in fact

were less likely to have diagnoses of arthritis, diabetes, Parkinson’s and related diseases

and respiratory diseases compared to respondents who did not cite old age as a cause of

their disability. Respondents reporting symptoms were also often less likely to have

disabling conditions compared to those reporting chronic condition or acute event.

However, patients reporting pain/discomfort or weakness as a cause of their disability

were more likely to have evidence of arthritis. Respondents citing weakness were more

likely to be female. However, the sample sizes were small in several of these categories

making precise inference difficult.

Types and Severity of Limitations

        We report the number of functional limitations, IADL limitations and ADL

limitations according to self-reported cause of disability in Figure 6 (Table A3 in the




                                             24
appendix provides information on specific limitations). Newly disabled respondents

reporting only chronic or acute conditions reported more functional limitations than

respondents who reported old age, and significantly more ADLs and IADLs then

respondents who reported symptoms.

Medical and Assistive Services

         We present self-reported utilization of health care and assistive services in Table

7. Past nursing home stays were highest among those who reported clinical causes and

lowest among those citing symptoms. Respondents citing symptom causes were also less

likely to report use of physical or occupational therapy services. Consistent with the

observation that respondents citing old age or symptoms were less likely to have

evidence of clinical conditions in their medical claims, these respondents have lower

levels of health care utilization (physician visits, medications, and hospitalizations).

However, health care use was high in all groups. Forty percent of respondents citing old

age reporting a physician visit in the past month and a quarter reported being hospitalized

in the previous year, suggesting sufficient contact with the health care system to receive

care for chronic conditions.

         Discussion

         Analyzing 31 clinical conditions, we estimated that arthritis, dementia, infectious

diseases, heart failure, diabetes and stroke each explained at least 5% of incident

disability. These top 6 conditions together explained almost half of new disability

(48%).    Consistent with these findings, arthritis, stroke, dementia and heart disease were

the conditions most often mentioned among respondents who reported an acute or

chronic condition as a cause of their limitation.




                                              25
       We also found that newly disabled respondents with these six conditions typically

experience problems in multiple categories of functional limitations, ADL and IADL

tasks. Elderly patients with any of these six conditions were also more likely to have

been hospitalized in the past year and had a greater average number of prescription drugs

in the past month compared to the average newly disabled patient. However, there were

differences across these pathways in the types of disability experienced and in the use of

services. For example, dementia represents the pathway most strongly associated with the

most severe types of disability and the largest number of reported limitations. Newly

disabled respondents with dementia were also the heaviest users of supportive services,

including nursing home residence. In contrast, arthritis, while being the largest

contributor to overall disability, was associated most strongly with mobility limitations

and newly disabled respondents with arthritis used relatively few supportive and medical

services.

       Our comparison of newly disabled respondents who attributed their disability to

old age or symptoms to those citing chronic or acute medical conditions also

demonstrated important differences. First, we found that those who reported age as a

cause of their disability had similar or lower levels of disabling conditions compared to

those who reported a clinical condition. In addition, newly disabled respondents

attributing disability to symptom causes or old age tended to have less severe disability

and use fewer supportive services. While those citing old-age had lower use of health

care, there were sufficient interactions with clinicians (42% report visit with a physician

in prior month) to have had chronic disease diagnosed. These results suggest those

reporting old age or symptoms represent a different “pathway”, i.e. frailty or “pre-




                                             26
clinical” disease that leads to their disability. The importance of infectious diseases in

our empirical models also suggests a role for heightened vulnerability in the elderly as

past diagnoses of infectious diseases may be a marker for frailty.

       We found that self-reported causes and empirical analyses of claims-based

measures provided complimentary information. Claims-based diagnoses were available

on all respondents and empirical models allowed us to estimate the fraction of disability

attributable to each condition independently of the other conditions. However, binary

measures of diagnoses from medical claims may not adequately capture disease severity.

In addition, claims-based analyses did not capture most visual and hearing impairments,

which have been shown to be important correlates of disability here and in other studies

(Kosorok, Omenn et al. 1992; Dunlop, Manheim et al. 2002). Analyses based on self-

reported causes, which were only collected from community-based respondents, may

underestimate the effect of highly disabling conditions like dementia. Given the differing

strengths and weaknesses of clinical data and self-reports, future attempts to measure

causes of disability should combine the two approaches.

       These analyses have important implications. First, an understanding of the major

contributors to disability in the late 1990’s, provides insight into potential future trends in

the health of the elderly. We found that conditions without effective medical treatments

– in particular dementia – were major contributors to disability in older persons.

Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia are highly disabling progressive diseases with

few effective interventions to slow their progression,(Cummings and Cole 2002) Until

effective treatments are found, dementia-related disability is likely to increase in

importance. In contrast, many conditions, in particular stroke, heart disease and arthritis,




                                              27
are amenable to both medical and lifestyle interventions, suggesting that increased use of

effective medical therapies and control of risk factors could lead to continued

improvement in the health of the elderly.(Manton 1989; Boult, Altmann et al. 1996;

Singer and Manton 1998) However, obesity rates continue to rise and obesity is a risk

factor for four of the six most important pathways in our analysis (arthritis, heart failure,

stroke and diabetes). The increase in obesity rates in the elderly and non-elderly

population, coupled with increases in disability rates in younger populations, have led

others to suggest that disability rates in older persons will increase in the

future.(Lakdawalla, Bhattacharya et al. 2004; Leveille, Wee et al. 2005) Moreover, a

recent study found that obesity contributed to an increasing number of cases of arthritis

between 1971 and 2002.(Leveille, Wee et al. 2005)

       Second, our results suggest potential avenues for medical and other interventions

to alleviate dependence in the elderly. We found that various diseases and conditions are

specific to different types of disability. This suggests that interventions to prevent or

reduce disability may be targeted to different types of tasks, depending on the medical

condition experienced by the patient. Interventions likely need to be targeted to multiple

ADL and IADL tasks within a category of disability, as the six diseases and conditions

were associated with limitations in multiple tasks.

       In addition, medical care and assistive service utilization varied across conditions,

suggesting that there may be variation in opportunities to intervene through medical and

non-medical services. For example, while respondents with dementia had relatively low

rates of hospitalizations and physician visits, almost half were institutionalized and 20%

were using home health services. Until effective medical interventions are available for




                                              28
dementia patients, current interventions may be best targeted through supportive care

services and within their living environment. In contrast, newly disabled respondents

with arthritis were relatively infrequent users of intensive inpatient or nursing home care,

but had higher than average use of medications and physician visits, suggesting that

interventions for disability assessment and prevention services among these patients may

be most effectively conducted by physicians. For all diseases and conditions studied,

improved medical care in the future may help to reduce disability.

       Our analyses of newly disabled respondents attributing their disability to old age

or symptoms suggest a greater focus on physician-based assessment of preclinical disease

and treatment of symptoms in order to prevent disability. The large number of disabled

respondents in the community who cited old age as a cause of disability may also imply

that elderly respondents have low expectations for interventions, either medical or

otherwise, to help them function independently. Physician-based interventions may help

to educate patients about expectations for functioning and additional medical care

treatments and interventions to minimize disability.

       In conclusion, we identified 6 major clinical pathways to disability that account

for almost half incident disability, but differ in the types of disability experienced and use

of medical and assistive services. These results have important implications for future

trends in the health of the elderly population, highlighting substantial challenges to

continued improvement in disability.
