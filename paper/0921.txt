           International Interest-Rate and Price-Level Linkages under
              Flexible Exchange Rates: A Review of Recent Evidence


                                    Abstract


     In an open economy, the scope for activist stabilization policy depends

on the nature of the linkages between domestic and international markets for

goods and assets. Two important relationships--purchasing power parity and

uncovered interest-rate parity- -have received extensive empirical attention

in recent years and are fundamental building blocks of several empirical ex-

change rate models. This paper reviews and extends recent econometric findings

on these two classical parity relationships and on their corollary, the

international equality of expected real interest rates.

     Econometric tests assuming rationality of expectations are on the whole

unfavorable to the classical parity relationships: with few exceptions, they

are strongly rejected. A central theme in the review of empirical work is

the conditional heteroskedasticity of inflation and exchange rate forecast

errors and the bias this statistical problem may impart to tests of inter-

national parity relationships. The paper proposes and implements a test for

conditional heteroskedasticity which in many cases produces strong evidence

that the problem is indeed important.

Introducti on




      International linkages between goods and asset markets are the key

factors in exchange rate determination. The scope for activist stabiliza-

tion policy depends on both the nature of the equilibrium implied by these

linkages and the speed with which equilibrium is attained. Two important

re'ationships--purchasing power parity, which links the exchange rate to

relative national price levels, and uncovered interest-rate parity, which

links the expected future path of the exchange rate to relative nominal

interest rates--have received extensive empirical attention in recent

years and are main building blocks of several empirical exchange rate mo-

dels.'' The purpose of this paper is to review and extend recent empirical

evidence on these classical parity relationships within a rational-

expect at ions framework.

      When an economy is small and both classical parity relations hold

even in the short run, monetary policy cannot influence the ex ante real rate

of interest. Insofar as the ex ante real rate is an important determinant of

saving and investment decisions, an important channel for stabilization

policy disappears.' In theoretical models of Dornbusch (1976) and Mussa

(1982), temporary price-level stickiness allows money to influence the real

interest rate in the short run even though uncovered parity holds exactly.

Portfolio-balance models of exchange-rate determination (such as those of

Branson (1979) and Girton and Henderson (1977)), stress imperfect substitu-

tion between bonds of different currency denomination. In these models,

central banks can influence real interest rates if they can alter relative

outside debt supplies.

      As emphasized by Roll and Solnik (1979), among others, the classical
parity relations need not hold in a setting of uncertainty and risk aversion,

even when prices are fully flexible and agents efficiently exploit all welfare—

augmenting arbitrage
                        opportunities. Unless at least one parity relationship

fails, monetary policy cannot affect the expected real rate of interest; but

the   invalidity of a parity condition does not, in itself, imply that monetary

policy has this power (see Henderson (this volume) and Obstfeld (1982b)). Thus,

the series of tests performed below is at best a single component of a more

extensive inquiry into the role of monetary policy in the open economy.

        A central theme in our review of empirical work is the conditional

heteroskedasticity     of inflation and   exchange rate forecast errors, and the

bias   this   econometric problem may impart to tests of international parity

relationships. Below, we propose and implement a test for conditional

heteroskedasticity which in. many cases produces strong evidence that the

problem is indeed important.

        The paper is organized as follows. Section I reviews the classical

parity conditions and examines the recent behavior of bilateral ex post real

interest rate differentials between the United States and the United Kingdom,

Germany, Switzerland, Canada, and Japan. Section II carries out bilateral tests

of ex ante real interest rate equality between the U.S. and       these

countries. Section III is devoted     to empirical tests of uncovered interest-
rate   parity. Finally, Section IV tests the hynothesis that relative pur-

chasing power     parity has held ex ante during the recent era of exchange
rate flexibility.

I.     Classical Parity Relationships and Real Interest Rates



        To facilitate formal discussion of the classical naritv relations, we
introduce the following notation:



               =   price   level in the "home" country         at   the end of period t;

      P = price            level in the "foreign" country at the end of period t;

                   the exchange rate at the end of period t, defined as the home—
      St

                   currency price of foreign currency;

                       ln(l +                           is the home-country k-period nominal
      Rk   ,                    'k It   where 1k
                                                   It
               interest     rate at the end of period t;

                   =        +           where           is the foreign-country k-period nomi-

           nal interest rate at the end of period t;

      Etc.) =          Conditional      expectation operator, based on information avail-

           able at the end of period t.



      Purchasing power parity (PPP), in its relative form, states that the

rate at which the relative price of two currencies changes over time must

equal the difference between the national inflation rates. The doctrine

of PPP has a long intellectual history, which is surveyed by Frenkel (1976,

1978). Using the foregoing notation, the PPP relation may be written as



      ln(St/St1) =              ln(P/Pt   ) -   ln(P/P1).                                  (1)




An implication of (1) is that relative PPP must be expected to hold ex ante,

that is, for any k,




      Et[ln(Stk/St)] En(Pk/P) —                           ln(P/Pp].                        (2)




The ex ante relative PPP condition (2) is weaker than (1), of course. 1agee (1978)
                                          4




and Roll (1979) have suggested an "efficient markets" interpretation of ex

ante PPP for a world with low transport costs.

      Uncovered interest-rate parity (UIP) states that the nominal inter-

est differential between similar bonds denominated in different currencies

must equal the expected change in the logarithm of the exchange rate over

the holding period. This explanation of international differences in

nominal interest rates is associated with Fisher (1930). UIP implies that

for any k,



                       =                                                  (3)
                           Et[ln(St+kISt)].

Condition (3) must hold when bonds differing only in their currencies of

denomination are perfect substitutes in investors' portfolios.

      Define the expected or ex ante k-period real interest rates for the

home and foreign countries by



                       -                                                  (4a)
      rk                   Et{ln(Pt+k/Pt)],

             E
                 Rit   —
                           Et{1n(P+k/P)].                                 (4b)




By combining (2) and (3) with (4a) and (4b), we find that



      rk =                                                       -
                                                                          (5)



Thus, under ex ante relative PPP and uncovered interest-rate parity, cx

ante real rates of interest must he equalized internationally. The

classical parity relationships imply that policymakers in a sriall open

economy cannot affect domestic economic activity through financial policy

measures aimed at influencing the expected real interest rate.

     Figures 1 through 5 plot monthly series of ex post one—month real interest

rate differentials between the United States and the United Kingdom, Germany,

Switzerland, Canada, and Japan. The series begin in January 1976 and are based on

wholesale price index inflation rates and one-month    Eurocurrency   deposit rates.

     Because the figures use nonoverlapping monthly data involving one-month-

ahead forecasts, the   deviations   from ex post real rate equality should be

serially uncorrelated and trendless if agents' expectations are rational and

real rates are equal across countries ex ante. All five figures suggest some

degree of both serial dependence and trend, however. Ex post real rates in

both the U.K. and Germany, for example, appear to have been on the whole

above those in the U.S. over the period lasting from roughly July 1977 to

December 1979. Between early 1976 and mid-1978, Swiss and Japanese ex post

real rates were persistently above those in the U.S. The figures show a

pronounced rise in U.S. ex post real rates relative to those in the five other

countries beginning around the end of 1980.

     While the figures are suggestive of the existence of ex ante real interest

rate differentials over the period since January 1976, conclusive evidence can

be provided only by econometric tests. e now turn to these.

II. The Equality of Ex Ante Real          Interest   Pates




             The equality of ex ante real interest rates across countries has been

tested in papers by Hodrick (1979) and Mishkin (1982). Hodrick (1979), using

monthly data on three-month rates, performs bilateral tests to compare ex ante

real rates in the United States and four other OECD countries over the period o'

generalized floating. He concludes that the empirical record, though mixed,          is


not inconsistent with the validity of condition (5). Mishkin (1982) carries out

multilateral tests of equality using quarterly data for the U.S. and six other

OECD countries. Over both the 1967:11 to 1979;iI and 1933.: 11 to 1979:11 sample

periods, he obtains strong rejections of the hypothesis that ex ante real

interest rates in the seven countries were equal.

           In this section we test equation (5) taking into account the possible

dependence of the conditional covariances of relative inflation forecast

errors on nominal interest differentials, Such dependence induces a hetero-

skedasticity problem which invalidates hypothesis tests unless standard

errors are estimated in an appropriate manner. Below, we establish the

presence of a conditional heteroskedasticity problem and then use appropriate

estimators to conduct a test similar to one of Hodrick's (1979).          The results,

based on monthly data, are on the whole unfavorable to the hypothesis that expected

real interest rates have been equalized internationally in recent years.



A Test of the Hypothesis



           The assumption of rational expectations yields a simple bilateral test

of the hypothesis that ex ante real rates are equal across countries. Let

subsequent forecast errors are not part of that information set, E(ut+kut+k_j)J

        While OLS     is    consistent when applied to equation (8), it is generally

    inefficient relative to an instrumental_variables estimator of the type

    discussed by Cumby, Huizinga, and Obstfeld (1982) and by Hansen (1982).J

    Because ek is orthogonal to any variables in agents' information set at

    time t, many instrumental variables are available.                 Below, we use third-country

    interest rates as additional instruments to estimate the parameters of (8)

bythe two-step two-stage least squares (2S2SLS) technique described by
Cumby, Huizinga, and Obstfeld (l982).!

When X = Q, d reduces to the OLS                 estimator   (QQ)Q(u       -


        Computation of d and its asymptotic covariance matrix requires a con-

where Z is an estimate   of   the variance-covariance matrix E(ee), formed

using the residuals from a first-step, consistent estimation of (8) (by OLS,

say). The matrix



       T[QX(XEX)1XQ]1                                                        (12)


provides a consistent estimate of the asymptotic covariance      matrix of (d -     d)

in   this special case. (The usual textbook formula for the asymptotic covariance

matrix of the two-stage least squares estimator (see Dhrymes (1974)) is based

on assumption (10) and the assumption that a.      0 for j   > 0.)

       Formula (12) is used by Hodrick (1979) to calculate the asymptotic confi-

dence ellipse for OLS estimates of (8). But (12) is not justified, even in

the OLS case, unless the conditional covariances of forecast errors with re-

spect to lagged interest differentials are constants.21 Condition (10) would

be valid if the variables included in X were all strictly exogenous; hut

that is certainly not the case here.-'      The validity of (10) is thus an issue

of considerable importance in constructing hypothesis tests concerning the

coefficients of (8). Belpw, we describe and implement a test of (10).

       When (10) fails, estimation of the matrix ? is more involved. Hansen

(1982) suggests the following procedure. As before, generate estimates e of

the residuals of (8) using some consistent (but not necessarily efficient)

estimation procedure, for example, OLS. Then,     calculate a consistent estimate
s()   of the spectral density matrix of the vector stochastic process {Xe),



     s()   =     Eexp(-it) (XeeX).                                           (13)

A   consistent estimate of        is   provided   by 2Ts(0). This heteroskedasticity-
consistent covariance     matrix estimator is convenient, as it does not require

detailed specification of either the nature of the heteroskedasticity or

the nature of the serial correlation in the residuals of (8).



A Test of Conditional Homoskedasticity



       To determine the appropriate estimator for the matrix 1 in (9), the

empirical validity of assumption (10) must be examined. Here, we test (10)

for the casej = 1.        In that case, (10) asserts that



                     02                                                                 (14)
       E(e+kIXt)


a constant, so that the forecast error e÷k is conditionally homoskedastic

with respect to time-t values of the instrumental variables. Rejection of (14)

is clearly a sufficient indication that formula (12) is inappropriate and

may lead to faulty inferences.

        Since our ultimate goal is to test whether a = 0 and b =         1       in (8), it

is reasonable to test for conditional heteroskedasticity under the tenta-

tive assumption that the null hypothesis of ex ante real interest rate equal-

ity is valid. That assumption implies that ek is simply the composite

forecast error            -            +       which is obervable. By the properties

of conditional means, the random variable



                2             2
        't÷k e+k - E(e+k X)

has unconditional mean zero and is uncorrelated with any variable in the

                                               11




and so (14) can be tested by estimating an equation of the form



       e+k =    cx   +
                         (Rkt   -
                                    R)     +
                                               Y(Rkt
                                                       -
                                                           R)2   +                  (15)




A test of the hypothesis            =   y = 0 is a test of conditional homoskedasticity.
Because tltk is uncorrelated with the regressors in (15) (all of which are

included in the information set generated by instrumental variables dated t

or earlier), OLS yields consistent parameter estimates. But 2S2SLS again

yields an efficiency gain in general. Any variables in the information set

generated by x           may be used as instrumental variab1es.--'

       The foregoing test is similar in spirit to one proposed by White (1980)

for cross-sectional estimation environments. White suggests regressing

estimated equation residuals on cross-products of regressors. His procedure

thus imposes no a priori coefficient constraints. The present setting , however,

jS   one in which a simple null hypothesis is to be tested. Absence of conditional

heteroskedasticity when the null is imposed is clearly necessary if formula

(12) is to lead to valid inferences.

       Table I contains the homoskedasticity test results based on monthly

data. Five countries--the United Kingdom, Germany, Switzerland, Canada, and

Japan--are compared with the United States in the tests of ex ante rea' inter-

est rate equality carried out below. Choosing an appropriate price index and

interest rate is in itself an issue of considerable importance. Thus, the tests

are performed for both consumer price index (CPI) and wholesale price index (WPI)

inflation rates and for three nominal interest rates, the one-month and three-

month Eurocurrency rates and a domestic three-month money-market           rate.' All

the resulting possibilities are represented in Table I.-'

         The   results      illustrate the empirical relevance of the conditional hetero-

skedasticity prob]em in tests of real interest rate equality. In twenty

of the thirty tests, the hypothesis of conditional hornoskedasticity can be

rejected at the S per cent level. In five of the remaining cases, the

hypothesis can be rejected at the 20      percent level. Taken together,

these results contradict the simplifying assumptions under which formula

(12) is a consistent estimator of the asymptotic covariance matrix. Ac-

cordingly, a heteroskedasticity-cOflSiSteflt covariance matrix estimator is

used to obtain the test results analyzed below.




Empirical Results



      Tables 2a, 2b, and 2c report the results of bilateral tests of equality

between the U.S. real interest rate and those of the U.K., Germany, Switzerland,

Canada, and Japan.' Except in the U.K. and Japanese cases, equality is strongly

rejected for all combinations of price index and interest rate.    The

rejections in tests using onshore money-market interest rates (Table

2c) may in some cases be plausibly ascribed to the existence or prospect

of capital controls, However, the rejections are almost equally strong

when Eurocurrency interest rates are used in place of money-market rates;

and arbitrage between differently denominated Eurocurrency deposits has

not been restricted.---' On the whole, it seems difficult to explain the

rejections of real interest rate equality by appealing to institutional

factors that hinder international movements of capital.

       In the case of the U.K., the evidence ison the whole very

favorable to the hypothesis that ex ante real rates in the U.S. and U.K.

have been equal during the recent years of floating exchange rates.      While

the U.S./U.K. 'test statistic lies in the 5 percent critical region in one

 case and is quite high in the others, the large size of the estimated

constant term (a) relative to its estimated standard error is often the

 cause. In contrast, the estimated slope coefficient (b) is, in half the

cases, within a standard deviation of unity. This evidence is consistent with

the existence of a constant ex ante real interest differential

between the U.S. and the U.K. The evidence therefore sug-

 gests that real interest rates in the two countries, though possibly differ-

 ent, are closely linked.

        Tests for Japan using CPI inflation rates and Eurocurrency interest

rates support the hypothesis of real interest rate equality.     When WPI in-

 flation rates are used in defining real interest rates, however, the hypo-

thesis is easily rejected.    Use of the CPI inflation rate together with

the domestic money-market nominal interest rate yields a chi-square statistic

that is quite close to the critical value of 5.99.

       An interesting feature of the results is that nominal interest differ-

 entials have significant explanatory power in equations

 differential as the dependent variable, but do not usually help in forecast-

 ing relative WPI inflation rates. The U.K. is again an exception in this

 respect: Nominal U.S.-U.K. interest differentials are significant (and rela-

 tively unbiased) predictors of CPI and WPI inflation rates. The greater

 importance of the interest differential in ci regressions is not surprising,

 for the expected future CPI is probably a better measure of the anticipated

 future "real" value of money to consumers than is the expected WPI.

         The tests demonstrate that ex ante real interest rate equality is

  often rejected decisively over the recent floating exchange rate period.

against that hypothesis.

Empirical studies such as Frenkel and Levich (1975,1977,1981), McCormick (1979),

and Marston (1976) show that (16) holds quite closely in the Eurocurrency
market, where the interst-bearing assets being compared have identical default

of the future spot rate, and one-period ahead forecast errors (k = 1) are

where      is a risk premium which may fluctuate through time and may be serially

correlated. Recent theoretical work shows that when asset holders are risk

averse, market efficiency is consistent with the existence of a nonzero,

possibly time-varying, risk premium (see, e,g., Frankel (l979b), Grauer, Litzen-

the UIP condition. Frenkel finds that the results of estimation are "broadly

findings suggest that the possibility of nonstationarity needs to be ta}en

seriously in designing and evaluating hypothesis tests involving exchange

rates.

          A procedure that often avoids the unit—root problem is to test whether

a = 0 and b = 1 in the equation



                        a + b ln(Fkt/St) +                                   (21)

Under the hypothesis of UIP, (21) is equivalent to (20), and states that the

k-period forward premium is the markets expectation of the change in the

logarithm of the spot rate over the next k periods.      Like the tests cited

above as rejecting UIP, the test just described works in terms of first

differences rather than levels. Thus, the asymptotic theory used in testing

is more likely to be justifiable.

          Equation (21) is estimated below, and the hypothesis that a = 0 and

b =   1   is tested. The tests are bilateral (unlike Bilsonts (1981)), but

expand Frenkelts (1981) information set by using third—currency forward premia

observed at time t (which are uncorrelated with the disturbance \rt÷k)
                                                                          as in-

strumental variables in forming 2S2SLS estimates of [a b].       This yields

parameter estimates more efficient than those produced by OLS, and so a more

stringent test of the null hypothesis. Like Hansen and Hodrick (1980), we use

weekly data on three-month forecasts.



A Test of Conditional Homoskedasticity



          Tests of UIP have almost universally assumed that the conditional covari-

ances of forecast errors do not depend on lagged forward prernia.' Because
                                      18




the forward premium is not a strictly exogenous variable, this assumption

may be false, in which case the customary standard-error estimators have

no asymptotic justification. As in the previous section, it is therefore

of interest to test the conditional homoskedasticity assumption formally

under the null hvnothesis that flIP holds.

      This can once again he done by   estimating   the equation




      V÷k
               +
                   ln(Fkt/St)   +

Under conditional homoskedasticitv, the exnected
                                          -      value of v2t+k conditional on

forward premia observed at time t    is a constant. Thus, we should

find that B = y = 0 in (22). As before, any variable in the conditioning

set may be used as an instrumental variable in forminc 2S2SLS estimates of (22).

      Table 3 reports the results of testing the conditional homoskedasticity of

three-month forward rate forecast errors.1' The tests involve the U.S.

dollar's exchange rate against the pound sterling, the Deutschernark, the

Swiss franc, the Canadian dollar, and the Japanese yen. Weekly data running

from 7 January 1976 to 24 June 1981 are employed. The data are aligned to
                                                                   19/

      In four of five cases, the null hyDothesis of conditional homoskedas-

ticity is strongly rejected. For the Canadian dollar, there is weak evidence a-

gainst conditional homoskedasticity. The results suggest that a hetero-

skedasticity consistent covariance matrix estimator should be used in con-

ducting hypothesis tests on the coefficients of equation (21).

5. The equations were estimated by OLS, but the standard errors were

calculated using a heteroskedasticity-consistent technique.

      Rejection at the 5 percent level again occurs in all cases except

that of Germany. Thus, the results of the present test are quite

similar to those of Table 4.   In addition, most of the estimated constant

terms (Canada is the exception) are quite insignificant.

jections in Table S appears to be caused exclusively by the large size of

an estimated constant tern relative to its standard error, Note that

while the present tests are unable to reject UIP for dollar and Deutsche-

mark deposits, tests by Hansen and Hodrick (1980) using a different data


 sample do reject that hypothesis.

 the hypothesis of perfect asset substitutability,

 interpreted with caution. First, political uncertainties may have introduced

 an element of default ris.k into forward transactions during the sample pen—

od. A second issue is the so-called "peso problem" (Krasker 1980), which is

essentially a problem of finite-sample inference. If agents, over some

significant time period, expect a major central bank intervention which does

not materialize, nonoverlapping forward forecast errors will be correlated in

the sample even if the expectation of intervention is rational in the light

of past central bank behavior. While agents would be correct on average

given an infinite sample containing infinitely many such episodes, the

econometrician has only a finite history at her disposal. The dramatic

Federal Reserve-Buridesbank interventions in the fourth quarters of 1978

and 1979 are examples of the type of event which, if incorrectly anticipated

ex post, may give rise to a spurious correlation in nonoverlapping fore-

cast errors.

IV. Exchange Rates and National Price Levels



     The absolute version of the purchasing power parity (PPP)
                                                                  doctrine has not

fared well in econometric tests on recent data, at least not in tests involving

the U.S. (see, e.g., Frenkel (1981) and Krugman (1978)). Figures 6 through 10

display the time series of first differences of the real exchange rates of the

U.K., Germany, Switzerland, Canada, and Japan against the U.S. The real

exchange rate is defined as the dollar "value" of the foreign WPI divided by

the U.S. WPI. The figures reveal that for all countries, the floating-rate

period has been a period of much higher real exchange-rate variability

vis--vis the U.S. than was the Bretton Woods era.—' The increase in the

amplitude of deviations from PPP begins abruptly with the adoption of flex-
           22/
ible rates.
      Here, we test whether relative PPP holds ex ante, that is, whether

                                               the expected inflation differ-
expected exchange-rate depreciation reflects
                                                  If ex ante PPP does not hold, ex
ential between the home and foreign countries.

ante real interest rates will generally differ internationally.    As Magee (1978)

and Roll (1979) observe, ex ante PPP is under certain assumptions a consequence

of the efficiency of international commodity
                                               markets. Both Roll (1979) and

Frenkel Cl981) present evidence that changes in real exchange rates are

serially uncorrelated, and thus possess a key property of forecast-error

series.




A Test of the Hypothesis



      To design a test of ex ante relative PPP we return to equation (2).

By combining (2) with (6a) and (6b) we obtain the equation

the null hypothesis for a three-month forecasting horizon were also per-

formed, but these are not reported as they only reinforce the message of

Table 6.

      That message is that expected exchange rate changes have been poor and

biased predictors of relative inflation rates over the years of generalized

floating. The hypothesis a = 0 and b =    1   is decisively rejected for all

countries, regardless of the price index used. Further, the estimated

slope coefficients are almost always insignificant and frequently of the

wrong sign. The one exception to this occurs in the case of the dollar-

Deutscheinark rate, where we find that the expected depreciation rate does

help forecast the U,S.-Cerman CPI inflation differential.
          Table 7 uses the adjusted Q statistic of Ljung and Box (1978) to test

whether real exchange rate changes have been serially uncorrelated in recent

years. The test statistics, which are computed for twelve lags using monthly data,

confirm the Roll-Frenkel finding that real exchange rate changes are not

serially correlated. Only in the Canadian case can the null hypothesis of

no serial correlation be rejected at better than the 20 percent significance

 level. While the foregoing evidence is supportive of ex ante relative PPP,

the results of Table 6 are strongly at variance with that hypothesis. On

balance, it seems reasonable to conclude that the "efficient markets" version

of relative PPP has not characterized the recent ex?erience with floating

 rates.

Conclusion



      This paper has studied the interplay among price levels, interest

rates, and exchange rates over the recent period of managed exchange-

rate flexibility. Attention was focused on the two classical parity

conditions that link prices and nominal interest rates internationally

and on their corollary, the international equality of ex ante real

rates of interest. Econometric tests of these propositions within a

                                                                         theiri.
rational-expectations framework provided significant evidence against

As a by-product of the investigation, we found that inflation and exchange-

rate forecast errors appear to be conditionally heteroskedastic.

       ls'hen monetary disturbances are dominant, the classical parity

relationships may be a reliable guide to the comovements of nominal

macro-variables. But the past decade has been characterized by

moderate inflation coupled with substantial real disturbances. In

 such circumstances, the classical conditions appear to be too simple

 and aggregative to provide an adequate explanation of macroeconomic

 events in a world of differentiated commodities and assets.

      Whether the failure of the parity relations has conferred monetary

autonomy on small open economies is an entirely distinct question.

Further theoretical and empirical research is needed before a confident

answer can be ventured.

Appendix: The Data



Section   II




Prices: WPI's are taken from International Financial Statistics (IFS), line

63. CPI's come from IFS, line 64.
Interest Rates: One- and three-month Eurocurrency deposit rates come from

Data Resources, Inc. (for the U.K., Germany, and Switzerland) and from the

Harris Bank of Chicago Weekly Review (for Canada and Japan), Three-month

domestic money-market rates come from Morgan Guaranty's World Financial

Markets, and are quoted at or near the end of the month. For the U.S., the

rate on prime industrial paper is used. Interbank deposit rates are used for

the U.K., Germany, and Switzerland. For Canada, the rate used is that on

prime finance company paper. The interest rate on three-month repurchase

agreements is used as the Japanese money-market rate.


Section III
Spot and ninety-day forward exchange rates are noon rates collected by the

Federal Reserve System. Spot rates are matched to the maturity of the cor-

responding forward contract, as described by Riehl and Rodriguez (1977).

Morgan Guranty's World Calendar of Holidays is used to account for bank holi-

days, weekends, etc.

 2. In these circumstances, monetary policy also loses its power to system-

 atically influence the terms of trade or real exchange rate, and a second

 avenue of demand management is thus closed. Even so, monetary policy can

 be effective if nominal wages are sticky (see Obstfeld (1982a)).    But this

 possibility disappears as well when wages are fully and instantaneously

 indexed    to the aggregate price level, While monetary policy may be   inef-

 fective, tax policy can always succeed in driving a wedge between home and
 foreign ex ante real rates. The discussion below abstracts from taxes.
 Also ignored is the   possibility that changes in monetary growth rates might

 influence the terms of trade through real effects of the Tobin-Sidrauski

 sort.


 3. If there are no default risks, covered interest arbitrage is riskiess

  (in   home currency terms) and so covered interest parity must always hold
  exactly in the absence of transaction costs. In contrast,     uncovered

  arbitrage involves home-currency risk in an essential way. The relation
  between   covered and uncovered interest parity is discussed in Section III,
  below.

4. This test is suggested by Hodrick (1979). However, he uses the k—period
forward premium rather than the k-period nominal interest differential on the
right-hand            side of (8). The two procedures should yield very similar results

when Eurocurrency interest rates are being compared (see Section III).



5. The reasoi is that the latter uses more information As noted in the next

paragraph of the text, OLS is a special "just-identified" case of this type

of instrumental-variables estimator.



6. When the forecast horizon k exceeds one period, e+k is serially correlated

and, under the null hypothesis, has the covariance matrix of a moving average (MA)

process. As Hansen and Hodrick (1980) note, two-step serial correlation corrections

of the generalized least squares type are inconsistent, even though OLS is consi5-

tent. The inconsistency is due to the fact that the nominal interest dif-

ferential is not a strictly exogenous variable. To see this, suppose that k =

 covariance matrix of an MA process and, by Granger's lemma (see Ansley, Spivey,

 and Wrobleski (1977)), can be written as an invertible second-order MA process,

 e+3 =     t+3   +         + X21.          But even though e3 is uncorrelated with

 the regressors in (8), t+3 need not be; and therefore application of a

 generalized-least-squares transformation to (8) will generally induce a

 nonzero correlation between the filtered disturbance t+3 and the filtered

 regressors. For a more detailed argument, see Cumby, Huizinga, and Obstfeld

 (1982). Hansen and Hodrick (1980) use the Wold theorem to provide a similar

 characterization of the form of the forward exchange rate forecast error when

 contract periods overlap in the data.



 7. See Dhrymes (1974), pp. 183-4. A more recent discussion of the failure

 of assumption (10) in regression models with i.n.i.d. residuals appears in

 White (1980). For time series models, see Engle (1982) and Hansen (1982).

 It is important to note that even if (10) does not hold, the estimator

 given in (11) still yields consistent (but relatively inefficient) estimates

 of parameters.



 8. The condition would also be valid if the instruments and disturbances

 were jointly normally distributed. Without the joint normality assumption,

however, lack of correlation need not imply statistical independence.



 9. One can of course obtain more efficient covariance matrix estimates by im-

posing such information if it is known. Cumby, Huizinga, and Obstfeld (1982)

 describe one way of doing this. Their method is implemented in obtaining the

 empirical results reported in this paper. White (1980) has proposed a

context, along with a test of homoskedasticitY. White's test is discussed

further below.
