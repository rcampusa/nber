Unemployment Insurance and Reservation Wages: Evidence from Administrative Data

JEL No. J64,J65

                                         ABSTRACT

Although the reservation wage plays a central role in job search models, empirical evidence on
the determinants of reservation wages, including key policy variables such as unemployment
insurance (UI), is scarce. In France, unemployed people must declare their reservation wage to
the Public Employment Service when they register to claim UI benefits. We take advantage of
these rich French administrative data and of a reform of UI rules to estimate the effect of the
potential benefit duration (PBD) on reservation wages and on other dimensions of job selectivity,
using a difference-in-difference strategy. We cannot reject that the elasticity of the reservation
wage with respect to PBD is zero. Our results are precise and we can rule out elasticities larger
than 0.006. Furthermore, we do not find any significant effects of PBD on the desired number of
hours, duration of labor contract and commuting time/distance. The estimated elasticity of actual
benefit duration with respect to PBD of 0.3 is in line with the consensus in the literature.
Exploiting a regression discontinuity design as an alternative identification strategy, we find
similar results.

1   Introduction
In standard job search models, unemployed workers receive job offers that they accept if
the value of the offered job is higher than the value of unemployment (McCall, 1970). Their
search strategy can be summarized by one key concept, the reservation wage, which is the
lowest wage of an acceptable job offer. Job search models predict that more generous un-
employment insurance (UI) increases the value of unemployment, and thus also increases
reservation wages. This selectivity channel pushes up accepted wages. However, unem-
ployment insurance also lengthens unemployment and, as job prospects decrease with un-
employment duration, this negative-duration-dependence channel drives down accepted
wages. Which channel dominates is a priori ambiguous and may depend on the context.
A recent strand of the empirical literature documents modest – either positive or negative
– UI effects on accepted wages (Card et al., 2007; Schmieder et al., 2012b, 2016; Le Bar-
banchon, 2016; Nekoei and Weber, 2017).1 However, the existing literature has no precise
estimate of the UI effect on reservation wages only, which corresponds to the selectivity
channel. Our paper contributes to filling this gap.

We take advantage of unique administrative data on reservation wages and of a quasi-
experimental research design. In France, when newly unemployed job seekers register
at the public employment service, they have to declare their reservation wage and other
information on the job they are looking for, such as commuting time/distance, desired
number of hours and type of labor contract (temporary vs. long-term). Our main identifi-
cation strategy relies on a reform that altered the Potential Benefit Duration (PBD) for some
claimants groups while leaving it unchanged for some others, depending on their previous
work tenure. Using this natural experiment, we compute difference-in-difference estimates
of the elasticity of reservation wages with respect to PBD. Our results point to the lack of
responsiveness of reservation wages and other dimensions of job selectivity to the poten-
tial duration of benefits. We obtain very similar results using an alternative identification
strategy, based on the discontinuity of the PBD schedule with age.

While the previous literature on reservation wages is based on survey data (Feldstein and
Poterba, 1984; Koenig et al., 2014; Krueger and Mueller, 2016), we use administrative data
on reservation wages. Our data have thus several strengths: large sample size, no missing
values due to non-response and precise measures of UI-related policy variables and past
labor outcomes, such as past tenure or past wages. On top of these strengths, the data also
enable us to follow workers over multiple claims, so that we observe repeated measures
of reservations wages for a given worker. As a sanity check, we verify that claimants

insurance on non-employment duration.

stating higher reservation wages draw on UI benefits for a longer time period, holding
constant the claimants’ and the claims’ characteristics, and controlling for unobserved time-
invariant heterogeneity of claimants (fixed effects models). This first result confirms that
the reservation wage stated by claimants to the UI agency is meaningful.

Our main identification strategy relies on a UI reform, which occurred in 2009. The reform
was not triggered by the Great Recession. Its main objective was to simplify the rules
according to which the potential duration of benefits are computed. In France, PBD is
mainly determined by the claimant’s previous work duration. Before the 2009 reform,
PBD was a step function of past tenure. The 2009 reform simplified the rule and made it
linear, so that claimants are now entitled to as many days of benefits as days of work in
the previous two years. Some tenure groups benefited from the reform while others lost.
Some tenure groups were unaffected and can be used as control groups in a difference-in-
difference setting.

Whatever the statistical specification we use, we cannot reject that the elasticity of reser-
vation wages with respect to PBD is zero at the 5% level. Our results are precise and, in
our favorite specification, rule out elasticities greater than 0.006. The elasticity of the actual
duration of benefits with respect to PBD, estimated at 0.3, is in line with most results of
the literature. We also find that more generous benefits slow down job finding even at the
beginning of the spell when claimants declare their reservation wages.

Looking at other dimensions of job selectivity, we do not find any significant effect of PBD
on the maximum commuting time/distance that job seekers are willing to accept. Nor do
we find any effects of PBD on the number of hours or on the type of contract job seekers are
looking for. The absence of responsiveness in all dimensions of job selectivity is a strong
result. While the non-responsiveness of reservation wages could have been explained by
strong wage rigidity and low mobility across jobs, the fact that the willingness to find
open-ended contracts and to ensure job security does not change with PBD suggests that
rigid labor markets are unlikely to be the only explanation to our results.

While the elasticity of reservation wages is zero on average, we find that it amounts to a
significant 0.01 for job seekers with the lowest past tenure. These job seekers are entitled to
short PBD and the date when their benefits could elapse is close to their registration date
when they declare their reservation wages. Consistently, we also find that the elasticity
of actual benefit duration is higher for these short tenure claimants. We do not find any
significant heterogeneity of the PBD elasticity of reservation wages across gender or past
wage groups.

We are able to check the robustness of our main results using another identification strategy,
a Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD). When unemployed job seekers are over 50 years


                                                3
old at the separation date from their previous employer, they benefit from more generous
PBDs, which are on average 30% longer. We find some manipulation of the separation
date around the 50-year-old cutoff. Consequently, we adopt a ”Donut” RDD strategy,
which excludes observations in a window around the cutoff of the running variable. As
with our main difference-in-difference strategy, we cannot reject that the PBD elasticity of
reservation wages is equal to zero, while the elasticity of actual benefit duration is around
0.2. Claimants in the RDD strategy are different from those of the difference-in-difference,
in particular they are more attached to the labor force and older; yet results are very similar.

Lastly, we discuss the theoretical relation between the elasticities of unemployment du-
ration and the reservation wage with respect to PBD. In partial equilibrium, we can de-
compose the elasticity of unemployment duration into two components: one due to the
elasticity of the reservation wage (scaled by the slope of the wage offer distribution taken
at the level of the reservation wage) and the other one due to the elasticity of the job offer
arrival rate (or search effort). Taking the upper bound of the 95% confidence interval of
the estimate of the reservation wage elasticity, we find that the reservation wage margin ac-
counts, at most, for 6% of the elasticity of unemployment duration, the rest being attributed
to the elasticity of search effort.

Our paper is, to the best of our knowledge, the first one to obtain precise quasi-experimental
estimates of the effect of more generous UI on self-reported reservation wages and other
dimensions of job selectivity. Most previous contributions could not rely on credible ex-
ogenous variations in UI generosity and found mixed results. Feldstein and Poterba (1984)
finds a large elasticity of reservation wages to benefit levels, while Krueger and Mueller
(2016) cannot reject that this elasticity is equal to zero.        2


Our findings on reservation wage responsiveness shed lights on the current debate on the
effect of UI on accepted wages. Our results show that changes in PBD have no significant
effect on job selectivity at the beginning of the job-search spell for the average job seeker.
The absence of selectivity effect is in line with the conclusion of Schmieder et al. (2016) that
reservation wages are not binding in Germany. When we focus on job seekers with short
potential benefit duration, who are more comparable to claimants in the Austrian sample of
Nekoei and Weber (2017), we find an estimate of the elasticity of reservation wages around
.01, which has a similar magnitude as the estimate found by Nekoei and Weber (2017) on
the elasticity of accepted wages with respect to PBD (.016).

Section 2 describes the 2009 UI reform and the data. Section 3 explains our DiD strategy
and provides evidence in favor of the identification assumptions. Section 4 presents the
   2 One recent exception is Lichter (2016) who uses a quasi-experimental setting to analyze the effect of PBD

on job search effort, but also on reservation wages. His results on reservation wages are consistent with ours,
although less precise because of the small sample size of his survey data.

ity. Section 5 deals with our alternative RDD strategy. Section 6 discusses the relationship
between the elasticities of reservation wages and unemployment duration with respect to
PBD. Section 7 concludes.



2     Research design and data
2.1    Research design

Our identification strategy relies on a change in UI rules that occurred at the beginning of
2009. The 2009 reform was not triggered by the Great Recession. In France, UI rules are
renegotiated by unions and employers’ organizations every three years. The renegotiation
was thus expected but the nature of the change was not anticipated. The objective of the
2009 change was to simplify the computation of Potential Benefit Duration (PBD), i.e. the
number of days of benefits workers are entitled to when they become unemployed. Both
before and after the change, PBD depends on the number of days worked in the previous
years but in a different way. For workers aged less than 50, before the reform, PBD could
take three values: i) 213 days if the unemployed had worked between 182 and 365 days
(excl.) in the previous 26 months, ii) 365 days if she had worked between 365 and 487
days (excl.); and iii) 700 days if she had worked 487 days or more. After the reform, the
unemployed are entitled to as many days of benefits as they worked in the reference period,
with a cap at 730 days. In the current section, we restrict ourselves to workers less than 50
years old. The UI rules are more generous for workers of more than 50 years old, a group
on which we focus in our alternative identification strategy in Section 5.

Figure 1 shows this shift from a step function to a linear function. Some tenure groups
benefited from the change, whereas others lost from it, and within winners and losers,
some tenures were associated with larger changes than others. The new UI rule applies to
anyone whose contract terminated after March 31st 2009.3


2.2    Sample selection

From the administrative records of the Public Employment Service (PES), we select the
inflow of job seekers registering for a new UI claim from 2006 to 2012.4 We focus on
claimants of the regular UI rules, excluding senior workers over 50 years old, workers from
    3 Peoplewhose contract terminated before and who are still unemployed on March 31st 2009 stay entitled
to the old rule.
    4 New claims correspond both to first claims ever and to situations when a worker registers again and has

no benefits left from her previous claim.

temporary help agencies –interimaires– and workers in the culture and arts industries –
intermittents du spectacle. We restrict the sample to claimants that were previously employed
full-time. This resolves any ambiguity about the reservation wage question (see below).
Finally, we exclude observations with extreme past wages or reservation wages.5

We further select unemployed people whose pre-unemployment contract terminated be-
tween April 1st 2006 and March 31st 2012, 3 years before and after the 2009 reform.
Although we show the main results on the full sample as well, the analysis (until Sec-
tion 5) focuses on claimants with multiple claims, more precisely with exactly two claims
(there are very few individuals with 3 claims or more so we drop them6 ). Focusing on
claimants with multiple spells enables us to control for time-invariant unobserved hetero-
geneity, for instance, in productivity, which is important to make sense of the link between
reservation wages and unemployment duration as we show in section 2.3. Controlling for
time-invariant heterogeneity is also a plus when implementing our difference-in-difference
strategy (see section 3). We also believe that job seekers with multiple spells have a bet-
ter knowledge of the UI system and are thus more likely to react to changes in the PBD
schedule. Our final sample has around 180,000 claims, while the full sample of both one-
spell and multiple-spells claimants has around 2,000,000 claims. Summary statistics can be
found in Appendix Table A1.
   5 Observations  with reservation wages or past wages below the minimum wages are excluded. We also
exclude observations whose past wage is over 3,400 euros, or whose reservation wage is over 3,200 euros (95%
percentile). We trim observations with a ratio of the reservation wage over the previous wage that is below 0.4
or above 3 (the first and last percentile).

2.3   Reservation wage data

When registering as unemployed in France, people are asked the type of job they are
looking for and their reservation wage for this job. Figure 2 is a screenshot of the online
registration form. The question is stated in these terms: “What minimum gross wage do
you ask for?”. People indicate an amount and choose the unit in which they are reporting
their reservation wage: hourly, monthly or annual. Before answering the reservation wage
question, they are asked what occupations they are looking for. These occupations may be
different from their previous job and they probably provide some kind of anchor for the
reservation wage question. Job seekers cannot move on to the next page without having
reported their reservation wage.

Figure 2: Screenshot of the section dedicated to reservation wage on the PES website at
registration




After the reservations wage, questions about desired hours, type of labor contracts (long-
term vs temporary contrats), commuting times/distances are asked in order to help the PES
caseworkers choose the type of vacancies they will send to each job seeker.7 If browsing
through vacancies is costly for job seekers, basic theory suggests that the best response
of job seekers is to reveal their true reservation wage to the PES.8 We are also confident
that the monitoring/sanctioning role of the PES does not lead job seekers to lie about their
reservation wages. Indeed, when controlling the search effort of job seekers, the legal rule
   7 The  fact that these variables are used for this purpose is confirmed here: http://www.pole-emploi.fr/
candidat/le-projet-personnalise-d-acces-a-l-emploi-@/article.jspz?id=60640.
   8 In case of incomplete information, this conclusion may not hold. Assume for instance that job seekers do

not know for certain the distribution of wage offers when they answer the question. In this case, they may be
tempted to declare a lower reservation wage than their true one, to learn about the distribution. Interestingly
though, shorter PBD would then lead job seekers to declare even lower reservation wages, as they need to
learn more quickly. This would amplify the impact of PBD on the observed reservation wage, which is at odds
with our results.



                                                      7
requires caseworkers to compare the posted wages of vacancies to which job seekers apply
to their past wage – and not to their reservation wages.9 Anecdotal evidence also suggest
that sanctions for failing to comply to job-search requirements are never implemented.

We focus on job seekers previously working full-time because the reservation wage ques-
tion is not explicit about whether it relates to full-time or part-time jobs. Almost all job
seekers in our sample look for a full-time job (see Section 2.4) and the reservation wage
data can be interpreted as being in relation to a full-time job.

Figure 3 shows the distribution of the monthly reservation wage.10 The upper panel dis-
plays the reservation wage (in nominal terms). In the intermediate panel, the reservation
wage is divided by the minimum wage at the time of registration. The lower panel displays
the reservation wage divided by the pre-unemployment wage. Figure 3 shows that 35%
of workers report the minimum wage as their reservation wage. The minimum wage is
high in France11 and applies to a large share of the workforce: 40% of the unemployment
spells of our sample are associated with a previous wage that is inferior or equal to 1.2
times the minimum wage. The upper panel of Figure 3 also shows that individuals tend to
round their stated reservations wages to hundreds of euros. We discuss the consequences
of rounding on our identification in Appendix A. We show that the non-classical measure-
ment error in our main outcome variable induced by rounding is unlikely to bias our main
estimates, as the exogenous variation in PBD used in our context is independent of the
measurement error.

Dividing the reservation wage by the past wage in the lower panel is a first attempt to
control for individual heterogeneity. It captures whether people are being more or less
picky, for instance whether they are willing to accept a wage cut. 70% of job seekers would
accept a job that pays less than their previous job. The median of the reservation wage
ratio is 0.93. The distribution of the reservation wage ratio in our data, is close to the one
obtained by Feldstein and Poterba (1984) or Krueger and Mueller (2016).

One potential concern to address is the extent to which, conditional on the previous wage,
the reservation wage conveys some additional information. It could be for instance that
the reservation wage is anchored on the previous wage with some noise. We show that the
reservation wage carries information. First, the reservation wage is meaningfully correlated
with workers’ characteristics. Second, we show that the reservation wage helps to predict
actual benefit duration, even conditional on past wages. In the remainder of the text, we
also use the term “unemployment duration” for actual benefit duration.

  10 We convert in monthly terms wages declared in hours or in annual terms, using the legal number of
working hours for full-time employees.
 11 For instance, in 2012, the gross monthly minimum wage was 1400 euros.

women tend to have a lower reservation wage. On the contrary, age, experience and edu-

Second, we show that higher reservation wages predict longer unemployment duration.
One concern is that the empirical relationship between the reservation wage and unem-
ployment duration, controlling for observables, is likely to reflect both the causal effect
of the reservation wage on unemployment duration and the influence on the reservation
wages of unobservables that are also correlated with unemployment duration. The workers
who are more productive are likely to have better prospects and thus higher reservation
wages. They are also more likely to stay unemployed for shorter periods. The unobserved
heterogeneity in productivity is likely to create a negative relationship between reservation
wage and unemployment duration, holding observables constant. We test whether this
unobserved heterogeneity matters by estimating the following equation with and without
individual fixed effects:

                         log Duri,n = Indiv.F.E.i + δ log resWi,n + βXi,n + ei,n                            (1)
 12 We   split the sample in 20 equal-sized bins in terms of previous wage and use dummies for these bins



                                                      10
where Duri,n is the duration of the n-th claim of individual i; resWi,n is the reservation
wage declared by individual i at the beginning of her n-th claim; Xi,n are a set of covariates
including the log of PBD, time fixed effects (quarterly date of registration), 50 past wage
bins and age (see footnote of Table 2 for the exhaustive list). First, the OLS coefficient
without individual fixed effects (Column (1) in Table 2) is negative and equal to -0.16. This
suggests that the unobservable productivity component of reservation wages dominates
the correlation. Then we estimate the fixed effects regression and find a positive significant
coefficient of 0.28 (Column (2) in Table 2). Once we control for unobserved (time invariant)
heterogeneity using the individual fixed effects, the relationship between unemployment
duration and reservation wages only reflects the differences between claims in the work vs.
non-work valuation. The comparison between Column (1) and Column (2) of Table 2 shows
the importance of controlling for unobserved (time-invariant) heterogeneity. This justifies
our choice of selecting a sample of job seekers with multiple claims, which enables fixed
effects estimation. While this selection is admittedly important – job seekers with multiple
spells are probably less productive than those with one spell only –, the OLS coefficient of
Column (1) in Table 2 does not change much when it is estimated on the whole sample in
Column (3) (-0.21 vs. -0.16).

Figure 4 shows the distribution of the difference between the reservation wages declared
by the same individual at the beginning of her first and second spell over our period of
analysis. As the figure shows, although 35% of job seekers declare the same real reservation
wage for their two unemployment spells, there is still some variability that we relate to
exogenous variations in PBD in Sections 3 and 4.

2.4   Data on other dimensions of job selectivity

During the registration process and after stating their reservation wage, job seekers are
also asked about other characteristics of the job they are looking for. They are asked the
type of contract and the type of hours they would like. In France, there is a strong duality
in the labor market between jobs with open-ended contracts and jobs with temporary con-
tracts. Open-ended contracts ensure that workers benefit from a high level of employment
protection: we call them long-term contracts. Table 3 shows that almost 90% of job seekers
declare that they are looking for such contracts. This is in sharp contrast with the share of
job seekers separating from a long-term contract, which amounts to 35%. In contrast to the
wage dimension along which the unemployed are willing to accept a cut, job seekers are
looking for jobs with more job security than their previous jobs. Table 3 also shows that
97% of job seekers are looking for a full-time job.
Table 3 also reveals the extent to which job seekers are mobile. On average, job seekers
declare that they would accept a job that is in a 32 km radius around their home.13 For
those who give a commuting time, on average they would accept a maximum of 44 minutes
of commute. 2% of job seekers declare that they would accept a job anywhere in France.
When estimating the effect of UI on mobility, we will abstract from this last category.
As we do not observe the occupation of job seekers in their previous jobs, we cannot study
how mobile job seekers are in the occupational dimension.

3      Empirical strategy: difference in differences
Our preferred identification strategy relies on exogenous variations in the Potential Benefit
Duration (PBD) triggered by the 2009 reform of the Unemployment Insurance (UI) rules.
Whereas Figure 1 displayed the theoretical change in PBD, Figure 5 exhibits the variation
in PBD as we observe it in the data. More precisely we plot the α j coefficients from the
following regression

                  26                                                                        26

                  j =6                                                                      j =6


where i, n denotes the n-th unemployment spell of individual i. Tenurei,n is the number of
months worked in the 26 months before the beginning of this spell.14 A f teri,n is a dummy
variable equal to 1 if the last job before the claim terminated after March 31st 2009.

Figure 5 highlights that our identification strategy can be thought of as a difference-in-
difference analysis. For job seekers with past tenure equal to 7 months, 12 months and
23 months, PBD according to the 2009 rules is just 15 days over what it would have been
under the 2006 rules. These tenure groups constitute our control groups. All other tenure
groups experience larger changes in PBD. Several assumptions are needed to ensure that
our design actually identifies the effect of PBD.

The main assumption is the common trends assumption. Figure 6 presents a graphical
    14 The   past employment duration which is available in days in the data, is rounded down in number of
months.


                                                                                       14
check of the validity of this assumption. Because we have a continuous treatment, for the
purpose of this test only, we constitute two equal-sized groups based on the size of the
change triggered by the reform. The median change is a 30-day increase in PBD. We split
the sample between tenure groups that are above and below the median. For these two
groups, we plot in Figure 6 the evolution over time of the main outcomes of interest: the
reservation wage and the actual duration of benefits. The red line with squares shows the
evolution of these outcomes for workers whose tenure would make them lose from the
reform or gain less than 30 days. The blue line with triangles shows the evolution for
workers whose tenure would make them gain more than 30 days of PBD. Figure 6 shows
roughly parallel trends before the reform, for both outcomes. These graphs also preview
the results presented in the next section: the actual duration of benefits seems to be affected
by the reform whereas this is not obvious for the reservation wage.

One may be concerned that the difference-in-difference groups are defined according to
an endogenous variable: past tenure. We verify in Appendix Figure A3 that the tenure
distribution is similar over time and does not seem to be affected by the 2009 reform.15
In Section 4, we also show results of placebo tests that further confirm our identification
strategy.

Another concern is related to the differential selection of claimants after the Great Reces-
sion. For example, the 2008-2009 crisis may have triggered early separations of productive
individuals, thus affecting differently the average productivity of tenure groups. Our focus
on multiple spell individuals allows us to control for time-invariant unobserved hetero-
  15 Appendix Figure A4 shows a further test. We compute from the tenure distributions the average PBD

according to both the 2006 and 2009 rules. We show that the evolution of the average PBD according to both
rules is parallel over time.



                                                                    15
geneity, e.g. in productivity, and thus partly alleviates this concern.

Finally, the Stable Unit Treatment Value Assumption (SUTVA) states that each tenure group
is not affected by the fact that workers in other tenure groups are treated differently. Lalive
et al. (2015) show that UI affects equilibrium conditions on the labor market. Compared to
other reforms that have been studied, the 2009 reform is less likely to violate the SUTVA
as there are both winners and losers, so that the overall generosity of the system does not
change much.


4      Main results
In this section, we present our main estimates of the effect of the Potential Benefit Duration
(PBD) on the reservation wage, the actual benefit duration, and the other dimensions of
job selectivity. Then, we present an analysis of the heterogeneity of the effects according to
workers’ characteristics.


4.1     Reduced-form effect of the reform

We first estimate the reduced form effect of the reform, tenure group by tenure group.

                          26                                                         26
    log Yi,n =            ∑            β j D ( Tenurei,n = j) × A f teri,n +         ∑            δj D ( Tenurei,n = j)
                    j=6,excl.7,12,23                                           j=6,excl.7,12,23

                                                       + Xi,n γ + Year × QuarterF.E. + Indiv.F.E.i + νi,n (3)

Yi,n is either the reservation wage or the number of days of benefit receipt for the n-th claim
of individual i. Xi,n are job seeker’s observable characteristics. These include gender, age
and experience, age square and experience square, number of years of schooling, marital
status and number of children, a dummy for being foreign born, and dummies for 20 bins
of the previous wage.16 We also include dummy variables for the year × quarter at which
the previous job ended. We show the results with the individual controls and the year
× quarter fixed effects but the patterns are similar without these individual controls (and
replacing the time fixed effects by the time dummy for the reform A f teri,n ).

The main coefficients of interest in this regression are the β j s that capture the differential
evolution in the outcome of tenure group j after 2009, compared to that of almost unaffected
groups, i.e. groups with 7, 12 or 23 months of tenure.                   17    Figure 7 plots the β j s of each tenure
group against its corresponding change in PBD induced by the 2009 reform. In the upper
    16 Obviously,time-invariant characteristics only matter when we run specifications without individual fixed
effects.
   17 Figure A5 in the Appendix plots these coefficients.



                                                              16
panel, the reduced-form effects on the reservation wages are small in magnitude (below
0.01) and they do not seem to be related to the changes in PBD. This contrasts with the
positive slope in the lower panel. The reduced-form effects on the actual benefit duration
are positively related with the underlying change in PBD, and larger in magnitude. To sum
up, Figure 7 suggests that UI generosity has no effect on reservation wages, while it affects
unemployment duration.

4.2   Effect of PBD on the reservation wage and on the actual benefit duration

Using the notations previously introduced, we estimate the following model:

                                                        26
   log Yi,n = Indiv.F.E.i + α log PBDi,n +              ∑            δj D ( Tenurei,n = j)
                                                  j=6,excl.7,12,23

                                                                 + γXi,n + Year × QuarterF.E. + ei,n (4)

Table 4 shows the elasticity estimates (α) of the reservation wage in the upper panel, and
of the actual benefit duration in the lower panel. In Column (1), we report the elasticity
estimated by OLS without individual fixed effects. In Column (2), we use the 2009 reform
as an instrument for PBD. More precisely, we instrument log PBDi,n by the set of tenure
group dummies interacted with the dummy indicating that the reform has taken place:
∀ j ∈ [6, 26], D ( Tenurei,n = j) × A f teri,n . In Columns (3) and (4), we include individual
fixed effects, respectively in the OLS and IV estimations. In Columns (5) and (6), we report
the OLS and IV estimates on the full sample, without restricting it to multiple-spell job
seekers, and consequently without fixed effects. Standard errors are robust and clustered
by monthly tenure group in Columns (1) and (2).

The estimates of the elasticity of the reservation wage are not statistically different from


                                                       18
zero on the sample of multi-spell job seekers, whatever the specification. The estimation is
very precise, especially when individual fixed effects are introduced. The standard errors
in Columns (3) and (4) enable us to rule out that the elasticity is greater than 0.006, i.e the
upper bound of the 95% confidence interval. These findings are qualitatively identical on
the full sample.

We perform placebo tests, detailed in Appendix Table A2. We consider four placebo re-
forms dates: end of March 2007, 2008, 2010 and 2011. None of the placebo reforms yields
significant effects on the reservation wage, which supports the common trend assumption.

The absence of responsiveness of the reservation wage contrasts with that of the the actual
benefit duration. The estimates of the actual benefit duration elasticity range from 0.22
in Columns (1) and (2) to 0.33 when individual fixed effects are introduced in Columns
(3) and (4). All point estimates are statistically significant. The IV strategy hardly affects
these estimates. Introducing individual fixed effects increases the elasticity estimates by
50%. This points to positive selection into PBD. More productive individuals, who leave
unemployment faster, tend to have longer PBD. Overall, our elasticities are in line with the
literature: they are lower than the 0.5-0.6 elasticity reported in Schmieder et al. (2012a), but
higher than the usual 0.1-0.2 estimates of the elasticity of non-employment duration.

Job seekers with higher PBD find jobs at a slower rate even in the first weeks of unem-
ployment, period during which they declare their reservation wage. Table 5 shows the
effect of PBD on the job finding probability during the first five weeks of unemployment.
We report the estimate of α in equation (4), where we instrument PBD by the 2009 reform
on the sample of recurrent job seekers – our preferred specification. In the n-th column
of Table 5, the outcome variable is equal to one if the individual left the unemployment
registers and declared having found a job within n weeks after entering unemployment.
After the very first week, PBD decreases significantly (at the 5% level) the cumulative job
finding rates: from 1 percentage point in week 2 to more than 2 percentage points in week
5. These results suggest that job seekers react to PBD from the very beginning of the un-
employment spell and therefore that PBD is salient to them from the start. The absence of
responsiveness of reservation wages cannot be attributed to an overall lack of reaction by
the job seeker at the beginning of the spell.


4.3   Effect of PBD on other dimensions of job selectivity

Table 6 shows the effect of PBD on other job characteristics. We report the estimates of α
in Equation (4) where the outcome is: a dummy indicating whether the job seeker looks
for a long-term contract (Column 1), a dummy indicating whether she looks for a full-
time job (Column 2), a composite measure of the willingness of the job seeker to commute

(Column 3). We use our preferred specification, with the 2009 reform as an instrument and
controlling for individual fixed effects (and covariates).

At registration, job seekers can answer the question about mobility in terms of commuting
time or commuting distance. In Column (3), we use as an outcome the log of the commut-
ing time or commuting distance, controlling the declaration unit (kilometers or minutes).

Table 6 does not display any statistically significant coefficient relating to PBD. We can rule
out small effects of PBD on these extra dimensions of job selectivity. For example, a 10%
increase in PBD cannot trigger effects larger than 0.08 percentage points on the probability
to look for a long-term contract. These results are robust when we estimate the model by
OLS, with or without fixed effects (results available upon request).

4.4   Heterogeneity analysis

In this section, we analyze the heterogeneity of the effect and we show that job seekers who
have a tenure lower than the median and who thus face a shorter horizon before benefit
exhaustion react more to changes in PBD.
When the heterogeneity of the effect relates to time-invariant characteristics, we directly
use the fixed-effect specification in stratified samples. For characteristics such as tenure or
past wage which can vary across spells within individuals, we compute the average within
individuals across spells and split the sample at the median of this average value.
Table 7 reports the estimates of the PBD elasticity of the reservation wage (upper panel) and
of the actual benefit duration (lower panel) in various sub-samples. The elasticity estimates
are obtained according to our preferred estimation strategy, instrumenting PBD with the
2009 reform and controlling for individual fixed effects. Column (1) reports the elasticity
estimates for job seekers with an average past tenure below the median, which is 13 months.
Their elasticity of the reservation wage is around 0.01, and statistically significant. They
react more to changes in PBD presumably because their horizon before benefit exhaustion
is shorter : they face on average a PBD of 9 months whereas the average PBD of job seekers
with a past tenure above the median is 18 months. Consistently, the elasticity of the actual
benefit duration is higher for job seekers with lower tenure (Column 1) than for job seekers
with higher tenure (Column 2).
Note that the positive correlation between PBD elasticities of reservation wages and of
unemployment duration does not contradict the negative correlation between elasticities of
accepted wages and of unemployment duration highlighted in Nekoei and Weber (2017).
Indeed, negative duration dependence in unemployment does not drive down the elasticity
of reservation wage measured at the beginning of the spell.
When restricting our sample to claimants with low tenure, we analyze a sub-population
that experience a PBD shock closer to Nekoei and Weber (2017). They focus on 40-year-old
claimants who experience a PBD increase from 30 to 39 weeks. Our reservation wage elas-
ticity on the low-tenure sub-population (.01) is then in line with their elasticity of accepted
wages (.016).18 That being said, we still expect elasticities on reservation wages to be higher
than elasticity on accepted wages, as unemployment duration, which is increased by UI,
affects negatively job offer prospects.
We do not find any difference in the elasticity of the reservation wage across gender (Col-
umn (3) vs. Column (4) in Table 7). In the lower panel, the elasticity of the actual benefit
duration is higher for females than for males –a standard result in the literature on labor
  18 Nekoeiand Weber (2017) report that reemployment wages increase by .5% (Table 2 of their paper) when
PBD increases from 30 to 39 weeks (30%).


                                                  21
supply–, although the difference in elasticity is not statistically significant. Lastly we do
not find any difference in the elasticity of the reservation wage and of the actual benefit
duration, between low-wage and high-wage job seekers (Column (5) vs. Column (6)). This
is surprising as we would expect higher wage workers to be less constrained by the mini-
mum wage and thus to respond more to changes in PBD. However, high-wage job seekers
probably have higher job finding rates and higher past tenure, which also makes them less
responsive to changes in PBD.

5     Alternative empirical strategy: Regression Discontinuity De-
      sign
In this section, we consider an alternative identification strategy based on an age disconti-
nuity in Potential Benefit Duration (PBD) at age 50.

When workers are above 50 years old at the time of job separation, they benefit from a
more generous PBD schedule. Before 2009, when senior claimants had worked more than
27 months during the last 36 months, they were entitled to 1,095 days of benefits, i.e. 36
months. If they did not fulfill this criteria, they faced the step function schedule described
in Section 2. Starting in 2009, senior workers are entitled to as many days of benefits as
days worked within the last 36 months before job separation: the maximum PBD is thus
36 months. Consequently, senior workers with continuous work history over the last 3 years
before unemployment are entitled to benefits for a period that is 50% longer than that of
younger workers. Besides this difference in PBD schedule, UI rules are essentially the same

                                                    22
for claimants above and below 50 years old. In particular, the formula used to compute the
amount of benefits as a function of past wages is identical for senior and younger workers.


We select a sample of new claims filed between 2006 and 2012. We apply the same sample
restrictions as above, but do not restrict the sample to job seekers with multiple claims
over the period. We only keep claims filed by job seekers aged between 45 and 55, which
corresponds to a 10-year window around the RDD cutoff. In our sample, we estimate that
PBD is on average around 30% higher for claimants above 50 than below 50.
Figure 8 plots the distribution of the population in age bins that are one-month wide. This
reveals some missing mass just below 50 and extra mass just above the cutoff. We perform
the usual McCrary test and we estimate that the density is 8% higher just above the cutoff
– statistically significant at the 1% level.19

                                       Age (binned in month) at the end of the pre-U employment spell



We also find some discontinuities in the distribution of covariates around the threshold.
Appendix Table A3 shows that workers laid off just after 50 years old are more educated
and are paid higher wages. This is consistent with some manipulation of the running
variable, i.e. age at the separation date. Manipulation is a serious threat to the RDD
identification strategy. This is the reason why we only consider the RDD as an alternative
strategy and the next results as suggestive. Yet we find it reassuring that they are consistent
with the main results obtained with the difference-in-difference strategy.
 19 The   bandwidth used to perform the test is around 2 years.


                                                                 23
Lalive (2007) and Schmieder et al. (2012a) also report cases of manipulation in the context of
UI rules based on age. To address this issue, we follow the same strategy as Schmieder et al.
(2012a) and we exclude the observations that are just around the age cutoff.20 This is a valid
correction as long as manipulation is a local matter. There are no theoretical guidelines to
choose the size of the window around the cutoff where we exclude observations. Visual
inspection of the density of the running variable plotted in Figure 8 suggests that the
manipulation window would be between 3 months before and 3 months after the cutoff.
We vary the size of the window to test the robustness of our estimates.

Figure 9 plots PBD and the outcomes of interest against age at job separation excluding
individuals between 49.75 and 50.25 years old. The upper panel shows that the distribution
of reservation wages seems continuous on either side of the cutoff whereas the lower panel
shows that the size of the discontinuity in PBD is around 30% as already mentioned above
and that there is a discontinuity in the actual duration of benefits at the cutoff.

For the estimation, we consider the fuzzy RD design where the treatment is the log of PBD.
This framework enables us to interpret our estimates as elasticities with respect to PBD. We
estimate the following model using the dummy 1( age ≥ 50) indicating that the claimant is
over 50 years old (at job separation) as an instrument.

 log Yi = α + δ log PBD + P0 ( agei − 50) × 1( agei < 50) + P1 ( agei − 50) × 1( agei ≥ 50) + ei
                                                                                                            (5)
where P0 (.) and P1 (.) are polynomials whose coefficients are estimated (without constant).
We follow the common practice and we use local polynomial regression. The bandwidth
of the local estimation is selected according to Calonico et al. (2014). We also follow the
methods they recommend for bias correction and robust standard error correction.

Table 8 reports the estimates of the elasticities δ on samples trimmed in different ways (see
columns). The upper panel reports the estimates of the elasticity of the reservation wage,
while the lower panel reports those of the elasticity of the actual benefit duration. The
elasticity of the reservation wage is not statistically significant, whatever the size of the
excluded region around the cutoff. This contrasts with the elasticity of benefit duration,
which is around 0.2 and statistically different from zero. This confirms the main results of
Section 4: inelastic reservation wage and responsive benefit duration. We also find that the
effects of PBD on other dimensions of the reservation strategy, such as the desired type of
labor contract or number of hours or the maximum commute accepted, are not statistically
different from zero (results available on request).

 20 Lalive   (2007) finds that only women manipulate their age to benefit from more generous entitlement.

    on these averages - the solid line.

Appendix Table A3 tests for discontinuities in covariates, when observations around the
threshold are excluded. Any discontinuities disappear as the bandwidth of the trimmed
sample around the cutoff increases. In Appendix Table A4, we further show that includ-
ing covariates as controls in the RDD estimation hardly affects the estimated elasticities
reported in Table 8. Finally, we conduct placebo tests at every age from 44 to 54. Appendix
Table A5 shows no significant discontinuities at every placebo age.


6   Interpretation
In a simple job search model, the job finding rate (or hazard rate) h is the product of
the probability to receive an offer e and the probability to accept this offer given one’s
reservation wage ψ.
                                               h = e F̄ (ψ)                                  (6)

where F (.) is the cumulative distribution function of wage offers.

When the potential benefit duration T changes, the probability to receive an offer may
change, as job seekers adjust their search effort. The probability to accept the offer may
change as well, as job seekers update their reservation wages. Given equation (6), there
exists a mechanical relationship between the elasticities of h, e and ψ with respect to the
potential benefit duration.
                                                        f (ψ)ψ
                                      eh,T = ee,T −             eψ,T                         (7)
                                                         F̄ (ψ)
where ey,T is the elasticity of variable y with respect to the potential benefit duration T, and


                                                   26
f (.) is the density of wage offers.
Using equation (7), we would like to assess the extent to which the elasticity of the reser-
vation wage explains the elasticity of the hazard rate. For this empirical exercise, we will
use the elasticities êh,T and êψ,T we have estimated in the previous sections, as well as the
distribution of wages obtained by job seekers newly employed.21 Taking the average value
of the reservation wage, we find that the empirical equivalent of ψ f (ψ)/ F̄ (ψ) is close to
3.22 For the empirical value of the elasticity of the hazard rate to potential benefit duration,
we can either consider the elasticity of unemployment duration (Table 4, column 4, second
panel), or the elasticity of the job finding rate in the first weeks of the spell (Table 5). Both
give a value of êh,T around -.3.23 Taking the upper bound value of the 95% confidence of
the elasticity of êψ,T , equal to .006, we find that the response of the reservation wage (-.018)
represents at most 6% of the elasticity of the hazard rate (êh,T =-.3), so that the search
margin would represent at least 94%. Considering the median reservation wage instead of
the mean leads to an even smaller role for the reservation wage: at most 3.5%.


7      Conclusion
Despite a significant and non negligible effect of the Potential Benefit Duration (PBD) on
actual benefit duration, there is almost zero effect of PBD on the reservation wage and
other dimensions of job selectivity at the start of the unemployment spell. The elasticity of
reservation wages is insignificant and we can rule out that it is larger (in absolute value)
than 0.006, which means that being entitled to 1 additional month of benefits for a claimant
with an initial PBD of 10 months is associated with at most a 0.06% increase in the reser-
vation wage. The lack of responsiveness of reservation wages to changes in UI echoes the
results of Krueger and Mueller (2016) who find that reservation wages adjust at a very slow
rate along the unemployment spells.
The question of why reservation wages react so little to changes in UI remains open. We
see at least two explanations that are worth further explorations. First, job seekers may
have reference-dependent behaviors (Koenig et al., 2014; DellaVigna et al., 2016). They may
anchor their reservation wages on their past wages, which would limit the responsiveness
of reservation wages. Second, job seekers may have biased beliefs about their employment
prospects. Over-optimistic job seekers, who consider that job offers arrive at a high arrival
    21 Because
             we work on claimants with multiple spells, we can observe in the administrative data the past
wage relating to the second unemployment spell, which we consider a good proxy for the hiring wage after
the first unemployment spell.
  22 We take ψ = 1.2, i.e. 20% higher than the legal minimum wage, and we find in the empirical distribution

of wages that f (1.2) = 1.92 and F̄ (1.2) = .76.
  23 Considering the elasticity of unemployment duration gives ê
                                                                       h,T = .306. Considering the elasticity of the
job finding rate, for example in the three first weeks, gives êh,T = -.0165/.044 = -.375.


                                                        27
rate, might also react too little to changes in PBD, as they underestimate their likelihood to
exhaust benefits (Spinnewijn, 2015). Exploring these possibilities are promising directions
for future work.

A last natural question concerns the extent to which empirical measures of reservation
wages inform us about the welfare cost of unemployment (Shimer and Werning, 2007).
Answering this question is essential in order to assess how useful our elasticity of reserva-
tion wage is to the design of optimal UI.

A    Appendix: Consequences of rounding
In this Appendix, we discuss the consequences of rounding in the reservation wages on our
identification. First, we explore potential biases taking an analytical perspective. Second,
we quantify its importance using Monte-Carlo simulations.

We are not in the standard case of classical measurement error in a covariate. We consider
measurement error on the reservation wage, which is the main outcome (left-hand side
variable), and rounding is a non-classical measurement error, as the difference between the
true variable and its proxy is not independent of the true running variable.

First, we clarify the potential bias from an analytical perspective. We denote Y ∗ the true
unobserved outcome. We assume that we only observe Y, obtained after rounding to the
nearest hundreds. We have Y = v + Y ∗ , where v = Y − Y ∗ is the measurement error. We
assume that the true data generating process is such that: Y ∗ = βX + u where Y ∗ and X
are centered and u is an error term uncorrelated to X. Because of the measurement error,
we can only estimate the following model: Y = β̃X + w. After some algebra, the OLS
                            cov(v,X )
estimate of β is β̃ = β +    var ( X )
                                       .   The measurement error will induce a bias if and only
if the rounding error v is correlated with X (i.e. PBD in our case), which has a priori no
reason to be true.

Second, we run some simulations to check what happens in practice with plausible data
generating processes. We draw the PBD in 1 + 7U 1/2 , where U is a uniform between 0
and 1, which generates a Pareto between 8 and 24, and the wage is a log-normal with the
first and last deciles equal to 800 and 3700. We set the elasticity of the wage to PBD to
0.2. Then, we build a version of the wage rounded to the hundreds. For the Monte-Carlo
simulation, we generate 1,000 samples of size 10,000. For each sample, we estimate the
elasticity of the wage wrt PBD and the elasticity of the rounded wage wrt PBD. Figure
A1 shows the distributions of the elasticity estimates without and with rounding: both
distributions look extremely similar. In Figure A2, we compute for each simulation the
difference between elasticity estimates with and without rounding – the bias – and we plot
the distribution of biases. The bias is very close to zero (magnitude 100 times lower than
the original elasticity). The measurement error induced by rounding the outcome is likely
not to be a first-order issue in our case.

Source: FNA-FH (Pole emploi). Note: Each panel plots the distribution of the past tenure for the inflow of
claimants who loose their job between the 1st of April of year N and the 31st of March of Year N+1. Thus the
3 first distributions are pre reform and the 3 last are post reform.

Source: FNA-FH (Pole emploi). Note: for each claimant, we compute, from her tenure, her PBD according
to the 2006 rules and the 2009 rules. We then average each PBD over quarter. This translates the actual
tenure distribution into potential treatment intensity. The Figure shows that there are no changes in the tenure
distribution that would imply a change in treatment intensity on top of the reform shock.

Yi,n is either the reservation wage or the number of days of benefit receipt for the n-th claim of individual
i. Xi,n controls for the job seeker’s observable characteristics. These include gender, age and experience, age
square and experience square, number of years of schooling, marital status and number of children, a dummy
for being foreign born, and dummies for 20 bins of the previous wage. We also include dummy variables for
the year × quarter at which the previous job ended.

    Note: Robust standard errors in parentheses. *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. This Table reports the
    placebo tests. To avoid contamination, we split our main sample into two subsamples: before and
    after the 2009 reform. We use the before subsample to test for potential effects of placebo reforms
    at the end of March 2007 (Column 1) and of March 2008 (Column 2). We use the after subsample in
    Columns (3) and (4). In each column, we estimate the fixed effects model (2) where we replace actual
    PBD by a placebo PBD and we instrument the placebo PBD by tenure group dummies interacted
    with a dummy indicating whether the separation date is after the placebo reform date. For example,
    in Column (1), the placebo PBD is equal to the PBD according to the 2006 rules for claimants who
    register before the 31st of March 2007 and it is equal to the PBD according to the 2009 rules for
    claimants who register after the 1st of April 2007.
