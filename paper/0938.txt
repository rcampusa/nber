         Pension Funding Decisions, Interest Rate
                Assumptions and Share Prices

                         ABSTRACT



         This paper explores how unfunded pension obligations

affect the market values of firms. Firms appear to choose the

interest rate they use in discounting future benefit obligations

so as to balance the tax advantages of a low rate against the more

healthy looking annual reports a high rate allows. Investors seem

to penetrate this ruse and value firms as if obligations were figured

at a standard rate. The rate thus used seems to be much lower than

current long term interest rates. Pension liabilities are therefore

overemphasized by the market. There is also some evidence that

pension assets are undervalued. This suggests that growth of the

private pension system might increase savings by investors and

firms.

           The effect of pension obligations on share prices is of intrinsic

 interest to anyone concerned with the efficiency of capital markets and the

 nature of corporate financial decisions. More generally, however, the ability

 of share prices to reflect unfunded pension obligations is an important link in

 the effect of private pensions on national saving (Feldstein, 1978). If

unfunded obligations are not fully reflected in share prices, the equity owners

will be induced to increase their consumption incorrectly and national saving

will be lower than it would be with correct perceptions.

          This paper uses a new body of data on corporate pensions to evaluate

how unfunded pension liabilities influence the value of corporate equities and

to begin an empirical examination of the corporate decision not to fund pension

obligations fully. The important and novel feature of the new data is infor-

mation on the interest rate assumed by each firm in evaluating the present value

of its pension obligations.1 Before such interest rate information became

available, it was difficult to interpret and compare differences among firms in

the extent of unfunded pension obligations. In a previous study, Feldstein and

seligman (1981) warned that the heterogeneity of interest rate assumptions was

the source of a potentially serious problem in measuring the key variable in

their study of the effect of unfunded pension liabilities on share prices.1

The new data make it possible to assess the importance of this source of bias

and to examine whether the market takes the differences in interest rate assump-

tions into account in evaluating pension liabilities.

          To understand the link between national saving and the effect of pen-

sion obligations on share prices, it is useful to consider the effect of a firm

that obtains lower present wages in exchange for a promise of future pension

benefits with the same present value but does not fund the resu)ting pension

obligation. As a result, the firm reports higher earnings and adds the earnings

to its capital stock. Over time, the firm's capital stock is increased by an

amount equal to its unfunded pension obligation. If shareholders correctly per-

ceive the unfunded obligation, they will recognize that the change in the form

of employee compensation has not made the shareholders any wealthier and their

consumption will remain unchanged. The net effect of the pension on national

saving will therefore be the difference between the firm's additional retained

earnings and the reduction in the employees' direct personal saving that is

induced by the promise of retirement benefits.2 If, however, the share price

understates the unfunded pension obligation, shareholders will regard themselves

as wealthier, increase their consumption, and thus reduce national saving by a



  1The same problem also affects the share prices studies of Gersovitz (1980)
   and Oldfield (1977) as well as any other study that uses the reported values
   of pension liabilities..

  21fl the extreme case in which employees reduce direct personal saving by a
   dollar for every dollar of present value of promised pension benefits, the
   introduction of the pension would have no effect on total saving.

                           1
 corresponding   amount.

            The effect of unfunded pension obligations has attracted attention

 not only because a significant fraction of the pension obligations of some firms

 are now unfunded but also because alternative legal funding requirements could

 increase the extent to which pension obligations are not explicitly funded.

Current ERISA (Employee Retirement Income Security Act) and tax rules require

companies to fund their pension obligations over a period of years and permit a

deduction in the calculation of taxable income only for the amount contributed -

to   a fund. An alternative rule would be a "book reserving" system in which a

firm would not be obliged to fund its pension obligation but could deduct for

tax purposes the present value of a pension obligation that it assumes even if

it does not fund that obligation as long as it reports the obligation on its

"books" (i.e., balance sheet) and finds an appropriate organization like an

insurance company or bank to "guarantee" that pension obligation. The national

savings impact of unfunded pensions of this type would depend on the ability of

share prices to reflect the accumulating liability and therefore to prevent

shareholders from increasing their consumption in response to the apparent but

artificial increase in the net assets of the firm.

           In considering a firm's pension obligations, it is important to

distinguish vested benefits from other types of expected pension payments. The

vested benefits are those that will be paid to existing retirees and that would

have to be paid to current employees even if they left the firm immediately. In

addition to these vested benefits, there are also two other types of benefits

that a firm or its shareholders might take into account. First, "unvested



 11n the special case referred to in the previous footnote, the provision of a
  private pension could actually reduce national saving.
                                      -4-


accrued pension benefits" refer to the benefits that current employees have
earned on the basis of their service with the firm but which have n4t yet become

vested. Second, firms also look ahead and, on the basis of expected employee

turnover and projected wages, estimate the pension benefits that current

employees are likely to receive when they retire. Firms may use this very broad

concept of benefits based on past and future employment for the purpose of

determining the tax—deductible contributions that they can make to their pension

fund. Pension assets can therefore exceed both vested pension liabilities and

total past service liabilities.

         Focusing on the vested pension benefits is important for two reasons.

First, vested benefits are the only legal obligation of the firm and have been

the principal concern of financial analysts who discuss pension obligations.

Moreover, as Bulow (1979, 1981) has explained, the cost to the firm of any non—

vested pension benefits can in principle be offset by corresponding reductions

in wage payments as those benefits become vested. However, as Feldatein and

Seligman note, it is not clear to what extent such wage adjustments are actually

made in practice or taken into account by financial analysts. It is noteworthy,

though, that while firms are required to report values for vested benefit obli-

gations and sometimes report values for other past service liabilities, the

broader measure of total expected liabilities is not reported.

          Most of the estimates presented in this paper refer to the difference

between vested pension liabilities and pension assets. The "unfunded vested

pension liability" (uvPL) reported by the firms in our sample is in fact nega-

tive for more than two—thirds of the firms in our basic sample (92 of 132

firms reported negative UIIPL), implying that their pension fund assets exceed their
                                      —5—



vested liabilities. Moreover, the aggregate value of pension assets of the firm

in our sample exceed the aggregate value of vested pension liabilities. Some

analyses using the broader measure of total unfunded accrued pension liabilities

(UAPr) will also be reported. For this variable, 62 percent of the firms in

our basic sample reported a negative value.1

          Those firms with negative unfunded liabilities have accumulated more

in pension assets than the present value of the pension benefits that they have

promised to their employees. If these benefit promises establish an upper limitS

on the extent to which the pensions depress private saving,2 the "superfunded"

pensions are potential net contributors to national saving. The extent to which

superfunded pensions do increase national saving depends on the response of

shareholders. To the extent that share prices ignore the value of these excess

reserves, the extra corporate pension fund accumulations will not be offset by

reduced shareholder saving.

          Our analysis will generally treat underfunded and superfunded pension

liabilities symmetrically by using a single variable to represent the net liabi-

lity of firms. In section 4 we will however examine this symmetry assumption

explicitly.

          The first section of the paper discusses the data that we use and

the basic specification of the corporate valuation equations that are estimated



 1When the pension liabilities are reevaluated using the market interest rate
  in$tead of the lower values assumed by the companies in their calculations,
  significantly higher fractions of the companies had assets that exceeded their
  liabilities. Using the Baa bond rate prevailing at the end of the sample year
  suggests that virtually all firms in the sample had pension assets in excess
  of both vested and part service liabilities.

       need not be true if employees reduce their own saving to offset the
  benefits that they anticipate on the basis of their expected future
  employment experience and not just the benefits rights that they have
  already accumulated.

in this paper. In section 2 we present the basic estimates of the effect on

firms' market values of the net unfunded pension liabilities that the firms

report. The third section then discusses the importance of the alternative

interest rate assumptions used in calculating the present value of liabilities

and presents alternative estimates based on the use of a common interest rate

for all firms.

          The analysis in sections 2 and 3 estimate linear relations between the

market value of the firm and the net unfunded pension liabilities. Section 4

considers two generalizations of this basic specification: separate effects of

pension assets and of liabilities, and different effects of positive and nega-

tive unfunded liabilities.

          The fifth section provides some evidence on why firms choose different

interest rate assumptions for valuing pension liabilities and, more generally,

why firms have different unfunded pension liabilities.

          There is a brief concluding section that summarizes the fundings, com-

ments on the implication for national saving, and indicates some possible direc-

tions for future research.


1. The Specification and Data

          The framework for our analysis is a valuation model that relates the

market value of the firm per dollar of its physical capital to several basic

determinants of market value including the firm's unfunded pension liability.

The basic specification is thué the same as that used in Feldatein and Seligman

(1981) and therefore builds on earlier studies of market valuation by Gordon

(1962), Modigliani and Miller (1958), Oldfield (1977), Tobin and Brainard (1977)

and others.
                                      -7-


          Under certain strict conditions, the market value (v) of a firm's

equity and debt will be equal to the replacement value of its underlying physi-

cal assets (A). More generally, however, the marginal and average values of

physical assets will not be the same1 and even the marginal value of an addi-

tional amount of physical capital will differ from one if there are distor—

tionary taxes2 or if the firm's capital stock is not in equilibrium.

Differences among firms in the observed valuation ratio, q = V/A   ,   will   reflect

perceived differences in the firms' abilities to provide above—average earnings

and in the riskiness of their earnings and asset value.

          The potential earning ability of a firm depends on such things as

market position, patents, know—how, etc. The specification used in the present

study represents future earnings by three variables: (1) the current ratio of

earnings to physical assets, E/A , where    E includes interest payments as well

as equity profits;3 (2) the growth of earnings over the past decade,4 GROW; and

(3) expenditure on research and developnent as a fraction of the value of the

firm's physical assets (RD/A)



  1Hayashi (1981) shows the conditions under which the marginal and average
   value of capital which are equal.

 2Auerbach (1979), Feldstein and Green (1980) and King (1977) discuss the
  effect of taxes on the market value of marginal additions to the capital
  stock.

     would in principle be desirable to, adjust E by adding to it the difference
  between the firm's pension contribution and the increase in vested benefits
  during the year. Such an adjustment would be unlikely to have a substantial
  effect since completely omitting E or GROW or both does not change the
  implied effect of UVPL/A.

 4mis variable is defined in the same way as it was in Feldstein and Seligman:
  the difference between average earnings in the most recent five years and
  average earnings in the previous five years divided by the 1979 value of physi-
  cal assets in the final years of this ten year period.

          The capital asset pricing model implies that the risk of investment in

a firm's equity should be measured by the beta coefficient measure of the sen-

sitivity of the firm's share price to the value of the total market portfolio.

The beta value for a firm depends on how broadly the "total market portfolio" is

defined (equities Only; all financial assets; all investment assets including

land, gold, etc.) and on the frequency of the observations used for calculatin€

the beta coefficient (daily, monthly, annual, etc.). The present study employs

the widely available beta values based on monthly observations and an equity

market portfolio that is calculated by Merrill, Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Smith.

          A second measure of risk included in the current study is the ratio of

the net debt1 to total capital, DEBT/A .    A higher debt ratio increases the risk

of bankruptcy and limits the firm's ability to undertake potentially profitable

investment activities.

          Since unfunded vested pension liabilities are a form of corporate

debt,3 they should in principle be included with other debt in measuring the

market value of the firm (v) and in calculating the net DEBT variable. If the

pension liability of the firm were accurately measured,4 the unfunded vested

liability could be added directly to the market value of conventional debt or,


  1Net debt is defined as total financial liabilities minus financial assets.
   Short term assets and liabilities are included at book value but long term
   liabilities are revalued by assuming that they have a remaining maturity of
   ten years and pay a nine percent coupon rate but are valued to have the
   1979 year-end yield to maturity of about 12 percent. For many firms in our
   sample net debt is actually negative; financial assets including cash and
   accounts receivable exceed financial liabilities.

 2See Gordon and Nalkiel (1979) and Myers (1977).

 31f the unfunded liability is negattve, it actually represents a financial
  asset or "negative debt."

 4See section one of Feldstein and Seligman (1981) for a discussion   of the
  problems of pension liability measurement and the inadequacies of   the
  reported estimates. Note in particular that unfunded liabilities    are tax
  deductible when funded or paid. Similarly, until liabilities are    paid,
  the relevant interest rate is a net of tax rate.
                                              —9-


equivalently,       could be included on the right hand side of the equation (divided

by the replacement value of physical assets) where the expected value of its

coefficient would be minus one. More generally, however, the coefficient of the

observed unfunded vested pension liability variable (UVPL/A) reflects the

errors in the measurement of unfunded pension liabilities and the stock market's

ability to perceive and reflect the existing liabilities.

             The specification of the market valuation equation is thus:


                       +                                              DEBT       UVPL
(1)                             +    GROW +         + cç   BETA +            +          +



where    c represents      a   random error. The values of ct1, c&      and        are

expected    to   be positive and the values of      c.4
                                                          and       and expected to be

negative.        The sign of c* (the coefficient of the debt variable) is uncertain.
In    a strict Modigliani—Miller world, c would be zero. More generally, the

increased risks of bankruptcy and the adverse effect of debt on investment

opportunities would imply that             is negative. However, if the tax        factors
discussed by Auerbach (1979) and King (1977) make the value of V/A less than

one for equity while the value of V/A for debt is equal to one, firms with

higher ratios of debt to physical assets will have higher values of V/A and

      may be positive.

            As we noted in the introduction, our analysis will examine both the

unfunded vested pension obligations and the broader measure of the total

unfunded accrued liabilities (UAPL/A).

            The specification of equation 1 assumes that the valuation ratio

(q)    is the same for debt and equity. If, because of tax or risk factors, a

dollar of retained earnings is not worth the same amount as a dollar of capital

financed by debt, it would be more appropriate to analyze the effect of pension
                                     -10-



liabilities on the equity value of the firm (yE) .   This alternative equity
value equation may be written


(2)        =
               ftj   iH    2GROWE+            ftBETA+   DEBT UVPL

where AE is the "equity value" of the physical assets (i.e., the replacement

value of the physical assets minus the value of the net debt and of the pre-

ferred shares), EE is the equity earnings of the firm, and GROWE Is the ten—

year growth of equity earnings. For this purpose, EE is defined as profits

after tax plus the equity owners' real gain or loss on net financial assets

(i.e., the product of the inflation rate and the firm's net financial debt).

          Our analysis is based on data for a sample of large manufacturing

firms for 1979. The construction of most of the variables uses the data in the

Standard and Poor's Compustat file. Three factors limit the size of the available

sample. First, since comparable information on earnings for the decade from

1970 through 1979 must be available, firms that were engaged in significant

merger activity had to be eliminated. Second, the interest rate assumed in the

pension liability calculation was only available for 1979 for some firms.

Third, the information required for inflation adjustment (described below) was

not available for all firms. These data requirements and the elimination of a

few statistical outliers reduced the sample to 132 firms.

         Economists have long recognized that accounting data for assets and

earnings can be very misleading in a period of inflation like the 1970's.

Beginning with 1976, firms were required to provided information on the replace-

ment value of the firm's capital stock and on the effect of inflation on the

value of accounting depreciation and inventory costs. With this information and
                                      —11—



an estimate of the inflation gain on net financial liabilities, it is possible

to estimate an inflation adjusted measure of accounting profits. This was the

procedure found in the earlier Feldstein-Seligman analysis for 1976 and 1977.

          Despite the accounting requirement to provide inflation—adjusted

information and the widespread recognition of the distortions created by

inflation, most financial analysts have continued to focus exclusively on the

traditional accounting measures of assets and income. One important indication

of this tendency to disregard the inflation—adjusted data is that by 1979 the

Standard and Poors corporation no longer included the inflation adjusted

accounts in its Compustat File.

          Since we are concerned with market valuation and the perception of the

financial community, we have done our analysis with the conventional accounting

data as well as with data adjusted for inflation. Since the inflation—adjusted

data are not available in the Compustat file, we have approximated the inflation

correction for 1979 by using data for 1980 collected from individual annual

reports by Daniel Smith and Lawrence Summers and then deflated to the 1979

level. One of the principal accounting distortions caused by inflation is the

misstatement of inventory costs for firms that use FIFO inventory accounting.

As a further check on our results, we also present estimates only for those

firms that used LIFO as the primary method of inventory evaluation.

          We are aware of the difficulty of making valid inferences about the

effect of unfunded pension liabilities on the basis of equations like 1 and 2.

Any omitted variables will bias the estimated coefficient. If, for example,

large unfunded vested liabilities are characteristic of financially weak corn—

panies, the estimates of    and    would reflect this weakness and be biased
                                     —12—


away from —1. Moreover, firms can to some extent influence the size of their

reported liabilities by the interest rate assumption that they choose.

          A finding that the coefficient of the pension liability variable is

substantially different from —1 must therefore be treated with substantial

caution since the difference may reflect statistical bias rather than a failure

of the financial market to appraise the extent of a firm's pension obligations.

In contrast, a finding that the pension liability, variable has a coefficient of

approximately -1 would be reassuring support for the view that the financial

market correctly assesses pension liabilities since finding the appropriate

answer by chance alone, although possible, would be very unlikely.


2. Effects of Unfunded Pension Liabilities

         This section presents the basic estimates of the effects on the value

of the firm of the net pension liabilities as reported by the firms. The

next section discusses the importance of the interest rate assumption used in

valuing pension liabilities and their presents parameter estimates based on

alternative revaluated pension liabilities. The estimates in section 4 examine

several general specifications of the relation between pension liabilities and

the firm's market value.

          Equation 1.1 of Table 1 reports the estimated coefficients

corresponding to the specification of equation 1 in the previous section of this

paper. The sample contains all 132 firms and uses inflation adjusted accounting

measures of income and assets. The mean of the dependent variable, the ratio of

the firm's market value to the current value of its physical assets, is 0.87.

          Before discussing the coefficient of the pension variable, it is use-

ful to comment on the coefficients of the other variables.

earnings,   E) perdollar of physical assets increases the market value of those

assets. An extra dollar of current earnings adds approximately two dollars

to the market value of the firm. The coefficient of GROW suggests that a higher

rate of past increase of earnings may lead to a higher market value but the

coefficient is smaller than its standard error.1 Companies that spend more

on research and development have significantly greater market value, a rela-

tionship that should be interpreted with care since it presumably reflects the

market's valuation of the general character of companies that spend more on

research rather than a direct effect of research spending on the firm's market

value. All three of these effects are similar to the estimates for 1976 and

1971   reported   in Feldstein and Seligman.

            A greater riskiness of the firm, as measured by its beta coefficient,

depresses the firm. This is consistent with the theoretical implications of the

capital asset pricing model, although contrary to the insignificant effect round for

1976 and 1971. The weak positive effect of leverage on the firm's total value is

also contrary to the earlier Feldstein—Seligman finding. One possible exp1nation of

this difference is that the sharp increase in inflation (the consumer price index

rose 14.8 percent and 6.8 percent in 1976 and 1977 but 13.3 percent in 1979) might

have raised the equity value of the firms with greater net debt (Summers, 1982).

            The coefficient of the unfunded vested liability variable (UvPL/A) is

—1.143 with a standard error of 0.82. The effect is thus clearly signifi-

cantly negative and not significantly different from minus one. By coincidence,

this coefficient is almost identical to the 1977 value of l.1414 (standard error


   1The measures Of earnings and earnings growth should be adjusted by adding
    the pension expenses and subtracting the increase in accrued pension
    liability. This correction is not possible with the data available for
    a single year. It is reassuring therefore that the estimated effect of
    unfunded vested pension liabilities is not affected by completely omitting
    both E and GROW from the equation.

0.47) reported by Feldstein and Seligman (1981). The estimate is consistent with the

view that the financial market accepts the conventional measure of the net unfunded

vested pension liability and reduces the market value of the firm by an equal amount.1

            Broadening the definition of unfunded liabilities from vested liabili-

ties to accrued liabilities (equation 1.2) leaves all of the parameter estimates

essentially unchanged. The coefficient of UAPL/A is —1 .42 with a standard error

of 0.65. The suni of squared residuals (SsR =   13.18) is slightly smaller than
the corresponding SSR for the vested pension liability, suggesting that the         -


financial   market may give more weight to the broader means of pension liabilities.

            One purpose of the inflation adjustment is to correct the understate-

ment of production costs for firms that do not use the last—in—first—out (LIFO)

method of inventory accounting. By 1979, the inflation adjustment had become

extremely important; for all nonfinancial corporations as a whole, the inflation

adjustment was more than 60 percent of real after tax profits. As a further

check, we therefore estimated the basic equation for the subset of 85 firms that

used LIFO as the primary method of inventory accounting. The results, presented

in equations 1.3 and 1.4, are essentially the same as for the entire sample.

            Although our emphasis is on the estimates using inflation adjusted

data for earnings and assets, we recognize that the financial community con-

tinues to rely primarily on conventional accounting data. We have therefore

reestimated the basic equations using the conventional accounting figures; the

results are shown in equations 1.5 and 1.6.2 The estimates of the unfunded pen-

 interpretation. Nevertheless, while coefficients not significantly different from
  —1 could occur by chance in the current and previous study, we regard that as
  unlikely.

2The mean of the dependent variable is 1.30, substantially higher than the
 inflation—adjusted value.

siori   liability   variables are essentially unchanged; they are slightly larger

than with the inflation—adjusted data but the difference is less than one stan-

dard error. Earnings, earnings-growth and debt appear to have a larger effect

on the value of the corporation and the level of research and development

spending has a smaller effect. The unfunded accrued liabilities continue to

have slightly greater explanatory power than the unfunded vested liabilities.

             The   second   set of six equations in Table 1 are based on the equity

value of the firm and used the specification of equation 2 in section 1.1         The

coefficients of the four equations estimated with inflation—adjusted data

(equations 1.7 through 1.10) are essentially identical to the corresponding

coefficients based on the market valueof debt and equity (equation 1.1

through 1.4). This similarity of results with the two specifications was

also found for 1976 and 1977 in the earlier study by Feldstein and Seligman.

When the conventional accounting data are used without adjustment for inflation

(equation 1.11 and 1.12), the coefficients of the unfunded pension liability

variables are reduced substantially to approximately -0.7 and are about equal in

size to their standard errors. On the basis of these two coefficients alone,

one could not reject the hypothesis that the true parameter is either zero or

minus one. Although we regard the instability of the coefficients estimated

with conventional accounting data as evidence against relying on such data

without inflation adjustment, we recognize that these estimates can also be

 stock and AE      is the
                     difference between the value of property, plant, equipment
 and inventories and the firm's net debt. The mean of this variable is 0.82
 when the data are inflation adjusted and 1.54 when they are not inflation
 adjusted.

 interpreted as raising some doubt about the conclusion that the coefficient of

 the pension variable is significantly negative. We shall therefore continue to

present estimates in the later sections of' the paper based on the conventional

accounting data as well as on the data which has been adjusted for inflation.


3. Alternative Interest Rate Assumptions

            It has been customary for pension actuaries to assume   a   low rate of

interest in calculating the present value of pension liabilities.       Thus the

average interest rate assumed by the 132 firms in our sample was only 7.3

percent,   far less than the 12.1 percent rate on Baa bonds that prevailed at the

end of 1979 or the 10.7 percent average Baa rate for the year 1979 as a whole.1

Using a low discount rate increases the present value of vested pension benefits

and therefore of the unfunded pension liability.

           In considering the effect of the interest rate assumption, it is

important to distinguish between vested pension liabilities and the total future

pension benefits thata firm expects to pay to its current employees and on the

basis of which it may legally determine its funding contributions.       In esti-

mating the total future pension benefits, the firm must project the employees'

future wage growth (as well as the probabilities of death and of employment

separation.) The typical pension benefit formula relates an individual's

retirement benefits to his wage during a year or a few year's immediately before


  Despite the tax advantage of investing pension funds exclusively in debt
  instruments ('Black, 1980, Tepper, 1980), most pensions invest in both debt
  and equity and, considering the greater risk of equity as a method of funding
  nominal liabilities, expect to earn an even higher nominal return on equity.
  It might, however, be argued that the appropriate rate for discounting future
  liabilities is a risk—free rate, with any extra return going to shareholders
  as compensation for assuming the portfolio risk while guaranteeing the bene-
  fits. But even a 10 year U.S. Treasury bond had a 1979 year—end yield of
  10.4 percent.
                                     -18-




retirement. The present value at any time in an employee's career of the bene-

fits that he will be paid during his first year of retirement depends on the

difference between the discount rate and the projected rate of growth of wages.

Since pension actuaries have generally assumed a low rate of wage growth, the

use of a low discount rate may not produce as substantial a bias in their esti-

mates of total future pension liabilities as it might at first appear. The

value of benefits to be paid after retirement, however, depends only on the

discount rate, implying that the present value of total future pension benefits

is typically overstated.

         Vested pension benefits depend only on an employee's previous        0




experience with the firm. Although that experience will entitle the employee to
greater future benefits if he stays with the firm,1 the future annual value of

his benefit is fixed if he leaves the firm immediately. Thus, in calculating

the present value of vested benefits, the likely future growth of wages is

irrelevant. The assumptions of an artificially low interest rate unambiguoi.sly

raises the value of vested pension liabilities.2 The same upward bias occurs in

the calculations of the present value of unvested benefits based on past service

and therefore on the total accrued pension liability.




    typical defined benefit pension plan makes retirement benefits proportional
  to the product of the final years (or years') earnings and the number of years
  of employment with the firm.

 2The low interest rate assumption is advantageous to the firm because it
  permits the firm to make greater tax—deductible pension contributions.
  We return to this in section 5.
                                           —19—



              The 132 companies in our sample assumed interest rates that ranged

from 5   percent   to 10.5 percent. For all but 13 companies, the rate was between

6   percent   and 9 percent. The assumed interest rates thus differ significantJ,y

from each other and     from   the actual rate of return available on pension fund

assets. Since the firms reported pension assets and vested liabilities that are

approximately equal in value,1 a chan,e in the interest rate could have

a   significant effect on the     estimate of unfunded liabilities and therefore

potentially     on the estimated regression coefficient of this variable in the
market value equation.
              The effect on the present value of vested pension benefits of changes
in the interest rate assumption depends on the current distribution of vested
benefits among employees and retirees of different ages. ¶Lb1e 2 shows the
actuarial present value of a dollar a year from age 65 until death       evaluated at

ages   between L5 and 70 for three different interest rates.2 The closer an
employee is to retirement, the nearer in time are his benefits and the less sen-
sitive is their present value to the interest rate assumption. For example,




    1The mean absolute value of unfunded vested pension liabilities as a percen—
     tae of pension assets was only 6.56 percent; for total accrued pension
     liabilities, the corresponding figure was 1.02 percent.


    2The actuarial present value was calculated usin the 1978 age specific death
     rates for white males that are presented in the l930 Statistical Abstract
     of the United States.

increasing the discount rate from 6 percent to 8 percent reduces the value of

the pension benefit by 14 percent at age 65 but 21 percent at age 60.

          Unfortunately, data are not available for each firm   on the distribu-
tion of vested pension benefits by employee and retiree age. Although the

actual distribution will differ among firms, it is clear that most ofthe

"weight" of the typical vested pension distribution is among retirees and older

employees in the years just before retirement. This concentration reflects

three things. First and most important, the benefits of retirees and older

workers are closer in time and therefore subject to less mortality risk and less

interest rate discounting. Table 2 shows that the present actuarial value of a

given benefit is reduced to half or less between ages 65 and 55. Noreover, the

actuarial present value of a one dollar annual benefit at age 70 is worth more
                                     —21—



than the prospect at age 60 of a one dollar benefit from age 65. Second, older

workers and retirees have generally accumulated more years of service with a

firm and vested benefits are generally proportional to the number of years of

service after an initial period. Finally, older workers generally have higher

earnings and vested benefits are also proportional to earnings.1

          Bulow (1979) reports that professional actuaries often assume as a

rule of thumb that the age distribution of vested benefits is such that the

overall present value of vested benefits is inversely proportional to the rate

of interest. It is clear from Table 2 that the actual relation differs by age

and that the inverse proportionality rule holds at about age 55 for a comparison

of 6 and 8 percent interest rates and at about age 65 for a comparison of 8 and

10 percent interest rates. Our analysis in this paper uses the inverse propor-

tionality assumption because data for developing a better weighting are not

available. While we believe that the resulting estimates of vested pension

liabilities are an improvement over using the reported values with varying

interest rate assumptions, we caution that the adjustment procedure is only an

approximation. It would clearly be desirable to obtain information on the age

distribution of vested benefits for all companies in the sample or even for a

smaller sample of companies that might be used to develop weights to apply to

figures like those of Table 2.

         We have made two different types of interest rate adjustments in

recalculating pension benefits. First, we standardize all pension liabilities

to the Baa bond rate of 12.1 percent prevailing at the end of 1979. Since no

firm used an interest rate even remotely as high as this, it seems unlikely that

the financial market implicitly used such a high rate in evaluating the

unfunded pension liabilities. This is confirmed by the estimates presented

below that show using such a high discount rate reduces the explanatory power of

the market valuation equation and causes the coefficient of the pension

liability variables to be small and insignificant.

          The second adjustment standardizes all pension liabilities to a

discount rate of 7.2 percent, the average rate used by the 132 firms in the

sample. This has the effect of eliminating the relative overstatements and

understatements of pension liabilities that result from the variety of interest

rate assumptions while changing very little the estimated liability for firms

that use a rate close to the average for the group. It is equivalent to

assuming that financial markets adjust the stated pension liabilities for

deviations from common practice rather than for deviations from a Baa rate.

          Table 3 summarizes the effect of different interest rate assumptions

on the estimated impact of pension liabilities on the market value of the firm.

The estimates are based on the specifications presented in Table 1 and therefore

in equations 1 and 2 of section 1.   For each equation, Table 3 presents only the

estimated pension liability coefficient and the sum of squared residuals for the

corresponding equation.

          Consider first the effect of the unfunded vested liability on the

total market value of the firm. Using inflation adjusted data and the reported

value of the unfunded vested liability implies a regression coefficient of —1 .43

with a standard error of 0.82. This figure was presented in equation 1.1 of

Table 1 and is repeated in the first row of Table 3 corresponding to the

"actual" interest rate.

          The present value of vested benefits discounted at the Baa rate is

approximated by multiplying each firm's reported liability by the ratio of its

actual interest rate to the 1919 year—end Baa rate of 12.1 percent. With this

adjustment, almost all firms had negative unfunded vested liabilities. Pension

assets exceed the recalculated vested liabilities by amounts that averaged 8.7

percent of the replacement value of the firm's physical assets. With these

adjusted unfunded vested liabilities, the estimated regression coefficient is

only —0.31 with a standard deviation of 0.143. The corresponding sum of squared

residuals (13.65) is however greater than the sum of squared residuals with the

actual interest rate (13.35), implying that the Baa rate is a less likely

specification of the market valuations model.

          By contrast, adjusting the vested pension liabilities to the common

average interest rate of 1.2 percent provides a substantially better explanation

of the data (the sum of squared residuals is only 12.89) and implies a

regression coefficient of —0.90 with a standard error of 0.33. This evidence

is consistent with the view that the financial markets disregard the differences

in unfunded pension liabilities and evaluate pension liabilities in terms of a

common average discount rate. Although we have not done a search over different

possible interest rates, to find a maximum likelihood estimate of this parameter

it is clear that the assumed average rate of 1.2 is substantially more likely

than either the Baa rate or the variety of rates actually used by the individual

companies. The regression coefficient of —0.90 with a standard error of 0.33

strongly supports the view that unfunded vested pension obligations, when

correctly valued, depress the value of the firm by approximately one dollar for

every dollar of unfunded obliè,ation or, equivalently, raise the market value of
                                         —25—



the firm by one dollar for every dollar of pension assets in excess of the

vested pension liability.

            The results for the total accrued liabilities are very similar. The

constant average interest rate has the best explanatory power (with a sum of

squared residuals of 12.73) and a coefficient of —0.89. Comparing the sums of

squared residuals for total accrued liabilities and vested liabilities suggests

that the accrued liability provides a slightly better explanation of the market

value of the firm. But the choice between vested and accrued liabilities does

not influence the conclusion that the common average interest rate is best and

that the effect of net pension liabilities on the market value of the firm js

approximately dollar for dollar.

            Changing the specification from the total market value of the firm to

the market value of equity also has virtually no effect on the estimated coef-

ficients of the unfunded pension liability variables. The specification with

the lowest sum of squared residuals again corresponds to the unfunded accrued

liability evaluated with the common average rate of return.

            When the conventional accounting data are used without inflation

adjustment, the estimated coefficients are less stable. For the total market

value of the firm, the evidence indicates that the best specification uses the

actual interest rate and unfunded accrued liabilities. The coefficient of the

pension liability variable is -1.59 with a standard error of 0.48. The Baa rate

has a substantially higher residual sum of squares. With the common average

interest   rate, the coefficient is   —0.05 with a standard error of 0.23.

           Finally,   for the market value of the corporate equity, the best speci-
fication   corresponds to the common average interest rate. The coefficient of
                                     —26—



the unfunded vested pension liability is —0.85 with a standard error of 0.20 and

therefore quite similar to the estimate with the inflation adjusted variables.

          Because the unfunded pension liabilities evaluated at a common average

interest rate generally have a better explanatory power than the corresponding

reported pension liabilities, we have reestimated the specifications of table 1

with these more appropriately measured pension variables. The results are pre-

sented in Table 4. The coefficients of the pension variables estimated for our

entire sample of firms have already been discussed in conjunction with

Table 3. For the sample of firms that use LIFO inventory accounting, the

unfunded pension liabilities are between —1.54 and —2.03. The coefficients of

the other variables are quite similar to their values in Table 1.

          Although we have included five variables that can influence the market

value of the firm, it is of course still possible that the unfunded pension

liability is correlated with some other omitted variable and that the apparent

effort of the unfunded pension liability is really only a reflection of this

omitted variable. In particular, it might be argued that "strong" companies

fully fund or overfund their accumulated liabilities while "weaker" companies

have large unfunded liabilities. To the extent that this is true and that cor-

porate strength and weakness are not reflected in the other variables, the nega-

tive coefficient of the unfunded liability will reflect the corporation's

generally weak financial position. Although it is clearly impossible to rule

out completely such an "omitted variable" argument, we have tried to test for

the importance of such an effect by reestimating the inflation adjusted

equations of Table 4 with the company's bond rating as an additional variable.

The bond rating represents an expert judgment about the long—term financial

strength of the company. To incorporate this variable, we use the Moody's bond

rating for the longest maturity bond issued in 1979 and scale this rating

from a 9 for an Aaa rated bond to 4 for a B rated bond.

          For the equations determining the total market value of debt and

equity, the coefficient of this variable as small (0.04) and barely larger than

its standard error. Including it in the equation actually raised the absolute

value of the coefficient of the pension liability variable. For the equation

determining the market value of corporate equity, the coefficient of the bond

rating variable is slightly larger (about 0.09) and about twice its standard

error. Including this variable reduces the coefficient of the unfunded pension

liability variable by approximately 0.05.    Thus including a general measure of

the financial strength of the company does not alter the estimated effect of

unfunded pensions.1


4. Additional Specification

          The estimates presented in the previous sections assume that there is

a linear relation between the market value of the firm and its unfunded vested

pension liabilities. This specification implies that a one dollar increase in

the firm's pension liability has the same effect on the firm's value as a one

dollar decrease in the value of the firm's pension assets. The linear specifi-

cation also implies that the market responds in the same way to unfunded liabi-

lities that are positive as it does to unfunded liabilities that are negative.

The present section presents estimates that relax these constraints.


  1Jererny Bulow has told us that he has investigated the relation between unfunded
   pension liabilities and the rate of return on equity over the previous decade
   (as a measure of the "quality" of the firm) but found no relation.

Separating Assets and Liabilities

          The equations in Table 5 include the value of pension assets per

dollar of the firms physical assets (PA/A or PA/AE) as well as the unfunded pen-

sion liability variables. All of the equations are based on inflation adjusted

data and separate estimates are presented using the reported pension liabilities

and liabilities adjusted to a common average discount rate.

          The coefficients in equation 5.1 are representative of all of the equations

for total market value of debt and equity in this table. The estimated parameter

values for the non-pension variables are very similar to the corresponding figures in

equation 1.1 of Table 1 which had the same specification without the separate pension

assets variable.. The coeffIcient of unfunded vested pension liabilities is now

slightly lower (—1.14 with a standard error of 0.82) while the coefficLent of the

pension assets variable is —0.55 with a standard error, of 0.28.

          Including the pension asset variable is equivalent to estimating

separate coefficients for vested pension liabilities and pension assets. The

coefficient of UVPL/A measures the effect of increases in vested pension liabi-

lities (—1.14 dollars of market value per dollar of vested pension liability)

while the difference between the coefficients of PA/A and of UVPL/A measures the

effect of increases in pension assets (i.e., —0.55 + 1.14 =   0.59   dollars of

market value per dollar of pension assets.) This coefficient of pension assets

has a larger standard error (0.91), implying that when pension assets and pen-

sion liabilities are included as separate variables neither can be estimated

with any precision.1

          Using the liability variables adjusted to a common average interest

rate (equation 5.3 and 5.4) permits much more precise parameter etimates. The


   11t is however possible to say that the difference between the coefficients
    of the liability and asset variables is statistically significant.
                                           —31—


implied coefficient of vested pension liabilities is —0.91 with a sttnd.ard error
of   0.32   while   the implied coefficient of pension assets is 0.29 with   a standard
error of 0.142. This implies that liabilities have a substantial nebative effect

on the market value of the finn that is not significantly different from minus

one while assets have a much smaller effect that may not differ from zero. One

possible reason for this asymmetry is that the financial market ma,y regard 1are

pension assets as an indication that the firm projects large pension liabilities

that will have to be paid on the basis of future employment service.1'2

              The estimates based on the market value of corporate equity imply that

pension assets have a greater effect that is not significantly different from

the effect of pension liabilities. In equation 5.5, for example, the implied

effect of pension assets is 0.914 dollars of market value per dollar of pension

assets. With the more precisely estimated coefficients corresponding to a corn-.

mon average discount rate, the implied coefficient of pension liabilities is

—0.91 (with a standard error of 0.29) while the implIed coefficient of pension

assets is 0.55 with a standard error of 0.36. The difference between these two

coefficients is inarina1ly significant; the corresponding t—statistic is 1.8 and

therefore significant at the 7 percent level.

             Taken at face value, the coefficients in Table 5 generally imply that

each dollar increase in a firm's pension liabilities reduces the firm's market

value by about one dollar while each dollar increase in pension assets increases

in value by less that a dollar. If this is correct, it provides at least a


  1Recall that a uinii can accumulate pension assets only to the extent that it
   can satisfy the Internal Revenue Service that these assets are a reasonable
     provision against future pension liabilities. Note also that this explanation
     assumes that the value of such liabilities will not be offset by lower wages
     in the future.

 2Stuart Myers has pointed out to us that, when separate coefficients are estimated
  for pension assets and liabilities, it is not possible to distinguish among dif-
  ferent assumed constant discount rates. The superiority of a common rate over
  varying individual assumptions remains.
                                             —32—


short-run reason for firms not to fully fund or overfund their pensions. It

also implies that to the extent that firms make pension promises that reduce the

savings of employees, the market perceives the extra liability and therefore

has the information to adjust other personal saving. At the same time, the

lower coefficient of the pension assets variable implies that the market does

not accurately reflect the extent of asset accumulation in the pension fund.

The net effect of this is that an increase in a funded vested liability reduces

the market value of the firm and induces additional saving.


Positive and Negative Net Liabilities

                 A different but related issue is raised by the fact that pension

assets exceed liabilities for the majority of the firms in our sample. Does the

market respond differently to "unfunded" pension liabilities that are positive

and to the unfunded liabilities that are negative and therefore represent an

additional net asset of the firm? To answer this question, we have divided each

unfunded pension liability variable into two variables, e.g., PUVPL/A is UVPL/A

if this is a positive amount (implying that liabilities exceed assets) and

NUVPL/A if IJVPL/A is a negative amount (implying that assets exceed liabilities.)

                 Table 6 presents the estimated coefficients of the positive and, nega-

tive pension liability variables. These coefficients are based on the same

basic specification used in Tables 1 and 4. The pension liabilities are

adjusted to a common average discount rate and all of the data are adjusted for

in flat   ion.
                 All   four parameter estimates show a much larger negative coefficient
for   the firms with actual unfunded liabilities (the "positive" liability

coefficients) than for the firms in which assets exceed liabilities. In

each case, the pension coefficient for the firms in which assets exceed liabili-

ties is approximately —0.S with a standard error of about 0.4. These coef-

ficients are therefore not significantly different from either zero or minus one.

In contrast, the pension coefficient for the firms in which liabilities exceed

assets is approximately minus two with a standard error of about 0.8. These

coefficients are all significantly different from zero and again not signifi-

cantly different from minus one.

          An explicit test of the equality of the two pension coefficients in

each equation indicates that equality cannot be rejected at the 10 percent pro-

bability level in the equations relating to the total market va:lue of the firm

but can be rejected at the 5 and 8 percent probability levels in the equation

for the market value of corporate equity.

          1-low should these egtimates be interpreted? One possible interpreta-

tion is that, because of the large standard errors, there is no need to

distinguish between the two types of firms or to revise the conclusion that an

extra dollar of unfunded vested pension liability reduces the market value of

the firm by approximately one dollar. An alternative "statistical" explanation

is that the equation is misapecified and omits additional variables that are

observed by participants in the financial markets and that are correlated with

the size of pension liabilities. Thus, although the financial market may

correctly reduce or increase a company's market value by a dollar for each

dollar of positive or negative unfunded vested pension liability, our estimated

coefficient instead reflects the impact of the additional omitted variables.

          It is, however, also possible that the observed difference between the

"positive" and "negative" coefficients are more than statistical artifact and do

reflect the way that the financial market responds differently to these two
                                     —35—


types of firms. Since a firm that fails to fund fully its vested or past ser-

vice liability incurs a higher corporate tax than would otherwise be necessary,

a firm's failure to fund these liabilities may be an indication to the financial

market that the firm is in a financially weak position or is not well managed.

This could account for coefficients of the unfunded liability variables that are

absolutely greater than one. This argument would, however, suggest a sym-

metrically favorable effect on a firm's market value if its pension liabilities

are substantially overfunded and therefore an equally large negative coefficient

for firms with negative unfunded liabilities. One reason why this is not

observed is that, as we noted earlier in this section, the financial market may

regard large pension assets as an indication that the firm has correspondingly

large future pension benefits that are not yet vested or based on past service

but that can he reasonably anticipated for the future. We can think of no way

to test this two part explanation.


5. Why Firms Choose Different Interest Assumptions

          As we noted in section 3, the choice of the discount rate has a very

powerful effect on the value of vested and other accrued pension liabilities.

Since these benefits are based only on employees' past service, future wage

rates and turnover rates are irrelevant. As a rough approximation, the value of

unfunded pension liabilities varies in inverse proportion to the assumed

interest rate.

          The tax law provides a strong reason for companies to assume a low

interest rate. By increasing the value of its pension liability, the firm can

justify accumulating more pension assets. For any given stream of anticipated

benefits, the accumulation of more pension assets is equivalent to reducing the
                                         —36—


real cost of those pensions. The reduced cost reflects the fact that the

earnings in the pension fund are untaxed while earnings on assets held by the

corporation are taxed and the interest rate that the corporation pays on its own

debt is deductible from taxable income.

            If the tax benefits of early funding were the only influence on the

choice of an interest rate assumption, firms would choose the lowest permissible

interest rate. But a low interest rate assumption also has it disadvantages.

Firms may wish to avoid making the large annual funding payments that would

result from a low interest assumption and may not wish to report that they have

large unfunded pensions liabilities. To the extent that this is true, they will

prefer   a higher interest assumption.
          A large unfunded liability requires a firm to increase the annual
contribution to its pension fund. This directly reduces the firms reported     ear-

nings. Firms may fear that this in turn will have an adverse effect on the

market price of the firms' stock because portfolio investors do not correctly

perceive the reason for the lower reported earnings. Moreover, a firm that has

limited access to credit or that faces a rising marginal cost of funds may

prefer to postpone funding. To the extent that a firm can fund as much as it

wants at a moderate or high interest rate, it will have no incentive to use a

lower interest rate.

           A large unfunded liability may also he regarded by corporate manage—

ment as undesirable in itself.    It wold not be unreasonable for them to fear

that such a liability would depress the equity value of the firm and increase

its cost of debt.   If financial investors are unable to take the firm's choice

of interest rate into account in interpreting its reputed liability, the firm

may be able to raise its value by selecting a high interest rate that causes
                                      -37-




          Firms   that have large vested pension liabilites when calculated at
some standard rate will have more incentive to reduce their apparent liability

by selecting a high interest rate. Even more likely, firms that have large

unfunded liabilities (when valued at a standard interest rate) will have an

incentive to choose a high interest rate and   virtually nothing   to gain by

choosing a low rate. Conversely, firms in which pension assets exceed liability

(when valued at a standard rate) will have no reason to disguise the size of

their promised liability and every reason to increase the size of that'liability

in order to increase the rate of tax—deductible funding.

          The evidence that we have examined indicates that firms do systemati-

cally choose their interest rate assumption in the way that this analysis

suggests. Table 7 presents estimates of the way in which the choice of interest

rate is influenced by the firm's pension liability (adjusted to the common

average discount rate to permit comparability) and by other variables that

measure the firm's financial condition.

          Equation 7.1 shows that firms with large vested pension liabilities

tend to choose high interest rate assumptions. The assumed interest rate is

related even more strongly to the firm's unfunded vested pension liability, a

fact shown in equation 7.2. Firms with higher ratios of net debt to assets may

be more reluctant to increase the size of their pension fund and therefore may

prefer a higher assumed interest rate. The coefficient of DEBT/A in equation 3

is positive but just barely larger than its standard error.

          Equations 7.4 and 7.5 indicate that the choice of the interest rate

assumption can also be explained by reference to the total accrued pension

liabilities although that variable has somewhat weaker explanatory power than
                                                               Table   7

  reports.   The pension liability variables are all based on the common
                                                                         average rate.

the vested liability.

          Equations 7.6 and 7.7 indicate that firms with better bond ratings

choose higher interest rates.1 Again the coefficient of this variable is only

slightly larger than its standard error and may be due to chance. If it is not

due to chance, the positive relation between bond rating and the choice of

interest assumptions suggests that the causation is actually from the interest

rate assumption to the bond rating. Thus, a firm with a given "true" value of

UVPL/A that chooses a high interest rate assumption will appear to have a

smaller pension liability. This in turn makes the firm appear financially sound

if the rating agency does not take its interest rate assumption into account.

          The last three equations are based on data that have not been adjusted

for inflation. Those results are quite similar to the corresponding equations

with inflation adjusted data.

          It is clear from the estimates presented in Table 7 that firms do

engage in strategic attempts to reduce their reported unfunded vested pension

liabilities when the benefits from doing so may outweigh the tax advantages of

early funding.


6. Conclusion

          The purpose of the current study has been to assess the extent to

which. the market value of firms   reflects   accurately their unfunded pension obli-

gations. Although there are substantial problems in measuring pension liabili-

ties and in specifying an appropriate framework for estimating their effect on



  1Recall that the bond rating variable scores Moody's Aaa bonds as 9 and
   decreases the score linearly with lower bond ratings.
                                      —40—




market values, the results presented in this paper can be said to be generally

consistent with the view that the market value of firms reflects a conventional

measure of unfunded pension obligations or net pension assets.

           The value of vested pension liabilities depends critically on the

interest rate that firms use to discount future benefit oblications. The 132

large manufacturing firms in the sample used a wide range of interest rates from

5.0 percent to 10.5 percent in evaluating their 1979 pension liabilities. The

choice of interest rate appears to reflect the deliberate policy of firms with

substantial benefit obligations relative to existing pension assets to try to

reduce the reputed present value of their obligation. Similarly, firms in which

pension assets are large relative to benefit obligations tend to choose low

interest rate assumptions in order to increase the tax advantages of early

funding.

           The financial market appears to "see through" this manipulation of

pension liabilities and sets market values that are related more closely to a

pension obligation evaluated at a common standard interest rate than to the pen-

sion obligations as reported by the finns. Although an appropriate interest

rate for evaluating pension obligations would be the long—term interest rate

prevailing in 1979, our evidence indicates that market values of firms are

related much more closely to pension liabilities evaluated at the average rate

used by all of the firms in our sample (7.2 percent) than to the pension liabi—

lities implied by the Baa rate (1 2.1 percent).

           The majority of firms in the sample have pension assets that exceed

the value of pension liabilities. There is some evidence in our estimates that

the market gives more weight to pension liabilities than to pension assets and
                                           —41—




responds more to variations in the excess of liabilities over assets than to the

excess of assets over liabilities. Although we offer son tentative explana-

tions of these asymmetries, we are aware that they might also be an indication

of a misspecification of the basic equations.

            More      research with additional data could help to resolve, some of the
remaining problems. Using cross—section data on a         panel of firms for several

years   would permit     eliminating firm specific effects that may bias the estimated
effect    of the pension liabilities. With data for several years, it might also

be possible to modify the measurement of earnings to include information on

pension contributions and the changes in vested pension liabilities. It would

certainty be very useful to obtain data on the age distribution of vested bene-

fit obligations in order to improve the adjustment of total vested obligations

to a common rate of interest.

            If the two basic findings of this study ——      that   the market appears to

see   through   the   "pension veil" and that the market value of the firm reflects
pension obligations evaluated at an interest rate that is far below the market

rate ——   are   correct, they have important implications for the relation of pen-

sions to national saving. First, pension liabilities are evaluated at an

interest rate that is too low, the present value of those liabilities is

overstated. Thus share prices are depressed by larger pension obligations and

shareholders have an increased incentive to save. Second, if pension assets are

correctly perceived by the financial market, the extent of pension funding will

not influence aggregate priva,te saving. Moreover, to the extent that the evi-

dence of section I implies that the market gives too little value to pension

assets, an increase in pension assets will not reduce other private saving         by an
                                     —42—




offsetting amount. The overstatement of pension liabilities and the possible

understatement of pension assets thus suggests that the expanding size of the

private pension system may increase total saving by companies and their share

holders.1




  1Any conclusion about the overall effect of pensions on saving depends also
   on the response of employees to promised pension benefits. It is of course
   possible that employees may substitute promised pension benefits for direct
   saving. If the interest rate that they would anticipate on their own direct
   saving is less than the interest rate earned by the pension fund, total
   saving could decline. Alternatively, the higher potential yield on pension
   saving might induce employees to increase planned retirement consumption by
   enough to raise the level of current saving despite the higher interest rate.
   The problem is closely related to the discussion in Feldstein (1978b).
