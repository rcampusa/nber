                                            ABSTRACT

The paper provides a survey of fiscal and monetary policies during the 1930s under the Hoover and
Roosevelt Administrations and how they influenced the policies during the recent Great Recession.
The discussion of the causal impacts of monetary policy focuses on papers written in the last decade
and the findings of scholars using dynamic structural general equilibrium modeling. The discussion
of fiscal policy shows why economists do not see the New Deal as a Keynesian stimulus, describes
the significant shift toward excise taxation during the 1930s, and surveys estimates of the impact of
federal spending on local economies. The paper concludes with discussion of the lessons for the present
from 1930s monetary and fiscal policy.

       Economists and economic historians generally agree that the Federal Reserve made

several decisions about monetary policy between 1929 and 1937 that worsened the Great

Depression. The Federal Reserve allowed the money supply to fall and did too little, too late in

trying to stave off the bank failures of the early 1930s. The Fed then reduced the money supply

again by raising reserve requirements three times in 1936 and 1937 in an attempt to prevent

inflation by soaking up excess reserves. As a broad brush explanation of the reasons for the

Federal Reserve’s choices, most scholars agree that the Federal Reserve’s attempts to maintain

the international Gold Standard between 1929 and 1933 explain a significant amount of why they

followed their policy actions. Week-by-week accounts of the timing of bank failures and the

Federal Reserve’s policy moves, however, suggest a complex set of motives for the actions of

the Fed and regional Reserve Banks that add a great deal more nuance to the story.


       The largest debates about monetary policies during the 1930s arise over how effective

they were in driving real GDP and unemployment. Nearly all agree that the Federal Reserve

policy interacted with other negative shocks in ways that caused the Depression to deepen. The

question remains how much? Estimates from a variety of models suggest that the impact of

monetary policy explains a range of 20 to 70 percent of the decline in real output between 1929

and 1933. Some scholars argue that the recovery that started in mid1933 was driven by

Roosevelt administration’s adoption of a new “reflationary” policy regime that simultaneously

freed the U.S. from the “golden fetters” of the Gold Standard, shifted to a looser monetary

policy, and ramped up government spending just after the inauguration in 1933. The shock of a

new policy dogma reversed deflationary expectations that contributed to most of the recovery.

Later efforts by the Federal Reserve to combat potential inflation through increases in reserve
                                                                                                     4


requirements and cuts in federal spending signaled another policy regime change that contributed

to the downturn of 1937-38.


        How effective was fiscal policy? A nationwide Keynesian fiscal stimulus was never

really attempted in the 1930s. During the Hoover Presidency Congress doubled federal spending

and ramped up federal lending through the Reconstruction Finance Corporation. The Roosevelt

Congresses then spent nearly double the Hoover levels. But both administrations collected

enough taxes in a variety of new forms to maintain relatively small deficits throughout the

period. Relative to a Keynesian deficit target designed to return to full employment, the deficits

were miniscule. State governments also ran deficits in the early 1930s and then expanded

taxation and ran surplus in the late 1930s. Even if fiscal deficits had been run, Christina Romer’s

(1992) estimates of fiscal and monetary policy multipliers from 1921 and 1938 imply a weak

effect of fiscal policy. Studies of the impact of government spending at the state, county, and

city level suggest that impact on real variables differed by program. Public works and relief

spending contributed to increases in economic activity, while the farm programs were explicitly

designed to reduce output. Preliminary estimates of the impact of net federal spending using

annual data for 48 states between 1930 and 1940 suggest that a marginal increase of $1 in net

federal spending was associated with an increase of $1 to $1.50 in per capita personal income in

the states.


        The insistence upon raising tax rates during the 1930s also likely retarded growth. The

Hawley-Smoot Tariff of 1930 touched off a series of protectionist responses from other countries

that cut world import activity by two-thirds by 1933.    Increases in income tax rates, particularly

spikes in the top marginal rates to 58 and 67 percent, likely contributed to tax avoidance and

inhibited economic activities at the top of the income distribution. A series of taxes on capital,
                                                                                                       5


dividends, and undistributed profits led to relatively small amounts of revenue at the cost of

chilling some forms of investment activity. New excise taxes on bank checks, autos, electricity,

pipelines, gasoline, and communications likely slowed growth in the leading technological

growth sectors in the economy. The new excise taxes along with renewed collections on

alcoholic beverages after the end of Prohibition account for a significant part of the rise in tax

revenues during the 1930s.


        Modern policy makers have clearly sought to avoid making the macroeconomic policy

mistakes of the 1930s. In contrast to the 1930s, the Federal Reserve, guided by Depression

scholar Benjamin Bernanke, has flooded the banking system with liquidity since fall 2008. The

Bush and Obama administrations fought the downturn with tax rebates in 2008 and 2009. The

new Obama administration and the Democratic Congress pushed through a fiscal stimulus

package that has driven the federal deficit near 10 percent of GDP, the largest peace-time deficit

in American history.


        On the microeconomic side, policy makers followed several strategies that mimic the

activities of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in the 1930s. Bernanke and Treasury

Secretaries Henry Paulson and Timothy Geithner orchestrated mergers, bailouts, and ownership

stakes in major financial institutions to stave off anticipated financial disaster if an institution

that was too big to fail went under. As the RFC did with the railroads and other industries, the

Bush and Obama administrations made substantial loans to GM and Chrysler.


        The paper follows the path laid out in the introduction. I describe the monetary policies

under the Hoover Administration, discuss why the policies were chosen, describe the shift in

monetary policy under Roosevelt, and then discuss extraordinary banking policies that set
                                                                                                    6


precedents for the bailouts, bank investments, and stress tests introduced in 2008 and 2009. I

then address the modern versions of the debates over the causal impact of monetary policy with

particular attention to dynamic structural general equilibrium modeling. Following an

examination of the fiscal policies of Hoover and Keynes in the light of Keynesian economics, I

discuss estimates of the impact of federal spending on local economies, describe the supply-side

aspects of the rise in tax rates, and conclude with further discussion of the lessons for the present

from 1930s monetary and fiscal policy.


Monetary Policy under the Hoover Administration


       Nearly everybody agrees with Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz (1963) that the

Federal Reserve’s monetary policy contributed to making the Great Contraction worse between

1929 and 1933. At the time the Fed had two effective tools for influencing the money supply,

open market operations and the discount rate at which the Fed allowed member banks to borrow

(or discount bills to the Fed) to meet reserve requirements. The open market operations involved

the purchase or sale of existing bonds. Reductions in the discount rate and purchases of bonds

could be used to reduce the probability of bank failures in a panic and both contributed to

increases in the money supply. Thus, if the Fed had focused on combating bank failures and

unemployment within the U.S. economy, the appropriate strategy was to lower the discount rate

and purchase bonds.


       Yet, the Federal Reserve also paid close attention to the international gold standard,

which was essentially a promise that the Federal Reserve and U.S. banks would pay out an ounce

of gold for every $20.67 in Federal Reserve notes. To remain on the gold standard, the Federal

Reserve was required to provide adequate U.S. gold reserves to make this promise credible. If
                                                                                                     7


changes in the relative attractiveness of the dollar led the U.S. supply of gold to fall below the

appropriate level, the Fed was expected to take actions to make the dollar more attractive. At the

time the standard policies in response to gold outflows included raising the discount rate and

selling (or at least reducing purchases) of existing bonds.


       Figures 1 through 4 and Table 1 show the monthly movements over the period from

January 1929 through February 1933 of series representing two of the major dilemmas for

monetary policy-- the nominal volume of deposits in suspended banks (diamonds in the figures)

and the change in the U.S. gold stock (circles in the figures). Each figure shows how specific

measures of Federal Reserve activity were changing in response to these dilemmas, including

changes in the Federal Reserve’s holdings of U.S. Securities (squares in Figure 1), the level of

the New York Fed’s discount rate (squares in Figure 2), changes in the Fed’s holdings of bills

purchased (squares in Figure 3), and changes in the member bank borrowing at the Fed (squares

in Figure 4). The bills purchased refer to short term credit instruments known as bankers’

acceptances and trade acceptances that Federal Reserve banks could purchase in the open

market. These are the types of “real bills” discussed in the real bill’s doctrine described below.

At the founding of the Federal Reserve, changes in bills purchased were expected to be a major

aspect of policy, as they were in England at the time. In the 1920s, however, open market

purchases and sales of U.S. securities became the main source of adjustment and policy

operations (Meltzer 2003, 270).


       The Federal Reserve’s attempts to slow the speculative boom in stocks contributed to

slowing the money supply between 1928 and 1929. Soon after the recession started in August

1929, the Dow Jones Stock Index peaked in early September. For most of October the Fed had

been selling U.S. securities, but this policy changed swiftly when the Dow Jones Index dropped
                                                                                                     8


24 percent on Monday October 28 and Black Tuesday October 29. The New York Fed

responded immediately by purchasing $115 million in U.S. securities. Two days later the

Federal Reserve Board agreed that it was the proper move. The entire Fed system purchased

$157 million in U.S. securities the last week of October and then purchased on net another $161

million in November and $131 million in December in Figure 1 and Table 1. The New York

Fed lowered its discount rate in Figure 2 and Table 1 from 6 to 5 percent on November 1 and

then to 4.5 percent by November 15 after the Dow dropped to roughly two-thirds of its October

25th level by November 11 (Meltzer, 2003, 284-288).


       The Fed’s response to bank failures over the next three years varied from crisis to crisis.

Over most of the year 1930 the Fed made policy adjustments in response to gold flows and

seasonal demands for credit. The spike in suspended bank deposits (diamonds in the figures) in

November and December 1930 in Figure 1 and Table 1 led the New York Fed to purchase $100

million in U.S. securities and $75 million in bankers’ acceptances (bills purchased in Figure 3)

between November 30 and December 17th. It then sold $50 million in the middle of the month.

The New York Fed then lowered its discount rate from 2.5 to 2 percent in Figure 2 and Table 1

and purchased more than $100 million in bankers’ acceptances and $85 million in U.S. securities

in the last week of December (Meltzer 2003, 325). The rest of the regional Federal Reserve

banks were leaning the other way, however, as the Fed systems’ stock of U.S. securities rose by

only $45 million in December in Figure 1 and Table 1 and the stock of acceptances rose by only

$73 million that month.


       The Fed faced its ultimate dilemma between August and October of 1931 in Figures 1, 2,

3, and 4 and Table 1 when the volume of deposits suspended spiked again and a dramatic

outflow of gold occurred after Britain left the gold standard in September of 1931. Until October
                                                                                                    9


the Fed’s primary focus was international. During the first part of the summer the Fed worried

about a flight of gold out of Eastern Europe and Germany into the U.S. associated with possible

coups and the rise of Hitler. In response, the Fed participated in loans to banks in Hungary, the

German Reichsbank, and the Austrian National Bank. In late July, the Fed approved a purchase

of $125 million in prime commercial bills guaranteed by the Bank of England to aid a crumbling

situation in Britain. After Britain left the gold standard on September 20 and gold started

flowing out of the country, the Fed followed the standard responses. First it purchased U.S.

securities, although the holdings of U.S. securities in Figure 1 and Table 1 changed very little

relative to the changes in gold stocks or in bank suspensions during this period. The New York

Fed then raised its discount rate in Figure 2 and Table 1 from 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent on

October 9 and then to 3.5 percent on October 16 (Meltzer 2003, 332-48).


       The memo for the Open Market Policy Committee (OMPC) meeting on October 26

finally focused more attention on the bank failures than the gold outflows, but this did not lead to

much of a change in OMPC policy. The OMPC chose not to make any major open market

purchases of U.S. securities. Instead, the OMPC recommended that member banks should be

encouraged to lend to banks in difficulty and then rediscount those loans to the Federal Reserve

system banks. Most of the action was driven by the decisions of the member banks. Despite the

higher discount rates in October, member banks sharply increased their borrowing at the Fed’s

discount window in Figure 4 and Table 1 and sold a large amount of bankers’ acceptances to the

Fed (Figure 3 and Table 1). Meltzer (2003, 348) argues that the Fed did more to prop up the

Bank of England than it did for the American banking system.


       The wave of bank failures over the summer led President Herbert Hoover to call for a

new set of extraordinary measures outside the Federal Reserve. He met with bankers in October
                                                                                                   10


1932 to establish the National Credit Corporation (NCC). The NCC was designed as a way for

commercial banks to pool resources voluntarily to purchase marketable assets of insolvent banks

and to provide alternative borrowing facilities for the banks based on assets that the Fed could

not accept as collateral.


       At the November 30 OMPC meeting, the committee members expressed satisfaction at

their handling of the gold outflow. Essentially, they felt that they had stemmed the tide of the

gold flow and meanwhile had done the right thing for the bank failures by lending a great deal at

high discount rates, as seen in Figures 2 and 4 and Table 1. They had not purchased securities to

stave off the banking crisis, but seemed satisfied that that was the right course (Meltzer 2003,

348-9). They approved the capacity to purchase $200 million in U.S. securities in open market

operations but then sell them again in response to the seasonal demands for credit.


       A new wave of bank suspensions hit in December 1931 and January 1932, but not much

was done. The NCC made $155 million in loans to 575 banks but December 1931 still had the

third highest monthly volume of deposits suspended in the early 1930s. The Hoover

administration started developing the plans for the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC),

which would become a government corporation with the authority to lend to banks and

businesses and the Glass-Steagall Act of 1932, which expanded the range of assets on which the

Fed could provide credits to member banks. Despite the authority to make $200 million in U.S.

security purchases, the Fed did not respond to the bank failures with purchases of U.S. securities.

Instead, they sought to time purchases to the passage of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation

and the Glass-Steagall Act of 1932 (Meltzer, 2003, 357-361).
                                                                                                              11


         Finally, between February and June 1932 the Federal Reserve purchased slightly more

than $1 billion in U.S. government securities. Meanwhile the RFC seemed to be much more

active in trying to prevent prevent bank failures by making $784 million in loans to more than

4,000 banks between February and November of 1932.1 Friedman and Schwartz (1963) argue

that had the $1 billion in open market purchases of U.S. securities been completed during the

first wave of bank failures in late 1930, the move would have been effective at stemming the

crisis in 1930 and stalling the drop in the money supply that followed. The economy would have

been in a much better position when the next crises hit, or some of the later crises would have

been prevented or softened significantly. In their view, the $1 billion purchase in 1932 was “too

little, too late.”


        After the major open market purchases ended in the summer of 1932 Fed policy was

relatively passive. When a new wave of bank failures hit in December 1932 and the first two

months of 1933, the Fed did little. Meanwhile, President Hoover and President-Elect Roosevelt

could not come to an agreement on how to deal with the latest wave of suspensions of over 500

small banks between December and February. Hoover pressed Roosevelt to join him in

developing a policy to counteract the bank failures but demanded that Roosevelt promise to stay

on the Gold Standard and run a balanced budget. Roosevelt did not want to make such

commitments or accept responsibility for a joint policy until he had actual authority. Meanwhile,

state governments took action to prevent the failures, as 35 states declared bank holidays and the

remaining states put strong restrictions on withdrawals (Meltzer 2003, p. 379-380).


Why was the Federal Reserve so recalcitrant?

preventing bank failures.
                                                                                                  12


          A significant amount of the Fed’s actions can be understood by examining its

international role in defending the gold standard (Eichengreen 1992, Temin and Wigmore 1990,

Temin 1989). Until 1933 the Fed maintained a commitment to the international gold standard,

a commitment that tied its hands to some degree. Even though the money supply and the

economy was continuing to decline, outflows of gold when Britain left the gold standard in 1931

and during the banking crisis in March of 1933 led the Fed to raise the discount rate. Once the

U.S. left the gold standard in 1933, it was freer to focus on domestic policy and the money

supply.


          Friedman and Schwartz argued that the Federal Reserve lacked the right type of strong

leadership. Benjamin Strong, a powerful advocate for use of open market purchases of U.S.

securities during recessions in the 1920s as the head of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, had

died in 1928. Even though his replacement George Harrison and several others argued for

expansive bond purchases at various times in the early 1930s, they were overridden by the rest of

the Fed policy makers, who tended to hold the view that Fed interference would either prolong

the problems or have little agreement. .


          Not all agree that the Fed had changed directions with the death of Benjamin Strong.

When Alan Meltzer (2003, 284-411) wrote his majestic history of the Federal Reserve System,

he had access to many internal documents that had not been available to Friedman and Schwartz.

He draws more nuanced conclusions about the internal policy debates within the Fed, as well as

the attitudes of Strong’s replacement as head of the New York Fed, George Harrison. Between

1929 and 1933 the most common view held by the Fed policy makers was a combination of the
                                                                                                              13


“real bills doctrine” and the Riefler-Burgess framework.2 Under the real bills doctrine increases

in credit should be provided by the Federal Reserve by purchasing commercial bills of exchange

or bankers’ acceptances because they arise from the financing of trade or production. The idea

was that credit and output would expand together and thus not be inflationary. Credit expansion

based on Fed purchases of government securities was considered to be speculative credit because

no new production resulted. Real bills analysts wanted the member banks to initiate the

demands for credit and to avoid having the Fed provide “redundant” or “speculative” credit

(Meltzer 263, 411)”


        The Riefler-Burgess framework “explained that banks were reluctant to borrow,

borrowed only if reserves were deficient, and repaid promptly. To repay borrowing, banks

called loans, raised lending rates, and sold government securities….A rise in the discount rate

lowered the level of member bank borrowing, reduced credit and money, and raised market

interest rates (Meltzer 2003, 161).” Meanwhile, open market purchases of U.S. securities

supplied reserves and encouraged banks to repay borrowing, offer more loans, and reduce

interest rates; open market sales drove banks to borrow, restrict lending, and raise interest rates.

The doctrine suggested that the key variables to look at were member bank borrowing and

interest rates. If both were low, policy was easy. If the two were high, policy was tight. The cut

point was $500 million for borrowing (Meltzer 2003, 734-5). Meltzer found that the Fed leaders

spent very little time looking at the sharp decline in the money supply, although in late 1931 and

1932 they began to note signs of currency hoarding and the holding of excess reserves by banks.

 Winfield Riefler was an economist at the Federal Reserve Board and W. Randolph Burgess was at the New York
bank.
                                                                                                    14


        There were disagreements among the members of the Board of Governors and the

OMPC. At various times one or more members advocated expansionary open market purchases

of U.S. securities. Yet, in most situations there were always real bills and Riefler- Burgess

advocates who saw low member bank borrowing and low interest rates and felt that monetary

policy was sufficiently easy. Several of the decisions makers argued that prior attempts to

promote recovery with open market purchases of U.S. securities had had little effect in the 1930s

and had promoted speculation in the 1920s. Even during the $1 billion open market purchase of

U.S. securities in 1932 some members of the OMPC were not fully on board. Most of the

regional banks allowed the New York Fed to make most of the purchases. The members of the

OMPC went ahead with the purchases in part because banks were already borrowing a great

deal, so that Fed officials saw the purchases as a means of allowing the member banks to replace

borrowing without promoting inflation. Further, Fed officials were worried that if they did not

act, Congress might pass much more inflationary acts in the form of the World War I Veterans’

Bonus and a new bill to expand the printing of greenbacks (Meltzer 2003, 358-361).


       One reason so many officials thought the policy was easy is that they did not adjust

nominal interest rates for the high rate of deflation. Meltzer (2003, 411) finds no mention of

officials adjusting the nominal rate for deflation and discussing the implications of a high real

rate of interest. The Fed cut the nominal discount rate shown in Figures 2 and 5 and Table 1 in

eleven steps from 6 percent in October 1929 to 1.5 percent in 1931. But in that same time span,

the Consumer Price Index inflation rate in Figure 5 was near zero in 1929, and then became a

deflation rate of -2.4 percent in 1930 and -9 percent in 1931. This meant that the ex-post real

discount rate, the discount rate minus the inflation rate, rose slightly from 4.5 to 4.77 percent in

1930 and then jumped to 10.5 percent in 1931. The Fed raised the discount rate back to 3.5
                                                                                                     15


percent in late 1931 to stem the outward flow of gold when Britain abandoned the gold standard.

Then the Fed allowed it fall to 2.5 percent for most of 1932. Yet, the 10 percent deflation rate

that year caused the real ex-post discount rate to rise to 12.5 percent. Even though low nominal

interest rates led Fed officials to believe the monetary policy was easy, the effects of deflation

drove the real interest rates to levels that were than two times as high as any real interest rate

experienced in the U.S after 1933.


       Karl Brunner and Meltzer (1968) and Elmus Wicker (1966) argue that the Fed’s policy

objectives were similar in the 1920s and the early 1930s. David Wheelock (1992) builds on their

work by combining narrative discussions with time series regressions to estimate the relationship

between Federal Reserve policy tools and various economic targets. He then uses the

regressions to identify the Fed’s policy regimes and shows that the Fed responded to changes to

the domestic and international changes of the 1930s with largely the same proportionate

responses as they had in the 1920s.


       Wheelock argues that the Fed policy makers did not realize that the same proportionate

responses were not enough to offset the drastic downturn that was taking place. For example,

the Federal Reserve and state bank regulators allowed an average of 630 banks per year to

suspend operations between 1920 and 1929 because they believed them to be weaker banks that

normally would not survive in a market economy. Analyses of individual bank failures in the

1920s and 1930s by Charles Calomiris and Joseph Mason (2003) and Kris Mitchener (2005)

suggest that most of the failures in the early 1930s also fit this pattern as well. As a result, many

of the regional Federal Reserve banks felt comfortable in following the same lender of last resort

policies they had followed in the 1920s. The difference between the early 1930s and the 1920s

was the sheer scale of the failures and the economy-wide problems. The number of banks fell
                                                                                                   16


from 25 thousand to 17.8 thousand between 1930 and 1933. The shares of deposits in suspended

banks rose to 2 percent in 1930, 4.5 percent in 1931, 2.4 percent in 1932, and 11 percent in 1933.

It was likely that the banks failing in the early 1930s, having already survived through the 1920s,

were generally stronger, but they were hit by far worse circumstances in the 1930s as output

dropped sharply in every state. Thus, the Federal Reserve policy rules were not enough to

prevent failure due to the extraordinary circumstances of the 1930s.3


Monetary Policy During the Roosevelt Administration


       After taking office on March 4, 1933, Roosevelt made sweeping changes. Within two

months he had taken the U.S. off of the Gold Standard. The removal of the “Golden Fetters” and

the devaluation of the dollar to $35 dollars per ounce of gold combined with political events in

Europe to cause a flow of gold into America. The economy began to recover. This same

pattern was repeated throughout the world. In country after country as central banks sought to

maintain the gold standard, their domestic economies continued to sink. As each left the gold

standard, their economies rebounded (Temin and Wigmore 1990; Eichengreen 1992).

       The New York Fed cut the discount rate from 3.5 to 3 percent in early April. Eugene

Black, the Governor of the Atlanta Federal Reserve bank became the Chair of Federal Reserve

Board in May 1933. The Atlanta Fed was known for providing more liquidity during bank runs

than most of the other regional Feds between 1930 and 1932 (Richardson and Troost, 2009).

Under the new leadership the Fed cut the discount rate again in May 1933 from 3 to 2.5 percent.

The rate in Figure 5 fell to 2 percent by the end of the year, to 1.5 percent in 1934, and then to 1

3
 In some cases increased state enforcement and monitoring activity actually made the situation
worse for some banks. Richardson and Van Horn (2009) find that a change in monitoring
activity by New York state banking officials may well have contributed to the failure of a
number of banks in New York in the summer of 1932.
                                                                                                      17


percent in 1937, where it stayed for the rest of the decade. The rates stayed low in real terms as

well. The highest ex-post real rates occurred at around 2 and 3 percent in the deflationary years

of 1938 and 1939. In 1934 an inflation rate above 7 percent led to a real discount rate of

negative 6 percent, while a 4-percent inflation in 1937 led to a negative 2.5 percent rate.   In

terms of open market operations, the Federal Reserve’s holdings of securities were roughly

steady around $2.5 billion dollars between 1934 and 1939 (Wheelock 2006, 3-624 to 3-629).


       The Federal Reserve was given direct administrative control over the reserve

requirements of member banks when it was reorganized under the Banking Act of 1935. Under

the fractional reserve system member banks were required to hold a share of deposits in reserve

at the Federal Reserve. By 1935 the economy had been moving through two years of recovery.

Real GDP growth was very rapid, in large part because the economy was starting from a base

that was 36 percent below the level in 1929. The number unemployed had dropped significantly,

although they still composed over 15 percent of the labor force. Noting that banks were holding

large reserves above and beyond the required reserve requirements, the Fed began worrying

about the possibility of inflation. If the banks started lending out their excess reserves, the Fed

worried that the rise in the money supply would lead to rapid inflation that would halt the

recovery. The Federal Reserve doubled the long standing reserve requirements in three steps on

August 16, 1936, March 1, 1937 and May 1, 1937. The Fed had not recognized that the banks

were holding so many excess reserves to protect themselves against bank runs. The experience

of the past decade had given the banks little confidence that the Fed would act as a lender of last

resort. Therefore, the banks increased their reserves to make sure that they retained some excess
                                                                                                    18


reserves as a cushion. These changes were followed by a spike in unemployment to 19 percent,

and a decline in real GDP growth in 1937-38.4


Extraordinary Banking Policies in the 1930s


       Banking policy in the 1930s was not confined to the actions of the Federal Reserve.

Precedents were set for Treasury Secretary Paulson to establish government ownership stakes in

banks 2008 and for Secretary Geithner to seek extra certifications of the quality of bank assets

before allowing banks to buy back the government’s ownership positions.


        In February 1932 the Hoover administration established the Reconstruction Finance

Corporation (RFC). Its first moves included making loans to 4,000 banks, railroads, credit

unions and mortgage loan companies to provide assets that would jumpstart commercial lending.

Among the most important programs was the provision of loans to troubled banks to seek to

provide them with enough liquidity to survive bank runs. Recent studies suggest that these initial

loans were not successful because the RFC loans were given first priority over depositors and

other lenders in situations where the bank failed. As a result, banks had to hold the assets that

they could sell most easily to insure repayment of the RFC loans. These assets could not then be

used to repay depositors when the bank failed. When the RFC began to accept more risk by

purchasing preferred stock in the troubled banks, it was more successful at staving off bank

failures (Mason 2001; Mitchener and Mason 2010).

       During a series of bank runs between October 1932 and March 1933 30 states declared

bank holidays and the remaining states put restrictions on deposits. Under the national Bank

Holiday all banks and thrift institutions were temporarily closed. Government auditors were then

sent in to evaluate the banks and allow them to reopen if they were sound. Conservators were

appointed to improve the positions of the insolvent banks and the Reconstruction Finance

Corporation was given the power to subscribe to stock issues from the reorganized banks. These

seals of approval conferred on the reopened banks helped change expectations about the

solvency of the bank system.5


The Causal Impact of Monetary Policy


       While the vast majority of economists agree that the Federal Reserve policies were

flawed, there has been substantial debate about how much causal impact the monetary policies

had on real GDP and unemployment. In A Monetary History of the United States, 1867-1960

Milton Friedman and Anna Schwartz saw the Great Depression as one of many episodes in

which changes in the money supply strongly influenced the path of inflation and growth in real

output, typically measured by real Gross National Product (GNP). The basic equation showing

the multiplicative relationship between the money supply (M), velocity (V), the price level (P),

and Real output (Q) is


       MV=PQ                                                                             1),


The growth rate version of the equation with growth rates in lower case letters is


       m+v=p+q                                                                                 2)

       5
           See Mitchener and Mason (2010) for more detail on these extraordinary policies.
                                                                                                   20


These equations always hold in hindsight because velocity (V), the number of times the money

supply turns over in the purchase of final goods and services, is calculated as the ratio of the

money supply (M) to Nominal GNP (PQ).


         In Friedman and Schwartz’s monetarist model the equation has analytical force because

they argue that velocity moves in predictable ways. Thus changes in the money supply will lead

to changes in price (P) and real output (Q) in the same direction and the only question is how

much of the change in the money supply is allocated to changes in price and real output. Figure

6 shows the strong relationship between indexes (1929=100) of the most liquid form of money

(M1) and real output from 1929 through 1940 in level form. The price level has a weaker

relationship with the money supply during the period. Monthly indexes (1923-1925=100) of the

money supply and industrial production of consumer goods in Figure 7 also show the same

strong relationships over time. The annual growth rate version of the variables in Figure 8

shows an even stronger visual relationship between the growth rate of the money supply and the

growth in real GNP. The fit between M1 growth and the inflation rate is not so good for 1930,

1935 and 1936.


       The strong correlations are consistent with the monetarist view, but correlation does not

guarantee causation. The debates in the macroeconomic literature center on the “causal” impact

of the monetary policy on real output. How much of the drop in real output into 1933 was

caused by the failure to loosen monetary policy? How much of the rise in output from 1933

through 1937 is attributable to the reflationary monetary policy and how much of the drop in

output from 1937 to 1938 was determined by the Fed’s increases in reserve requirements?
                                                                                                      21


         Friedman and Schwartz argued that most of the changes in the measures of the money

supply were caused by changes in monetary policy. On the other hand, macroeconomists of all

stripes are aware that changes in real GDP also can cause changes in money supply measures.

Increases in income lead people to hold more money for transactions and as assets, and vice

versa. Even though the velocity measure in the monetarist equation is seen as a money demand

parameter, the money supply, prices, output, and velocity all can be seen as endogenous to the

system, so that it is very difficult to sort out causality with ordinary least squares regressions.

Keynesians, in particular, argued that the strong correlations between the money measures and

real GDP were as likely to have been driven by a causal relationship that moved from a drop in

output to a lower amount of money used in the economy. When Peter Temin (1976) asked “Did

Monetary Forces Cause the Great Depression,” he argued strong for unexplained drops in

consumption as a primary cause of the Depression. There are plenty of other culprits that have

been identified.


       In the 1970s and 1980s numerous scholars debated the impact of the money supply using

IS-LM frameworks to predict the impact of monetary policy on interest rates, prices, and output

and then provided empirical tests with the extant data. Since my charge in this paper is to

examine the scholarship of the past two decades, I cannot cover these debates adequately.

Jeremy Atack and Peter Passell (1994) and Gene Smiley (2002) provide readable surveys of the

debates. Other excellent resources on past and current debates include Randal Parker’s (2002,

2007) interviews with the leading scholars of the Great Depression.


       Rational expectations economists argued that if enough people recognized that the

changes in the demand they witnessed were due to changes in the amount of money available,

they would respond by changing price but not real output. Thus, people had to mis-estimate
                                                                                                   22


changes in monetary policy for changes in monetary policy to have a causal effect on real output

and unemployment. This has led scholars to focus on expectations. For example, James

Hamilton (1987) argues that the impact of contractionary monetary policy that started in 1928

operated through unanticipated deflation, and after 1930, through the disruption of the real

services of intermediation on the part of the financial sector as a consequence of banking panics.

In Hamilton’s (1987, 145) view “it would have been difficult to design a more contractionary

policy than that adopted in January 1928.” As $307.8 million dollars in gold flowed to France in

1928, the Federal Reserve raised the discount rate from 3.5 to 5 percent, sold $393 million in

securities between December 1927 and July 1928 and cut its holdings of bankers’ acceptances in

half by raising its buying rates from 3 to 4.5 percent. Despite Fed leaders’ claims to the

contrary, Hamilton is convinced the Fed was trying to slow the stock market boom. Meanwhile,

the stock boom led to an increased demand for loans and banks found it profitable to replace

unborrowed reserves with borrowed reserves. Hamilton cites evidence that many policy makers

did not anticipate deflation, that regression models with data from 1900 to 1940 fail to predict

deflation, and that the deflation in commodity prices caught speculators by surprise.


        More recently, Real Business Cycle theorists have argued that a combination of large

negative productivity shocks and ill-advised microeconomic policies designed to prop up wages

and prices caused the downturn. Most recent tests of the impact of monetary policy in the

Depression have been performed in the context of macroeconomic models based on micro-

economic foundations. These Dynamic Stochastic General Equilibrium (DSGE) models start

with a dynamic scenario where representative households with infinite lives choose consumption

and asset levels to maximize the expected utility of their long run stream of consumption subject

to their anticipated long run income stream. The firms that hire the household members
                                                                                                  23


maximize their expected stream of profits. There is typically a capital accumulation law for the

economy.


       The models then incorporate factors that would create inefficiencies in the operation of a

competitive economy. Many modern scholars build on Keynes’s emphasis on “sticky wages” in

the form of long term labor contract provisions or government policies designed to promote high

wages. Depression-Era policies include Hoover’s jawboning with manufacturers to get them to

maintain higher nominal wages and the Roosevelt Administration’s pressure to keep wages high

while industry established their Codes of Competition on the National Industrial Recovery Act

(Bordo, Erceg, and Evans 2000; Cole and Ohanian 2004; Chari, Kehoe, and McGratton 2002 and

2005; and Eggertsson 2009) Like Hamilton, Benjamin Bernanke (1983) argues for a causal role

for inefficiencies in credit markets caused by an increase in the cost of credit intermediation. In

particular, unanticipated deflation may have caused lenders to see many previously sound

borrowers as un-creditworthy. In the modern period, scholars add inefficiencies derived from

sticky prices and some forms of regulation.


       The scholars pick or estimate a set of parameters in the model that best fit a series of

stylized facts about features of the economy. The model is then used to perform simulations to

show how well the time paths associated with different policy regimes fit the actual Depression

era data on real output, prices, investment, interest rates, and other variables of interest.


       As one leading example, Michael Bordo, Christopher Erceg, and Charles Evans (2000)

(henceforth known as BEE) develop a model with sticky wages to incorporate the common claim

that manufacturing wages did not fall as much as people anticipated they should have during the

Great Depression (Ohanian 2009, Taylor 2009). The BEE analysis finds that contractionary
                                                                                                24


monetary shocks account for 50 to 70 percent of the decline in real GNP between 1929 and the

first quarter of 1933. They find a much weaker effect of expansionary monetary policy after the

move off of the Gold Standard in mid-1933. They argue that the expansionary monetary policy

had much weaker effects because the National Industrial Recovery Act raised nominal wages in

ways that limited production and hours worked.


       V. V. Chari, Patrick Kehoe, and Ellen McGratton (2002, 2005) reexamine the issue in the

context of their “wedges” model of the factors that lead to Depressions. They use simulations to

develop measures of three wedges: a labor wedge, an efficiency wedge, and an investment

wedge. Their labor wedge includes the combination of sticky wages and monetary policy shocks

analyzed by BEE as well as the inefficiencies from NRA policies and failures to enforce antitrust

described by Cole and Ohanian. They describe the efficiency wedge as a result of poor

government policy interacting with shocks. Finally, the investment wedge is associated with

gaps between consumer’s rates of substitution between current and future consumption and the

marginal product of capital that might arise due to agency costs (Bernanke and Gertler 1989).

This investment wedge might be associated with the types of extra costs of capital intermediation

described by Bernanke (1983) for the Depression.


       The wedge model analysis tells a mixed story about the effect of monetary policy. The

simulations from the model do not show as strong an effect for monetary policy as the BEE

(2000) model does. The labor wedge, which incorporates the combination of monetary policy

shocks and sticky wages analyzed in the BEE model, accounts by itself for about half of the

decline in real output from 1929 to 1933. Unlike the BEE model findings, the wedge model

matches up well with the post 1933 period. The combination of efficiency and labor wedges

together seem to fit the output data from 1929 to 1933 very closely. Meanwhile, the investment
                                                                                                   25


wedge, which might be associated with Bernanke’s emphasis on the costs of credit

intermediation related to bank failures, has very little explanatory power in the 1930s. Cole and

Ohanian (2005, 32) argue that the BEE (2000) model overstates the impact of monetary policy

because it includes only the sticky wage-monetary policy shock channel and does not incorporate

the other wedges included by Chari, Kehoe, and McGratton (2005, 2002) . Meanwhile, Cole

and Ohanian (2005) analyze the experience of 17 countries during the Depression using a real

business cycle model. They find that about one-third of the international Depression is

accounted for by monetary shocks and two-thirds by productivity shocks.


       Lawrence Christiano, Robert Motto, and Massimo Rostagno (2003) build a DSGE model

to account for the Depression using data from the 1920s and 1930s. They argue that economic

actors shifted their preferences in favor of more liquidity, which led them to shift away from

holding time deposits to holding cash. They develop a monetary rule that would have called for

a temporary increase in the money growth in periods after a negative shock. The rule could not

call for money growth in the same period as the negative shock because short term interest rates

were near zero. The zero-bound made contemporaneous money supply growth an ineffective

policy tool. Their simulations suggest that this post-shock monetary growth response rule

would have prevented about 80 percent of the decline between 1929 and 1933 and improved the

rate of the recovery. They also ran simulations of a monetary growth rule in which the growth

rate was held constant over the period. The results suggest that following a consistent growth

rate rule would have done little to lessen the Depression. Finally, they do not find support for

Friedman and Schwartz’s claim that the Fed could have staved off most of the Depression by

preventing the drop in M1 in 1930 seen in Figure 6.
                                                                                                   26


       Gauti Eggertsson (2009, 2007) builds another DSGE model based on the insights of Peter

Temin and Barry Wigmore (1990). The scholars argue for a strong role for deflationary shocks

as a major cause of the Great Depression. To turn the economy around, the Roosevelt

administration and the Federal Reserve had to change course sharply with a combination of new

policies that would lead to inflation. This shock to the public’s expectations could cause the

economy to recover.


       To promote recovery and have a causal effect, it was not enough to announce new efforts

by the Fed to raise the money supply. Interest rates on short term Treasury bills were near zero

and could go no lower. Further, the Fed’s past actions meant that there were no guarantees that it

would not reverse the policy in the future. Only a complete reversal of the policy dogma of the

day would work as shock therapy to convince the public that future policy would no longer be

deflationary. Expectations about future policy were the key. The move off the Gold standard

freed the Fed and the economy from the “Golden Fetters” that had prevented an inflationary

policy. The willingness to ramp up government spending signaled that the money supply would

have to be raised further to monetize the new federal debt to be issued. Eugene Meyer, the new

leader of the Fed, was known for his prior actions in combating bank failures.


       The timing of changes in output fits the story. Seasonally-adjusted industrial production

in Figure 7 spiked in April, May, June, and July, although it then declined in the latter half of the

year. Real GNP returned to its 1929 peak in 1937 in Figure 6. In Eggertsson’s (2009) dynamic

stochastic general equilibrium (DSGE) model, a continuation of the Hoover administration

policies of small government, adherence to the Gold standard, and balanced budgets would have

implied that real income would have dropped from 30 percent below the 1929 level in 1933 to 49

percent below in 1937. The simulation with the new policy regime leads to a rise in real output
                                                                                                 27


that can account for as much as 80 percent of the difference between the extremely low

counterfactual prediction in output in 1937 and the actual output in that year.


       Given that short-term nominal interest rates remained very close to the zero bound

between 1933 and 1938, Eggertsson and Benjamin Pugsley (2006) argue that they can use a

similar DSGE model with low interest rates to explain why the U.S. fell back into recession in

1937-1938. They argue that the recession was the result of the public’s perception that the

Roosevelt administration was returning to a deflationary policy. Anybody paying attention

might have thought so. The Fed raised reserve requirements in 1936 and 1937 and the federal

government reduced government spending between in the fiscal years 1937 and 1938.

Simulations from their model suggest that the sharp change to deflationary expectations driven

by the new policies was a prime contributor to a GNP reduction of 9 percent and a deflation of

11 percent.


       The most recent development in the study of the causal effects of monetary policy has

been a focus on the impact of monetary policy on individual banks and the impact of bank

failures on economic activity. Using state level information and an instrumental variable

strategy to control for endogeneity, Thomas Garrett and David Wheelock (2006) find that

changes in per capita income have a strong positive correlation with bank failures across states in

the 1920s.


       Meanwhile, Gary Richardson and William Troost (2009) have used quasi-experimental

techniques to examine the effects of different policy regimes followed by the Atlanta and the St.

Louis regional Federal Reserve Banks in the state of Mississippi. Atlanta, which oversaw

southern Mississippi, followed Bagehot’s rule for banking panics. This meant acting quickly as
                                                                                                  28


a lender of last resort to provide liquidity to prevent solvent banks faced with deposit runs from

failing and dragging healthy banks with them. St. Louis, which oversaw northern Mississippi,

followed the “real bills” doctrine that the supply of credit should contract in recessions because

less credit was required to sustain economic activity. During panics through July 1931 the St.

Louis Fed tended to limit lending and demanded extra collateral for loans.


        Richardson and Troost (2009) use a variety of methods to ensure that banks in both Fed

districts in Mississippi were similar on all dimensions, so that only differences in the Fed policies

would lead to differences in bank failure rates. They show that during the banking crisis of

November 1930 bank failures rates were significantly higher under the St. Louis Fed’s tighter

policy regime in northern Mississippi than under the Atlanta Fed’s looser regime in southern

Mississippi. When the St. Louis Fed shifted to follow policies more consistent with the Atlanta

Feds in mid-1931, the difference in failure rates went away. They then show a causal link to

real measures of output by showing that declines in wholesale trade in Mississippi tend to follow

closely behind a set of bank failures.


Federal Fiscal Policy: Spending and Taxation at the National Level


       Nearly all of the discussion of macroeconomic policy by macroeconomists focuses on

monetary policy because the Hoover and Roosevelt Administrations ran relatively small deficits

throughout the 1930s. Both administrations increased government spending. However, tax

revenues also increased markedly during both administrations.


       Most observers do not realize how much the Hoover administration increased

government spending. One reason is that Hoover remained a staunch advocate for balanced

budgets throughout his Presidency. Unlike Roosevelt, Hoover did not trumpet spending
                                                                                                   29


increases through new work-relief programs and public works programs. Instead, he expanded

existing programs by doubling federal highway spending and increasing the Army Corps of

Engineers river and harbors and flood control spending by over 40 percent.6 Hoover dam, which

was set in motion before the Depression hit, also contributed a great deal to enhanced public

works spending. The Hoover administration and Congress ramped up nominal federal

expenditures in Figure 9 by 52 percent from $3.1 billion in fiscal year 1929 to $4.7 billion in

1932 and $4.6 billion in fiscal year 1933. After adjusting for the deflation in the early 1930s in

Figure 10, real government spending in the Hoover era peaked at over 88 percent above the 1929

level in 1932 and 1933. In these figures 1933 is considered a Hoover year because the spending

and taxes are reported for a fiscal year that ran from July to June and Roosevelt’s spending did

not ramp up until July 1933.


       As the Hoover administration raised spending, tax revenues fell, and the federal budget

fell into its first deficits since World War I. The Hoover administration ran deficits because

nominal and real tax revenues fell after 1930, largely because the economy was falling apart and

despite Hoover’s desire to maintain a balanced budget. Congress and the Hoover Administration

tried to reverse the drop in tax revenues, partly by a “soak the rich” tax increase under the

Revenue Act of June 6, 1932. Less than 10 percent of households earned enough to pay income

taxes throughout the 1930s because individuals with less than $2000 in income and families of

 Nominal road spending under the Agriculture Department rose from $95 million in 1929 to
$207.2 million in 1932, while spending on rivers and harbors rose from $83 million in 1929 to
$121 million in 1931 to $118 million in 1933 (U.S. Bureau of the Census Statistical Abstract of
the United States for the years 1931 (pp. 180-182), 1933 (pp. 165-7), 1934 (pp. 165-7); U.S.
Department of Treasury 1931, pp. 435-42). In many cases the new Roosevelt agencies built
roads and performed work on rivers, harbors, and flood control that could have just as easily
been assigned to the highway departments and the Army Corps of Engineers.
                                                                                                   30


four with less than $5,000 were exempt. Those who were required to pay saw their tax rates

jump sharply. For example, individuals earning between $2,000 and $3,000 saw their rates rise

from 0.1 percent to 2 percent. The rate rose from 0.9 to 6 percent for incomes from $10 to $15

thousand, and the top rate rose from 23.1 to 57 percent for those earning over a million. Families

of four did not pay taxes until their incomes reached $5,000. Those above $5,000 saw their rates

rise across income categories in a similar fashion. The tax on corporations rose from 12 to

13.75 percent (U.S. Bureau of the Census, 1975, pp. 1111; Revenue Act of 1932).


       The rise in income tax rates did little to stem the drop in tax revenues because receipts

from household and corporate income taxes and estate taxes fell 37 percent from $1.1 billion to

780 million between 1932 and 1933. The only reason total tax collections in Figure 9 stayed

roughly the same in 1932 and 1933 was an extra $311 million in revenue delivered by the 1932

Revenue Act’s new excise taxes on oil pipeline transfers, electricity, bank checks,

communications, and manufacturers—particularly, autos, tires, oil, and gasoline (U.S. Bureau of

the Census 1975, 1107 and 1111; Commissioner of Internal Revenue, 1933, 14-15).


       After the Roosevelt’s landslide win, the Roosevelt administration and the new

Democratic Congress proceeded to raise annual nominal government spending in Figure 9 by $2

billion to roughly 6.5 billion in both fiscal 1934 and 1935, and then reached a temporary peak in

1936 at $8.4 billion. After a reduction to $6.8 billion over two years, the spending ramped up

again to $8.8 billion in 1939. Yet, only the deficits of 1934, 1936, and 1939 in Figures 9 and 10

are much larger than Hoover’s 1932 and 1933 deficits.


       Why? Tax receipts in Figure 9 rose steadily from 1933 through 1938 before tailing off

slightly. Much of the rise reflects an increase in income tax and excise tax collections
                                                                                              31


associated with the recovery.   Income tax rates largely remained at the new higher levels. The

Roosevelt administration readjusted the household income tax rates slightly in the Revenue Act

of 1934 by lowering the rates paid by individuals earning between $2,000 and $20,000 by a few

tenths of a percent and raising them a few tenths for people between $20,000 and $1 million with

similar adjustments for families. In the Revenue Act of 1936 the tax rate was raised from 31.4 to

33.4 on individuals and families earning more than $100,000 and from 57.2 to 68 for individuals

and families with more than $1 million in income. In fiscal years 1934 and 1935, the

administration temporarily collected 23 and 16 percent of its revenues from Agricultural

Adjustment Act processing taxes used to pay farmers to take land out of production. By the

time the AAA was declared unconstitutional in 1936, excise taxes on new alcohol sales after the

end of Prohibition had risen to $505 million, roughly 14 percent of tax revenues. (Commissioner

of Internal Revenue 1934, 76-77; 1935, 82-83; 1936; U.S. Bureau of Census 1975, 1107).


       The Hoover and Roosevelt administrations ran deficits in most years, but economists do

not consider them to be Keynesian stimulus attempts because the deficits were small relative to

the economic declines during the 1930s. At the time John Maynard Keynes was introducing his

theories that the economy could be brought out of a low employment equilibrium by increasing

government spending and lowering taxes and thus increasing government budget deficits. Even

though Roosevelt had ramped up spending, Keynes chastised him for not doing enough to

stimulate the economy. In an open letter carried in several newspapers in December 1933

Keynes announce that more spending was not enough. Roosevelt needed to reduce taxes and run

large federal budget deficits.7 Writing in 1941, Alva Hansen, a major figure in aiding the


       7
        In the Los Angeles Times on December 31, 1933 Keynes wrote. Thus, as the prime
mover in the first stage of the technique of recovery, I lay overwhelming emphasis on the
increase of national purchasing power resulting from governmental expenditure which is
                                                                                                    32


diffusion of Keynesian thought in the economics profession stated. “Despite the fairly good

showing made in the recovery up to 1937, the fact is that neither before nor since has the

administration pursued a really positive expansionist program…For the most part the federal

government engaged in a salvaging program and not in a program of positive expansion (quoted

in Brown 1956, p. 866).”


       E. Cary Brown (1956) and Larry Peppers (1973) carefully examined whether the deficits

were large enough to help the economy reach a target of full employment in a Keynesian model,

and concluded that they fell well short. The magnitudes of the federal government spending and

the federal deficits compared with the size of the income drop shown in Figure 10 show why.

The income drop is measured as the difference between real GNP (in $1958) in each year and the

1929 full-employment peak of $203.6 billion. The 1933 Real GNP was $62.1 billion below its

1929 level in 1958 dollars, while the real budget deficit was only $2 billion. In 1934 a $5 billion

dollar deficit was matched with a GNP shortfall of $49.3 billion; in 1935 the $4.5 billion dollar

deficit was offsetting a $34.1 billion shortfall. The figures look strongest in 1936 when a 7.5

billion deficit was matched with a $10.6 billion GNP shortfall. Keynesians argue that budget

deficits have multiplier effects. For these deficits to be meaningful at returning to full

employment, the multiplier effects would have had to have been much larger than the multiplier

estimates of two proposed by the most ardent Keynesians.8




financed by loans and is not merely a transfer through taxation from existing incomes. Nothing
else counts in comparison with this.” Barber (1996, pp. 52, 83-4) discusses the relationship
between Keynes and Roosevelt and the economic thinking of Roosevelt’s Brains Trusters.
Among Roosevelt’s advisers, there were several who also argued for using government programs
as a stimulus but they followed a different logical path for their arguments.
       8
         The extent to which fiscal policy is stimulative involves more complex calculations than
the ones described here. E. Cary Brown (1956) and Larry Peppers (1973) find that the New Deal
                                                                                                 33


       There still remains a question as to whether large federal deficits would have done much

to increase real output and reduce unemployment. Christina Romer (1992) estimated fiscal and

monetary multipliers for the period using a simple equation where


       Output Changet = βM (Monetary Change)t-1 + βF (Fiscal Change)t-1          3)


She argues for a year lag in the impact of policy and then picks two years where she could

plausibly argue that monetary and fiscal policies were not designed to offset declines in the real

economy. Romer picks output years 1921 and 1938 and thus policy years 1920 and 1937. In

both cases she argues that Federal Reserve policy was independent and not focused on the

economy. There was much less federal spending in 1937 than in 1936 because of the one-time

payout of the veterans’ bonus in 1936 over Roosevelt’s veto. After plugging values in for these

two years she finds a monetary multiplier of 0.823 that is much larger in magnitude than the

fiscal multiplier of -0.233. The fiscal multiplier is negative because a stimulatory policy would

be a situation where the spending minus taxes is negative, hence a deficit. Based on these

calculations, the fiscal deficit would not have done much.




deficits were even less stimulative than the raw numbers shown here suggest. In fact, Peppers
argues that Hoover was following more stimulative fiscal policies than Roosevelt. Any impact
that the federal government deficits had in promoting recovery had to compete with the
contractionary changes in state and local government budgets after 1933. Prior to 1933, state
and local governments generally held nearly full responsibility for relief of the indigent and the
unemployed. By 1933 state and local governments were overwhelmed by these and other
responsibilities in the midst of a sharp decline in their revenues. A number were forced to run
short-term deficits in the early 1930s. Yet state constitutions generally require balanced year-to-
year budgets. To repay the budget shortfalls and also the debt issued during the early 1930s,
state and local governments began raising taxes and establishing new taxes after 1933. The
problem was further exacerbated when the federal government dumped responsibility for direct
relief to “unemployables” back onto the state and local governments in 1935 after two years of
extensive spending. Thus, in the latter half of the 1930s, state and local governments were often
running small surpluses.
                                                                                                   34


       Eggertsson (2009, 2008) sees Roosevelt’s shift to a fiscal deficit in 1933 as having large

effects because it is part and parcel of the overall program to reflate the economy by going off of

the gold standard and using more expansionary monetary policy. In his view the deficit serves as

a commitment device that aids in convincing the public that the government will continue to run

expansionary monetary policy to monetize the debt created. Thus, the deficit is a contributor to a

change in expectations about future policy that will have large real effects. It is important to

note, however, that Eggertsson’s deficit arguments have to rely on the federal spending and

deficit changes being part of a larger package with changes in Federal Reserve monetary policy.

If spending more and running larger deficits were enough to reverse deflationary expectations by

themselves, Hoover’s doubling of spending and the presence of federal deficits in 1932 and 1933

should have helped boost the economy before Roosevelt was inaugurated.


Federal Spending and Its Impact on State and Local Economies


       In the past few years there has been an explosion of work about New Deal spending

policies that address the impact of the New Deal spending programs at the state, local, and

county level. The results of these studies are reported in Table 1. One key insight to the papers

is the importance of thinking about the purpose of the federal grants distributed and the terms on

which they were distributed. For example, Fishback, Horrace, and Kantor (2005, 2006) find that

public works and relief grants contributed to increases in economic activity and to net in-

migration into areas while AAA farm payments had slightly negative effects. The public works

and relief grants had positive effects because they simultaneously provided employment, extra

income, and public goods that raised productivity in the areas. The AAA payments

automatically had a crowding-out feature to them because they were designed to take agricultural

land out of production in an attempt to lower output and raise farm prices nationally. The
                                                                                                   35


farmers who received the payments may have benefited, but this likely came at the expense of

farm workers and croppers who lost employment or saw their wages decline due to the drop in

demand for labor.


       A series of papers offer conflicting pictures of the impact of relief programs on private

employment in the 1930s. Studies of cross-sectional data using Instrumental Variable estimation

by Robert Fleck (1999) for county data in 1937 and 1940 and by John Wallis and Daniel

Benjamin (1981) using city data in 1934/1935 suggest that areas with higher relief employment

did not experience a reduction in private employment. On the other hand, studies using panel

data sets, which allow the research to take advantage of variation across time within locations

while controlling for nationwide shocks in different years, find some degree of crowding out that

varies across time. In the early years of the decade when unemployment was at its peak above

20 percent, Kent Matthews and Daniel Benjamin (1992) find that the addition of one work relief

job reduced private employment by about one-third of a job, while Todd Neumann, Price

Fishback, and Shawn Kantor (2010) find a slight positive effect of relief spending on private

employment. After 1935, when unemployment rates fell below 20 percent, both studies find that

an additional work relief job was associated with a reduction of up to nine/tenths of a private job.

       Fishback and Valentina Kachanovskaya (2010) recently have estimated a New Deal

fiscal multiplier at the state level. They examine the impact of net federal spending per capita

(federal spending minus taxes) on state personal income per capita in an annual panel of states

for the years 1930 through 1940. In estimates that control for the endogeneity of the distribution

of funds using state and year fixed effects and state-specific time trends, the results show a slight

negative relationship between net federal spending and per capita income. They then add to the

analysis an instrument for net federal spending that uses a combination of trends in spending
                                                                                                   36


outside the region and measures of swing voting. The multiplier estimates using the IV

procedure with state and year effects range from 0.91 to 1.72, depending on how federal

spending is defined. The multiplier for federal grants was 1.45, but only .91 when federal

spending includes both grants and loans.     When effects are estimated separately for AAA farm

grants and nonAAA farm grants the multiplier for the farm grants is -0.57 and the multiplier for

the nonAAA grants is 1.72.


Tax Rates and the Supply-side


       The supply-side features of fiscal policy changes involving tax rates in the 1930s have

not been investigated in great depth. Nearly all of the changes called for increased tax rates,

which likely retarded the growth of the economy. The Hoover administration has been rightfully

tarred for its attempts to raise tax rates. Although less than 10 percent of households paid

income taxes, the rise in income tax rates for households with more than $1 million in earnings

in 1932 was confiscatory and likely led to extensive tax avoidance. Given that the economy was

falling further in 1932 and 1933, it is hard to sort out how much of the drops in income tax and

estate tax collections were caused by the economy declining and how much were due to tax

avoidance. Some of the decline in the economy might well have been driven by the high rates

(Piketty and Saez, 2003). The Roosevelt administration did little to reduce the tax rates in 1934

and then jacked the top rate still higher in 1936.


       Other new federal taxes created additional distortions. The new excise taxes on

manufacturers established in the 1932 act contributed to inefficiencies in the economy. William

Lastrappes and George Selgin (1997), for example, find that the two-cent tax on checks from

1932 to 1934 led households to shift significantly toward holding money in the form of currency
                                                                                                   37


rather than in the form of checking accounts in banks. The National Industrial Recovery Act of

1933 instituted a tax on capital stock, dividends, and excess profits that was collected through the

rest of the 1930s. These taxes typically led to the collection of roughly $100 million to $150

million in revenue, about 2 to 3 percent of total federal receipts (Commissioner of Internal

Revenue, 1934, 1935, 1936, 1937, Table 1). In 1936 the federal government added a surtax on

profits not distributed as dividends. It rose progressively as a function of the percentage of

earnings retained out of corporate income, from 7 percent on the first 10 percent retained up to

27 percent on retentions above 60 percent of income. The surtax was reduced in 1938 and

expired in December 1939. The undistributed profits tax delivered $145 million in tax revenue

in 1936 and $176 million in 1937 (Calomiris and Hubbard 1993).


       Although the amounts of revenue collected were relatively small, all of these taxes likely

led to distortions in investment spending. Calomiris and Hubbard (1993) studied the investment

and cash flow decisions of 273 publicly-traded manufacturing firms. As might be expected the

share of income retained as earnings by companies fell from 23 percent in 1935 to 15 percent in

1936 and 1937. However, nearly one-fourth of the companies held enough earnings to pay the

highest marginal rate of 27 percent. These companies tended to be smaller firms in the fastest

growing industries who faced more difficulty in finding external financing. Thus, it appears that

the undistributed profits tax led to significant distortions in investment decisions.


       The final tax to consider is one that was clearly not designed to raise revenue. The

Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930 raised taxes on imports substantially on top of an earlier rise

in 1922. The goal was to protect American manufacturers from competition from foreign

imports. International trade was a small enough percentage of the American economy at the time

that most economists ascribe the tariff a secondary role as a contributor to the Depression in the
                                                                                                   38


U.S. However, it had far worse implications at the international level. The Smoot-Hawley tariff

was matched by a series of protectionist measures by countries throughout the world. As each

nation tried to protect its home production interests through higher tariffs and restrictions on

imports, world trade spiraled downward. By 1933 the total imports for 75 countries had fallen to

roughly one-third of the level seen in 1929 (Kindleberger 1986).


       The Roosevelt administration contributed to a recovery in world trade by relaxing these

tariff barriers. The Reciprocal Trade Agreement (RTA) Act of 1934 freed the Roosevelt

administration to sign a series of tariff reduction agreements with key trading partners.

Agreements with Canada, several South American countries, Britain and key European trading

partners loosened the trade restrictions markedly. As a result, American imports rose from a 20-

year low in 1932-1933 to an all-time high by 1940.9


Current Policy in Light of 1930s Policy


       Nearly all agree that the Federal Reserve’s monetary policy was disastrous on a variety of

dimensions. The only disagreements relate to why the Federal Reserve followed the path it did

and how large the causal effects were. On the fiscal side, the Hoover and Roosevelt

administrations both increased federal spending, but tax revenues rose enough that they ran

       9
        For historical comparisons of the impact of tariff rates, see Irwin (1998). Kindleberger
(1986, 170) and Atack and Passell (1994, 602) describe the international trade developments in
the 1930s.
                                                                                                     39


relatively small deficits. Since less than 90 percent of households paid income taxes, most of

the supply-side distortions came from the extraordinarily high tax rates of over 57 percent paid

by households with over one million dollars in income (roughly 16 million in today’s dollars)

after 1932. The capital stock, dividend, and undistributed profits taxes contributed to distortions

in investment decisions that have not been explored very fully. Meanwhile, the Hawley-Smoot

tariff is largely considered to be a major mistake that greatly harmed world trade.


        There is no doubt that the policies of the 1930s are influencing the policies developed

during the financial meltdown of 2007-2008 and the Great Recession of 2008-2009.          Federal

Reserve Chairman Benjamin Bernanke has long been known for his work on the

macroeconomics of the Great Depression. Bernanke and Treasury Secretaries Henry Paulson

and Timothy Geithner have followed strategies that were the antithesis of Fed policy in the

1930s. The Federal Reserve of the 1930s did lower discount rates, but the high rates of deflation

left real interest rates at double-digit levels not seen since. The Fed waited for three years, as

unemployment rose above 10 percent, then 16 percent, and then 20 percent, before making a

large-scale open market purchase of $1 billion. In contrast, Bernanke ran open market

operations that expanded liquidity and drove the federal funds rate close to zero before the

unemployment rate passed seven percent in 2008. The Fed has continued the liquidity expansion

by buying large amounts of mortgaged backed securities.


       To prevent shocks from failures that they believed would topple the financial system, the

Fed and Treasury tore pages out of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation (RFC) playbook.

They brokered mergers and bailouts of Bear Stearns, AIG, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac. They

used Temporary Asset Replacement Program (TARP) funds to take investment stakes and

guarantee assets in banks, made loans to auto companies and then developed stress tests of the
                                                                                                       40


banks similar to those of the 1933 Bank Holiday before allowing banks to buy out the

government’s interest. Given descriptions by the principals of how close to failure these

institutions were, the monetary policy changes and emergency policies seem necessary and may

well have staved off a financial meltdown that could have touched off a severe Depression. We

will never know for sure because so many events occurred in such a short time frame that there is

not enough variation to identify what the counterfactual would have been had the Fed and

Treasury not acted.


        It will take some more time before we see the actual cost of these moves, but the losses

will likely be small relative to the reserves promised, and the government might even earn a

profit on the transactions. There are two major issues to address associated with these moves.

First, do we want the federal government so heavily involved in financing the economy? Fannie

Mae and Freddie Mac, which were supposed to have been independent corporations since the

1970s, are now essentially government-owned enterprises that finance or guarantee the vast

majority of new mortgage loans. Second, the bailouts and backing provided for the Great

Recession have likely created moral hazard problems, in which financial institutions take more

risks in the future while anticipating another government bailout. Congress continues to struggle

with this issue in trying to set regulations to insure that no financial institutions are too big to

fail. Arguments have been made to limit the size of commercial banks, or instead limit the types

of investments, or even just leave the banks alone. It is a thorny issue and well-known

economists have argued for each of the positions (Wessel 2010).


        On the fiscal side, Great Depression scholar Christina Romer is the current head of the

President’s Council of Economic Advisors. Here again, the Obama administration and the

Democratic Congress has gone in the opposite direction from the Hoover and Roosevelt
                                                                                                   41


administrations. The new leaders built on a deficit that had been rising under George Bush by

passing a sizeable fiscal stimulus package that raised the deficit to 9.9 percent of GDP in 2009

from 3.3 percent in 2008. Even after excluding the budget impact of the Troubled Assets Relief

Program (TARP) the 2009 deficit was roughly 8.9 percent of GDP.10 The anticipated deficit for

fiscal 2010, ending on September 30, 2010 is 10.6 percent. The U.S. is flying blind with a deficit

of this size because previous experiments with large fiscal deficits have been on the order of five

to six percent of GDP.11 In the case of the Reagan-Bush era of 1980-1992 the economic logic

underlying the deficits was an emphasis on the supply-side effects of lower tax rates on income.


       Some think that World War II offers an example of a situation where fiscal stimulus

worked. But the World War II analogy is highly misleading for any discussion of a peace-time

economy. The deficits were run during an all-out war when 40 percent of GDP was spent on

munitions, the military made most of the allocation decisions in the economy, over 15 percent of

the workforce was in harm’s way in the military, there were widespread wage and price controls,

and rationing ruled the day. In essence, the World War II deficit experience tells us more about

  The bailouts and ownership stakes taken by the Treasury and Fed are not easily measured in
the budget figures. Since the assets and ownership stakes have value and many of the loans will
likely be repaid, the actual Treasury costs could be quite low or the government could turn a
profit. The listed federal outlays under the TARP in fiscal 2009, October 1 2008 to September
30, 2009, were $151 Billion, which was about 1 percent of GDP or roughly 10 percent of the
budget deficit. The outlay was substantially less than the earlier forecast outlay of $247 billion.
The Obama administration predicts that the net cost to the Treasury will fall further once loans
are repaid and assets resold. See Office of Management and Budget (2010, 152 for the actual
2009 figure and Office and Management and Budget (2009, 117) for the forecast. It is hard to
see signs of the bailout of Freddie Mac, Fannie Mae, and AIG in the budget figures.

fiscal stimulus in the Soviet Union’s command economy during the Cold War than it does about

the modern U.S. mixed economy.


       Even as an exercise in pure government spending the current situation looks quite

different from the Great Depression. A large share of federal government spending in the 1930s

was spent on income maintenance programs and work relief, and the federal government

spending started at only 4 percent of GDP at the start of the decade. With a much larger safety

net already in place in the current era, federal spending has risen from 20 to 25 percent of GDP.

The most famous program of the 1930s, the Works Progress Administration, would not be

acceptable today, because most people today receive unemployment insurance benefits that pay

roughly the same share of income as the WPA, but without the WPA’s requirement that they

work construction to get the benefits.


       There is no doubt that the Great Recession has been one of the two most serious post-war

recessions. Unemployment rates have exceeded 9 percent for more than a year, and real GDP

went through a year-long decline between the peak in the second quarter of 2008 and the trough

in the second quarter of 2009. However, the current fiscal stimulus response seems to be out of

proportion to the problem, especially when the lost output and unemployment are compared with

the Great Depression. The U.S. in 2007 started at average GDP per capita levels that were five

times higher than in 1929. Inflation rates are as low as they have ever been, and the U.S. is not

experiencing the large non-neutral deflation of the 1930s. By the time the fiscal stimulus

package was passed in February 2009, the impending financial disaster of fall 2008 had largely

passed. Real GDP turned upward in the second quarter of 2009 before very much of the fiscal

stimulus money had been passed out. By the first quarter of 2010 real GDP had reached 99.4
                                                                                                    43


percent of the GDP peak in second quarter 2008, and it is likely that more than half of the

stimulus money had still not been distributed.


       The major problem is that unemployment rates remain near 10 percent in May 2010. Yet

only a small part of the stimulus money is going toward expanded unemployment benefits.

There are growing worries that the government expansion may be partially crowding out private

activity. Many multiplier estimates are significantly less than one, implying that deficits lead to

crowding out of private employment. The current fiscal stimulus program seems to be the size

of response a Keynesian would have called for in the Great Depression, while the changes in the

size of the federal deficits during the Great Depression seem more like the changes we might

expect policy makers would make in response to the Great Recession of 2007-2009.12 Over ten

years in response to unemployment rates ranging between 10 and 25 percent the Hoover and

Roosevelt administrations raised the federal debt as a percentage of GDP by 28 percentage

points, from 16 percent in 1929 to 44 percent in 1939. In response to unemployment rates

ranging from 5 to 10 percent, the U.S. government has achieved a similar rise in the federal debt

as a percentage of GDP in just three years, from 36 percent in 2007 to an anticipated 64 percent

at the end of fiscal 2010.


       Going forward, macroeconomic policy makers face two major challenges. As the

economy continues its recovery, the huge amount of liquidity in the banking system has

everybody anticipating a rise in inflation at some point. Can the Fed effectively soak up this

liquidity to prevent a raging inflation without causing the kind of second dip recession that

occurred in 1937 and 1938?


       On the fiscal side, the deficit has risen markedly and the federal government still has not

yet effectively addressed the long run funding problems with the pay-as-you-go Social Security

and Medicare programs. Everybody expects the new health care entitlements to add to those

funding problems, particularly because Congress is currently trying to restore Medicare

payments to doctors that were cut in the health reform act to make the act look like it would not

add to the deficit. We know that budget deficits at 10 percent of GDP are not sustainable.


       So when will the U.S. start dealing with these budget issues? Based on Obama’s fiscal

2011 budget proposal announced in February 2010, it will not be fiscal year 2011. The budget

calls for a freeze on discretionary non-security spending, which account for less than one-sixth of

spending. Tax rates will rise for high income households, as the Bush tax cuts expire for that

group. Financial institutions and investment managers will pay higher taxes, and subsidies for

oil and gas companies will be reduced. Based on the experience with the 1932 tax rate increases,

do not expect a substantial rise in tax collections. As has been promised in numerous other

budgets, the administration will attempt to cut waste in government, close loopholes, increase

IRS enforcement, and create a fiscal commission. Congress will return to PAYGO rules

requiring each new spending program to be offset by spending cuts elsewhere, but these have

been routinely ignored over the past three years. Meanwhile, the budget offers new tax breaks

for small business investment and job creation, no expiration of the Bush tax cuts for middle and

low income people, and subsidies for sustainable energy (Office of Management and Budget

2010; Geithner 2010). The proposed budget looks more like “government business as usual”

rather than a serious response to dealing with deficits.
