Elite Identity and Political Accountability: A Tale of Ten Islands

                                          ABSTRACT

Emancipation of slaves in the 1830s transformed the political elites of the British-Caribbean
plantation islands. New elites were more accountable to the citizenry. We develop a theory in
which two factors limit and possibly reverse the effect of this on political outcomes, with
legislators (i) ‘stepping up to pass extractive policies and/or (ii) weakening democratic
institutions. The theory is supported by an historical analysis of ten Caribbean plantation islands,
based on original archival data on legislator race, occupation and roll-call voting. Eventually, all
assemblies that experienced a significant change in composition dissolved themselves and
converted to British ‘Crown Rule’.

1       Introduction

In 1836, slaves were emancipated throughout the British Empire. In the British Caribbean ‘sugar

islands’, this had dramatic consequences for the islands’ elites and their interaction with the newly

formed citizenry. At the time of Emancipation, the population of the islands was two to three per-

cent white; eight percent of mixed race, a group that “had been freed earlier and possessed, in

many cases, substantial property”; and almost ninety percent black, newly emancipated (Taylor,

1885, p. 207).      1   After Emancipation, many whites left the islands. The gradually increasing num-

ber of enfranchised freed blacks largely supported the new mixed-race elite (who met the property

qualifications for office) to represent them in the islands’ legislative assemblies. As a result, the

new elite gained political power. Figure 1 shows that within 20–30 years of Emancipation, this

new elite made up sizeable portions, in many cases even majorities, of the islands’ legislative

assemblies.2

        Despite the shifting identity of the political elite, political outcomes exhibited little change.

New elites were expected by many to support policies that would benefit the new black citizenry,

including expansion of education, health provision, and less regressive taxation. Yet, throughout

this period, “each major inquiry [by English Parliament] into the British West Indies noted with

amazement that nothing had been changed since the last report” (Craton, 1988, p. 165). Between

1861 and 1877, legislators in all but one of the 10 islands dissolved their assemblies, and replaced

them with legislative councils that were to be appointed by the British Crown. In Figure 1, the

dissolution dates are the endpoints of the plots. The only island not to dissolve its assembly,

Barbados, was also the only island not to experience significant change in the composition of the
    1
     This distinction between the new mixed-race elite and the black citizenry was rooted in the fact that non-white
Caribbean elites were the descendants of white slave-owners and slave mistresses, subsequently freed and bequeathed
property (Lowes 1995, p.37, Patterson 2013, p.16).

Notes: The figure plots the evolution of the share of the new elite in the legislative assemblies of the nine Caribbean
islands that eventually dissolved their assemblies. The end-point is marked in each island by its assembly’s self-
dissolution. All sub-figures are identically scaled: from 1836 to 1886 on the horizontal axis, and from 0 to 1 (denoting
100 percent) on the vertical axis. In Barbados, the only island not depicted, the share of new elites always stayed below
fifteen percent throughout the nineteenth century, and Barbados was the only island that never dissolved its assembly
(for reasons we will touch upon later).




political elite, with the old white elite holding over ninety percent of assembly seats.

            How could the emancipation from slavery of over ninety percent of the population, a sizeable

fraction of whom obtained the franchise, not lead to a more dramatic improvement in policies?

The leading explanation for such continuity in political outcomes is the iron law of oligarchy, de-

scribed by Acemoglu and Robinson (2006) as follows: “The reason for persistence is not persis-

tence of the elites, but the persistence of incentives of whoever is in power to distort the system for

their own benefit.”3 What we document is a more extreme version of the iron law. First, it is not

hard to see how political outcomes might be independent from elite identity in non-democratic

settings, e.g. when new elites hijack existing extractive institutions after military coups. It is
   3
     Michels (1911) first coined the term to refer to the ‘inevitable’ emergence of a leadership class, or oligarchy, in
organizations.



                                                                  2
harder to see how this can occur in settings with electoral institutions. Second, in the Caribbean,

elites were not replaced like for like, but rather new elites were more closely connected and thus

accountable to the citizenry. Two mechanisms are identified that preserve an iron law of oligarchy

in such settings.

       We analyse repeating roll call voting over extractive policies in a legislature whose composition

changes endogenously. Legislators differ in terms of (1) political accountability and (2) economic

interests. Changes in the composition of the legislature, in terms of both political accountability

and economic interests, do matter for political outcomes. Accountable types are less likely to vote

for extractive policies, i.e. policies that benefit the elite at the expense of the citizenry.4 Hence the

likelihood that extractive policy is passed falls as the share of accountable legislators rises. But

two factors limit and possibly reverse the effect of changes in political elite identity.

  (1) Stepping up. When accountable types are rare, it is mostly unaccountable types who vote for

         extractive policy because they do so at lower electoral cost. Accountable elites share an eco-

         nomic interest in extractive policy, but free ride when voting to avoid electoral punishment.

         Unaccountable types thus provide an elite ‘club good’. As the share of accountable types

         grows, however, they need to ‘step up’ and begin voting for the extractive policy for it to

         pass.

‘Stepping up’ is needed to maintain the legislative majority required to pass extractive policy,

giving it the character of a threshold ‘club good’ (Schelling, 1978; Palfrey and Rosenthal, 1984).

       However, there are limits to the extent to which ‘stepping up’ can compensate for a rising share

of more accountable elites. When this share becomes large, ‘stepping up’ is not enough. In those

cases, an extractive equilibrium that sustained only by a more drastic response.

  (2) Institutional Change. When new legislators face greater accountability, they may weaken

         electoral institutions to enact extractive policies at lower electoral cost.

That institutional change can be a means of preserving elite rents is well-known. What is new

in our theory is that democratic institutions are not weakened by an old elite to shut out a new

elite, but instead they are weakened by a coalition of old and new elites in response to the greater
   4
    Extractive policies are typically modelled simply as a regressive tax in the related literature (Meltzer and Richard,
1981; Acemoglu and Robinson, 2001). In our empirical application, we will have three types of extractive policies: (i)
policies to depress agricultural wages, (ii) regressive land taxes, (iii) lowering of public-good provision.


                                                           3
accountability of the new elite. A modern-day example of such a phenomenon may be the consti-

tutional reforms undertaken by the fledgling Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe in the late 1980s and

early 1990s, which protected it from popular pressure for land reform.5

       Our theory is applied to an historical analysis of ten British Caribbean sugar-plantation islands

after the emancipation of slaves. The great strength of this application is that we can get an unusu-

ally sharp characterization of the social and economic identity of each elite member. Using novel

archival data on Caribbean legislators’ race and occupation, and their roll-call voting in the assem-

blies, we show that legislators from the new elite were more politically (electorally) accountable

for voting for extractive policies, and that legislators’ roll-call voting behaviour depended on their

type and the overall composition of the legislature in the manner predicted by our theory.6 As the

share of white planters in the elite declined, individual members of the new elite indeed ‘stepped

up,’ i.e. increased their support for extractive policies. Finally, we show that the timing of the

dissolution of the assemblies is consistent with the political-accountability explanation suggested

by our theory, but inconsistent with the conclusion of many Caribbean historians — who did not

have access to our newly collected data on Caribbean elites’ identities and their voting patterns —

that the dissolution of the legislatures was as an attempt by white elites to prevent the new elite

from taking control (Ashdown 1979, p.34, Lowes 1994, p.35).

       Our theory and empirical analysis illustrate that democracy is not necessarily a self-enforcing

system. Expansion of the franchise, as happened with a bang after Emancipation in the Caribbean,

does not automatically produce an absorbing democratic state, but requires sufficient ongoing

support among the elite. This support depends not only on conflict between the elite and the

masses, but also crucially on inter-elite and intra-elite dynamics (North, Wallis, and Weingast,

2009). Moreover, it can be undermined by attempts to increase political accountability within the

electoral system, without proper institutional safeguards of the electoral system.

2    Existing Literature

By examining the effect of political elite identity on political outcomes, our paper is part of an

expansion of the literature on the economics of identity into political economy (see Akerlof and

Kranton, 2000, 2010; Shayo, 2009; Bénabou and Tirole, 2011; Akerlof, 2017).7 Major political tran-

sitions not only involve changes in formal institutions (e.g. North and Weingast, 1989), but also

shifts in the composition of the political elite. Many countries have experienced a transition in

power from elite groups with distinct social and economic identities (e.g. aristocrats, colonial

elites) to elites that are more closely connected (and accountable) to the citizenry. Examples in-

clude the Reform Act in 1832 which made British Parliament more representative by removing

rotten boroughs and the aristocrats elected by them. Latin America in the 18th century saw the

emergence of ‘Creole elites’ who were tied to the land and had incentives that were fundamentally

different from those of Spanish colonial administrators (Anderson, 1983). In much of the develop-

ing world, the end of colonialism saw the replacement of European elites with a mix of indigenous,

mixed race, and transplanted elite groups. Despite the abundance of historical examples, there is

relatively little work on the political consequences of changes in the identity composition of the

elite.

    Our focus is on how changes in the elite’s composition affect extractive policies through the

elite’s changing political accountability. Political accountability is the degree to which elite mem-

bers are punished for supporting extractive policies, through for example revolt (Acemoglu and

Robinson, 2000; Aidt and Franck, 2015), social sanctions (Miguel and Gugerty, 2005), and electoral

punishment—voting against candidates who support extractive policies in subsequent elections.

There is a large literature demonstrating that better institutions and policy outcomes are brought

about by greater political accountability, due for example to shocks to the cost of collective action

by citizens (Acemoglu and Robinson, 2001; Brückner and Ciccone, 2011) and improvements in

monitoring of elites (Tabellini and Persson, 2000; Besley and Prat, 2006; Ferraz and Finan, 2008). By

contrast, elite identity has received relatively little attention as a determinant of political account-

ability, with Corvalan, Querubin, and Vicente (2016) being a notable exception. Yet, it is clearly

important: Elites that are socially closer to the citizenry may face greater political accountability
   7
     The paper of course also speaks directly to the literature on Caribbean post-Emancipation political history. See for
example Rogers (1970), Heuman (1981), Brizan (1984), Craton (1988), and Holt (1991).


                                                           5
because they have less control over voters, weaker military protection and poorer exit options

than the aristocrats and colonial elites that came before them. In addition, social sanctions against

elites may be more effective when social distance to the citizenry is low, as in Miguel and Gugerty

(2005), and citizens may feel greater betrayal by leaders from their own group, as in Di Tella and

Rotemberg (2016).8

    Like us, Acemoglu and Robinson (2000), Lizzeri and Persico (2004), and Ashraf, Cinnirella,

Galor, Gershman, and Hornung (2017) decompose the elite into groups by economic interest. Sim-

ilarly, Mattozzi and Snowberg (2015) analyse a model of legislative bargaining with rich and poor

legislators. None of these papers focus on the social distance between the elite and the citizenry.

On the other hand, Shayo (2009) and Abramson and Shayo (2017) examine the identity composi-

tion of the citizenry but not in relation to the elite. In modelling an elite member’s type as having

both a social (political accountability) and economic dimension, our approach is closest to that of

Bisin and Verdier (2015) who model elite heterogeneity along economic and cultural dimensions.

Their focus is not on the political accountability channel we study here, however. Surprisingly, we

find that increasing the political accountability of individual elite members does not necessarily

aggregate to greater accountability of the political system as a whole.

    We identify two mechanisms that preserve the iron law even when legislators tend to be re-

placed by more accountable types. How these mechanisms are related to the broader political

economy literature is now discussed. First, to our knowledge, we are the first to uncover the ‘step-

ping up’ mechanism. This behaviour makes it difficult to infer the political preferences of minority

political factions. We have chosen a model that conforms closely to our motivating Caribbean ex-

ample, but the logic of ‘stepping up’ is more general. For example, ‘stepping up’ could occur if

a shrinking bloc of unaccountable elites uses side-payments to co-opt accountable elites, as in the

literature on vote-buying in legislatures (e.g. Groseclose and Snyder, 1996).9 Another possible ap-

proach could focus explicitly on coalition formation, where a stable ruling coalition may re-form

to include accountable elites (in a manner different to the process we analyse), as in Acemoglu,
    8
       Elite composition can also affect extractive policies because of ingroup bias; i.e. elite members who are socially
closer to the citizenry may support non-extractive policies because of altruistic in-group preferences and norms (Shayo,
2009; Bramoullé and Goyal, 2016). We recognize the potential importance of in-group altruism, but it does not generate
either of the two patterns we focus on, namely stepping up and institutional change.
    9
      See also Auriol and Platteau (2017) on co-option by an autocrat of religious elites through side payments. A setup
like that could also see accountable elites being co-opted to permanently change electoral institutions.

Egorov, and Sonin (2008).

    Second, we add to the literature on institutional change. Acemoglu and Robinson (2008)

present a model in which elites respond to a loss of de jure power by investing in de facto power,

e.g. collective action. In our case, the direction of causality is reversed. We show that extractive

policies may persist despite increasing de facto accountability if elites can alter de jure institu-

tions to protect themselves. The dissolution of legislative institutions in the Caribbean sets an

interesting counter-point to the more common empirical pattern whereby temporary increases in

political accountability tend to strengthen, reinforce and lock in democratization (Acemoglu and

Robinson, 2000; Brückner and Ciccone, 2011; Aidt and Franck, 2015). Our analysis also contrasts

with the more commonly proposed reason for institutional erosion, whereby old elites weaken

institutions in order to protect their rents against an emergent new elite. See for example, Trefler

and Puga (2014) who show that in Medieval Venice incumbent elites eroded formal institutions

in an attempt to shut out new elites. Unlike this line of work, we focus on the interplay between

different elite groups, and circumstance under which old and new elites work together to weaken

institutions.

    Setting aside the precise mechanisms of persistence that we focus on, our paper also adds

broadly to the existing literature arguing that the interplay of institutional change and persistence

are critical to economic development. The seminal papers by Engerman and Sokoloff (1997) and

Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson (2002) both emphasize that institutional change reversed the

positions of the U.S. and the Caribbean in the world income distribution. Implicit in both papers

was a contrast between the persistence of extractive institutions in the Caribbean and the change

towards more inclusive institutions in the U.S., but neither paper discussed Caribbean institu-

tions in any detail. Even the comparative study of specifically electoral institutions in Engerman

and Sokoloff (2005) does not provide any detail on the Caribbean. Our paper enriches the broad

arguments in this literature by filling in many details of institutional change in the Caribbean.



3   The Theory

To examine the effect of elite identity on political outcomes, we examine repeated roll-call voting

in an n member legislature with a changing distribution of legislator types. Legislators are het-


                                                 7
erogenous along two dimensions: (1) economic interests and (2) political accountability. In the

Caribbean, economic interests were determined by occupation (planter or merchant) and politi-

cal accountability by race (old white elite and new elite), as we shall see.10 We focus on electoral

accountability because it is the most prevalent form of political accountability in the literature.11

Our equilibrium construction is in Markov strategies, which are simple enough to be played by

plausible human players.


3.1     Setup

Consider an infinite-horizon model with discrete time indexed by t = 0, 1, 2 . . . Each period, soci-

ety consists of a finite and possibly changing set of players Mt , drawn from a universal player set

M which is countably infinite. Society is divided into an elite and a citizenry. The elite is denoted

by Et ⊂ Mt with typical member i.

       Policy is determined by voting in a legislature composed of n > 2 members.12 The set of

legislators in period t is denoted by Nt . Legislators are drawn from the elite: Nt ⊂ Et .13 While the

size of the legislature n is fixed, its composition Nt changes over time.

       Voting and Policy:       Each period t, every i ∈ Nt votes either for extractive economic policy

vit = 1 or against it vit = 0. Denote the profile of voting choices in period t by vt ≡ (vit )i∈Nt .

The policy implemented is determined by majority rule and denoted by xt ∈ {0, 1}, where x = 1

is the extractive policy. For example, x = 1 could be a wage-depressing policy which increases

economic rents to the elite. Without loss of generality, ties are broken in favour of the extractive

policy.

       Types:     Elite members (hence legislators) differ in terms of (1) economic interests and (2)

political accountability, as in the Caribbean context. Agent i’s economic interest is ωi ∈ {h, `},

where h types receive a greater economic rent from extractive policy. Agent i’s political account-
  10
     Occupational choice and race may be correlated. For example, most large farmers in Zimbabwe were of British
origin under Mugabe until the land reforms in 2000.
  11
     We examined the threat of revolt as a source of political accountability in an earlier version of the paper (Carvalho
and Dippel, 2016).
  12
     This is a departure from citizen-candidate models in which a single decision maker is selected from the citizenry
(Osborne and Slivinski, 1996; Besley and Coate, 1997). Models of legislative bargaining have more than one political
decision maker (Buchanan and Tullock, 1962; Weingast, 1979), but their focus is on dividing a fixed budget among
districts (Baron and Ferejohn, 1989), whereas we examine voting over a common, extractive policy.
  13
     This matches the Caribbean context, but does not qualitatively change any of the results. Relatedly, Corvalan et al.
(2016) develop a citizen-candidate model with wealth restrictions for office that are higher than the wealth restrictions
needed to vote.

ability is denoted by θi ∈ {L, H}, where L (H) denotes low (high) political accountability, in a

manner to be made precise below. A legislator’s two-dimensional type is denoted by Θi = (θi , ωi ),

which is fixed for all time. The space of individual types is denoted by T ≡ {L, H} × {`, h}. Let
        P
nt (Θ) ≡ i∈Nt I(Θi = Θ) be the number of Θ types in the legislature at time t. The distribution of

legislator types at time t is

                                                  zt ≡ (nt (Θ))Θ∈T .

    Payoffs:        Legislators maximize the expected discounted sum of their payoffs over time.

There are two (additively separable) components of stage-game payoffs. First, every elected legis-

lator receives per-period political rents worth r, which could be salary, perquisites, and ‘ego rents’

from being in office. All others receive no political rents. Second, each elite member (elected and

unelected) receives an economic rent worth π(x, ωi ), which depends on whether extractive policy

is passed, x, and i’s economic type, ωi . To simplify expressions, we set π(0, ωi ) = 0 for ωi = `, h.

When extractive policy is passed, we assume


                                              π(1, h) > π(1, `) > 0.                                                  (1)


That is, both types receive economic rents from extractive policy but h types profit more than `

types. In Online Appendix A.1, we describe an economy in which this ordering of economic rents

holds.14


3.1.1   Political Turnover

The composition of the legislature changes both endogenously (through elections) and exoge-

nously (e.g. through out-migration of old elites).

    Attrition:     With probability 1 − δ, i ∈ Nt is exogenously and permanently removed from the

elite (and legislature) in period t + 1, earning a payoff of zero thenceforth. In this case, i replaced

in Nt+1 with a player drawn uniformly at random from Et+1 . We refer to 1 − δ as the attrition rate,

where δ ∈ (0, 1) will serve as each player’s discount factor.

    Elections:     With probability δ, i is not exogenously removed, and his likelihood of re-election
   14
      Another mechanism shaping economic rents, which we do not model here, is capital destruction by the citizenry.
The citizenry might destroy capital to reduce rents from extraction and legislators might vote less frequently for extrac-
tive policy to reduce incentives to destroy capital.


                                                            9
depends on his roll-call voting choice. Though we do not explicitly model voting by the citi-

zenry, re-election of legislators occurs in a manner consistent with retrospective voting by citizens

(Barro, 1973; Ferejohn, 1986).15 If legislator i votes against extractive policy in period t (vit = 0),

he is re-elected with probability p̄ ∈ (0, 1]. If he votes for extractive policy in period t (vit = 1),

his likelihood of re-election is a random variable Pit , which determines his electoral penalty for

supporting extractive policy. The realization pit is drawn from the distribution Fθi , independently

across agents and time. Fθi is continuous and strictly increasing on [0, p̄], so that voting for extrac-

tive policy is almost always penalized (pit < p̄). Naturally, H accountability types expect to pay a

larger electoral penalty than L types when supporting extracting policy. Formally, FL dominates

FH in the sense of first-order stochastic dominance: FH (p) > FL (p) for all p ∈ (0, p̄).

       In summary, a legislator’s likelihood of re-election is


                                          δ [I(vit = 0)p̄ + I(vit = 1)Pit ].


       If a Θ0 type is replaced in period t, his successor is of type Θ with probability qt (Θ|Θ0 ). We

restrict the replacement probabilities below so that when a legislator is unelected his successor is

expected to have a weaker interest in extractive policy. Otherwise, voting out a legislator would

make less sense. In addition, we assume there is no incumbency disadvantage: the likelihood that

each i ∈/ Nt is newly elected to the legislature in t + 1 is no greater than the likelihood that he is
                                                          R
re-elected while in the legislature, denoted by E[Pit ] ≡ pit dFθi .

       Since legislators are selected from the elite Et , changes in Nt are connected to changes in Et .

To guarantee enough examples of each type in Et to fill all eligible legislative roles, we simply

assume nt (Θ) ≥ n for each Θ ∈ T . We need not otherwise restrict the evolution of Et .


3.1.2     Timing

In each period t, voting choices are made after electoral penalties summarized by pt are publicly

observed.

       At t = 0, the initial set of legislators N1 is determined. For all t ≥ 1, the stage game unfolds as
  15
    The importance of retrospective voting in practice has been established since Fiorina (1978). Much of the literature
focuses on the role of monitoring in political accountability (Besley and Burgess, 2002; Ferraz and Finan, 2008; Bobonis,
Fuertes, and Schwabe, 2016). Monitoring in our context is straightforward. An extractive policy can be unambiguously
identified and support for extractive policy is observable from voting records.


                                                           10
follows:

   1. The vector of electoral penalties pt is publicly observed.

   2. Each legislator i ∈ Nt votes for or against an extractive policy, vit ∈ {0, 1}.

   3. The policy xt ∈ {0, 1} is implemented based on majority voting in the legislature.

   4. Economic rents π(xt , ωi ) are received by all elite members i ∈ Et and political rents r are

        received by all legislators i ∈ Nt .

   5. Nt+1 and Et+1 are determined by attrition and election, given voting behaviour vt and elec-

        toral penalties pt .

      There is no discounting other than through attrition, producing a discount factor of δ. The

structure of the game is common knowledge.


3.2     Voting Equilibrium

We seek voting strategies that are robust and simple, yet still immune to one-shot deviations (i.e.

constitute a subgame perfect equilibrium). They should be robust to incomplete information about

the complex strategic environment (itself a simplification of the Caribbean context) and simple

enough to be formulable by plausible human players. A player deciding whether to vote for ex-

tractive policy must compare the current gain in terms of economic rents to the long-term loss in

economic and political rents from reducing his likelihood of re-election. This could require play-

ers to compute (among other things) expectations at each time T over all possible infinite-horizon

trajectories of the distribution of legislator types {zt }∞
                                                          t=T , where the probability distribution over

trajectories is itself endogenously determined by voting choices {vt }∞
                                                                      t=T . We do not expect legis-

lators to make such complex, forward-looking calculations.

      Hence we focus on Markov voting strategies that do not require implausible levels of computa-

tional power, still constitute a subgame perfect equilibrium of the game (i.e. no profitable one-shot

deviation by any player, no matter how sophisticated), and exhibit a useful form of monotonicity

which links voting choices to the composition of the legislature.

      Voting strategies are constructed as follows. Write π(1, ωi ) simply as πi . Define the following

random variable as a function of the re-election probability Pit :

                                                   11
                                              Dit = πi − ai (πi + r),                                   (2)

where
                                                   δ
                                         ai =             (p̄ − Pit ) .                                 (3)
                                                  1−δ     | {z }
                                                        electoral penalty

   We refer to Dit and its realization dit as i’s interest in extractive policy in period t. The first term

is the economic rent to i in period t when extractive policy is passed. The second term is an upper

bound on i’s expected loss of future economic and political rents from voting for extractive policy,

given the electoral penalty p̄ − Pit . Thus, i’s interest in extractive policy is a lower bound on his

current period net benefit from voting for extractive policy. This is useful because it is simple

for players to compute and not very sensitive to details about the environment, especially those

governing the evolution of legislator types over time. Notice that Dit is positive whenever the

electoral penalty is sufficiently small.

   We can now formally state the restriction on replacement probabilities mentioned above:


                                     P
Assumption 1        P(Dit ≥ 0) ≥       Θj ∈T    qt (Θj |Θi )P(Djt ≥ 0).



   That is, when a legislator is unelected his successor has, in expectation, a weakly lower interest

in extractive policy.

    Denote the 12 n th largest values of Dit and dit among i ∈ Nt by Dt∗ and d∗t respectively. Also
                 

                                     P
define the rank of i as R̃t (i) = 1 + j∈Nt −{i} I(dit ≤ djt ). The unique rank denoted by Rt is a

bijective function ranking players as in R̃t except with ties broken at random.



Definition 1 A voting equilibrium is defined as follows. For each i ∈ Nt and t ≥ 1:

  (i) If d∗t ≥ 0, vit
                   ∗ = 1 if only if R (i) ≤
                                              1 
                                     t         2n .


 (ii) If d∗t < 0, vt∗ = 0.




Proposition 1 A voting equilibrium is a subgame perfect equilibrium of the game.


                                                        12
       All proofs are in Appendix A.

       In a voting equilibrium, if at least a weak majority of legislators has a non-negative interest

in extractive policy, x = 1 passes.16 The legislators voting for extractive policy are those with the

largest interest in extractive policy. This is one sense in which voting choices are monotone. Notice

that voting strategies are not conditioned directly on an individual’s type Θi . Rather, a legislator’s

type is probabilistically related to his voting behaviour through his interest in extractive policy.

Thus, a voting equilibrium can be interpreted as a noisy kind of coalition formation through which

different elite types cooperate to pass extractive policy, as we observe in the Caribbean context.17

Still some types are more likely to participate in voting for extractive policy than others, in partic-

ular h types who expect greater economic rents from extractive policy and L types who expect a

smaller electoral penalty.

       It should be clear by now that rent extraction through roll-call voting is akin to provision of

a threshold club good, the club here being the elite Et and the club good being economic rents

from extractive policy. A subset of the elite needs to contribute to the good (i.e., vote for extractive

policy) for it to be provided. Only these contributors bear the cost of provision, in terms of an

electoral penalty. For provision of the club good to be incentive compatible, the benefit must

exceed the cost for the threshold number of club members. This is a simple but powerful insight

which we exploit in the theoretical and empirical analysis.


3.3      Elite Composition and Political Outcomes

Voting choices depend on realized payoffs. The analyst, however, often observes only a noisy

proxy for the precise payoffs, such as a legislator’s identity Θi . In our model, the randomness

in the relationship between an agent’s political type θi and his ‘electoral penalty’ from voting for

extractive policy can come from unobservable idiosyncratic factors and district-level conditions,

such as electoral mobilization, information and discontent. In the Caribbean context, we can ob-

serve a legislator’s race and occupation and want to know how voting for extractive policy varies
  16
      Note x = 1 is passed by a minimum winning coalition. If we allow F to have a mass point at pit = p̄ (i.e. no
electoral penalty), as in a previous version, we get supermajorities voting for extractive policy without changing the
other results.
   17
      As Frey (1994, p. 340) suggests: “The Schumpeter-Downs model of democracy needs to be complemented by
a model in which (between elections) [...] a coalition of all (established) legislators and parties stands against the
voters and taxpayers [...] The members of parliament are a well-defined group jointly reaping rents. They have (with
exceptions) spent their lives together in all kinds of meetings and sessions, committees and commissions.”


                                                         13
with the racial and occupational composition of the legislature. Thus, we compute the expected

likelihood that extractive policy is passed conditioning only on zt , without any knowledge of pt

other than its distribution.
                                                                                                            1 
       Across all elite members i ∈ Nt , we have n random variables (Dit )i∈Nt . Denote the                  2 n th

largest value by the random variable Dt∗ . Under monotone voting, extractive policy is passed

whenever its realization d∗t is nonnegative. The ex ante likelihood that extractive policy is passed

in state zt (prior to the realization of pt ) is


                                        P(xt = 1 | zt ) = P(Dt∗ ≥ 0 | zt ).


       Observe that (2) is negative for some Pit ∈ [0, p̄] if and only if

                                                 πi      δ
                                                      <     p̄ ,                                                 (4)
                                               πi + r   1−δ

that is, if the economic rent from extractive policy πi is sufficiently small relative to political rents

from holding office r. If (4) is violated for all types Θ ∈ T , the likelihood that extractive policy

is passed is invariant to elite composition: P(Dt∗ ≥ 0 | zt ) = 1 for all zt . To focus on the more

interesting case in which political outcomes depend on the distribution of legislator types, we

henceforth impose:

Assumption 2          (4) holds for all types Θ ∈ T .

       In Online Appendix A.2, we formally state and prove that the likelihood extractive policy is

passed is decreasing in the share of legislators with high political accountability (H types) and

low economic rents (` types) (Proposition A1). This relationship between the composition of the

elite and extractive policy is illustrated in Figure 2.18 When we start with a high proportion of

(L, h) types, the likelihood of extractive policy being passed is high. As L accountability types are

replaced by H types and h rent types are replaced by ` types, the likelihood of extractive policy

being passed falls.
  18
     Figure 2 is constructed as follows. Let nh = n(L, h)+n(H, h) be the number of h types and nH = n(H, h)+n(H, `)
be the number of H types. Each point (nh , nH ) can potentially be generated by a number of distributions z =
(n(Θ))Θ∈T . Let S(nh , nH ) = {z | n(L, h) + n(H, h) = nh and n(H, h) + n(H, `) = nH }. For each s ∈ S(nh , nH ),
we computed the probability that extractive policy is passed P(D∗ ≥ 0|s). The functions depicted in the sub-
figures areP unweighted averages over all relevant combinations. That is, the function evaluated at (nh , nH ) equals
     1                        ∗
|S(nh ,nH )|  s∈S(nh ,nH ) P(D ≥ 0|s).

        Beta(3, 1), fH (Pi ) ∼ Beta(1, 3), where Beta(α, β) is the pdf of the Beta distribution
        with parameters α and β.



      If we interpret (L, h) types as white planters in the Caribbean context, then political outcomes

are improved by changes which make the political elite more representative of the citizenry. How-

ever, as we shall now show, this identity effect is muted (and possibly flipped) by two factors, one

strategic and the other institutional.


3.4     Elite Composition and Voting Interactions: ‘Stepping Up’

How a legislator votes depends not only on his own type, but also on the distribution of types in

the legislature zt . We uncover a strategic effect that partially offsets the direct effect of changes to

legislator identity described above. Passing extractive policy, as we have noted, is akin to provi-

sion of an elite club good. When types that provide the good at low cost exit, high cost types ‘step

up’ and begin contributing to it. Here, a representative change in the composition of the legisla-

ture induces legislators with high political accountability and low economic rents to step up and

vote more frequently for extractive policy.



Proposition 2 From state z, produce state z 0 by switching the type of one player j, such that n0 (H, ω) ≥




                                                   15
n(H, ω) for ω = `, h and n0 (θ, `) ≥ n(θ, `) for θ = L, H, with at least one inequality strict. For all i 6= j:


                     P(xt = 1 | z) − P(xt = 1 | z 0 ) < P(vjt = 1 | z) − P(vjt = 1 | z 0 ).



      Raising j’s accountability or lowering his economic interest in extractive policy reduces the

likelihood that j votes for extractive policy more than it reduces the likelihood that extractive

policy is passed. The difference is made up by an increase in the frequency with which other

members of the legislature i 6= j vote for extractive policy. We call this behaviour ‘stepping up’.

When H accountability types are rare, they tend to vote against extractive policy, free riding on

the large number of L types who are likely to vote for it. An increase in the share of H types

induces legislators who did not previously support the extractive policy to step up and vote for

the policy in order to get it passed. The same applies to the economic dimension, given an increase

in the share of ` types. Thus one can underestimate the support for extractive policy by high

accountability and low economic rent types when extrapolating from their voting behaviour when

they are rare.

      With this in hand, let us return to Figure 2. The graph can be understood as follows. Replace

one L type with an H type. The direct effect is that the new member of the legislature votes

for extractive policy at a lower rate. This is partially offset by stepping up by other legislators

(Proposition 2)—the strategic effect. The two effects combine to produce the curvature of the

graph, with the relative magnitude of the effects depending on the existing composition of the

legislature.


3.5     Elite Composition and Institutions

At some stage, stepping up may not be enough to support extractive policy. Instead, legislators

may pursue a more drastic and damaging option: weakening institutions to shield themselves

from greater electoral accountability.

      We focus on a particular kind of institutional change, namely the dissolution of the legisla-

ture. (Other institutional responses could be analysed in a similar manner.) We are particularly

interested in how the composition of the legislature affects this choice.

      Our motivation is evident in Figure 1 which depicts a rising share of legislators from the new

                                                      16
elite in nine out of ten British Caribbean plantation islands, culminating in the dissolution of the

legislative assemblies of each of these islands. The tenth island, Barbados, experienced neither

a significant rise in the share of new elite legislators nor the dissolution of its assembly. In the

Caribbean, race maps to political accountability. To focus on this dimension, we simply assume

equal economic rents π(1, h) = π(1, `), so all that matters is a legislator’s political accountability.

That is, the number of H accountability types, denoted by nt (H), is sufficient to describe the

distribution of types in the legislature.

   Institutional change is incorporated as follows. For each period t ≥ 1 , introduce a date 0 at

which legislators i ∈ Nt can vote to permanently dissolve the legislature and end elections at cost

c to each legislator. Whether the legislature is dissolved is decided by majority rule. If dissolution

occurs, extractive policy is permanently imposed and each i ∈ Nt receives political rents of r in

all future periods in which he is not exogenously replaced. (Attrition still occurs with probability

1 − δ.) If not, the game proceeds as usual.

   The cost c per legislator of dissolving the legislature can be (1) a reputational cost, (2) a direct

payment to some outside entity (e.g. the payment required by the British crown to assume con-

trol), and/or (3) the cost of losing control over the island’s politics. As we shall see in Section 4.5,

Caribbean elites did not want to cede control over legislative institutions, and had historically

resisted doing so.



Proposition 3 Let the initial state be n1 (H) = 0. The following constitutes a subgame perfect equilibrium

of the game with institutional change.

   There exist thresholds c and c, c < c, such that:


  (i) If c ≤ c, the legislature is dissolved immediately at t = 1.


 (ii) If c > c, the legislature is never dissolved.


 (iii) If c ∈ (c, c], there exists a value n ∈ (0, n], such that the legislature is dissolved as soon as the number

      of H accountability legislators n(H) reaches n, which occurs in finite time t > 1.




                                                       17
Whenever the legislature is not dissolved, voting choices are given by the voting equilibrium in Proposi-

tion 1.



    The proposition has the game begin with all L accountability legislators (e.g. white planters).

When institutions can be altered at low cost c ≤ c, the legislature is dissolved immediately. When

institutions can only be altered at high cost c ≥ c, the legislature is never voluntarily dissolved by

legislators. In this case, play proceeds according to the voting equilibrium in Proposition 1. In the

intermediate range, c ∈ (c, c], the decision to dissolve the legislature depends on the composition

of the legislature. Not immediately, but eventually as the share of H accountable types grows,

legislators vote to dissolve the legislature. Hence rising accountability of individual legislators

increases the likelihood of extractive policy in ‘weakly institutionalized’ environments.

    Caribbean historiography suggests that the cost to the political elites of giving up local control

in the Caribbean islands fell in this intermediate range. We see in Figure 1 that electoral insti-

tutions were stable enough to deter white planters from immediately dissolving legislatures and

forestalling change in the political elite after emancipation. But they were not stable enough to

avoid dissolution once the share of new elite legislators became large.

    The insight that elites may weaken institutions to preserve their rents is of course not new (see,

for example, the many references in Acemoglu and Robinson 2012 or the case study of Medieval

Venice discussed earlier (Trefler and Puga, 2014)). What is new is that this need not be driven

by an old elite forestalling the rise of a new elite, but rather an old and new elite cooperating to

preserve rents to both groups. Our theory explicates why the dissolution of legislatures in the

Caribbean might have been supported by new elite legislators. The reason is that, as the share of

(more accountable) new elite legislators rises, they have to step up to get extractive policy passed.

They also face a larger electoral penalty when doing so. Hence new elite legislators may support

dissolution as a less costly way of implementing extractive policy. We explore this prediction in

Section 4.5.

4        The British Caribbean Sugar Islands After Emancipation

4.1        Historical Backdrop

We apply our theory of elite identity and politics to an historical analysis of ten British Caribbean

sugar colonies, i.e. Antigua, Barbados, Jamaica, Montserrat, Nevis, St. Kitts, Dominica, Tobago,

St. Vincent, and Grenada, where we can get an unusually complete picture of the identities of the

local elites, and where the economic and social identities of each elite group are clearly identified

by the islands’ histories. Sugar was introduced into these islands around 1700, and with this

emerged an elite that was dominated by a small white planter elite; white commoners left the

islands for the American colonies, their place taken by an ever-expanding population of imported

slaves (Taylor, 2002, ch. 11).19 From around 1800 the tide turned against the Caribbean planters.

Slavery, which was critical to Caribbean wealth, came under increasing attack from the rising

Abolitionist movement in London (Ragatz, 1928, ch.10). In 1807, British parliament abolished the

slave trade. Finally, in 1833, British parliament passed An Act for the Abolition of Slavery which

ended slavery throughout the Empire in 1836. We study the islands in the decades that followed.

         Next, we describe how the basic setup of the model in Section 3.1 maps into our data.


4.1.1       Basic Features

Legislators and the ‘Assemblies’:          One critical part of the model is that extractive policy is cho-

sen through legislative voting. In the Caribbean, this occurred in the legislative assemblies, which

had extensive legislative powers, including the power to set extractive policies. At the end of the

19th century, the assemblies had greater power vis-à-vis the colonial governor than the average

British colony (Xu, 2018). The main reason for this was that the Caribbean colonies were con-

siderably older than the average British colony, and had been formed with more decentralized

institutions than later colonies. Green (1991, p. 68) writes that “in addition to their legislative

functions, [the assemblies] had extensive executive powers. Colonial Acts assigned all important

administrative tasks to special boards, or commissions, upon which members of the assembly
    19
     The first six (plus the Virgin Islands for which we have no data) were founded in the 1600s by British settler-
farmers. The other four were annexed from France at the end of the Seven Years War in 1765, and were then resettled
by sugar planters from the existing British Caribbean islands. The British annexed three more Caribbean colonies —
Trinidad, St. Lucia, and Guyana — from Napoleon between 1797 and 1803, but these never had comparable legislatures.




                                                        19
enjoyed either exclusive or majority control”. Similarly, Rogers writes that “in the West Indies,

the executive was almost completely isolated from public finances, over which the assemblies ex-

erted an extraordinary influence. Indeed, all representative bodies exercised the functions of three

separate [British] agencies. As a lawmaking chamber, it imposed truces. In an executive role, it

collected revenue, voted appropriations, expended monies, and, along with the upper house, ad-

ministered public services. Lastly, acting as an audit board, the island assemblies checked their

own expenditures” (1970, p. 77–79).

       As in the model, the assemblymen were a subset of the broader elite whose changing composi-

tion we have just described. The assemblymen were drawn from the islands’ elite through regular

parish-level elections. The franchise itself was not very restrictive, requiring only 10 acres of land

ownership in all the islands. It had traditionally been small, not because of tight restrictions such

as property requirements, but simply because of the small number of free people.20 The property

(or income) requirements for holding office were very restrictive however. In this respect, the re-

lationship between electorate and political class in the ten islands was thus very similar to that in

the original 13 colonies and states of the United States in the 18th and early 19th century (Corvalan

et al., 2016).

       Data on Legislators and Assemblies:          The Records of the Colonial Office, housed at The National

Archives in London, maintain 6 data-series for each former colony: (i) Original correspondence, (ii)

Entry Books, (iii) Acts, (iv) Sessional Papers, (v) Gazettes, and (vi) Miscellenea. The bulk of the Mis-

cellenea series is made up of the Colonial Blue Books, annual statistical accounts that were sent to

London from each individual colony to report on local conditions. For years before the 1890s, only

(at most) two copies exist of each Blue Book, one in the issuing colony’s archives and one in the

British National Archives, in London, where this data was hand-collected. Starting from around

1836, sometimes earlier, sometimes later, the Blue Books’ Councils and Assemblies section reported

the names of all elected assemblymen, related election dates and the parishes they represented.

       The Social (Racial) Composition of the Islands’ Elites:                Shortly after Emancipation, the

Colonial Office drew a distinction between ‘whites, mostly landed”, people of mixed race “who

had been freed earlier and possessed, in many cases, substantial property”, and “blacks, recently
  20
     Before Emancipation it had been, throughout the Caribbean, “distinctly the exception for a member of the legisla-
ture to be returned by more than 10 votes” (Wrong, 1923, p. 69).



                                                         20
emancipated” (Taylor, 1885, p. 207). The reader may refer back to footnote 1 for the distinction

between the new (mixed-race) elite and the black citizenry in Caribbean historiography.21 Eman-

cipation was followed by steady exodus of whites returning to England. As new elite members

filled the void left by the old white elites, the social composition of the Caribbean elite became far

more mixed.22

       The Economic Composition of the Islands’ Elites:                While planters were still predominantly

British in the early years after Emancipation, this too changed. Green (1991, p. 199) writes that

“the planter oligarchy was, over time, no longer almost exclusively white;” Brizan (1984, p.201–

202) writes that “the vacuum created by the exodus of white planters was now being filled by the

rich [men of color];” and Craig-James (2000, p.200, 296) writes that “men of color [...] acquired the

plantation property,” and by the 1870s in Tobago they “owned or operated 32 of the 73 estates [in

Tobago]”. Craig-James recounts the story of Brutus Murray, a man of colour who was born a slave

in Tobago in 1797, appeared in the public records in 1842 as a sharecropper at Orange Valley Estate,

then in 1852 as a manager of Belle Garden Estate, in 1862 as a part-owner of Pembroke Estate,

and finally in 1870 as the exclusive owner of Pembroke and Cardiff Estates (Craig-James, 2000,

p.165). Stories like Murray’s abound in the detailed island histories of Craig-James (2000), Lowes

(1994), Holt (1991) and others. Nonetheless, the new elite segment was economically “far more

heterogeneous than the class it was gradually displacing [...] consisting of merchants, successful

estate owners, members of the professions, and an expanding managerial sector” (Meditz and

Hanratty, 1987, p.31).

       Measuring Elite Types:        As in our model, we assign each elite member i in our data a two-

dimensional type denoted by Θi = (θi , ωi ), consisting of a political accountability type θi ∈ {L, H},

where L (H) denotes low (high), and an economic interest type ωi ∈ {h, `}, where h (`) indicates

a higher (lower) direct benefit from extractive policy. In the post-Emancipation British Caribbean

context, these labels had very specific meanings that we can observe in the data. Political ac-

countability to the citizenry was determined by the most salient dimension of elite social identity,
  21
      The non-White non-British elites were by and large mixed-race, but beyond this fact, the distinction between the
new elite and black citizenry plays no special role in either the theory or our historical case study. We refer the reader
to the excellent social histories on this topic in Carmichael (1833), Smith (1953) and Cox (1984).
   22
      Craig-James (2000, p. 201) emphasizes that there “was little intermarriage” between whites and cthe new elite, so
that the latter “must be seen as a distinct segment of the dominant class.”




                                                           21
namely their race. An extensive collection of individual islands’ social histories helped us establish

each legislator’s race, our measure of θi ∈ {L, H}. To avoid clogging the paper’s references with

citations of island-specific source materials, the sources are listed in Online Appendix B. These

historical accounts are often focused on the issue of race to an extent that would seem strange in

other socio-historical contexts. For example, Heuman (1981) and Holt (1991) make explicit men-

tion of every single non-white legislator who ever sat in Jamaica’s Assembly, and contrast the

new elite’s incentives very explicitly with those of the old white elite. The Caribbean’s mono-crop

plantation agriculture also meant economic interest ωi ∈ {h, `} can be meaningfully captured by

a simple binary classification of elites into planters and non-planters (‘merchants’). For the tradi-

tional British planter elites, Slave Ownership Registries from the pre-Emancipation period and the

Emancipation Compensation Tables issued in 1835 listed all families who had owned plantations. For

the planters emerging form the new elite in the post-Emancipation period, we found 61 distinct

island-specific plantation surveys that help us further validate the economic identity of legislators

after Emancipation, which was especially useful to establish whether a new elite member was a

plantation owner. We coded all elites who were not planters as ‘merchant’, a group that de facto

included also lawyers and professionals. The key point to us is that plantation owners had a more

pronounced interest in a wage-reducing policy than any other elite group.23 British planters were

(L, h) types, new elite non-planters (merchants) were (H, `) types, and new elite planters (H, h)

types. Online Appendix B describes all data sources and the details of the coding.

       Drawing Legislators from the Elite:             Before Emancipation, legislators were drawn from an

elite that was entirely British, and whose economic interest was entirely in the plantation econ-

omy. According to Green (1991, pp.73), only “a few merchants, lawyers, and medical practitioners

secured seats in the Jamaica Assembly before 1840. In 1837, twenty-two of twenty-five Antigua

assemblymen were planters.” As the broader elite became more economically and socially mixed

after emancipation, as described above, so did the islands’ assemblies. The main reason for this

was that a substantial number of freed slaves obtained the franchise. Franchise requirements re-

mained at ten acres after Emancipation, in large part “because of pressures from the Colonial

Office, [which meant that] a comfortable translation of pre-emancipation legal distinctions into
  23
    There were also some (L, `) types in the assemblies, i.e. British but not planters. They were few and often British
colonial administrators, meaning their incentives were likely different to the payoffs in our model. To maintain our
focus on political accountability, we group these with the British planters, which does not affect any of empirical results.


                                                            22
distinctions of skin color was not possible” (Lowes, 1994, ch. 5).24 The “growth in the extent of

smallholding after 1838” thus led to a significant expansion of the franchise to the black citizenry

(Higman, 2001), although we unfortunately do not have good data on the franchise. The vote of

the black citizenry went largely to the new elite (Rogers, 1970, p. 187).25 As the assemblies be-

came racially more mixed, they also became more mixed in economic interests: Holt (1991, p. 221)

writes that between Emancipation and its self-dissolution “more than a third of the brown repre-

sentatives [in Jamaica’s assembly] were lawyers. Several others were merchants, editors, or public

employees, not dependent on agriculture. Unlike the planters, they did not identify the interests

of the island exclusively with the success of its plantations.”

       Measuring Voting Behavior:          Colonies recorded the proceedings of their legislative and ex-

ecutive councils in the Blue Books’ Sessional Papers. If the legislative body was locally elected, as in

the case of our ten islands, these proceedings were titled the Assembly Minutes. We photographed

the Assembly Minutes of each of the ten islands. Votes were unfortunately often not recorded in

practice. Only Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Jamaica, Montserrat and Tobago ever reported any

roll-call data in the Minutes. In Dominica, Montserrat and Tobago this data was exceedingly scat-

tered, and very few bills had any roll-call information attached to them at all. In Barbados and

Grenada, roll-call information was more regularly attached to the bills, but these revealed very

little information on the content of each proposal. The final conclusion was that we had enough

roll-call information in Barbados and Grenada to study the network of voting blocs in these is-

lands (depicted, e.g. in Figure 3), but that we could not know whether individuals’ supported

extractive bills specifically. This we could only do in Jamaica, because Jamaica kept a separate and

proper Hansard, the so-called Jamaica Vote Book which was unrelated to the Assembly Minutes.26

Jamaica also had the longest historical records of its assemblymen, going back to its assembly’s

founding in 1664 (Roby, 1831).

      The threat of brute force was not viable for whites in the Caribbean, given their tiny numbers.
  25
      Black (as opposed to mixed-race) legislators were exceedingly rare. In his investigation of Jamaican post-
Emancipation politics, Holt (1991) finds that there were a total of two black assemblymen between 1836–1865, compared
to over 30 mixed-race ones.
   26
      The Jamaica Vote Book had before us already been used in parts by Holt (1991). We owe a debt to Tom Holt who
had saved the Jamaica Vote Book on a magnetic tape recording when he was working on his 1992 book, and generously
sent this tape recording to us. Unfortunately, it had not withstood the test of time so that we had to scan and digitize
the hardcopies of the books anew.

                  Figure 3: Voting Network in Jamaica’s Assembly, 1844–1848 Session




Notes: White nodes are ‘old elite planters’, the dark-grey nodes are the ‘new elite planters’, black nodes are ‘new elite
merchants’. The two light-grey nodes on the far-left and far-right are ‘old elite merchants’ (Θi = (L, `)). The old elite
planters and the new elite merchants appear to be separate blocs because they tended to agree among themselves and
disagree with each other.




equation (7), Figure 3 displays the extent to which the assemblies after Emancipation were made

up of a racially and economically mixed elite. The figure depicts the voting network (over all

proposals) for the assemblymen in Jamaica’s 1844–1848 legislative session. White nodes are white

planters (Θi = (L, h)), the dark-grey nodes are new elite planters (Θi = (H, h)), and black nodes

are new elite merchants (Θi = (H, `)). In this visualization, two nodes are connected by an edge

if they agreed on more than two-thirds of the bills on which both voted, or not connected if they

agreed on less.27

       There are clearly discernible blocs for white planters and for new elite merchants, while new

elite planters’ voting connections were more spread between the two blocs. In our theory, voting

blocs result from shared accountability or shared economic interests, since an elite member de-

cides whether to support extractive policies solely based on their individual payoffs. All accounts

of politics in the Caribbean assemblies are consistent with this view in that they emphasize the ab-

    This network visualization has no scale and no axis. Two nodes are connected by an ‘edge’ if they agreed on more
than two-thirds of the bills on which both voted, or not connected if they agreed on less. The placement of nodes in the
graph is determined by these edges. Figure 3 was built in Gephi, using the Yifan Hu visualization algorithm.

sence of stable coalitions or any form of party discipline (Heuman, 1981; Holt, 1991; Honychurch,

1984). Figure 3 depicts a period in Jamaican politics when white planters still had a firm grip

on the assembly. Our theory suggests assemblymen from the new elite had no need to support

extraction in this period. The visual blocs in Figure 3 are consistent with our theory, but on their

own they are not enough to support it as a plausible alternative to potential competing theories.

In the following, we will present more rigorous evidence for our theory.


4.1.2   Political Accountability

A premise of our theory is that elites varied in their ‘social proximity’ to the citizenry, and that

closer proximity meant greater political accountability. On the ten islands, new elites are of the

θi = H type, while old elites are of the θi = L type.

    Electoral Accountability as Political Accountability:             In the model as well as the data, we fo-

cus on differences in electoral accountability. Voting in the Caribbean assemblies was by voice vote,

and thus publicly observable. Assemblymen were therefore politically accountable for their vot-

ing record. However, British white assemblymen were less accountable to the black citizenry than

their counterparts from the new elite. A major reason for this difference was that almost all white

elites were planters, and these white planters were returned to the assemblies via long-standing

landlord-tenant patronage relations. For the traditional Caribbean British planter-legislator, his

“relationship to his constituents had a similarity to the relationship of the classic English patron

and his retainers; the core of his political support appeared to come from tenants on his own

estates, whose taxes and voter registration fees he paid” (Holt, 1991, p. 293).28 New plantation

owners did not have the same patronage networks, particularly when compared to the ‘great at-

torneys’ who were often in charge of twenty or more estates at the same time and who constituted

a majority of the white planters in many of the islands (Smith, 1953, p.56).

    Other Forms of Accountability:            While electoral accountability is the focus of our analysis,

there were other dimensions along which new elites were more accountable to the citizenry. One

dimension that may have mattered to an extent was that new elites were “accountable to them-

selves” in the sense that a behavioural force of in-group altruism could have played some role
  28
     Baland and Robinson (2008) describe such relational voting and its pernicious effect on political development in
Chile.


                                                         25
in shaping new elites’ empathy towards the citizenry, as in Akerlof and Kranton (2000), Shayo

(2009) and Bramoullé and Goyal (2016). Another dimension may have been social stigma or so-

cial sanctions for supporting extractive policies. Such forces should be more effective when social

distance to the citizenry is low, as in Miguel and Gugerty (2005). Also, citizens may feel greater

betrayal by leaders from their own group, as in Di Tella and Rotemberg (2016). Lastly, political

accountability may have gone beyond electoral accountability in the case of violent uprisings. The

threat of violent uprisings loomed ever-large over Caribbean elites and it was the new elite who

was most exposed to it, as it could not count on the protection of the British Naval garrison and

the colonial judicial apparatus to the same degree as British citizens (Trouillot, 1988, p. 101).29 An

earlier version of this paper studied these non-electoral sources of political accountability, and

found similar results to the ones presented here (Carvalho and Dippel, 2016), but had to rely on

scarce and potentially inconsistently reported episodes of local riots. We therefore re-focused the

analysis on electoral accountability.

       Measuring Electoral Accountability using the number of districts assemblymen ever repre-

sented:      The historical narrative above suggests that lower political accountability came about

in part from local patronage networks. Since patronage networks are immobile, one way to em-

pirically test for differences in electoral accountability is to check whether unaccountable assem-

blymen were less likely than their new elite counterparts to represent several different electoral

district over the course of their tenure. The assemblymen’s electoral districts were reported in

the Colonial Blue Books discussed earlier.30 In Table 1, we relate each assemblyman’s type to the

number of parishes that represented during their tenure. Columns 1–2 focus on assemblymen in

all 10 islands for the roughly 30 years from Emancipation to the island-specific year an assembly

was dissolved. Instead of comparing assemblymen only within the post-Emancipation period, in

Jamaica we can also compare them prior to Emancipation because we have Jamaica’s full history

of assemblymen going back to 1664 from Roby (1831). This is done in columns 3–4. We find in

column 3 that new elite assemblymen on average represented more parishes during their tenure
  29
      Selective protection by British troops in the middle of an uprising was probably not the important point of dis-
tinction between old and new elites. Rather, it was clear that the colonial judicial administration would go hard after
anyone who injured or killed a British citizen, while the same could not be said for injuring a local elite member. Rein-
forcing this was the fact that white elites were often more physically removed from the consequences of policies on the
ground. As British citizens, they were in fact frequently absent from the islands.
   30
      Online Appendix Table 2 lists these electoral districts (islands’ parishes) from which assemblymen were returned.

Notes: In columns 1–4, the outcome is the number of different electoral districts an assemblyman represented over
their tenure. Columns 1–2 report on all assemblymen we observe across the 10 islands and who first appeared in the
assemblies after 1838. Columns 3–4 report on Jamaica only, where we observe all assemblymen from the assembly’s
inception in 1664. The two data-sets partially overlap for Jamaican legislators from 1838 onwards. The number of ob-
servations equals the number of individual legislators in columns 1–4. (b) In columns 5–6 we investigate (in Jamaican
voting data) whether an individual’s re-election penalty for supporting extractive policy depended on his social iden-
tity, as assumed in the model. The number of observations equals the number of legislator-elections. (c) p-values for are
reported in square brackets, standard errors are robust in columns 1–4, and clustered at the individual level in columns

than white assemblymen, both in the post-Emancipation period, and in a long-run comparison

going back to the 17th century.31 Column 4 shows that this is not due solely to new elites being

more likely to be merchants, and thus more mobile. Indeed new elite planters appear to be just as

likely to represent several parishes as new elite merchants.

    Measuring Electoral Accountability in the Voting Data:                                      We interpret Table 1 as prima facie

evidence that assemblymen from the new elite were more electorally accountable because they

could not rely on established patronage networks.32 When we restrict ourselves to only Jamaica,

we can confidently assign roughly one quarter of bills to one or more of the three types of ex-
  31
     To address truncation at the end of the data, when an assembly was dissolved, we control for the first year an
assemblyman entered, a variable that should shorten political careers, and thereby also reduce the number of parishes
represented. To address truncation at the beginning of the data in columns 1–2, we include only assemblymen who
appeared in the first election we observe, which was typically one or two years after Emancipation.
  32
     We would have also liked to verify that expansions in the franchise were associated with the rise of new elite
assemblymen, something which is strongly suggested by historical accounts. Unfortunately, the Blue Books do not
report data on the franchise until the late 1850s and in some colonies the early 1860s.



                                                                          27
tractive policies described.33 This allows us to more directly test the premise that new elites were

more politically accountable than white elites. Specifically, we can ask if a legislator’s re-election

probability was more negatively affected by having supported extractive bills if he was an H type:

                                                     X
                       P(reelectit = 1) = αt +             γΘ × I(Θi = Θ) × I(vit = 1) + t .                           (5)
                                                     Θ∈T


If our basic premise is true we should see a differential effect for (H, h) types (new elite planters)

and (H, `) types (new elite merchants) relative to the omitted category of (L, h) types (white

planters) in our data. Since the question is defined on electoral cycles, we can include electoral

cycle fixed effects αt to control for any time-variation in re-election probabilities.

       This is done in columns 5–6 of Table 1. We recognize that individual elite member i’s voting

decisions I(vit = 1) are endogenous to his electoral accountability, in accordance with our theory.

As such, the coefficients in columns 5–6 should therefore not be interpreted as the causal effect of a

new elite member’s support of extraction on their re-election probabilities. Instead, the key point

is that our theory assumes that the average white elite member who supports the extractive policy

is less accountable for doing so than the average new elite member who supports the extractive

policy. The data support this assumption. We find no electoral penalty for supporting extraction

among traditional British elites (γL > 0 with a p-value of at least 0.215), whereas new elites appear

to incur a pronounced re-election penalty for supporting extraction, with a highly significant coef-

ficient of −0.879. We recognize that we are slightly abusing notation here since the reported effect

of supporting extraction on re-elections γL = 0.196 in column 3 is common to both elite groups, so

that the new elites’ re-election penalty for supporting extraction is γH = 0.196 − 0.879 = −0.683.


4.2      Equilibrium

In Section 3.2 we describe a voting equilibrium in which rent extraction through voting is akin

to the provision of a threshold club good, the club here being the elite and the club good being

economic rents from extractive policy. Here, we describe this club and the club good in their

practical incarnations on the ten islands.
  33
     To validate our coding of extractive bills we verified that they were more contentious, i.e. were passed (or defeated)
with narrower margins. Using the totality of bills, we regressed the vote-margin on an indicator for a bill being classified
as extractive and indeed found that such bills had a 6% smaller vote margin, an effect that was highly significant.



                                                            28
       The Club:    In our model—conditional on ωi ∈ {h, `}—new elite members are less likely to

support extraction because of their higher political accountability θi ∈ {L, H}. While we do not

discount the possibility that new elites felt more altruism towards the black citizenry (see foot-

note 8), the historiography of the ten islands suggests that any such ingroup bias was dominated

by factors that connected the old British and new elites.34 Not only were the new elite and the

black citizenry “two entirely separated classes of people” at the time of Emancipation (Baker,

1994, p129), it is clear the new elite was if anything growing closer to the old British elite over

time: Henry Taylor, a high-ranking official in the Colonial Office at the time, stated that “it was

common knowledge that [the new elite] tended to amalgamate with the whites in their unchari-

table disposition toward the [black] peasantry” (Taylor, 1885, p. 216); Craig-James (2000, p. 201)

writes that “the rigid barriers” that had divided whites from the new elite “were eroded in the

free period” and “the most established [new elites] attended the governor’s balls, their wives and

daughters were pillars of the Church of England”; and Green (1991, p.296) writes that “although

whites continued to dominate society in most colonies [...] in numbers [the new elite] constituted

the largest segment of the European culture group at the end of the period.”

       The Club Good:       In the model, the elite votes on a binary extractive policy proposal xt ∈

{0, 1}. In practice, extractive policies in the post-Emancipation Caribbean could be grouped into

three categories: (i) policies were passed to depress wages and ensure a steady supply of plan-

tation labour. These included anti-squatting and anti-vagrancy laws.35 (ii) There was political

conflict over revenue raising, especially land taxes and customs duties. Plantations favoured

land-taxes that taxed any land-holdings but had declining marginal tax rates for larger holdings.

Black small-scale farmers protested that “parochial land taxes pressed hard on small proprietors”

(McLewin, 1987, p. 184). Political conflict also centred on customs duties. Perhaps surprisingly,

import tariffs on foodstuffs were one of the most progressive forms of taxation because food was

imported almost exclusively to feed plantation workers, with the plantations otherwise buying

provisions from peasants. Food tariffs not only raised the plantations’ cost of feeding workers

but also “tended to deplete labor reserves by driving workers from plantations to the hinterland,

where they grew ground provisions” (Rogers, 1970, p.96). Policies in categories (i) and (ii) had
  34
     Moreover, ingroup altruism generates nether stepping up nor institutional change.
  35
     According to McLewin (1987, p. 189), “assemblies brought into law an umbrella of coercive acts with the purpose
of creating a landless peasantry.”


                                                        29
closely related aims: high taxes on small-holds were not only regressive, but also contributed to

sustaining a labour pool because failure to pay them led to loss of title (Satchell, 1990, ch. 4). (iii) A

third contentious issue was policies about public good provision. The emancipated former slaves’

primary concerns were land redistribution and public good provision. Elites were disinterested in

the expansion of education and health services because they provided these to themselves as club

goods rather than as public goods (Sewell 1861, p. 39, Dookhan 1977, Brizan 1984, p. 163).36

       In our theory, all elite members derive an economic benefit from extractive policies, and are

only kept from supporting them by re-election concerns. While it is plausible in the Caribbean

that new elite merchants ((H, `) types) would have favoured some of the extractive policies dis-

cussed above, it is also possible that they would not have favoured others. Revenue raising and

public good provision were the areas of policy where the incentives of all elite members were

closely aligned, hence π(1, `) − π(0, `) > 0. Policies aimed at securing a steady labour supply and

undermining small-scale farming were more critical to the landed gentry. Therefore, in the overall

policy bundle π(1, h) − π(0, h) > π(1, `) − π(0, `) > 0, as in our model. These inequalities highlight

the importance of being able to identify a legislator’s economic as well as social type, which we

can do in our data.


4.3      Elite Composition and Political Outcomes

In Section 3.3 we describe how support for the extractive policy varies with elite type. The theory

suggests that new elite planters should be less likely than white elites to vote for extractive policies,

and new elite merchants should be least likely to do so. We can test this hypothesis by estimating

equation
                                                       X
                                 P(vit = 1) = αt +           κΘ × I(Θi = Θ) + it ,                                 (6)
                                                       Θ∈T

which expresses assemblyman i’s support for extractive policies as a function of his identity Θi

(as well as capturing broad changes in voting behaviour with year fixed effects αt ).

       We pursue two alternative approaches in dealing with the voting data. In a first approach, we

use assemblyman i’s overall voting agreement with the white planters to proxy for P(vit = 1).
  36
    Holt (1991, p.196) argues that “Planters generally opposed all measures to expand education. Very likely the idea of
spending money primarily for the benefit of the black majority did not appeal to most planters. The wealthier resident
planters sent their children to a few select private academies on the island and to England.” The same was arguably
true for the islands’ non-planter elites.


                                                          30
Only in Barbados, Grenada and Jamaica did the Assembly Minutes report roll-call voting informa-

tion regularly enough to allow us to construct voting networks.37 We measure voting agreement

as follows: We collapse the entire network of pairwise voting relations from the Assembly Minutes

measured over all bills for Barbados, Grenada and Jamaica. This approach is visually represented

in Figure 3. We aggregate voting relations for a full year to compensate for the fact that we include

procedural and ambiguous votes. In this approach we take as given that the white planter bloc is

the most supportive of extractive policies, and calculate each assemblyman i’s voting agreement

with this bloc. We interpret an individual who displays higher average agreement with all white

planters in a given year as being more supportive of extractive policies. To be precise, let Iijk = 1

if assemblymen i and j agree on bill k, and let Kijt be the set of bills that both i and j voted on in

year t. We define their voting overlap as voijt ≡ |K1ijt | Kijt Iijk ∈ [0, 1]. With nΘi denoting the
                                                          P

number of type Θi elites, P(vit = 1) is measured as assemblyman i’s voting agreement with the

white planters,38 defined as
                                                   1        X
                                                                      voijt .                                         (7)
                                                 n(L,h)
                                                          Θj =(L,h)

       While illustrative, results based on measuring P(vit = 1) by equation (7) need to be taken

with a grain of salt because measured in this way, the outcome is averaged over many bills that

are not necessarily coercive, i.e. procedural bills and bills where it is very difficult to say exactly

what they were about.39 In a second approach, we therefore restrict ourselves to records from the

Jamaica Vote Books where we can isolate extractive bills, and measure P(vit = 1) directly. (We refer

the reader back to Section 4.1.2, “Measuring Electoral Accountability in the Voting Data”.)

       Table 2 reports on the results of estimating equation (6). In Panels A and B, the outcome is

as defined in (7). Panel A, for Jamaica, presents results for eight specifications. Across columns

1–4, the data suggest new elites were on average about ten percentage points less likely to vote

with white planters over all bills. Column 1 reports results of a univariate regression on only an

indicator that i is a new elite member (in the model, a high-accountability social type θi = H).
  37
     The colonial records contain some rudimentary voting records of the assemblies, but as we discussed, the records
were sparse. We refer the reader back to the paragraph titled “Measuring Voting Behaviour” in Section 4.1.1.
  38
     If i is himself a white planter, he is naturally excluded from this summation.
  39
     A typical record for a purely procedural bill is an October 22nd 1839 bill that read “A bill to prepare an address to
the governor for the opening of the legislative session.” A typical record where it was impossible to determine a bill’s
meaning even though the bill may well be important was a June 17th 1864 bill that read “a motion that the house do
disagree to the third amendment proposed by the legislative council in their said message to the bill mentioned,” with
no further explanation on the bill in question.

999, 1064, and 733 are the number of assemblyman-year observations in each island. Data in panels A and C are

assemblyman supported a bill, separately considering extractive and non-extractive bills. We can only reliably glean
the bills’ content in Jamaica, where the data comes from a Hansard. The number of observations is thus the product of
bills and legislators voting on them. (b) The omitted category in all regressions is white planter, i.e. the Θi = (L, h)

The omitted category is white planters. New elite legislators agreed eight percentage points less

with white planters than white planters agreed among themselves.40 Column 2 includes year fixed

effects to allow for broad trends in the composition of bills (extractive vs non-extractive) tabled for

vote. Columns 3–4 weight the regressions by the number of bills over which each observation was

averaged, since legislative sessions with more voting should arguably receive higher weight. This

sharpens the results. Columns 5–8 repeat 1–4 but further partition new elites by their economic

identity, i.e. being a planter or a merchant (or, in the model, a ωi = h or a ωi = ` type). Columns 5–

8 show that new elite planters indeed display much closer voting overlap with white planters than

new elite merchants. Panel B shows only the un-weighted specifications for the two other islands

for which we have a sufficient number of bills, namely Barbados and Grenada. The results are very

similar to those for Jamaica in Panel A, although the distinction between new elite planters and

merchants is less sharp in Grenada than in Jamaica and Barbados. In summary, across the three

islands, new elite planters are less likely than white elites to vote for extractive policies, and new

elite merchants are least likely to do so, as hypothesized. Online Appendix Table 3 re-estimates

Panels A and B, which results in somewhat smaller point estimates but similar levels of statistical

significance on the coefficient of interest.

       We now hone in more precisely on the extractive content of the bills, focusing on Jamaica,

where good information on bills exists. The data is organized by bill, and the outcome is simply an

indicator for whether an assemblyman supported a bill. Columns 1–2 and 5–6 in Panel C focus on

bills that we coded as extractive in the sense described beforehand.41 By contrast, and serving as a

placebo test, columns 3–4 and 7–8 use the other bills that were either procedural or had no relation

or an ambiguous relation to extractive policies. Column 1 again reports on a univariate regression

of only an indicator (scaled to be 0 or 100) for supporting an extractive bill on an indicator that i

is new elite member. Column 2 adds year fixed effects. Unlike in panel A, year controls do not

matter since we have already isolated bills that are extractive. In columns 1 and 2, new elites are

3.5 percentage points less likely than white elites to support an extractive bill. Columns 5–6 again

break down the new elite by economic identity. As before, new elite planters are closer to whites

than new elite merchants. In panel C they in fact do not vote differently from white elites. It is only
  40
    On average, a white planter agreed with all other white planters on about 65% of bills in a given year.
  41
     If a bill was for a policy against extraction, e.g., a progressive land tax, then votes were inverted so that after
inversion a ‘yes’ vote always meant supporting an extractive policy.

an extractive bill. Indeed, columns 3–4 and 7–8 do not exhibit the difference in voting by legislator

identity seen in the rest of panels A and B.


4.4      Elite Composition and Voting Interactions: ‘Stepping Up’

Section 3.4 describes one of the key mechanisms by which extractive policies persist even as the

share of accountable elites rises: Proposition 2 of the theory postulates that when less accountable

(L, ω) types are replaced with more accountable (H, ω) types, individual elite members ‘step up’,

i.e. become more likely to support extractive policies.42 A pertinent example of such a dynamic

that is discussed in some detail in historical accounts involved proposals to tighten suffrage rules

in Jamaica. During the period we study, two local acts attempted to raise suffrage qualifications in

order to put a lid on Jamaica’s expanding franchise. The first, narrowly defeated in 1854, saw nine

of 12 new elite assemblymen vote against it. However, five years later, the Franchise Act of 1859

instituted a more stringent tightening of franchise qualifications, and this time seven of 13 new

elite assemblymen voted for it (Holt 1991, ch.8, Heuman 1981, p.159-163). Holt notes of this change

in new elite legislators’ voting behaviour that “some brown assemblymen obviously voted against

the interests of their constituents,” and his interpretation is that “many brown assemblymen might

have anticipated the imminent flowering of majority rule, with the uneasy realization that they

might themselves not be part of that majority.”

       We can also test Proposition 2 statistically by interacting individual elites’ support for extrac-
                                            n(L,h)
tive bills with the time-varying share        n      of white planters in the assembly

                                               X                          n(L,h)
                          P(vit = 1) = αi +          βΘ × I(Θi = Θ) ×            + it .                       (8)
                                                                            n t
                                               Θ∈T

                      n(L,h)
Because this share      n t    varies by electoral cycle, and individual legislators held their seats across

electoral cycles, equation (8) allows us to study changes in voting behaviour conditional on indi-

vidual preference fixed effects αi , i.e. controlling for i’s baseline likelihood of supporting extrac-

tive policies. If the stepping-up prediction holds in the data we should see a differential effect
  42
     The same prediction is made when more economically invested elite types (θ, h) are replaced with less economi-
cally invested (θ, `) types.

for (H, h) types (new elite planters) and (H, `) types (new elite merchants ) relative to the omitted

category of (L, h) types (white planters ) in our data. We recognize that we treat the colony-level
                 n(L,h)
variation in       n t    as econometrically exogenous to the individual assemblyman when estimat-

ing equation (8). Our justification for doing so that is the primary source of identifying variation
     n(L,h)
in     n t    is a secular decline in the share of white planters over time (see Figure 1), which can

arguably be viewed as exogenous to the individual assemblyman.

     Table 3 reports on the results of estimating equation (8). Indeed we see that new elites increase
                                                                                                    n(L,h)
voting for extractive policies when the white planter bloc shrinks, i.e. when                         n t    falls. Column

2 shows that this interaction is more pronounced for new elite planters than merchants. While the

theory does not deliver a clear prediction on this difference, the patterns makes sense because new

elite planters have a larger economic payoff than new elite merchants from stepping up. It also

matches the empirical observation (Panel C of Table 2, columns 5–6) that new elite planters were

on average much more likely than new elite merchants to support extractive bills. The variable
n(L,h)
  n t    is scaled to lie between 0 and 100; the indicator P(vit = 1) is scaled to take values 0 or 100.

Therefore, the estimated coefficient −0.965 implies that a one percentage point decrease in the

white planter bloc increased a new elite planter’s likelihood to support an extractive bill by one

percentage point.

     This stepping up behaviour is consistent both with the new elite sharing the old elite’s eco-


                                                              35
nomic interest in extractive policy, and with our theory on how extractive policy comes to pass

even in the face of rising accountability.


4.5      Institutional Change

There are limits to the extent to which ‘stepping up’ can compensate for a rising share of more ac-

countable elites. When this share becomes large, ‘stepping up’ is not enough and the equilibrium

that sustains extractive policies is likely to fracture. Section 3.5 analyses how elites may then, as a

last resort, “pull the ripcord” of changing the formal institutions that govern accountability. Such

institutional change can take many forms. In our Caribbean case study, it meant that local elites

switched to ‘Crown Rule,’ which quite literally meant an assembly had to dissolve itself. The Colo-

nial Office described one such switch succinctly: “The assembly [...] addressed the Queen that it

had passed a bill for its own extinction” (Britain, 1879, p. 188). These switches were a remarkable

form of institutional change. As described in Section 4.1.1, the assemblies had extraordinary local

powers, and the islands’ elites had for two centuries “jealously guarded [them] against interfer-

ence by the colonial administration” (Wrong 1923, p. 70).

       In our setup, institutional change occurs when the share of accountable elites rises too much to

be absorbed by ‘stepping up.’ In our historical setting, this is illustrated well by Barbados. Barba-

dos was the special case among the ten islands. It shared with them a history of slave-based sugar

production, and it shared with them the existence of a potential new (mixed-race) elite. However,

Barbados was unique among the islands in that it consisted of flat limestone rather than rugged

volcanic stone.43 This meant plantations comprised 95% of land on the eve of emancipation, com-

pared to under 50% elsewhere in the Caribbean (Engerman, 1984; Patterson, 2013). Therefore,

post-Emancipation Barbados had no hinterland that black citizens could purchase, therefore they

obtained the franchise at a much lower rate than elsewhere, and therefore the share of new elites in

the Barbadian assembly remained below ten percent throughout the nineteenth century. Changes

in the composition of the Barbadian assembly were so muted that institutional change never be-

came necessary; and indeed, Barbados was the sole island that never did dissolve its assembly.

       All of the history we have read agrees with the broad assessment that institutional change

happened because “it was hoped that Crown Colony Government would preserve the existing
  43
       We discuss the geography more in Online Appendix C.


                                                        36
political status quo” (Dookhan, 1977, p202-205). Most Caribbean historians also agree that change

was necessitated by the changing composition of the elite. However, they disagree on why the

changing composition of the elite necessitated institutional change. Some argue that the disso-

lution of the assemblies was a case of white elites trying to shut down the emergent new elites:

Lowes (1994, p.35) argues that “in the end, the demand of an increasingly restive nonwhite middle

class for a voice in island affairs proved the greater fear [than ceding power to the colonial office],

and the white elites voted themselves out of office.” Ashdown (1979, p.34) argues in a similar

vein that “the colonies gave up their elected assemblies voluntarily, for in most cases the white,

privileged classes preferred direct imperial government to the government of the [new elite] who

were slowly obtaining greater representation in the legislative councils.” This is more akin to the

narrative where institutional change is driven by an old elite thwarting the rise of a new elite (as

in Acemoglu and Robinson 2012; Trefler and Puga 2014). Others argue for an interpretation that

is much closer to our theory and narrative: Rogers argues that “fear of political displacement by

the [new] middle class was a primary reason for its cooperation in destroying representative gov-

ernment” (1970, p. 316). Similarly, Fergus (1994, p.81) concludes that the point of Crown Rule was

to alleviate the elite’s accountability for an extractive system as it created “a more subtly exclu-

sive system as far as free blacks were concerned. There was only room [in it] for whites and their

wealthy [mixed-race] equivalents.” This is more akin to our narrative where old and new elites

cooperate to preserve rents to both groups.

   We now offer four observations in favour of our narrative: First, the vote to dissolve the assem-

bly was everywhere shrouded in deep secrecy, and there was no public outcry about it by the new

elites on any of the islands, whilst there does appear to have been great concern about an outcry

by the black citizenry. Lowes (1995, p.46) suggests that in Antigua “the vote took place in secrecy

to forestall any public protest,” and the Assembly Minutes in Nevis reveal that the meeting of June

14th 1866, when the dissolution of the assembly was voted on, began with the reading of a petition

by smallholders against the dissolution of the Assembly. We screened all of the islands’ Assembly

Minutes for the relevant sessions, and there were no voting records on the decision to dissolve the

assembly even in Jamaica, where the Jamaica Vote Books (unlike other islands’ Assembly Minutes)

recorded practically all votes.

   Second, in the only two islands where the Minutes reported on the votes for the dissolution—


                                                  37
St. Vincent and Grenada — the majority of new elites voted in favour of dissolving the assembly:

In St. Vincent, five of the nine new elite legislators voted in its favour; and in Grenada eight of

thirteen new elite legislators voted in its favour. Support by new elite legislators was thus not

uniform, but this would be expected given some variation in the cost of voting for dissolution.

       Third, the new elite was a majority in many of the assemblies when they voted to dissolve

themselves. This can be clearly seen in Figure 1, where the dissolution and concurrent switch to

‘Crown Rule’ marks the end-point in each panel. Dominica, Montserrat, Grenada, Tobago and

Antigua had majorities of assemblymen from the new elite when the assemblies voted to dissolve

themselves, while Jamaica, St Kitts, Nevis, and St Vincent, had large minorities. On the islands,

the vote to dissolve the assembly could not have passed if new elite assembly-members had sys-

tematically opposed it, and there would have been records of this in the Minutes if they had.

       Fourth, the citizenry’s increasing discontent with the persistence of extractive policies was very

tangible in the years leading up to the dissolutions of the assemblies, and this discontent mani-

fested itself in a threat of riots and violent uprisings that was at least as worrisome if not more for

new elites than it was for the British elites. Indeed, violent uprisings were arguably the primary

form of political accountability elites faced in the years immediately before the assemblies’ dis-

solution: Rogers (1970, p. 262-266) argues that violent uprisings in St Vincent, which lasted from

September 25 to October 8 1862 and had “many members of the upper class, white and [mixed

race], fear for their lives,” were the direct precursor to the initiation of constitutional reform. Sim-

ilarly, the ‘Bellmana Riots’ in April 1876 directly preceded the dissolution of Tobago’s assembly

(Craig-James, 2000, p.237,251). The same is true in Jamaica, where it has long been held that the

Assembly’s dissolution was a direct response to the Morant Bay Rebellion (Lewis, 2004, p.96).44

       In combination, these four observations are consistent with our narrative and (at least the

first three) are inconsistent with the alternative narrative whereby old British elites dissolved the

assemblies to shut out an emergent elite.
  44
     As we discuss in Section 4.1.2, electoral accountability was not the only form of political accountability, We load
political accountability onto electoral accountability in our theory because we want to stay within the legislative voting
framework, but the threat of violent uprisings hung over the Caribbean islands throughout the period we study.

5   Discussion & Conclusion

In 1836, the emancipation of slaves in the British Caribbean freed over ninety percent of the pop-

ulation, a sizable fraction of which obtained the franchise, i.e. the right to vote. This transformed

the political elite, with a new group of legislators emerging who were socially closer and more ac-

countable to the citizenry. Yet this dramatic change did not produce the expected improvements

in political outcomes. For decades, “the dead hand of the past’‘’ continued to lie on the Caribbean,

until increasing political unrest culminated in nine out of ten legislative assemblies voting to shut

down the democratic process and hand over executive control to the British crown.

    We analyse theoretically the mechanisms that could preserve an “iron law of oiligarchy” even

under conditions thought to be conducive to political reforms. Two key mechanisms are identified:

First, when the share of accountable legislators increases, legislators who previously free rode

‘step up’ and vote in favour of extractive policies. Second, when accountable legislators become

too numerous, they may cooperate with old elites in weakening democratic institutions (at a cost)

to shield themselves from their higher electoral accountability.

    Using novel archival data, we apply our theory to an historical analysis of the post-Emancipation

Caribbean, where we can get an unusually sharp characterization of the social and economic iden-

tity of each elite member. Our analytic narrative shows why changes in political identity may not

translate into improvements in political outcomes, even under electoral institutions and where

new elites are more accountable to the citizenry. Raising political accountability through the elec-

toral system can only be achieved when there are proper institutional safeguards of the electoral

system. This is a strong form of the “iron law of oligarchy”.

Appendix A            Mathematical Appendix
Proof of Proposition 1. (i) Consider an arbitrary time T . By hypothesis d∗T ≥ 0.
  In a voting equilibrium, viT = 1 for exactly 12 n . Consider such an i.
                                               

  We first compute bounds on i’s continuation payoffs. Define two states, sit = 1 if i ∈ Nt and
zero otherwise. Let V0 and V1 be the expected discounted sum of payoffs to i in state 0 and state
1, respectively. We can construct an upper bound on the difference V1 − V0 , which is independent
of z, by supposing extractive policy is passed if and only if sit = 1, sit = 0 is absorbing, and
Pit = p̄ = 1 for all t ≥ T . This yields:


                                      V1 − V0 = πi + r + δ(V1 − V0 )                                  (9)

or
                                                             πi + r
                                               V1 − V0 =            .                               (10)
                                                             1−δ
  Because i is pivotal, a lower bound on the difference between his equilibrium payoff and the
payoff from a one-shot deviation to viT = 0 is


                                            πi − δ(p̄ − PiT )[V1 − V0 ].                            (11)

Substituting in (10), there is no profitable one-shot deviation if

                                                          πi + r
                                      πi − δ(p̄ − PiT )                 ≥ 0                         (12)
                                                          1−δ
                                                             diT        ≥ 0.                        (13)
                                                                                                    (14)

This holds since diT ≥ d∗T ≥ 0 by hypothesis.
  Now consider i for which viT = 0 in equilibrium. We again begin by computing i’s continuation
payoffs.
  The expected continuation payoff at T + 1 to i ∈ NT +1 is

             Ui (siT +1 = 1) = r + P(DT∗ +1 ≥ 0|siT +1 = 1)πi
                                                                                                    (15)
                               + δE[PiT +1 ]Ui (siT +2 = 1) + δ(1 − E[PiT +1 ])Ui (siT +2 = 0).

  Let E[P̃it ] be i’s expected likelihood of being elected to the legislature in t+1 given i ∈
                                                                                             / Nt . Hence
for i ∈
      / NT +1 , the expected continuation payoff is

            Ui (siT +1 = 0) = P(DT∗ +1 ≥ 0|siT +1 = 0)πi
                                                                                                  (16)
                              + δE[P̃iT +1 ]Ui (siT +2 = 1) + δ 1 − E[P̃iT +1 ] Ui (siT +2 = 0).

  Now consider a one-shot deviation at time T . As i is not pivotal, the difference between his



                                                        46
equilibrium expected payoff and his deviation payoff from playing viT = 1 is

                                δ(p̄ − piT ) [Ui (siT +1 = 1) − Ui (siT +1 = 0)] .                 (17)

 First, P(Dt∗ ≥ 0|sit = 1) ≥ P(Dt∗ ≥ 0|sit = 0) independently of zt , because P(Dit ≥ 0) ≥
P
 Θj ∈T qt (Θj |Θi )P(Djt ≥ 0) (Assumption 1). Second, E[Pit ] ≥ E[P̃it ] by assumption (no incum-
bency disadvantage). Taken together, this rules out a profitable one-shot deviation.
  (ii) By construction viT = 0 for all i ∈ NT . Since no legislator is pivotal, the argument in part (i)
(for i voting against extractive policy) rules out a profitable one-shot deviation for any player. 

   Proof of Proposition 2.
  For convenience, suppress time notation. Consider state z with j ∈ N .
  Define A as the event in which Di ≥ 0 for exactly d 12 ne − 1 players other than j. Define B as the
event in which Di ≥ 0 for at least d 21 ne players other than j. The likelihood that extractive policy
is passed is:


                                 P(x = 1|z) = P(Dj ≥ 0)P(A|z) + P(B|z).                            (18)
          ∗ as the d 1 neth largest value of D among i ∈ N − {j}. The likelihood that j votes for
  Define D−j         2                        i           t
extractive policy is:

                                                                ∗
                        P(vj = 1|z) = P(Dj ≥ 0)P(A|z) + P(Dj ≥ D−j |z)P(B|z).                      (19)

  Replace legislator j with j 0 as hypothesized to create state z 0 . Define z−j as the distribution of
types among i ∈ Nt − {j}. Then:


                   P(x = 1|z) − P(x = 1|z 0 ) = P(Dj ≥ 0) − P(Dj 0 ≥ 0) P(A|z−j ).
                                                                      
                                                                                                   (20)

  In addition:

   P(vj = 1|z) − P(vj 0 = 1|z 0 ) = P(Dj ≥ 0) − P(Dj 0 ≥ 0) P(A|z−j )
                                                          
                                                                                                   (21)
                                               ∗                       ∗
                                                                                  
                                   + P(Dj ≥ D−j  |z−j , B) − P(Dj 0 ≥ D−j |z−j , B) P(B|z−j ).

  (21) is larger than (20) if

                                        ∗                        ∗

  By hypothesis, the switch from j to j 0 involves the type switch L → H, or h → `, or both. Hence
P(Dj ≥ d∗ ) > P(Dj 0 ≥ d∗ ) for all possible values d∗ ≥ 0. Therefore, (22) is satisfied. 

   Proof of Proposition 3.
  For convenience, suppress time notation. It is straightforward to verify that the proof of Propo-
sition 1 still applies to voting over extractive policy, so a voting equilibrium is part of a subgame


                                                       47
perfect equilibrium of the game with institutional change.
  This produces an expected discounted payoff to i ∈ Nt in state n(H) under elections, written as

                                r + P (x = 1|n(H)) πi + δV (θi , n(H)) ,                            (23)

where V (θi , n(H)) is i’s (time t, date 0) expected continuation payoff in state n(H).
                                                                                       
 The expected discounted payoff to i when permanently ending elections is πi + r /(1 − δ) − c.
Hence, for i to vote for dissolution of the legislature:

                   πi + r
                          − c ≥ r + P (x = 1|n(H)) πi + δV (θi , n(H))                              (24)
                   1−δ
                                πi + r
                            c ≤           − r − P (x = 1|n(H)) πi − δV (θi , n(H))                  (25)
                                 1−δ
                              ≡ c (θi , n(H)) .                                                     (26)

  Let the threshold in the statement of the proposition be c = c (L, 0). Hence (26) establishes part
(i): dissolution occurs in the initial state n(H) = 0 if and only if c ≤ c.
  Part (ii) follows immediately from (26).
  To establish part (iii), note that, because of uniform random replacement of types under attrition,
the type distribution hits each state n(H) ∈ {0, 1, . . . n} in finite time with probability one.
  W.l.o.g. assume n is odd. From the initial state n(H) = 0 up until n(H) ≥ d 12 ne − 1, there is a
majority of L type legislators, who must vote for dissolution for it to pass: c ≤ c (L, n(H)). The
payoff from elections to a given L type i is strictly decreasing in n(H), because (1) the likelihood
of extractive policy being passed is strictly decreasing (Proposition A1) and (2) the likelihood i has
to vote for extractive policy is strictly increasing. Hence c (L, n(H)) is strictly increasing along this
interval.
  From n(H) equals d 12 ne to n, H types are in the majority and must vote for dissolution for it to
pass: c ≤ c (H, n(H)). As with L types, the payoff from elections to a given H type i is strictly
decreasing along this interval, and hence c (H, n(H)) is strictly increasing.
  Therefore, the maximum cost c for which dissolution occurs is:


                             c ≡ max c L, d 21 ne − 1) , c (H, n) .

  We have just established that c L, d 21 ne − 1) > c(L, 0) = c. Hence c > c. This establishes part
                                                 

Online Appendix A.1        Determination of Economic Rents
We now describe an economy resembling the Caribbean setting in which the ordering of economic
rents in (1) holds, with h types being planters and ` types being merchants.
    There are a finite number of planters nP and merchants nM , as well as a citizenry/workforce
which is a continuum with unit mass. All agents are risk neutral.
    Plantation production uses labour inputs and exhibits constant returns to scale. Each worker
hired produces output of λ > 0 units of sugar. Sugar is entirely exported at the price prevail-
ing on international markets, which we normalize to one. Planters collude in setting the wage
w to maximize planter profits. In doing so, they are constrained by a worker’s outside option of
becoming a smallholder. This option is worth τ (x)y to a worker, where y is determined by an in-
dependent draw from the distribution U (0, 1) and τ (1) < τ (0) so that the extractive policy makes
each worker’s outside option less attractive (and thereby depresses wages). In the Caribbean, re-
ducing workers’ outside options was the primary way in which wages could be reduced. One
reason was because London abolitionists kept a watchful eye on labour practices on the plan-
tations themselves. Another reason was that smallholding truly was the relevant alternative to
plantation labour so that wages were set at that margin as opposed to the standard assumption
of wages being set at the margin of labour productivities in two-wage paying sectors. See Dippel,
Greif, and Trefler (2018).
    The profits of planters and plantation workers are spent entirely on a good which is imported
by merchants. Workers who exercise their outside option and become smallholders engage in sub-
sistence production. They exit the formal economy and do not purchase goods from merchants.
Merchants import the consumption good at cost c and sell the good at price p > c, which is the
cost to non-merchants of importing the good.
    Let us now solve for the equilibrium profits of planters and merchants. To preserve symmetry
within each occupational class, we assume that (1) workers are evenly distributed among planters
and (2) sales to planters and workers are evenly distributed among merchants.
                                                           w
    A worker will accept a wage w if w > τ (x)y or y < τ (x)  . Hence by paying a wage of w, each
                           w
planter will hire mass nM τ (x) of workers. Thus a wage of w yields profit of
                                                    w        
                                   πP (w; x) =            λ−w .
                                                 nP τ (x)
   When planters collude in setting w to maximize planter profits, the equilibrium wage is w∗ =
λ/2 yielding equilibrium profit of

                                                     λ2
                                        πP (x) =             .
                                                   4nP τ (x)
   The equilibrium revenue of merchants is the sum of sales to planters and plantation workers,
which is simply equal to total planter revenue (i.e., wages are transfers between planters and
                                      2
plantation workers), which equals 2nPλτ (x) . Hence the profit to each merchant is

   As τ (1) < τ (0), πP (1) > πP (0) and πM (1) > πM (0).

Proposition A1 Construct state z 0 from state z by switching θi = L to H for n1 players and switching ωi
to ` for n2 players, for any feasible (n1 , n2 ).
    The likelihood that extractive policy is passed is lower in state z 0 :

   Proof of Proposition A1 Suppress time notation. In equilibrium, extractive policy is passed if
and only if d∗ ≥ 0. Hence the likelihood that extractive policy is passed is P(D∗ ≥ 0).

  Now replace i with i0 such that θi = L, θi0 = H and ωi = ωi0 as hypothesized. By (34), the
difference in probabilities is

                   P(D∗ ≥ 0| θi = L) − P(D∗ ≥ 0| θi0 = H) ∝ FL (∆i ) − FH (∆i0 ).                          (35)

As ωi = ωi0 , ∆i = ∆i0 . In addition, FH (∆) > FL (∆) for all ∆ ∈ (0, p̄) by assumption. Hence (35) is
negative.
  Similarly replacing i with i0 such that ωi = h, ωi0 = ` and θi = θi0 as hypothesized yields

                   P(D∗ ≥ 0| ωi = `) − P(D∗ ≥ 0| ωi0 = h) ∝ Fθi (∆i ) − Fθi (∆i0 ).                        (36)

∆0i > ∆i , because π(1, h) > π(1, `). Hence (36) is negative as F is strictly increasing.

the distinct island-specific plantation surveys in Online Appendix Table 1.
    To assign each legislator one of the four group labels, our starting point were plantation owner-
ship records. Before emancipation, all planters were white. In a first step, we therefore coded legis-
lators that belonged to families that were pre-Emancipation plantation owners as ‘white planters.’
Before Emancipation, plantation owners were recorded in the Slave Registries in the 1820s and then
again in the Emancipation Compensation Tables in 1835.45 Most families that appeared in the assem-
blies before 1838 were also recorded as plantation owners, but if they were not we coded them
as white merchants. For legislators whose families first appeared after Emancipation we con-
sulted post-Emancipation plantation surveys to establish if they were planters or merchants, and
we consulted an extensive list of island-specific social and political histories to establish whether
they were white or not. Given the salience of race as a feature of Caribbean history, these island-
specific accounts are usually quite explicit in this regard. The historical accounts almost never
contradicted the coding based on pre-Emancipation plantation ownership records, except in rare
cases of shared last names. They were essential for establishing the social type of legislators whose
families’ names had not appeared anywhere before Emancipation, particularly because there was
a substantial number of white planters in the data that first appeared after Emancipation, appar-
ently mostly ‘estate attorneys’ that managed the plantations of older established planter families.
    Despite the wealth of information we collected, we still had to make some judgement calls on
some individuals in islands where the social histories and records were less extensive and detailed
  45
      From 1813 on, the Crown required colonies to register all slaves. Most colonies have three iterations of the slave
registries, but each new iteration simply updated the previous for births and deaths. When England abolished slavery,
it set aside money to compensate slave owners for their loss. The disbursal of that money was recorded in the Com-
pensation Tables. We digitized the Slave Registries ourselves, while the Compensation Tables data had been digitized by a
research project at University College London; all 30,308 claimants can be viewed on consecutive url’s running from
http://www.ucl.ac.uk/lbs/claim/view/1 to .../30308.

than in Jamaica. Importantly, however, the thrust of our empirical analysis, especially on the key
predictions on roll-call voting behavior, is based on Jamaican data. Jamaica, being the biggest and
most important of the islands, had the richest records so that there was no ambiguity in measuring
elite types.

Online Appendix C              Barbados’s Geography
Barbados was an outlier among the Caribbean slave societies in its geography. While all Caribbean
islands shared their climatic conditions, there was large variation in geographic characteristics like
elevation and soil. The typical Caribbean sugar colony was characterized by sugar-suitable coastal
plains and a rugged interior that lay fallow during slavery. Barbados was the only Caribbean sugar
island that combined the advantages of limestone rather than volcanic soil with a high enough ele-
vation to protect sugar from saltwater and storm surges.The Caribbean is divided into three island
chains: The Greater Antilles are large islands with mountainous interiors and coastal plains. Of
these, only Jamaica was a British colony, the others are Cuba, Haiti and the Dominican Repub-
lic. Most British Caribbean colonies–Dominica, the British Virgin Islands, Grenada, Montserrat,
Nevis, St. Kitts, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent–belonged to the inner chain of the Lesser Antilles,
which is volcanic and mountainous. The outer chain of Lesser Antilles–Anguilla, Bahamas, Bar-
bados, Turks and Caicos–consists of flat limestone. This limestone was more suitable for sugar
cultivation because it retained water better than the volcanic land on the inner chain (Richard-
son, 1997, p. 147) and because sugar does not like high elevations. In Barbados, the entire land
area was highly sugar-suitable land, and over 95% of its land was under cultivation on the eve
of emancipation, compared to under 50% elsewhere in the Caribbean (Martin, 1839, p.32–102).
While Barbados was not particularly unique during slavery, it was unique after emancipation its
ability to offer extremely low wages for lack of any other options to the citizenry. Consequently, a
merchant class catering to local markets did not develop, and emancipated blacks did not obtain
the franchise for a lack of available land for purchase.
