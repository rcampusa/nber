Do Race and Fairness Matter in Generosity? Evidence from a Nationally Representative Charity

                                            ABSTRACT

We present a dictator game experiment where the recipients are local charities that serve the poor.
Donors consist of approximately 1000 participants from a nationally representative respondent panel
that is maintained by a private survey research firm, Knowledge Networks. We randomly manipulate
the perceived race and worthiness of the charity recipients by showing respondents an audiovisual
presentation about the recipients. The experiment yields three main findings. First, we find significant
racial bias in perceptions of worthiness: respondents rate recipients of their own racial group as more
worthy. Second, respondents give significantly more when the recipients are described as more worthy.
These findings may lead one to expect that respondents would also give more generously when shown
pictures of recipients belonging to their own racial group. However, our third result shows that this
is not the case; despite our successfully manipulating perceptions of race, giving does not respond
significantly to recipient race. Thus, while our respondents do seem to rate ingroup members as more
worthy, they appear to overcome this bias when it comes to giving.

1. Introduction


There is now broad agreement among social scientists that race and fairness are two of
the most important determinants of generosity to the poor.1 Empirical evidence from
many different levels of analysis points to significant, and often substantial, effects of
racial and ethnic group loyalty on redistribution. Across countries, those with more racial
or ethnic fractionalization have less governmental redistribution (Alesina, Glaeser and
Sacerdote 2001). Across states within the United States, those with more ethnic
fractionalization spend less on public goods and social services (Alesina, Baqir and
Easterly 1999). Across individuals, those who live in a locality with a higher fraction of
welfare recipients of a different race are significantly more opposed to redistribution
(Luttmer 2001), and racial attitudes seem to play an important role in attitudes to
redistribution (Gilens 1999, Lee and Roemer 2006).2
    The role of fairness in redistribution has also received a great deal of research
attention. By fairness we mean strong reciprocity, which is the propensity to incur
pecuniary costs to reward those who have been kind and to punish those who have been
unkind (Gintis 2000, Fehr, Fischbacher, and Gächter 2002, Bowles and Gintis 2004). The
type of “kindness” that motivates reciprocation involves good intentions, regardless of
the outcome of those intentions (Rabin 1993). The strong reciprocity motive can be
generalized such that people may want to reward those who have helped others or society
in general and to punish those who have hurt others or society in general. Thus, strong
reciprocity may motivate people to reward the industrious poor for trying hard to make it
on their own by giving more charity or supporting more governmental redistribution to
the poor; and to punish the “lazy” poor by withholding charity or opposing governmental
redistribution to the poor (Fong, Bowles and Gintis 2006).3

  For recent theoretical work, see Shayo (2009) and Lindqvist and Östling (2009) for interesting models of
social identity (including racial identity) and redistribution.

  Evidence that people are more generous to the industrious poor than to the “lazy” poor can also be
explained by related concepts from other fields, including: i) the equity principle of distributive justice,
according to which the resources one receives from a system should increase with one’s inputs into the
system (Walster, Walster and Berscheid 1978, Deutsch 1985); and ii) attribution theory in social
psychology, according to which people are less generous to people whom they judge to be individually
responsible for their need (Weiner 1995). See Konow (2003) for a review of empirical evidence on
distributive justice.


                                                      1
      Economists have modeled the relationships between beliefs about the causes of
income, individual economic experiences, and governmental redistribution (Piketty 1995,
Alesina and Angeletos 2005, Bénabou and Tirole 2006). These models show that it is
possible to have multiple stable equilibria: an equilibrium in which levels of
redistribution are low and people tend to believe that income is largely caused by effort,
or an equilibrium in which levels of redistribution are high and people tend to believe that
income is caused by circumstances beyond their control. There is also empirical evidence
of a strong association between opposition to redistribution and beliefs that the poor are
lazy rather than industrious.4 This relationship emerges at both the cross-country level
and the individual level within countries (Alesina, Glaeser and Sacerdote 2001, Corneo
and Grüner 2002); moreover, at the individual level, the relationship cannot be explained
by missing measures of socioeconomic status (Fong 2001). In laboratory experiments
using real payoffs, respondents give more to recipients who might be interpreted as
having greater moral worth (Hoffman, McCabe, Shachat, and Smith 1994, Eckel and
Grossman 1996, Fong 2007, Durante and Putterman, 2008). Similarly, randomized
survey experiments show substantially more support for government spending on “caring
for the poor” or on “helping the poor” than on “welfare.” Political scientists have argued
that this result supports the claim that people tend to judge welfare recipients as a
particularly unworthy social category (Heclo 1986, Gilens 1999).
      For neither race nor fairness, however, is the supporting evidence based on studies
that simultaneously use (i) real monetary transfers to the poor, (ii) randomized treatments
of race and fairness, (iii) a nationally representative sample, and (iv) decision-making in a
natural environment. We know of no evidence that is based on all four desiderata. In this
paper, we present the results from, to the best of our knowledge, the first study to produce
data based on the first three desiderata: behavioral measures of redistribution to the poor,
random treatments of race and worthiness, and national representativeness. We see our
paper as complementary evidence to field experiments, which typically meet all
desiderata except the third (Frey and Meier 2004, Croson and Shang 2005, Landry et al.
2006, Falk 2007, Karlan and List 2007, Eckel and Grossman 2008, DellaVigna, List, and
Malmendier 2009, List and Price 2009, Meer 2009).

                                                      2
   Our experiment is a dictator game in which the recipients are local charities that serve
the poor in the city of Tuscaloosa, Alabama. Donors consist of approximately 1,000
participants from a nationally representative respondent panel that is maintained by a
private survey research firm, Knowledge Networks. We randomly manipulate the
perceived race and worthiness of the charity recipients by showing respondents an
audiovisual presentation about the recipients. Our “black” treatment shows photos mostly
of black charity recipients while our “white” treatment shows photos mostly of white
charity recipients. The photos are presented along with an audio story in which we
manipulate perceptions of the worthiness of the charity recipients. We find that our
treatments are successful – they have significant direct effects in the expected direction
on perceptions of the race and worthiness of the recipients. We then give each respondent
a ten percent chance of receiving $100. Prior to learning whether or not they will receive
the $100, respondents must decide how much of that sum they would like to donate to the
assigned charity in the event that they receive it. Finally, we collect survey data on a
variety of attitudes and beliefs, including perceptions of the worthiness and race of the
recipients. These perception measures are designed to test whether our treatments
successfully manipulated beliefs about the recipients.
   Our experiment generates three main results. First, we find significant racial bias in
perceptions of worthiness: respondents rate recipients of their own racial group as more
worthy, and rate more worthy recipients as more likely to belong to their own racial
group. Second, respondents give significantly more generously when the recipients are
described as more worthy. In particular, audio treatments that raise the perceived fraction
of worthy recipients by 15.2 percentage points cause the respondents to increase their
giving by $11.0. This result, together with our finding of racial bias in perceptions of
worthiness, may lead one to expect that respondents would also give more generously
when shown pictures of recipients belonging to their own racial group. However, as our
third result demonstrates, this is not the case; despite our successfully manipulating
perceptions of race, respondents give about the same amount irrespective of the race of
the recipients in the pictures. For instance, the non-black respondents give $61.0 on
average when white recipients are shown and $58.9 on average when black recipients are
shown. The difference of -$2.1 is not statistically significant (s.e. = 2.7) and relatively



                                              3
small compared to the mean level of giving. Thus, while our respondents do rate ingroup
members as more worthy, they appear to overcome this bias when it comes to giving.
    In the remainder of the paper, Section 2 presents our experimental design, Section 3
presents our results, and Section 4 concludes with our interpretation of our results. As we
will explain in the conclusion, we do not believe that our failure to find racial bias in
giving contradicts prior evidence of discrimination and racial group loyalty. First, racism
may have been higher in the past. Second, there may be racial discrimination in the real
world that our study fails to detect. Finally, even if there currently is no racial bias in
individual preferences for redistribution, cumulative effects of prior discrimination may
cause racial inequalities to persist.


2. Experimental Design


Our experiment was fielded by Knowledge Networks, a market research firm founded by
two Stanford political science professors. Knowledge Networks maintains a roughly
nationally representative panel of respondents for use in both commercial and academic
projects. Its respondents participate in surveys approximately once a week by Internet or
Web TV. In exchange for their participation, Knowledge Networks panelists receive free
Internet or WebTV access and receive the monetary incentives from some surveys. For
example, our respondents received whatever monetary payoffs they earned from our
experiment. Panelists are recruited through random-digit dialing and are then asked to
join the Knowledge Networks panel.
    In our experiment, we manipulate respondents’ perceptions of the poor. More
specifically, we focus on perceptions of race and “worthiness” of recipients of two local
charities in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. We accomplish this with a slide show that presents
eight photographs along with two and a half minutes of audio. The slide show describes
the city of Tuscaloosa, one of two randomly-assigned charities, and recipients of aid from
that charity. Half of our respondents saw a slide show depicting the work of the Salvation
Army in Tuscaloosa, and the other half saw a slide show depicting the work of
Temporary Emergency Services in Tuscaloosa.




                                               4
     We took care to manipulate race perceptions in a way that minimized the likelihood
that respondents would recognize the racial motivation of our study. Thus, we did not
mention the issue of race in the audio part of our slide show. Instead, we manipulated
perceptions of recipient race with the photographs. Half of our respondents saw photos
mostly of black charity recipients, and the other half saw photos mostly of white charity
recipients.5 We made the backgrounds of the photos of blacks and whites as similar as
possible (nearly identical in most cases) by taking the photos of blacks and whites in
exactly the same location.
     The audio portion of our slide show is designed to manipulate perceptions of recipient
worthiness and other characteristics. We avoid using deception by including different
pieces of true information in different treatment conditions. For example, in our
manipulation of the economic standing of Tuscaloosa, one treatment condition correctly
states that the poverty rate in Tuscaloosa “is almost twice as high as the rest of the
country,” and the other treatment condition correctly states that Tuscaloosa’s “per capita
income … is more than 5% higher than the rest of the state.” Below we summarize our
randomly assigned audio manipulations. The issues being manipulated are in bold text
(with the fraction of participants assigned to each condition of the manipulation in
parentheses). The treatment conditions for each manipulation are listed together with the
values (0 or 1) we give them when they are used as dummy variables. With one
exception, each randomized manipulation contains two conditions. The exception is the
reasons for poverty and willingness to work manipulation, in which there are three
conditions.6 For each manipulation, each respondent was assigned to one and only one
treatment condition. The exact wording of the audio conditions is provided in Appendix
A.


5
  We did not show pictures exclusively of one race because that might arouse suspicions among the
respondents. Instead, in the black treatment condition, approximately 80% of the pictures are of blacks
while in the white treatment condition approximately 80% of the pictures are of whites.
6
  In the reasons for poverty and willingness to work manipulation, we assigned 50% to the default
condition in which we said nothing about the work ethic of the poor and said that the reasons for poverty
are a mixture of factors including bad choices and circumstances beyond control. Among the other 50% of
subjects, half were assigned to the Reason for poverty bad choices, not willing to work condition and half
were assigned to the Reason for poverty beyond control, willing to work condition. The actual number of
observations in each condition differs slightly from 50% or 25% because of non-response (see Section 3 for
details about excluded participants). The actual fraction of participants in each treatment condition is
presented in Table 1.


                                                    5
    i)    City is Republican (50/50):
          0. “Compared to the rest of Alabama, more people in Tuscaloosa vote for the Democratic Party”
          1. “Like the rest of Alabama, people in Tuscaloosa vote overwhelmingly for the Republican Party”
    ii) City is economically advantaged (50/50):
          0. “…with a poverty rate that is twice as high as in the rest of the country”
          1. “…with a per capita income that is more than 5% higher than the rest of the state”
    iii) Reason for poverty and willingness to work (50/25/25): Many of the poor in Tuscaloosa are
               poor because of
          0. “…a mixture of factors including bad choices…and bad luck” and work ethic not mentioned
          1. “bad choices” and “many of them wish they could rely on more generous assistance”
          1. “circumstances beyond their control” and “many of them try to get a job…”
    iv) Religious (50/50):
          0. [Nothing said]
          1. Many of the poor in Tuscaloosa “pray to God regularly to ask Him for help”
    v) Salvation Army (50/50): The charity depicted is
          0. Temporary Emergency Services
          1. Salvation Army
    vi) Short-term need for aid (50/50): Many of the charity’s recipients use its help
          0. “…for long periods of time”
          1. “…for short periods of time when it is absolutely necessary”
    vii) Currently working (50/50): the charity is busy “before people receive their next”
          0. “government benefits check”
          1. “paycheck”
    viii) Sharing own aid with others (50/50): “Many recipients are”
          0. “competitive about getting aid”
          1. “willing to share their allotment with others in need”
    ix) Law-abiding (50/50): It is often hard for recipients to get well-paying jobs because “many
               employers are reluctant to hire”
          0. “people who have a criminal record”
          1. “them”


    Immediately following the slide show, we measure generosity to the poor in
Tuscaloosa with actual giving to the charity depicted in the slide show. We explain that
we will give $100 to one out of every ten participants in this study and ask respondents to
decide how much of that money they would like to give to the Tuscaloosa charity.7 That
is, respondents had a 10% chance of playing a $100 dictator game with the Tuscaloosa
charity.
    After respondents enter their dictator game decision, we ask a series of questions
designed to check the effectiveness of our treatments. These questions measure
perceptions of the charity recipients and all the residents of Tuscaloosa. For each

7
  To credibly convey that each respondent had a 10 percent chance of being selected, we assigned each
respondent a number between 0 and 9, and told him that his decision will be carried out if his assigned
number is equal to the first number of the Louisiana State Pick3 lottery on a specified future date.
Moreover, we told the respondent that the charity would send him a note specifying the amount of his
donation. This was subsequently carried out as promised.


                                                     6
treatment condition, there is a perceptions question designed specifically to test its
effectiveness. Finally, we conduct a survey of background characteristics and attitudes.
This survey includes a variety of questions, including past charitable giving, attitudinal
support for government transfers to the poor in Tuscaloosa, attitudinal support for
charitable transfers to the poor in Tuscaloosa, preferences for government spending in
general, beliefs about causes of poverty, perceptions of racial composition of charity
recipients, social contact with people of other races, and attitudes about racial inequality
of opportunity.


3. Results


The experiment was fielded in 2006 from August 28 to September 20. A total of 1167
respondents participated. We limit our sample to the 989 individuals who indicated that
they could clearly hear the speaker in our audio presentation. An additional seven
respondents did not answer the question about how much they would like to give during
the experiment, so we also dropped these observations. Our final sample consists of 982
respondents, of which 204 are black. Since we oversampled black respondents, we
weight all of our results to correct for this oversampling. Appendix Table 1 compares the
means and standard deviations of demographic variables in our Knowledge Networks
data to those in the June 2006 Current Population Survey. The demographic means are
roughly similar in magnitude even though there are significant differences in age,
education, income, household structure, and marital status. There are no significant
differences in the means of race, region, and work status dummies (except for a
marginally significant difference in the fraction of respondents who are disabled).
   Table 1 presents summary statistics for the full weighted sample. The average
donation was $58.7 (s.d. = $37.2), and roughly 11% of the respondents gave zero. About
21% of the sample gave the median donation of $50, and about thirty-six percent of the
respondents gave the full $100. The total payout from the experiment to the charities was
$5995. Figure 1 presents the cumulative density function of giving during the experiment
for the full weighted sample. Slightly more than 20% gave between zero and $50, and
approximately 10% of the respondents gave between $50 and $100.



                                              7
       This fairly high level of giving in this experiment is not too surprising. In standard
laboratory dictator games, in which students give anonymously to other students, average
donations are around 10%-15% of the total (Camerer 2003). However, studies have
shown that average offers in dictator games vary greatly due to a variety of factors.
Factors that may have increased average giving in our experiment include social
proximity, which can be increased by providing information about recipients (Bohnet and
Frey 1999);8 the perceived level of need of the recipients (Fong and Luttmer 2009); and
our lottery method of assigning endowments to respondents, which may have decreased
their sense of entitlement to the sum (Hoffman, McCabe, Shachat, and Smith 1994).
Since so many factors can affect the overall level of giving in dictator games, our interest
lies exclusively in the marginal effects of our treatment conditions and background
variables. We use the dictator game simply as a tool to obtain a measure of generosity
towards the poor that is based on an actual, payoff-relevant choice. We therefore do not
interpret average giving in this experiment as an estimate of the marginal propensity to
give.


3.1. Treatment effects on perceptions of charity recipients


Tables 2a and 2b present the effects of our treatments on corresponding perceptions of
the charity recipients and Tuscaloosa residents using the whole sample. This table shows
that, by and large, our treatments successfully manipulated the perceptions they were
designed to affect. Each column presents a regression where the outcome variable is one
of the perception measures. The rows show the effects of our treatments on each of these
perceptions.
       Row (a) shows the effect of presenting photos of black charity recipients. We
expected the black photos to have positive effects in columns 1 and 10. The outcome
variable in these columns is the perceived percentage of people who are black minus
perceived percentage who are white, where the people in question are aid recipients
(column 1) and Tuscaloosa residents (column 10). As depicted in column 1, black photos
increase the perceived fraction of charity recipients who are black-minus-white by 21.8

8
    See also Small and Loewenstein (2003) for related work on the “identifiable victim effect.”


                                                       8
percentage points. This effect is significant at the one-percent level and establishes that
our treatments successfully manipulated perceptions of recipient race. In column 10, the
effect of black photos on the perceived fraction of Tuscaloosa residents who are black-
minus-white is 15.3 percentage points and is also significant at the one-percent level.
    Row (a) also shows that black photos have highly significant negative effects on
perceptions about the worthiness of the charity recipients. Columns 2 through 4 present
regressions where the outcome variables are perceptions of worthiness. These columns
show that the black photos have highly significant negative effects on beliefs that the
recipients were: (2a) “willing to work hard in order to get ahead in life”, (2b) “poor
mainly because of reasons beyond their control”, and (2c) not “poor mainly because of
bad choices in their personal lives.”9 Column 3 shows that the black photos had a highly
significant negative effect on beliefs that the recipients have no criminal record, while
column 4 shows that black photos had a negative, but insignificant, effect on perceptions
that recipients are willing to share their aid with others. As we will show in Table 3
below, the negative effect of black photos on perceived recipient worthiness is driven
entirely by the non-blacks in our sample; among blacks, the effect of black photos on
perceived recipient worthiness is small and insignificant. Hence, these results offer a first
indication of our finding of racial bias in perceptions of worthiness.
    Rows (b) and (c) show the effects of the first two worthiness treatments. Row (b)
shows the effects of describing recipients as poor for reasons beyond their control and
being willing to work. Row (c) presents the effects of describing recipients as being poor
because of bad choices and not very interested in working hard. The omitted control
treatment for rows (b) and (c) described recipients as poor because of a mixture of bad
choices and circumstances beyond control and did not mention work ethic. The treatment
presented in row (b) occurred in 25% of the cases, the treatment presented in row (c)
occurred in another 25% of the cases, and the omitted control condition occurred in the
remaining 50% of the cases. The worthiness perceptions that are the dependent variables
in columns 2a through 2c were designed specifically to test the effectiveness of these two
worthiness treatments. We expect the treatment in row (b) to have positive effects in

 The outcome in columns (2c) and (3) are reverse coded from the wording in the survey. See Appendix A
for original question wording.


                                                  9
columns 2a through 2c and the treatment in row (c) to have negative effects in these
columns. As expected, the effects of the worthiness treatment presented in row (b) are
positive and highly significant in columns 2a through 2c. Furthermore, in column 3, we
find that this treatment has a highly significant positive effect on perceptions that the
recipients have no criminal record. The worthiness treatment presented in row (c) has
negative effects (as expected) in columns 2a through 2c. The effect is highly significant
in column 2a, marginally significant in column 2c, and insignificant in column 2b.
   Rows (d) and (e) present the effects of the other two worthiness treatments:
describing recipients as, respectively, law-abiding and willing to share the aid they
receive with others. As expected, the law-abiding treatment has a highly significant
positive effect on perceptions that recipients have no criminal record, and the willing-to-
share treatment has a highly significant positive effect on perceptions that recipients are
willing to share their aid with others. In addition, these treatments have positive effects
on other perceptions of worthiness (columns 2a-2c) which are significant at the five-
percent level in three cases and the ten-percent level in one case. Together, rows (b)
through (e) establish that out treatments successfully manipulated perceptions of recipient
worthiness.
   Rows (f) through (h) present the effects of describing recipients as, respectively,
needing short-term aid, currently working, and religious. These treatments correspond to
perceptions measures that are ultimately relatively poorly explained. The R2 statistics in
the columns explaining perceptions about recipients needing short-term aid, currently
working, and being religious are the lowest among those in Table 2, ranging from 0.04 to
0.06. Nonetheless, the short-term need for aid treatment has a highly significant positive
effect on perceptions that recipients need short-term aid. The religious treatment is also
successful with a highly significant positive effect on both perceptions that the recipients
are religious and perceptions that the recipients are Republican.
   Row (i) shows that describing Tuscaloosa as having Republican leanings significantly
increases perceptions that the recipients are Republican. Row (j) presents the effects of
stating that the city of Tuscaloosa is economically advantaged. As expected, this
treatment has a highly significant positive effect on the perceived incomes of Tuscaloosa
residents (col. 11), and it even affects the perceived income of the charity recipients (col.



                                             10
9). It also causes respondents to perceive a significantly lower fraction of city residents
who are black-minus-white (column 10) and an insignificantly lower fraction of charity
recipients who are black-minus-white (column 1). Finally, this treatment has a significant
negative effect on perceptions that the recipients are Republican (col. 8).
     Lastly, the row labeled “Black respondent” shows that in many columns, black
respondents have significantly different perceptions than non-black respondents about
charity recipients and Tuscaloosa residents. Compared to whites, black respondents
perceive significantly fewer black charity recipients (col. 1) and perceive recipients as
significantly more worthy (col. 2a-2c), but also less likely to be Republican (col. 8) and
less economically advantaged (col. 9). Black respondents also perceive a significantly
lower annual income for Tuscaloosa residents than whites perceive (col. 11).
     Table 3 breaks out the sample by respondent race to further investigate the effects of
our race and worthiness treatments on perceptions of the race and worthiness of the
charity recipients. We present results for the whole sample (col. 1), the sample of non-
black respondents (col. 2), and the sample of black respondents (col. 3). Column 4
presents the results for the whole sample from a regression that includes an interaction
term between respondent race and the race treatment and an interaction term between
respondent race and the number of worthiness treatments. In this table, we use composite
measures of the worthiness treatments and the worthiness perceptions. Recall from Table
2 that the worthiness treatments had effects on worthiness perceptions in the expected
directions. Our composite measures of worthiness treatments and perceptions help us
summarize these effects more compactly and give us more statistical power.
     Our composite measure of worthiness treatments is the average number of worthiness
treatments that the respondent was exposed to. There are four audio worthiness
treatments: i) that poverty in Tuscaloosa is caused by bad choices, ii) that poverty in
Tuscaloosa is caused by circumstances beyond individual control, iii) that the charity’s
recipients are law-abiding, and iv) that the charity’s recipients are willing to share their
own aid.10 Our derived measure of the mean of these treatments ranges from zero to one,



10
  The treatments not included in this measure were designed to manipulate perceptions other than
worthiness – namely, perceptions about financial need and perceptions about background characteristics
that we hypothesized might lead to social group loyalty.


                                                   11
decreases by .25 for those who are assigned to (i) and increases by .25 for each of the
conditions (ii), (iii) and (iv) to which a respondent is assigned.
     Our composite measure of worthiness perceptions is the average of the responses to
the five worthiness perceptions questions. There were five worthiness perceptions
questions; namely the percentage of the charity’s recipients who i) are poor mainly
because of bad choices (reverse coded), ii) are poor because of reasons beyond individual
control, iii) are willing to work hard in order to get ahead in life, iv) have a criminal
record (reverse coded), and v) are willing to share their own aid.11 Our composite
measure of worthiness perceptions is the average of these questions and ranges from zero
to 100.
     Panel A presents regressions where the outcome variable is perceptions of the fraction
of charity recipients who are black minus the fraction white. In every column of Panel A,
the black photo treatment has a highly significant positive effect on the perceived fraction
of charity recipients who are black-minus-white, with effects ranging from 21 to 29
percentage points. This confirms our conclusion from Table 2 that the race treatment
successfully manipulated perceptions of race. The second row of Panel A presents the
effect of the number of worthiness treatments on the racial perception variable. In the
sample of black respondents, the number of worthiness perceptions has a marginally
significant positive effect at the ten-percent level on the perceived percentage of black-
minus-white aid recipients, while this effect is negative, but insignificant, for white
respondents. Column 4 shows a significant interaction between the number of worthiness
manipulations and respondent race, which indicates that the effect of the worthiness
treatments is significantly different for black and non-black respondents. According to
this interaction effect, people are more likely to think of worthy recipients as coming
from their own racial group. This constitutes the first component of evidence for our first
main finding, namely the existence of racial bias in perceptions.
     Panel B presents regressions where the outcome variable is perceptions of the
worthiness of the charity recipients. The first row shows that among non-blacks, black


11
  The perceptions measures not included in this worthiness perceptions measure correspond to treatment
conditions not included in the worthiness manipulation measure. These perceptions questions were
designed to check the effectiveness of treatments intended to manipulate financial need and background
characteristics other than worthiness.


                                                   12
photos have a highly significant negative effect on the perception of worthiness. In
contrast, among blacks, black photos have a small and insignificant effect on the
perception of worthiness. Moreover, column 4 shows that the interaction between
respondent race and the black photo treatment is statistically significant. That is, black
respondents seeing black photos rate aid recipients as more worthy than non-black
respondents do, and this difference is statistically significant. This interaction effect
mirrors the finding in Panel A of a significant interaction effect between respondent race
and the number of worthiness treatments on race perceptions, and constitutes the second
component of evidence for our first main finding, namely the existence of racial bias in
perceptions. Row 2 of Panel B shows that in all columns, the worthiness treatments have
significant positive effects on the perceived worthiness of the recipients, confirming our
conclusion from Table 2 that our treatment successfully manipulated worthiness
perceptions. In addition, non-black respondents’ perceptions of worthiness are
significantly more sensitive to our worthiness manipulations than the perceptions of black
respondents, which would be consistent with non-blacks’ being less familiar with aid
recipients, and therefore having weaker priors about them.
   Table 3 establishes our first main result – the existence of racial group loyalty bias in
perceptions of worthiness of the recipients. Panel A shows that blacks who hear that the
recipients are worthy are more likely than non-blacks who hear the same information to
perceive that the recipients shown in the photos are black. Analogously, Panel B shows
that blacks view black recipients as more worthy than white recipients while non-blacks
view white recipients as more worthy. These findings are consistent with findings from
the social categorization literature in social psychology suggesting that people tend to
hold out-group members individually responsible for their own poor outcomes while
people tend to attribute poor outcomes of “in-group” members to adverse external
circumstances (Brewer and Miller 1996).
     In the following sub-section we will examine the effects of our treatments on giving.
We will show that while there are robust significant effects of the worthiness treatments
on giving, there is no effect of recipient race on giving. Thus, while we find a form of
racial group loyalty in perceptions about the worthiness of recipients, this bias does not
translate into racial group loyalty in donations.



                                              13
3.2. Treatment effects on giving


Table 4 presents OLS regressions of giving in our experiment on our treatment conditions
and demographic controls. The first column presents the effects of each treatment
condition in the whole sample. The first row shows that the effect of the black photos is
-$2.2 with a standard error of $2.3. This treatment effect is less than 4% of the mean offer
of $59 (see Table 1). The 95%-confidence interval on this effect is -$6.7 to $2.3. Thus, at
this level of confidence, we cannot rule out a negative effect of black photos of 11% of
the $59 mean. The next four rows of coefficients along with standard errors in column 1
present the effects of the worthiness treatments. When the worthiness treatments are
included separately, their effects are generally in the expected direction, but only the
“shares own aid with others” treatment has a statistically significant effect on giving.
Finally, the remaining treatment conditions have small and statistically insignificant
effects.
    In the second column, we show the effect of the average of the four worthiness
treatments rather than showing the effect of each worthiness treatment separately. We
find that the combined effect of the worthiness treatments is positive and significant at
the five-percent level. Respondents who hear four worthiness treatments describing the
recipients as worthy give, on average, $11.0 more than those who hear the four
alternative treatments that describe recipients as unworthy. This establishes our second
main result, namely that there is a causal effect of perceived worthiness on giving.
    Columns 3 and 4 present the same regression as in column 2, but separately for non-
black and black respondents, respectively. In both columns the effect of black photos is
small and statistically insignificant, but relatively precisely estimated. The effect of the
worthiness treatments is positive and statistically significant for non-black respondents
but negative and not statistically significant for black respondents. This null finding
among blacks may reflect the fact that, among blacks, the number of worthiness
treatments has a weaker effect on worthiness perceptions than among non-blacks (see
Table 3). None of the other treatment effects are significant at the 5 percent level.




                                              14
     Finally, column 5 presents a regression of giving on the same variables as in columns
3 and 4 but with interaction effects included, using the whole sample. As with the other
regressions, this column shows a small, statistically insignificant, and relatively precisely
estimated effect of the race treatment. The combined effect of the worthiness treatments
is $13.4 and is significant at the five-percent level. Neither of the interaction effects and
none of the other treatment effects are significant at the five-percent level or better.12
This column establishes our third main result – the absence of significant racial bias in
giving. Both the main effect of the black picture treatment and the interaction effect of
the black picture treatment with black respondent are relatively small in magnitude, and
neither is statistically significant. The main effect, which is more precisely estimated than
the interaction effect, indicates that non-black respondents give -$2.3 less after seeing
black pictures, with a 95%-confidence interval from -$7.3 to $2.8. The interaction effect
of $0.4 indicates that the reaction of black respondents to the black picture treatments is
almost identical to the reaction of non-blacks, though the standard error of $5.3 limits our
ability to detect moderate amounts of racial bias.
     Table 5 examines the effects of race and worthiness perceptions (as opposed to
treatments) on giving. The independent variables here are identical to the dependent
variables in Table 3 and are measured on scales from 0 to 100. Columns 1 and 3 present
OLS regressions of giving on the perceived fraction of welfare recipients who are black-
minus-white and the average response to the five worthiness perceptions questions,
controlling for the other treatments and demographic variables. Note that these measures
may be endogenous to respondents’ donation decisions because i) perceptions may have
formed in response to unobserved variables that also affect giving and ii) we measure
perceptions after respondents decide how much to give to the recipients so stated
preferences may to some extent merely reflect behavior rather than cause it. Thus, in

12
  There is a marginally significant negative interaction effect between the number of worthiness treatments
and respondent race in column (4), corresponding to the finding in columns (2) and (3) that among non-
blacks there is a significant positive effect of the number of worthiness treatments while among blacks,
there is no significant effect. This is analogous to findings reported elsewhere that groups with lower
socioeconomic status, including non-whites compared to whites, place a lower monetary value on
redistributing resources on the basis of recipient “worthiness” (Corneo and Fong 2008). This lower
monetary value of justice for non-whites and other low SES groups is driven by the finding that the effect
of beliefs that bad choices (rather than bad luck) cause poverty on opposition to redistribution is smaller in
absolute value for non-whites and other lower-SES groups than it is for whites and other higher-SES
groups.


                                                     15
columns 2 and 4, we present instrumental variables estimates of the effects of exogenous
race and worthiness perceptions. Here, we instrument the race and worthiness perceptions
measures with the black photo treatment and the worthiness treatments.
   Columns 1 and 2 present the OLS and IV estimates in the sample of non-blacks. We
use this sample because we found that both the race and worthiness treatments had
statistically significant effects on the corresponding perceptions measures in Table 3
among non-blacks (in the black sample, only the race treatment had significant effects).
Additionally, only in the non-black sample did the worthiness treatments have a
significant effect on giving in Table 4. Finally, an important policy concern is non-black
discrimination against blacks. We have greater statistical power to detect such an effect in
the sample of non-blacks than in the whole sample.
   Columns 1 and 2 of Table 5 indicate that the effects of both endogenous and
exogenous perceptions of recipient race on giving are close to zero and statistically
insignificant. If the perceived fraction of recipients who are black minus the perceived
fraction who are white increases by ten percentage points, giving in our experiment is
unchanged in column (1) with a 95%-confidence interval of -$0.8 to $0.8. In column 2, a
ten-percentage point increase in our racial perceptions measure increases giving by $0.7
with a 95%-confidence interval of -$2.1 to $3.6. Recall that these results are from giving
out of a total amount of $100, where the mean gift is about $60. In contrast, both the OLS
and the IV estimates of the worthiness perceptions are positive and significant (at the
one- and five-percent levels, respectively). The IV estimate is noteworthy in at least two
respects. First, it allows us to scale the effect of the worthiness treatments in terms of
worthiness perceptions, and this reveals that the treatment effect is large in economic
terms: a ten percentage point increase in the average perceived worthiness of recipients
increases giving by $8.6. Second, the IV estimate is larger than the OLS estimate. Our
interpretation of this finding is that the worthiness perceptions measures are likely poorly
measured. If there is measurement error, then the OLS estimates are biased toward zero.
The IV estimates, in contrast, do not suffer from attenuation bias induced by
measurement error. Thus, our IV estimates address both the endogeneity and
measurement error problems that are likely to be present in the OLS estimates.




                                              16
    Columns 3 and 4 present OLS and IV estimates in the whole sample, with the race
and worthiness perceptions measures interacted with respondent race. The first two rows
show the effects of the race and worthiness perceptions on giving among non-blacks. As
expected, both the OLS and IV estimates are similar to those of columns 1 and 2. The
third and fourth rows present the interactions between the perceptions variables and a
dummy for a black respondent. The interaction terms show that the effects of the
perceptions variables among blacks are smaller than these same effects among non-
blacks, but these differences are not statistically significant.


3.3. Robustness checks


In Table 6, we investigate the robustness of the two main results from Table 4 – namely
that recipient race has a statistically insignificant effect on giving and that the combined
effect of our worthiness manipulations has a significant positive effect. As before, we
focus on the results for non-blacks because (i) this sample provides the most statistical
power to detect racial bias in giving against blacks and (ii) the effect of worthiness on
giving was driven by the non-black subsample. Each row of Table 6 presents a single
regression of giving in our experiment on the black photo treatment and the average
number of worthiness treatments. The first row reproduces the regression that was
presented in column 3 of Table 4. Using the sample of non-black respondents, this
baseline regresses giving in our experiment on the black photo treatment, the average
number of worthiness treatments, dummies for the remaining treatments, and
demographic controls. Each subsequent row presents a regression that is identical to the
baseline regression in all but one respect. The second row is identical to the first except
that it uses the whole sample. The third row uses whites only. The specifications and
samples in rows 4 and 5 are the same as in row 1, except that they use ordered probit and
censored regression, respectively. Rows 6 and 7 are the same as row 1 except that row 6
omits the demographic controls while row 7 includes additional controls. The additional
controls included in row 7 are the perceived effectiveness of the charity (measured as the
fraction of dollars donated to the charity that reach needy recipients), the self-reported
importance of “helping others in need”, and the self-reported importance of “earning a lot



                                              17
of money”. These additional controls are not included in our baseline regression because
they could be endogenous. Rows 8, 9, and 10 are the same as row 1 except that the
dependent variables are, respectively, hypothetical giving, self-reported preference for
government spending on the poor in Tuscaloosa, and self-reported preference for
charitable spending on the poor in Tuscaloosa.
    The first column of Table 6 presents the effect of the black photo treatment in each of
these regressions. In every case, the effect of the race treatment is small and statistically
insignificant. Column 2 presents the effects of the average number of worthiness
treatments. In rows 1-7, where the dependent variable is giving in the experiment, the
effect of the number of worthiness treatments is positive and significant at the five- or
one-percent level. In the OLS regressions where the outcome variable is giving, the
magnitude of the effect of hearing four worthiness treatments compared to hearing none
of them ranges from $11 to $16; while in the censored regression, the magnitude is $25.4.
In rows 8-10, the outcome variables are the non-behavioral measures of generosity to
charity recipients. The number of worthiness manipulations has a significant effect on
support for government spending on the poor in Tuscaloosa (row 9), but no significant
effect on hypothetical charitable giving (row 8). The effect of the number of worthiness
manipulations on self-reported preferences for charitable spending on the poor in
Tuscaloosa (row 10) was just short of marginally significant with a p-value of 0.104.
Recall that for these alternative dependent variables, there is no evidence of racial bias,
either.


3.4. External validity check


How well might the results of our experiment generalize to natural giving outside of the
experiment? One way to investigate the external validity of our result is to estimate the
extent to which giving in our experiment corresponds to total charitable giving in the
previous calendar year. In unreported results, we find that total charitable giving in 2005
has a statistically significant positive effect on giving in the experiment. However, a
drawback of this simple regression is that measurement error in charitable giving leads
attenuation bias in the estimated effect. Hence, it does not provide a good estimate of the



                                              18
sensitivity of giving in the experiment to total charitable giving. As a validity check that
circumvents attenuation bias from measurement error, we investigate whether
demographic characteristics that predict total charitable giving in 2005 similarly predict
giving in our experiment. Table 7 presents this analysis.
   Column 1 regresses giving during our experiment measured in dollars on respondent
demographic characteristics. Column 2 regresses a transformed measure of total
charitable giving in 2005 on the same demographic characteristics included in column 1.
To make the dependent measures in columns 1 and 2 comparable, we first topcode total
charitable giving in 2005 at $500 so that the fraction of people giving the maximum
amount is equal across the two measures. Then we divide total charitable giving in 2005
by 5 so that both giving measures range from zero to 100. The key result from columns 1
and 2 is that the explanatory power of the demographic variables is higher in column 2
than in column 1. Moreover, the coefficients in column 2 tend to have a larger absolute
value than the coefficients in column 1, and the percent of the variation in giving that is
explained by the demographic variables is roughly two times higher in column 2 (R2 =
.208) than in column 1 (R2 = .098). This is a first indication that giving during the
experiment is somewhat less responsive to demographics that actual past charitable
giving.
   The regressions in columns 1 and 2 show that the demographic variables tend to have
effects in the same direction on giving in our experiment and on past charitable giving;
we do not see any demographic variables that have a significant positive effect in one of
the columns and a significant negative effect in the other. However, since many of the
demographic variables are highly correlated with each other, we investigate this general
pattern in more detail in columns (3) and (4). We predict each type of giving with the
demographic variables and then estimate the effect of: i) predicted total charitable giving
in 2005 on actual giving during the experiment (column 3) and ii) predicted giving during
the experiment on actual total charitable giving in 2005 (column 4). That is, we regress
each type of giving on the linear combination of demographic variables that best predicts
the other type of giving. This is a check of how well the combination of demographic
variables that best explains one type of giving explains the other type of giving.




                                             19
   Column 3 shows that if predicted charitable giving in 2005 increases by one, then
actual giving in our experiment increases by $0.43. That is, giving in the experiment is
43% as responsive as past charitable giving to the demographics that predict charitable
giving. Column 4 estimates this responsiveness by regressing charitable giving in 2005
on predicted giving in the experiment. This estimate says that past charitable giving is
118% as responsive as giving in our experiment to the demographic variables that predict
giving in the experiment, or, inversely, that giving in the experiment is 85% as responsive
to the demographic variables as past charitable giving. In summary, giving in our
experiment is somewhere between 43% and 85% as sensitive to the demographic
variables as charitable giving in the real world. These results suggest that perceptions of
the worthiness of the poor may also have a greater effect on charitable giving in the real
world than they had on giving during the experiment.


4. Conclusion


In this paper, we presented the results from an experiment that examines how charitable
giving to the poor responds to the perceived race and worthiness of charity recipients.
The experiment was conducted on a sample of about 1000 respondents that is broadly
representative of the U.S. adult population. We showed an audiovisual presentation about
a charity, the charity’s recipients, and the city in which recipients were located to
manipulate respondents’ perceptions of recipient race and worthiness. Following the
presentation, the respondents decided how to distribute $100 between themselves and the
charity. Subsequently, we asked the respondents about their perceptions of the race and
worthiness of the charity’s recipients, which confirmed that our treatments successfully
manipulated the respondents’ perceptions.
   The experiment yielded three main results. First, we find a racial group loyalty effect
on perceptions: respondents rate recipients as more worthy when shown pictures of
recipients from their own racial group, and conversely, they perceive a higher fraction of
recipients from their own racial group if the audio story describes recipients in more
worthy terms. Second, respondents give significantly more if our audio treatment causes
them to perceive the recipients as more worthy. Moreover, this effect is also large in



                                             20
economic terms; audio treatments that raise the perceived fraction of worthy recipients by
10 percentage points cause the respondents to increase their giving by $7.2 relative to a
mean level of giving of $58.7. Third, we find no significant racial bias in giving. The race
of the recipients shown in the pictures, while highly influential on race perceptions, did
not significantly affect giving in the whole sample or in subsamples by respondent race.
Moreover, black and non-black respondents also did not respond significantly differently
in their giving upon to seeing pictures of black recipients. However, given the statistical
precision of our estimates, we cannot rule out a moderate amount of racial bias, but we
can rule out at the 5% level that seeing pictures of black recipients causes non-black
respondents to decrease giving by more than $7.4 on a mean of $60.0.
   We do not believe that our failure to find racial discrimination in giving contradicts
prior evidence of discrimination and racial group loyalty. There are at least three reasons
for this. First, our evidence is from a different time period than prior evidence on racial
effects in individual demands for redistribution. It is possible that racial effects may be
lower now simply because racism in general has been decreasing over time in the United
States. Racial effects may also be lower now than at other times because of domain-
specific reasons: Much of the evidence of racial discrimination in redistributive politics in
the United States comes from times when there was public anger about the former AFDC
program and debate about welfare reform (see, e.g., Gilens 1999). It seems plausible that
during politically turbulent times in countries where racial minorities belong to lower
socioeconomic classes, racial discrimination can flare up naturally or even be
manufactured by political entrepreneurs (Glaeser 2005). Second, there may be racial
discrimination in individual demands for redistribution that our study does not detect.
Our results are not precise enough to rule out moderate amounts of racial discrimination.
Furthermore, despite the methodological advantages of our study – namely, using
randomly varied perceptions as the independent variables and real behavior as the
outcome variable – there are some disadvantages. In particular, respondents in our study
were forced to make their donation decisions in a somewhat artificial setting, and they
may have also suspected that they were being studied. Both of these factors may have
affected our results. Third, even if there were currently no racial biases in individual
charitable behavior and individual demands for redistribution, it seems likely that racial



                                             21
inequality in socioeconomic outcomes would persist as a legacy from prior
discrimination. That is, merely avoiding discriminatory behavior in one instance, or even
ending it more broadly, seems unlikely to erase the cumulative effects of prior
discrimination. Thus, a lack of racial discrimination in our research does not imply that
racial discrimination in society has been eradicated or that racial inequality is a smaller
problem than previously thought.

[Respondents view second pair of pictures, again shown side by side. The first picture shows a person
entering a thrift store. This person is black in the black picture treatment and white otherwise. The second
picture shows two individuals, one black and one white, inside the thrifts store. Respondents hear the
following audio text.]

The Poor in Tuscaloosa
Many poor people in Tuscaloosa receive both welfare from the government and food and other goods from a
variety of charities.

[If REASON FOR POVERTY BEYOND CONTROL=0 and REASON FOR POVERTY BAD CHOICE=1]:
        Many of these people use welfare and charitable assistance because of bad choices in their personal
        lives such as lack of effort or substance abuse.

        Generally the recipients are unhappy about their situation and wish they had more money.

        Many of them wish they could rely on more generous assistance from the government and charities.

[If REASON FOR POVERTY BEYOND CONTROL=1 and REASON FOR POVERTY BAD CHOICE=0]:
        Many of these people use welfare and charitable assistance because of circumstances beyond their
        control such as bad luck.

        Generally the recipients are unhappy about their situation and wish they had more money.

        Many of them try to get a job that pays enough for them to stand on their own feet and no longer rely on
        assistance from the government and charities.

[If REASON FOR POVERTY BEYOND CONTROL=0 and REASON FOR POVERTY BAD CHOICE=0]:
        The reasons why these people use government welfare and charitable assistance vary widely. Often it is
        a mixture of factors including bad choices in their personal lives such as lack of effort or substance abuse,
        and circumstances beyond their control such as bad luck.

        Generally the recipients are unhappy about their situation and wish they had more money.

[Note the combination REASON FOR POVERTY BEYOND CONTROL=1 and REASON FOR POVERTY BAD
CHOICE=1 does not occur]

[RELIGIOUS]:
        0. [NOTHING SAID]
        1. Many of them pray to God regularly to ask Him for help.

      time.
      1. It provides food and other goods to the poor, many of whom only use this kind of help for short periods
      of time when it is absolutely necessary.

[CURRENTLY WORKING]:
      0. Providing enough assistance is more difficult on the busy days just before many people will receive
      their next government benefit check.

                                                         27
           1. Providing enough assistance is more difficult on the busy days just before many people will receive
           their next paycheck.

[WILLING TO SHARE OWN AID WITH OTHERS]:

        in line for assistance.
        1. During these busy days, many of the usual recipients get worried, but they are willing to share some of
        their allotment with others in need.

[Respondents view third pair of pictures, again shown side by side. Both pictures are of people receiving
aid from [CHARITY]. Under the black picture treatment, all individuals shown are black. Otherwise, all
individuals shown are white. Respondents hear the following audio text.]

The people that receive help from [CHARITY]

PART II. DECISION-MAKING TASK

Decision-making task
Now, you are going to make a decision involving [CHARITY] in Tuscaloosa. Please note that all information we
give you is true and all payments will be made exactly as stated. Please think carefully about your decision
because one out of every 10 participants in this study will have his or her decision carried out with real money.
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
We will give $100 to one out of every 10 participants in this study. We ask you to decide in advance how much of
this $100, if any, you would like to give to [CHARITY] in Tuscaloosa. You can give any amount you wish, including
nothing. If you are selected, this $100 is yours, and you are free to keep or to give away any amount you wish,
including nothing. While many people give some away, we expect that most people will keep at least some of this
amount for themselves.

If you are randomly selected to receive $100, we will send the amount that you want to donate, if any, to
[CHARITY] in Tuscaloosa. The amount that you decide to keep for yourself will be credited to your Knowledge
Networks account (you get 1000 bonus points for each dollar you decide to keep).

If you decide to donate money, [CHARITY] in Tuscaloosa will mail you a note to confirm that we sent them exactly
the amount you specified.
───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
The random selection works as follows. If the first number of the Pick3 draw of the Louisiana State Lottery on
[LOTTERYDATE] is [LOTTERYNUMBER], then we will carry out your decision. Because numbers in the Pick3 game
lie between 0 and 9, you have a 1 in 10 chance that we will carry out your decision. If you wish, you will be able to
find the winning number on http://www.louisianalottery.com. However, this is not necessary. If your number is
drawn, we will automatically carry out your decision.

for poverty bad choices (reverse coded), reasons for poverty beyond control, willing to work, possessing a criminal record (reverse coded), and
willing to share own aid. The controls for other treatments consist of the following six treatment variables: short-term need for aid, currently
working, religious, city republican, city economically advantaged, and salvation army. The demographic controls consist of the variables listed under
the heading “control variables” in Table 1. In the IV regressions, race perceptions and worthiness perceptions are instrumented by the black picture
treatment and by the number of worthiness treatments. The sample in columns (1) and (2) is limited to non-black respondents while the sample in
columns (3) and (4) consists of the total sample.

Table 4. All other regressions are identical to the baseline regression except for the change noted in the first column. The additional controls in row 7 consist of:
the perceived effectiveness of the charity (measured as fraction of dollars donated to charity reaching needy recipients), the self-reported importance of “helping
others in need,” and the self-reported importance of “earning a lot of money.”

and (3) is the number of dollars given during the experiment (out of $100). The dependent variable in columns (2)
and (4) is a transformed measure of total self-reported charitable giving in 2005. To make the scale of the charitable
giving variable comparable to the scale of giving during the experiment, we topcode charitable giving at $500 so
that the fraction of individuals giving the maximum amount is equal. Next, we divide the charitable giving variable
by 5, so that both dependent variables are measured on a 0-100 scale. The variable Predicted Charitable Giving is
the amount predicted by the regression in column (2). The variable Predicted Giving in Experiment is the amount
predicted by the regression in column (1).
