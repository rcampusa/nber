Can Competitiveness predict Education and Labor Market Outcomes? Evidence from Incentivized
Choice and Survey Measures

                                          ABSTRACT

We assess the predictive power of two measures of competitiveness for education and labor
market outcomes using a large, representative survey panel. The first is incentivized and is an
online adaptation of the laboratory-based Niederle-Vesterlund measure. The second is an
unincentivized survey question eliciting general competitiveness on an 11-point scale. Both
measures are strong and consistent predictors of income, occupation, completed level of education
and field of study. The predictive power of the new unincentivized measure for these outcomes is
robust to controlling for other traits, including risk attitudes, confidence and the Big Five
personality traits. For most outcomes, the predictive power of competitiveness exceeds that of the
other traits. Gender differences in competitiveness can explain 5-10 percent of the observed gender
differences in education and labor market outcomes.

1       Introduction
A growing literature documents the importance of individual traits such as conscientiousness and
grit in determining education and labor market outcomes (Heckman and Rubinstein, 2001; Heck-
man, Stixrud, and Urzua, 2006; Mueller and Plug, 2006; Borghans et al., 2008; Almlund et al.,
2011). We contribute to this literature by focusing on competitiveness, a trait emerging from the
experimental economics literature. A number of recent studies indicate that individual preferences
for competition are strongly associated with educational choices and early labor market outcomes
(Buser, Niederle, and Oosterbeek, 2014; Reuben, Sapienza, and Zingales, 2015).1 These studies
follow a large literature based on laboratory experiments documenting individual heterogeneity
in competitiveness (Gneezy, Niederle, and Rustichini, 2003; Niederle and Vesterlund, 2007). Es-
pecially the gender gap in competitiveness found in the laboratory has attracted much interest
because of its potential to explain gender differences in education and labor market outcomes
(Bertrand, 2011).
    Studies exploring the relevance of individual competitiveness for shaping careers typically link
choices in incentivized experiments conducted in a laboratory or classroom setting to subsequent
career choices and outcomes.2 This makes data collection expensive and logistically cumbersome.
As a consequence, most studies use relatively small samples of students (or other selective groups
which can be physically captured in one spot) and link the experimental data to short-term or
medium-term outcomes. To take this literature forward, we elicit competitiveness through two
measures that can be administered outside the laboratory setting. The first measure is incentivized
and is an adaptation of the setup of the original Niederle-Vesterlund experiment such that it can
be administered online. The second measure is an unincentivized survey question inspired by the
work of Dohmen et al. (2011) and Falk et al. (2016) on other economic preferences.
    This allows us to make the following main contributions. First, we show that willingness to com-
pete as measured by an incentivized choice experiment strongly predicts earnings and occupation
    1
      Buser, Niederle, and Oosterbeek (2014) and Buser, Peter, and Wolter (2017) show that an incentivized measure
of competitiveness predicts specializing in more prestigious and math-heavy subjects for Dutch and Swiss students
from the pre-university track of secondary school. Reuben, Sapienza, and Zingales (2015) show the same for
the starting salaries and industry choices of MBA graduates. Other studies find that competitiveness predicts
participating in a competitive high school entrance exam (Zhang, 2012), investment choices of entrepreneurs (Berge
et al., 2015), choosing an ambitious college track in high-school (Almås et al., 2016), future salary expectations of
undergraduate students (Reuben, Wiswall, and Zafar, 2017), and career choices at the vocational education level
(Buser, Peter, and Wolter, 2018). Flory, Leibbrandt, and List (2015) and Samek (2019) run field experiments
recruiting people for real jobs and show that compensation schemes which depend on relative performance deter
women from applying relative to men.
    2
      These studies commonly measure competitiveness using the design of Niederle and Vesterlund (2007), where
participants choose between piece-rate and tournament incentives for their performance in a real-effort task. Com-
petitiveness is then measured as the choice for tournament incentives conditional on prior performance on the task
(and, sometimes, measures of confidence and risk attitudes). This literature has focused mainly on gender differ-
ences. Niederle and Vesterlund (2007) find that men are much more likely to compete than women. Their result
has been replicated many times (see Niederle, 2016, Niederle and Vesterlund, 2011 and Croson and Gneezy, 2009
for surveys).

conditional on education level, as well as education level and college major choice in a representa-
tive sample. Second, we show that our unincentivized survey question predicts the same outcomes
in the same sample with comparable predictive power. Third, we show that our survey measure of
competitiveness predicts these outcomes over and above other unincentivized trait measures that
the education economics literature has typically focused on, including risk seeking, confidence and
the big five personality traits, indicating that competitiveness is a separate influential trait that
is not captured by these other, more traditionally used traits. Our new, validated questionnaire
measure will enable researchers in all social science fields to measure this trait in large scale sur-
veys, opening new avenues for exploring individual and group differences in competitiveness, their
origins, and their consequences for career choices and labor market outcomes.
    Our questionnaire measure is inspired by the seminal work of Dohmen et al. (2011) on risk
preferences and consists of the question "How competitive do you consider yourself to be?", where
respondents pick a number on a scale from zero to ten. We included this measure, as well as an
incentivized choice experiment based on the design of Niederle and Vesterlund (2007), in two of
the monthly rounds of an online survey panel which is representative of the Dutch population.
The survey question was included in one of the waves in 2017 and was sent to all members of
the panel. The incentivized measure was included in one of the waves in 2018 and was sent to
a random subsample of the respondents of the survey question. Because there was a full year
and several unrelated survey rounds in between the two waves, it is unlikely that participants in
the incentivized experiment were aware of the connection between the experiment and the survey
question.
    Eliciting our competitiveness measures in this panel allows us to leverage the rich information
that has already been collected from the panel participants. Besides data on education and la-
bor market outcomes, the dataset also contains information about many individual traits such as
confidence, self-esteem and the big five personality traits (extroversion, agreeableness, conscien-
tiousness, stability and intellectual openness). To this, we added a measure of risk preferences
(Dohmen et al., 2011). We can therefore investigate whether competitiveness predicts education
and labor market variables on top of these other traits. Moreover, we can compare the predictive
power of competitiveness to that of the other personality traits. This data also allows us to vali-
date our survey question not only by computing its correlation with the incentivized choice at the
individual level but also by checking whether both measures predict relevant career outcomes in a
similar way.
    Several papers in psychology have developed scales to measure aspects of competitiveness
(Griffin-Pierson, 1990; Ryckman et al., 1990; Smither and Houston, 1992; Houston et al., 2002;
Newby and Klein, 2014). None of these has been widely adopted and none has, to our knowledge,
been linked to education or labor market outcomes in a large sample. Houston et al. (2015) cor-
relate their competitiveness scale with occupational interests in a sample of 149 undergraduate
students, finding a positive correlation with the corresponding O*NET rating of the occupation's

                                                  3
level of competition.3
    In economics, Bönte and Piegeler (2013) use the Eurobarometer 283 survey on entrepreneur-
ship which contains an unincentivized measure of competitiveness.4 They show this measure is
positively correlated with entrepreneurship. Bönte, Lombardo, and Urbig (2017) elicit both an
incentivized measure of competitiveness and several unincentivized questions taken from differ-
ent competitiveness scales from the psychology literature. In a sample of 186 students, they find
a significant correlation between incentivized and self-reported competitiveness. They correlate
both with interest in a managerial career and find a significant correlation with a subset of the
self-reported measures, but not with the incentivized choice. Boschini et al. (2019) collected incen-
tivized measures of competitiveness and risk preferences using telephone interviews with a random
sample of 926 people from the Swedish population. Their paper focuses on gender differences in
competitiveness and risk preferences, finding no gender difference in competitiveness when partici-
pants perform a language task and replicating the lab finding that men are more likely to compete
in a math task. Regressions of competitiveness on gender, age, age squared, income, education and
gender of the interviewer show positive conditional associations between competitiveness and in-
come and between competitiveness and education. The results do not show how strong a predictor
competitiveness is for education and income, nor can the authors condition on other personality
traits or compare the predictive power of competitiveness with that of other traits (other than risk
preferences). Fallucchi, Nosenzo, and Ernesto (2020) conducted a validation exercise to obtain
a survey measure of preference for competition on a sample of 90 students from the University
of Luxembourg. Of the eight survey questions they included, the statement "Competition brings
the best out of me" correlates highest with an incentivized competition choice elicited two weeks
later.5
    We elicit both our incentivized measure and our unincentivized measure of competitiveness in
a large and representative sample that contains a rich set of career outcomes and psychological
traits. Our results show that both measures are strong predictors of the same education and
labor market outcomes. Conditional on performance in the task, gender, age, education level,
risk preferences, confidence and the big five personality traits, individuals who compete in the
experiment earn significantly more and are much more likely to hold a high-level managerial or
professional position. Individuals who compete are also more likely to have gone to college and,
conditional on having gone to college, chose more prestigious study majors that lead to higher
salaries. We find the same effects for people who score themselves higher on competitiveness in
our new survey question. Comparing the predictive power of different traits, competitiveness is

     They further find that a group of athletes agreed more with this statement than a group of non-athletes of the
same age.

consistently among the strongest predictors. The fact that the incentivized and unincentivized
measures predict the same outcomes justifies the use of the unincentivized survey question as a
valid measure of competitiveness. This makes it possible to elicit competitiveness in large-scale
representative survey panels or cross-country surveys in the future.
    Our results also contribute to a recent discussion in experimental economics about whether
competitiveness is a separate trait capturing a preference for competition or whether it is a com-
posite measure of confidence, risk preferences and other previously studied individual traits (Gillen,
Snowberg, and Yariv, 2019; van Veldhuizen, 2017). We present results that show that competitive-
ness and risk preferences predict different outcomes. Conditional on controls including confidence
and the big five personality traits, none of the education and labor market outcomes we study
are predicted by risk attitudes. But conversely, a range of risky, but not inherently competitive
choices that were studied by Dohmen et al. (2011), such as investing in stocks, smoking or being
self-employed, are predicted by risk attitudes but not by competitiveness. Likewise, competit-
iveness tends to predict education and labor market variables more strongly than each of several
measures of confidence. We conclude that competitiveness is not well captured by either risk at-
titudes or confidence or by the big five personality traits and should therefore be considered as a
new, distinctive trait.
    With both our incentivized and our unincentivized measure, we replicate the finding of a gender
gap in competitiveness. We analyze to what extent the gender difference in competitiveness can
account for gender differences in education and labor market outcomes. Controlling for our survey
measure reduces the estimated gender gap in earnings by about 5 percent (10 percent for college-
educated individuals) and the gender differences in occupation and chosen college major by about
10 percent. These effects are higher than those obtained for most of the other traits. These
results contribute to a recent discussion on whether differences in personality and preferences can
partially explain gender differences in labor market outcomes (Bertrand, 2011; Cortes and Pan,
2018; Shurchkov and Eckel, 2018).
    A further important question is whether the positive link between competitiveness and career
outcomes hides negative sides of competitiveness. In particular, it may be that increased competi-
tiveness comes at the cost of life satisfaction, personal relationships or social orientation. However,
we find that ­ conditional on gender, age, education level, risk preferences, confidence, and the big
five personality traits ­ individuals who rate themselves as more competitive also judge themselves
to be happier and more satisfied with their lives, are less likely to take medication for depression
or anxiety, are no less likely to have a partner or be married, feel closer to other people in general,
have similar levels of trust, and give more importance to being helpful and loving.
    The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. The next section introduces the survey
and incentivized measures of competitiveness and the other variables from the LISS panel that we
use in the analysis. Section 3 presents the empirical findings in five parts. It first reports results
for the relation between the incentivized competitiveness measure and education and labor market

outcomes. It next presents similar results for the survey measure of competitiveness and compares
the predictive power of the survey measure to those of other relevant trait measures (risk attitudes,
confidence and the the big five personality traits). The third part compares competitiveness and
risk attitudes in detail. The fourth part looks at wether competitiveness is associated with personal
wellbeing and social preferences. Finally, the fifth part examines to which extent gender differences
in competitiveness can explain gender differences in education and labor market outcomes. Section
4 summarizes and concludes.


2       Data
We collected our data on the Dutch LISS panel (Longitudinal Internet Studies for the Social
sciences), an ongoing online survey panel. The panel has been in full operation since October
2007. It is based on a true probability sample of households drawn from the population register
by Statistics Netherlands (www.lissdata.nl). Panel members answer to yearly repeated "core"
questionnaires which cover a large range of topics including work, education, wealth, family and,
importantly for our purposes, personality. On top of this, researchers can pay to run questionnaires
on the panel, including incentivized experiments, which can then be linked to all other data that
is available on the respondents. All LISS data, including researcher-run questionnaires, is publicly
available to all researchers.
    The timeline of our data collection is as follows. In March 2017, we collected two survey
measures of competitiveness, as well as measures of risk preferences and of confidence. This ques-
tionnaire was aimed at all panel members. A year later, in April 2018, we ran the incentivized
choice experiment on a subsample which represents a random selection of working-age panel mem-
bers. In this section, we explain the measures we collected, the trait measures already present in
the LISS questionnaires, and the education and labor market variables.


2.1     Survey measure of competitiveness
In March 2017, we included two survey questions in the LISS panel aimed at eliciting respondents'
competitiveness. The first question, which is the one we use for our main analyses, asks respon-
dents about their general competitiveness through the question "How competitive do you consider
yourself to be? Please choose a value on the scale below, where the value 0 means 'not competitive
at all' and the value 10 means 'very competitive'." This question is a variation on the general
risk preference question validated in Dohmen et al. (2011).6 The second question describes the
experimental design of Niederle and Vesterlund (2007) and asks respondents whether they would
choose piece rate or tournament compensation in the hypothetical case that they would participate
    6
    Their question reads "How do you see yourself: Are you a person who is generally willing to take risks, or do
you try to avoid taking risks?" The answering scale runs from 0 (completely unwilling) to 10 (completely willing).


                                                        6
in this choice experiment.7 We also asked the general risk preference question of Dohmen et al.
(2011), and ­ to measure confidence on the task­ we elicited how well the respondents think they
would perform in the Niederle-Vesterlund numbers task compared to other panel members.8 The
survey was answered by 5255 individuals, 3082 of whom are between 25 and 65 years old. This
corresponds to a response rate of 86%.
    From our analysis of the data, we conclude that the general question results in a better measure
of competitiveness than the hypothetical choice question. Both are correlated significantly with
the incentivized measure but the general measure shows stronger associations with education
and labor market variables.9 For readability we will therefore, in the main text, only report
results based on the general competitiveness question. Results for the hypothetical competitiveness
question are very similar and are reported in Appendix B. There, we also show that while the first,
simpler measure, predicts outcomes better, predictive power can still be meaningfully increased by
including both measures jointly.


2.2     Incentivized choice experiment
In the original Niederle-Vesterlund choice experiment (Niederle and Vesterlund, 2007), subjects are
seated behind computer screens in a laboratory to perform the same task during three subsequent
rounds. In the first round they are paid for their performance through a piece rate. In the second
round they are paid in the form of a winner-takes-all tournament. For the third round, subjects
have to choose whether they want to be compensated in the form of a piece rate or a tournament.
The task that subjects perform in this original experiment is to add up sets of five two-digit
numbers. The instructions tell the participants that the use of a calculator is not allowed.
    The advantage that the use of a calculator gives on this particular task makes it unattractive
for an online version of the experiment. The alternative task that we use here is to find the two
numbers that add up to 100 in a 3 × 3 matrix of 9 two-digit numbers (see Figure 1). There were
three rounds of two minutes, during which participants could solve as many matrices as possible.
One of the three rounds was randomly chosen for payment ex post. Before the start of the three
   7
      The exact phrasing reads as follows: "Imagine the following hypothetical scenario. You participate in an
experiment where you are paid for your performance in a simple task. This task consists in adding up sets of
five two-digit numbers without the help of a calculator (so, for example, 43+82+11+94+68=?). You have five
minutes to solve as many problems of this type as you can. You have to choose how you want to be paid for your
performance in this task: Option 1: Piece rate: you receive 1 Euro for each correctly solved problem; Option 2:
Competition: you compete against 3 other people. If you perform better than all three, you receive 4 Euros per
correctly solved problem, otherwise you receive nothing. Your three opponents will be randomly selected among
the other participants of the LISS panel. Which option would you choose?"
    8
      This question was phrased as follows: "In the described task (adding up sets of five two-digit numbers) how well
do you think you would perform compared to other participants? In particular, compared to 10 randomly selected
LISS panel members, do you think you would come 1st, 2nd, 3rd, . . . , 10th?"
    9
      Moreover, in regressions of both survey measures on outcomes, the coefficient of general competitiveness is
typically unaffected by the inclusion of hypothetical competitiveness whereas the coefficient of hypothetical com-
petitiveness often becomes smaller and sometimes insignificant after the inclusion of general competitiveness.

rounds, participants had to correctly solve three practice matrices. At the start of each round,
they were informed how they would be paid if that round were to be randomly chosen for payment:

   1. Participants receive 40 cents per correctly solved matrix (piece rate).

   2. Participants receive 80 per correctly solved matrix if their score is higher than the score of a
      randomly chosen other participant and zero if their score is lower10 (tournament).

   3. Participants have to choose between the piece-rate and tournament schemes. If they choose
      the tournament, their score is compared to the score of a randomly selected other participant.
      That other participant is chosen among all participants regardless of the payment scheme
      they chose.

The third-round choice is, conditional on performance in rounds 1 and 2, our incentivized measure
of competitiveness. To measure confidence on the task, we asked how well, on a scale from 0 (the
worst) to 10 (the best), participants thought they performed compared to other participants. We
also asked what they thought their chance was of beating a randomly selected opponent.11 The
two confidence measures are very highly correlated. To measure risk attitudes, we again included
the validated risk question of Dohmen et al. (2011).
    In April 2018, we ran this incentivized choice experiment on a subsample of the LISS population.
The sample frame was a random selection of participants below 65 years of age who filled in the
previous questionnaire.12 For most of the analyses, we restrict the sample to participants who are
between 25 and 65 years old (and who have presumably finished their education). 2098 individuals
participated in the choice experiment. Due to a programming error on the part of LISS, the
program crashed halfway the choice experiment for 418 participants. Another six participants quit
the experiment before choosing a payment scheme. This leaves us with 1674 observations. Among
these, 1437 are between 25 and 65 years old. In Section 2.4, we will show that these individuals do
not differ significantly from the other members of the panel in the same age range who participated
in the survey one year earlier. They are also not different from the participants who experienced
the error.

2.3     Measures of career outcomes and other individual traits
The LISS datasets contain thousands of variables. We concentrate on four education and labor
market outcomes: how much people earn, the level of their occupation, their education level, and,
in case they went to college, which major they chose. Participants are asked about their gross
monthly income every time they answer a questionnaire. We use the measure that was collected
in the same wave as our questionnaire measures.13
    Occupation level is based on the answer to the question "What is your current profession ?".14
We divide the answers into the following levels15 :

   1. Higher academic or independent profession (e.g. architect, physician, scholar, academic
      instructor, engineer)
   2. Higher supervisory profession (e.g. manager, director, owner of large company, supervisory
      civil servant)
   3. Intermediate academic or independent profession (e.g. teacher, artist, nurse, social worker,
      policy assistant)
   4. Intermediate supervisory or commercial profession (e.g. head representative, department
      manager, shopkeeper)
   5. Other mental work (e.g. administrative assistant, accountant, sales assistant, family carer)
   6. Skilled manual (e.g. car mechanic, foreman, electrician) or semi-skilled manual (e.g. driver,
      factory worker)
   7. Unskilled (e.g. cleaner, packer) or agrarian (e.g. farm worker)
For some analyses, we group 1 and 2 into a single "high level" category which we use as a binary
outcome measure. The question is asked on a yearly basis as part of the "Work and Schooling"
core questionnaire. If available, we use the most recent measure from 2017. If a participant did
not answer the questionnaire in 2017, we use the information from 2016.
   Highest completed level of education is elicited every time somebody answers a questionnaire
and is measured in the following categories16 :

   1. Primary schooling
   2. Pre-vocational education
   3. Vocational education
   4. Upper (pre-college) tracks of secondary school
  13
      If a panel member does not enter their gross income but reports their net income, then gross income is imputed
based on net income and other variables. See https://www.dataarchive.lissdata.nl/study_units/view/322.
   14
      Or, in case a participant was currently not working, "What profession did you exercise in your last job?"
   15
      Category 6 combines the answer options "Skilled and supervisory manual work (e.g. car mechanic, foreman,
electrician)" and "Semi-skilled manual work (e.g. driver, factory worker)". Category 7 combines the answer options
"Unskilled and trained manual work (e.g. cleaner, packer)" and "Agrarian profession (e.g. farm worker, independent
agriculturalist)".

   5. University of applied sciences
   6. University

For some analyses, we group 5 and 6 into a single "college" category which we use as a binary
measure.
   For those who completed college, we divide their field of study into the following categories
based on the question "In what field did you complete your highest level of education?"

   1. Nursing
   2. Humanities and art
   3. Social and behavioral sciences
   4. Economics and business
   5. Law
   6. STEM
   7. Medicine

The fields are ordered based on the average income of individuals above age 45 in our sample who
have completed college in that field. We use this ordering in some of our analyses to see whether
competitive individuals choose study majors with better career prospects. The question is asked
on a yearly basis as part of the "Work and Schooling" core questionnaire. If available, we use the
most recent measure from 2017. If a participant did not answer the questionnaire in 2017, we use
information from 2016.17
    The "Personality" core module contains a 50-question elicitation of the big five personality
traits: extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, stability and intellectual openness (Goldberg
et al., 2006). From the same module, we use the answer to the question "I have confidence in my
capabilities" (1 = totally disagree to 7 = totally agree) as a measure of general confidence. We
also use the results from the 10-item Rosenberg self-esteem scale (Rosenberg, 1965), where each
item is scored on a seven point scale (1 = totally disagree to 7 = totally agree). If available,
we use information from the 2017 personality questionnaire. If a participant did not answer that
questionnaire, we use personality traits measured in 2014.18
  17
      When answering the question, respondents can pick one or several out of the following: 1. General or no specific
field, 2. Teacher training or education, 3. Art, 4. Humanities, 5. Social and behavioral studies, 6. Economics,
management, business administration, accountancy, 7. Law, public administration, 8. Mathematics, physics, IT,
9. Technology, 10. Agriculture, forestry, environment, 11. Medical, health services, nursing, etc., 12. Personal care
services, 13. Catering, recreation, 14. Transport, logistics, 15. Telecommunication, 16. Public order and safety. We
drop respondents who choose 1 and ignore categories 10, 12 , 13, 14, 15 and 16 which do not correspond clearly to
any college major. We group 1, 2 and 3 into Humanities and Art and 8 and 9 into STEM. We split individuals who
answer 11 into Medicine and Nursing, depending on whether they attend a university (which offer only medicine)
or university of applied sciences (which offer only nursing). We drop participants who fit more than one category
from our major-related analyses.
   18
      The Personality module was not collected in 2016. In 2015, only participants who did not answer the big five
questions in 2014 received the full big five questionnaire.

2.4    Descriptive statistics
Table 1 shows the means and standard deviations of the competitiveness measures as well as of
the LISS panel variables we use as controls and as education and labor market outcomes. The
first column reports this for the panel members who participated in the choice experiment, the
second column for respondents of the unincentivized survey questions. The samples are restricted
to individuals between 25 and 65 years old, which is the sample we use for our analyses of the
relationship between competitiveness and career outcomes. Around 40 percent of this group has
a college degree, around 17 percent holds a high-level occupation and their average gross monthly
income amounts to 2480 Euros.
    The subsample who participated in the incentivized choice experiment was randomly selected
from those who had answered the questionnaire a year earlier. Because not everybody who was
selected participated, we check whether the participants in the experiment differ in any way from
the rest of the sample. The third column of the table shows that these differences are small and
not significantly different from zero, with the exception of the proportion who completed a college
degree which is slightly (and marginally significantly) higher in the full sample compared to the
experimental sample. In column 4, we check whether the participants who were affected by the
software error differ from the majority of participants who were able to complete the experiment.
The differences are small and insignificant in all cases, indicating that the occurrence of the error
is essentially random and should not influence any of our conclusions.
    Slightly over 27 percent of the participants in the choice experiment opted for the tournament
payment instead of the piece rate. This share is lower than the shares typically reported in lab
experiments using student populations, but very similar to the 28 percent found for the math
task by Boschini et al. (2019) in their telephone interviews. The mean response to the general
competitiveness question equals 6.2. Figure 2 shows the entire distribution of this variable. Forty-
six percent of the respondents score themselves below a 7, which is the median value.
    Table A1 in the Appendix shows the correlations between the various trait measures for the
experimental sample as well as the sample as a whole. Competitiveness is positively correlated with
the confidence measures, risk seeking, extroversion, conscientiousness, stability and intellectual
openness. The correlations between competitiveness and the big 5 personality traits are stronger
for our questionnaire measure than for our binary incentivized measure. The strongest correlation
we find is between competitiveness and extroversion. We will take a closer look at the correlation
between our incentivized and unincentivized competitiveness measures in Section 3.2.


3     Results
We present the results from our analyses in five parts. The first part shows that the incentivized
competitiveness measure is a significant and relevant predictor of education and labor market

outcomes in a representative sample of the Dutch working-age population. In the second part,
we show that our unincentivized questionnaire measure predicts the same outcomes with similar
predictive power and is often a stronger predictor of these outcomes compared to the other non-
incentivized trait measures (risk seeking, confidence and the big five personality traits). In the third
part, we provide further evidence that competitiveness and risk seeking are two distinct traits which
predict different outcomes. In the fourth part, we explore association between competitiveness on
the one hand and personal wellbeing and social orientation on the other hand. In the fifth part,
we look at the gender difference in competitiveness and show that it can explain a moderate but
meaningful part of gender differences in education and labor market outcomes.


3.1    Incentivized measure of competitiveness
Figure 3 shows how respondents who chose the tournament option and respondents who chose
the piece-rate option are distributed across different levels of each of the four education and labor
market variables. In the two upper-most panels, we divide the sample into income quintiles.
Because the income distributions of men and women are very different, we do this separately
by gender. For each gender, the income distributions of individuals who chose to compete and
individuals who chose not to compete differ strongly. Individuals who compete are more than
twice as likely to be in the highest quintile and much less likely to be in lowest two quintiles.
   In the center panel, we graph the distribution of occupational level by competitiveness. Indi-
viduals who compete are around three times as likely to work in a high academic or independent
position and more than two times as likely to work in a high supervisory position compared to
individuals who do not compete. Individuals who do not compete are more likely to work in
non-academic and non-supervisory occupations.
   In the two lower panels, we look at educational outcomes. In the lower-left panel, we split the

Note: the figures show the distribution of participants across different values of our outcome variables separately for
participants who chose who chose competition in the online experiment and participants who chose the piece rate
payment in the online experiment. The classifications of occupational levels, education levels and college majors
are explained in Section 2.3.


                                                                                                           14
sample by education level. Individuals who compete are more highly educated on average than
non-competing individuals, being three times as likely to have graduated from university (wo)
and 36 percent more likely to have graduated from a university of applied sciences (hbo). In the
lower-right panel, we look at the choice of college major for individuals with a college (university
or university of applied sciences) degree. In the graph, majors are ordered according to the average
income of individuals over 45 years of age in our sample who graduated from that major. College
graduates who chose competition are more than twice as likely to have graduated from one of the
two highest paying majors (medicine or STEM) and about 40 percent less likely to have graduated
from one of the two lowest paying majors (nursing or humanities and art).
    In Table 2, we examine the robustness of the predictive power of the incentivized measure
for these career outcomes to the inclusion of controls for performance in the experimental task,
gender, age, risk seeking, confidence, and the big five personality traits. In each regression, we
limit the sample to individuals for whom we have both the outcome variable as well as all the
control variables. The number of observations fluctuates slightly across outcomes because not all
outcome variables are available for all participants. The sample is much smaller for the regressions
using college major as the outcome variable because they include only participants with a college
degree.
    Panels A to D report results from regressions of monthly gross income on incentivized com-
petitiveness. In Panel A, we use a simple OLS regression.19 Conditional on performance in the
task, gender and age, individuals who compete in the experiment earn 550 Euros more per month
(relative to an average monthly income of 2205 Euros for individuals who do not compete). Addi-
tionally controlling for the big five personality traits, risk attitudes and confidence hardly changes
the estimate: competitive individuals still earn 470 Euros more. Additionally controlling for ed-
ucation level dummies, the difference is 290 Euros. This indicates that part of the relationship
between competitiveness and income is due to a relationship between competitiveness and level of
education
    In order to deal with outliers and to investigate the predictive power of competitiveness at
different parts of the income distribution, we use quantile regressions in Panels B, C and D (20th
percentile, median and 80th percentile respectively). Conditional on the other traits, the competi-
tion coefficient is equal to 585 Euros at the 80th percentile, 382 Euros at the median and 443 Euros
at the 20th percentile. Conditional on education level, the coefficient is significant and similar at
all three levels, fluctuating between 280 and 310 Euros, indicating that for those who compete, the
entire income distribution is shifted to the right.
    We use two methods to analyze the predictive power of incentivized competitiveness for oc-
cupational position. First, we use OLS to regress a dummy indicating that an individual holds
  19
     We do not think that the common strategy of using log income is appropriate here because it eliminates zero-
earners from the sample, who, in our case, are disproportionally women. It also puts disproportionate weight on
differences occurring at the lower end of the income distribution, rather than the upper end where we would expect
the strongest effects of competitiveness.

Note: Each estimate comes from a separate regression of a career outcome on the binary incentivized competition
choice and the control variables indicated in the bottom rows. Score is individuals' performance in the first and
second round of the choice experiment. Education level is measured by dummy variables indicating different levels.
Big 5 are obtained from the 50 question elicitation of the big 5 personality traits: extroversion, agreeableness,
conscientiousness, stability and intellectual openness. Risk attitudes is measured by the Dohmen et al. (2011)
survey measure which we elicited at the same time as our unincentivized measures of competitiveness. We use three
separate measures for confidence: an individual's confidence in their own relative performance in the experimental
task, their Rosenberg's self-esteem scale and their confidence in their own capabilities judged on a seven-point scale.

a high-level academic, independent or supervisory position on incentivized competitiveness and
controls. Second, we rank positions according to the ranking laid out in Section 2.3 and use or-
dered probit regressions. Conditional on performance in the task, gender and age, individuals who
compete in the experiment are 14 percentage points more likely to hold a high-level position (a
large difference relative to 11 percent for those who choose the piece rate). Again, the estimate
hardly changes when controlling for risk seeking, confidence and the big five personality traits
(12 percentage points). The coefficient is reduced by roughly half when we control for education
level, indicating that the relationship between competitiveness and occupation is partially due
to a relationship between competitiveness and education level. The coefficient on incentivized
competitiveness is also consistently significant in the ordered probit regressions.
    Moving to education level in Panels G and H, we use OLS regressions of a dummy indicating that
an individual completed college on incentivized competitiveness and controls, as well as ordered
probit regressions using the ordering of educational levels laid out in Section 2.3. Conditional on
performance in the task, gender and age, individuals who compete are 17 percentage points more
likely to have attended college (relative to 33 percent of individuals who do not compete). The
coefficient decreases to 13 percentage points when controlling for the big five traits, risk attitudes
and confidence. The ordered probit regressions confirm that competitiveness consistently predicts
a higher education level. Finally, for the subsample who have attended college, in Panel I we regress
college major (ranked according to the average income of individuals over 45 years of age in our
sample who graduated from each major) on incentivized competitiveness using ordered probit.
Conditional on performance in the task, gender and age, competing is associated with graduating
from a major that is ranked significantly higher. The coefficient is robust to controlling for the big
five personality traits, but reduces in size and loses statistical significance when we additionally
control for confidence and risk attitudes.


3.2    Survey measure of competitiveness
Having shown that the incentivized measure of competitiveness is a strong predictor of outcomes,
in this section, we will focus on our unincentivized survey measure. We will validate this measure,
which was collected approximately one year prior to the incentivized measure, in two ways. First,
we will show that the unincentivized measure predicts the incentivized competition choice that was
elicited a year later, a method previously applied by Dohmen et al. (2011) and Falk et al. (2016).
Second, we will use the fact that we elicited both the incentivized and the unincentivized measures
in the same sample to assess whether the unincentivized measure predicts the same outcomes we
analyzed in the previous section for the incentivized measure.20
    We find that for individuals of working age who participated in our experiment, their incen-

Niederle-Vesterlund tournament entry decision.

tivized choice and their answer to our unincentivized 11-point measure are strongly correlated.
The correlation coefficient is equal to 0.153 (p<0.001). To properly judge the strength of this
correlation, we have to take into account that the experimental measure and the survey measure
were elicited one year apart. This is a strength because it rules out spurious correlation due to
a desire to be consistent (Falk and Zimmermann, 2013) or other direct effects between the two
elicitations, but it also introduces noise due to the passing of time.
    One approach to correct for this is to use the test-retest correlation of a related measure across
the same time span as benchmark. We elicited the exact same survey measure of risk preferences
taken from Dohmen et al. (2011) in both surveys. We can use the correlation between the two
answers as a benchmark for the correlation between our incentivized and non-incentivized com-
petitiveness measures. The correlation between the two risk preference answers elicited one year
apart is 0.404. Using this as a benchmark to scale the correlation between the two competitiveness
measures leads to a correlation of 0.154/0.404=0.380.21
    In Figure 4, we show the relationship between our survey measure of competitiveness and
outcomes, repeating the analysis in Figure 3. To make the graphs comparable, we dichotomize
our 11-point measure by splitting the sample into people whose competitiveness is below or above
the median.22 The unincentivized survey measure is strongly related to income. For both men
and women, individuals who are above-median competitive are substantially more likely to be in
the highest quintile (86 percent more likely for men and 49 percent for women) and less likely to
be in the lowest quintile (28 percent for men and 28 percent for women) than individuals who are
below-median competitive. Looking at occupation level, we again find that the results from the
incentivized measure replicate quite closely. Individuals who are above-median competitive are
around three times as likely to work in a high supervisory position and 60 percent more likely to
work in a high academic or independent position. They are also 70 percent more likely to work in
an intermediary supervisory position.
    Looking at education, above-median competitive individuals are 70 percent more likely to have
graduated from a university and 26 percent more likely to have graduated from a university of
applied sciences. The unincentivized measure is also related to the choice of college major. As
with the incentivized measure, more competitive individuals tend to have graduated from more
lucrative majors. Nevertheless, the picture looks slightly different compared to the incentivized
choice. When using the incentivized measure, competitive people were much more likely to have
  21
     The correlation between our second, hypothetical choice measure and the incentivized choice is 0.200 (p<0.001).
A composite measure created by standardizing and adding up the two survey measures has a correlation of 0.216
(p<0.001). If we scale these correlations up using the test-retest correlation of the risk preference measure as
a benchmark, we get a correlation of 0.495 for the hypothetical choice measure and a correlation of 0.536 for the
composite measure. An alternative way to correct for the passing of time is to compare how choosing the tournament
option in the experiment is correlated to the contemporaneous risk measure and the risk measure elicited one year
before. The contemporaneous correlation is 3.11 times stronger (0.364 versus 0.117). If we use this factor to scale
up the correlations between our survey measures and the incentivized competition choice, we get correlations of
0.478 for the 11-point measure, 0.622 for the hypothetical choice measure, and 0.673 for the composite measure.

     This splits the sample into individuals with a competitiveness of 0-6 and 7-10

Note: The figures show the distribution of participants across different values of our outcome variables separately
for survey respondents who judged themselves to be above-median (7-10) and below-median (0-6) competitive on
an 11-point scale. The classifications of occupational levels, education levels and college majors are explained in
Section 2.3.




                                                                                                                         19
chosen medicine or STEM (and less likely to have chosen nursing or humanities and art). Using
the unincentivized measure, we again find a much higher likelihood of having a degree in medicine
and a much lower likelihood of having a degree in nursing or humanities and art, but we now also
find that individuals who judge themselves to be more competitive are about twice as likely to have
a degree in economics and business or law (on the other hand, they are only slightly more likely
to have a STEM degree). Overall, the graphs indicate that the unincentivized survey measure
is related to education and labor market outcomes in ways that are very similar to the patterns
observed for the incentivized measure.
    In Table 3, we repeat the analysis in Table 2 for the unincentivized survey measure using data
from the full working-age sample. Using regressions, we examine whether the predictive power of
the survey measure for education and labor market variables is robust to the inclusion of controls
for gender, age, risk attitudes, confidence, and the big five personality traits.
    The unincentivized survey measure of competitiveness significantly predicts all four outcomes
conditional on all mentioned controls. The coefficients are substantial. For instance, panel A,
column 2 shows that individuals who judge themselves one point more competitive (on an 11-
point scale) earn roughly 100 Euros more per month. When we compare this coefficient to the one
in panel A, column 2 of Table 2, we see that the effect of choosing competition in the incentivized
choice experiment is roughly equivalent to moving up five (out of 11) points on the survey scale.
Conditional on gender, age, confidence, risk preference and the big five personality traits, the most
competitive people (those who score themselves highest on the 11-point scale) earn 740 Euros more
per month, are 14 percentage points more likely to hold a high-level occupation, are 17 percentage
points more likely to have gone to college and, conditional on having gone to college, chose a one
spot higher-ranked college major compared to the least competitive people.
    Having established that our survey measure of competitiveness is a strong and robust predictor
of education and labor market outcomes, we now want to compare the predictive power of com-
petitiveness to that of the other traits, namely the big five personality traits, confidence and risk
attitudes. These traits are measured on varying scales. To make the effects comparable, we use a
method inspired by Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua (2006).23 We use OLS regressions to estimate
the effect on the outcome variables of moving from the bottom 30 percent to the top 30 percent
on each of the trait variables.
    Results are presented in Figure 5. Here, we graph the regression coefficients for each trait
controlling for age, gender, education (in the case of income and occupational position), as well
as all other traits. That is, the coefficients tell us how predictive a trait is on top of all the other
traits.24 In Figure A1 in the appendix, we show the effects of moving from the bottom 30 percent
  23
     In their analysis of the importance of cognitive and noncognitive abilities on labor market outcomes and
social behavior, Heckman, Stixrud, and Urzua (2006) calculate what would happen to an outcome if a person's
(non)cognitive ability increases from the lowest to the highest decile.
  24
     The exception are the two measures of confidence which are supposed to elicit the same underlying trait and
where we therefore control for all other traits except the other confidence measure.

Note: Each estimate comes from a separate regression of a career outcome on the unincentivized competitiveness
variable and the control variables indicated in the bottom rows.Education level is measured by dummy variables
indicating different levels. Big 5 are obtained from the 50 question elicitation of the big 5 personality traits:
extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, stability and intellectual openness. Risk attitudes is measured by
the Dohmen et al. (2011) survey measure which we elicited at the same time as our unincentivized measures
of competitiveness. We use two separate measures for confidence: their Rosenberg's self-esteem scale and their
confidence in their own capabilities judged on a seven-point scale. Standard errors in parentheses. */**/***

Note: Each figure shows the coefficient from a separate OLS regression of a dummy indicating that a respondent
is in the top 30% (vs bottom 30%) on a given trait on an outcome variable. Each coefficient is from a separate
regression controlling for gender, age, education level (in the case of the first two graphs), and all other traits
(with the exception of confidence and self-esteem where we control for all other traits except the other confidence
measure). The sample in each regression consists of respondents aged between 25 and 65 who are either in the
bottom or top 30 percent on the given trait. Error bars represent 95-percent confidence intervals.

age, gender and, in the case of income and occupational position, education).
    We start with gross monthly income. Competitiveness is the strongest predictor followed by
stability, confidence and self esteem. Agreeableness also significantly predicts income, albeit in a
negative direction. The effects of the big five traits are in line with the literature. For example,
Mueller and Plug (2006) equally find that stability predicts income positively whereas agreeableness
is a negative predictor. Competitiveness is also one of the strongest predictors for holding a high-
level occupation, and the only one apart from intellectual openness that significantly predicts the
outcome above all other traits.
    The strongest predictor for holding a college degree is intellectual openness followed by com-
petitiveness. It is useful to keep in mind that intellectual openness is closely related to cognitive
skills (see, for example, Rammstedt, Danner, and Martin, 2016) for which we do not have a di-
rect measure. Mueller and Plug (2006) find that controlling for scores in an IQ test substantially
reduces the coefficient of openness in a regression of income on the big-five traits. The strong
correlation between openness and college graduation is therefore likely partially due to openness
capturing unobserved cognitive skills. Finally, competitiveness, agreeableness (negatively), open-
ness and conscientiousness are the strongest predictors of having chosen a higher-ranked college
major.
    The question of which trait predicts best can also be answered in a complementary way by
estimating the additional proportion of the variance in each outcome that is explained by each
trait. In Figure 6, we show the increase in R-squared that is caused by adding each measure to
regressions of our career outcomes on age, gender and all the other traits (plus, in the case of
income and occupation, education level). In Figure A2 in the appendix, we show the increase in
R-squared caused by each trait not controlling for the other traits.
    The results in Figure 6 largely confirm those presented in Figure 5. Competitiveness is the
strongest predictor of income and rank of college major and the second-strongest predictor (after
intellectual openness) of holding a high-level occupation and having graduated from college.
    Taken together, these estimation results confirm that competitiveness significantly predicts
education and labor market outcomes conditional on a range of other traits which are commonly
studied in the literature on non-cognitive skills (Borghans et al., 2008; Dohmen et al., 2011),
indicating that competitiveness is a new trait that is not well-captured by existing measures of
personality and economic preferences. The results in Figures A1 and A2 in the appendix, where
we show the effects of each trait when not controlling for the other traits, confirm this picture.
Competitiveness is consistently one of the strongest predictors, meaning that if one has to choose a
single trait to predict the education and labor market outcomes of an individual, competitiveness
is more often than not one of the top choices.
    In the appendix, we also present results for our second unincentivized measure of competitive-
ness, the hypothetical choice in the Niederle-Vesterlund experiment. The results in Table B1 and

Note: the figures show the percentage point increase in R-squared in OLS regressions of a given trait variable on an
outcome variable. Each effect is from a separate regression controlling for gender, age, education level (in the case
of the first two graphs), and all other traits (with the exception of confidence and self-esteem where we control for
all other traits except the other confidence measure). The sample consists of respondents aged between 25 and 65.




                                                                                                                     24
Figure B1 show that this binary measure predicts the same outcomes as our incentivized mea-
sure and our 11-point survey question. Conditional on gender and age, individuals who say they
would compete in an incentivized experiment earn 265 Euros more per month (147 conditional
on education), are 8 percentage points more likely to hold a high-level position (5 conditional on
education), 8 percentage points more likely the hold a college degree, and, conditional on having
gone to college, have picked a more lucrative major. However, these effects are consistently lower
than those obtained with the incentivized choice measure and are less robust to controlling for
other traits. When we add both of our unincentivized measures to our regressions, the coefficients
on our 11-point measure hardly change while the coefficients on the hypothetical measure tend
to become insignificant. We conclude that our 11-point questionnaire item is a better measure of
competitiveness, on top of being quicker (and therefore cheaper) to elicit.25
    However, in situations where it is not too costly to elicit both measures, the hypothetical
measure still adds significant additional explanatory power. In Figure B2 in the appendix, we
replicate the analysis in Figure 6 using both measures of competitiveness simultaneously. Using
both measures leads to meaningful increases in the variance explained by competitiveness relative
to using the 11-point measure alone.


3.3       Competitiveness and risk attitudes
Two recent papers argue that a large part of the gender difference in competitiveness, as measured
by the Niederle and Vesterlund (2007) design, can be explained by gender differences in risk pref-
erences and confidence (Gillen, Snowberg, and Yariv, 2019; van Veldhuizen, 2017). While these
papers concentrate on the gender difference in competitiveness, their results raise the question
whether competitiveness, rather than being a new, separate trait, is well captured by risk prefer-
ences and confidence in one's own relative performance. Our results indicate that competitiveness,
risk and confidence are three separate traits which predict outcomes independently or even predict
different outcomes. For example, Table 3 and Figure 5 show that our survey measure of com-
petitiveness significantly predicts education and labor market variables even when controlling for
survey measures of risk preferences, confidence, self-esteem and personality. Neither the effects of
risk preferences nor of confidence are consistently robust to controlling for the other traits.
    The four outcomes we consider ­ income, professional position, education level and major choice
­ are not necessarily directly linked to risk taking (for instance, being willing to compete against
others is arguably more important for moving up the corporate hierarchy than being willing to take
risk). Here, we want to go a step further in establishing that competitiveness and risk attitudes
are separate traits that predict different outcomes by considering choices that are risky but not
necessarily competitive. To obtain a non-arbitrary selection of such outcomes, we pick the four
outcomes that were studied in the seminal study of Dohmen et al. (2011): the propensities to invest
 25
      The hypothetical measure requires an explanation of the experimental design of Niederle and Vesterlund (2007).


                                                         25
in stocks, practice sport, be self-employed, and smoke. Arguably only one of the four, practicing
sports, is obviously related to enjoying competition (self-employed people have competitors but so
do employees).26
    We use the same method as in the previous section to estimate the predictive power of our trait
measures for these risky outcomes. Figure 7 shows the difference in outcomes between individuals
in the top 30% and individuals in the bottom 30% on each trait, controlling for age and gender.
We replicate the Dohmen et al. (2011) result that risk seeking is a significant predictor of all four
outcomes. As expected, competitiveness does not predict investing in stocks, being self-employed
or smoking. On the other hand, competitiveness is the strongest predictor of practicing sports.
This analysis further underlines that competitiveness and risk attitudes are both relevant individual
traits which predict different economically important outcomes and should therefore be accounted
for separately.


3.4     Is there a dark side of competitiveness?
So far, we find that competitiveness is strongly associated with better education and labor mar-
ket outcomes. However, this does not mean that competitiveness is also associated with better
wellbeing or social outcomes. For example, it may be that being competitive is detrimental for
one's social life or intimate relationships. It may also be that competitive people are more selfish
or less socially oriented. Looking at the correlations between competitiveness and other traits in
Table A1, this seems a priori unlikely. Competitiveness is positively correlated with extroversion,
conscientiousness, stability and intellectual openness, and is unrelated to agreeableness. More-
over, competitiveness is positively correlated with confidence and self-esteem. To further explore
whether competitiveness has a dark side, in Table 4 we regress indicators of self-rated wellbeing
and social preferences as well as objective wellbeing measures on our unincentivized measure of
competitiveness using the same specifications as in Table 3.
    In panels A and B, we use self-rated measures of happiness and life satisfaction (on a scale
from 0 to 10). People who rate themselves as more competitive are also happier and more satisfied
with their lives, and this is true even when controlling for education level, other personality traits,
confidence and self-esteem. In panel C, we use an objective measure of wellbeing, namely whether
an individual is taking medicine to treat depression or anxiety. Individuals who rate themselves
as one point more competitive are between 0.4 and 0.8 percentage points less likely to take such
medication. This is a sizeable effect keeping in mind that 5.9 percent of individuals in the sample
were taking medication for depression or anxiety at the time of either the 2017 or the 2016 core
  26
     Some past studies have found correlations between willingness to compete and entrepreneurship. Bönte and
Piegeler (2013) find a significant correlation using the Eurobarometer 283 survey on entrepreneurship which contains
an unincentivized survey measure of competitiveness. Urbig et al. (2019), in a lab-in-the-field study conducted in
a shopping mall, find that individuals who compete in an incentivized task are more likely to have ever been
self-employed or to plan to become self-employed in the future.

Note: the figures show coefficients from OLS regressions of a dummy indicating that a respondent is in the top 30%
(vs bottom 30%) on a given trait on an outcome variable. Each coefficient is from a separate regression controlling
for gender, age, and age squared. The sample in each regression consists of respondents aged between 25 and 65 who
are either in the bottom or top 30 percent on the given trait. Error bars represent 95-percent confidence intervals.

    We next look at how individuals connect to others. In panels D and E, we show that more
competitive individuals are no less likely to have a partner or to be married. For a more gen-
eral indicator of social connections, in Panel F we use the "Inclusion of Others in the Self" scale
(Aron, Aron, and Smollan, 1992) which is included in the core personality questionnaire. Compet-
itive people feel significantly closer to others, although this correlation is well-captured by other
personality traits.
    Finally, we ask whether competitive people differ from less competitive people in their social
preferences. In Panels G-I, we use three measures from the core personality questionnaire. The
first is a general measure of trust, asking respondents whether they think most people can be
trusted on a scale from 0 to 10. The other two questions are included in a list of values where
respondents judge how important these values are as a "guiding principle" in their lives on a scale
from 1 to 7. The two values we include are "helpful" and "loving". We find that individuals who
are more competitive give more importance to being helpful and loving while there is no significant
relationship between competitiveness and trust.
    Overall, these results do not give any indication of a dark side of competitiveness. People who
rate themselves as being more competitive, on top of being more successful are also happier, feel
closer to others, are no less likely to be in a relationship and give more importance to being helpful
and loving.


3.5     Gender differences in competitiveness
A large experimental literature documents gender differences in competitiveness (Gneezy, Niederle,
and Rustichini, 2003; Niederle and Vesterlund, 2007; Niederle, 2016). Figure 8 shows that this is
also true for the competitiveness measures used in this paper. While 34 percent of working-age
men choose to compete in the experiment, only 22 percent of working-age women do so (p<0.001;
chi-squared test).27 65 percent of men and 47 percent of women rate their competitiveness as at or
above the median (p<0.001).28 In the right-most panel, we show a histogram of competitiveness
levels by gender which reveals large gender differences in the tails. 11 percent of men and 5 percent
of women rate themselves as extremely competitive (9 or 10 on a 0-10 scale). On the other hand,
9 percent of women and 5 percent of men rate their competitiveness as very low (0-2).
    We also observe gender differences in most of the other traits we consider. Figure A3 in the
appendix graphs the gender difference in each trait where trait measures have been standardized
to have mean zero and a standard deviation of one. Apart from being less competitive, women are
  27
     This difference is smaller than in some lab studies with university students but in line with the results of
Boschini et al. (2019) who use a representative sample of the Swedish population and Buser, Peter, and Wolter
(2018) who use a sample of secondary students that covers all ability levels.
  28
     Due to the discrete nature of the competitiveness measure, slightly more than 50 percent of individuals are at
or above the median of 7 (54 percent).

Note: Each estimate comes from a separate regression of the outcome indicated in the panel title on the unincen-
tivized competitiveness variable and the control variables indicated in the bottom rows. Education level is measured
by dummy variables indicating different levels. Big 5 are obtained from the 50 question elicitation of the big 5 per-
sonality traits: extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, stability and intellectual openness. Risk attitudes is
measured by the Dohmen et al. (2011) survey measure which we elicited at the same time as our unincentivized
measures of competitiveness. We use two measures for confidence: the Rosenberg's self-esteem scale and their con-
fidence in their own capabilities judged on a seven-point scale. Standard errors in parentheses. */**/*** indicates

Note: The left panel shows the fractions of men and women competing in the incentivized choice experiment. The
middle panel shows the means for men and women on the unincentivized general competitiveness question. The
right panel shows the distributions for men and women on the unincentivized general competitiveness question.
The sample consists of respondents aged between 25 and 65. Error bars represent 95-percent confidence intervals.


more agreeable and more conscientious while men rate themselves higher on stability, intellectual
openness, risk seeking and both confidence measures. There is no gender difference in extroversion.
These differences are in line with findings in the literature on gender differences in risk seeking
(Croson and Gneezy, 2009) and confidence (Niederle, 2016). The gender differences in agreeable-
ness, conscientiousness and mental stability also go in the expected direction, whereas many other
studies find no difference in openness (Mueller and Plug, 2006; Schmitt et al., 2008).
    Three of the four education and labor market variables exhibit significant gender differences.
Conditional on age and education level, working age women in our sample earn 1414 Euros less
per month (p<0.001; OLS) and are 11 percentage points less likely to hold a high-level occupation
(p<0.001). Their likelihood of going to college is similar to that of men, but conditional on going
to college, they pick a major that is ranked 1.3 positions lower in the ranking by income prospects
(p<0.001).
    In Figure 9, we ask whether our unincentivized measure of competitiveness, as well as the
other trait measures, can explain a significant part of these gender gaps. To do so, we estimate
the percentage reduction in the gender gap upon controlling for each of the traits separately and
jointly.29
    Controlling for the unincentivized competitiveness measure reduces the gender gap in income
conditional on education level by 4.3 percent. Competitiveness is among the traits which explain
most of the gender gap in income, together with stability (5.3 percent) and general confidence (3.6

    These coefficients are from OLS regressions of the education and labor market variables on a gender dummy,
a second-degree polynomial in age, and (in the case of income and occupation) education level dummies for the
sample of 25 to 65-year olds who answered our questionnaire.

percent). In the right-most graph in each panel, we estimate the proportion of the gender gap that is
explained by all traits together. We estimate that around 12 percent of the gender gap in income
in our sample can statistically be explained by the psychological traits we consider. Following
previous results that the potential of competitiveness for explaining differences in educational
career choices is highest at the top of the ability distribution (Buser, Peter, and Wolter, 2018), we
repeat this exercise for college-educated individuals. Here, competitiveness explains 7.6 percent of
the gender gap, while stability explains 9.9 percent and confidence 6.2 percent. All traits jointly
explain roughly 18 percent of the gender difference in income for college-educated individuals.
    Competitiveness also has the most explanatory power for the gender gap in holding a high-
level occupation conditional on education level (8.7 percent) followed by stability (7.3 percent),
risk seeking (6.3 percent), confidence (5.9 percent), and intellectual openness (5.8 percent). All
psychological traits jointly explain around 25 percent of the gender gap. For those who graduated
from college, competitiveness (6.1 percent), agreeableness (7.5 percent) and risk seeking (3.4 per-
cent) are the only significant explanatory factors for the gender gap in major choice. All traits
jointly explain 18 percent of the gender gap.
    In Figure B3 in the appendix, we repeat this exercise using both of our unincentivized compet-
itiveness measures separately and jointly. While our 11-point survey question consistently does a
better job explaining the gender gap, adding both measures jointly still leads to an increase in the
part of the gender gap in outcomes that can be explained by competitiveness. The two measures
can jointly explain 4.9 percent of the gender difference in income conditional on education, 9.6
percent of the gender difference in income for college graduates, 9.9 percent of the gender gap in
holding a high-level position conditional on education, and 8.4 percent of the gender difference in
major choice for college graduates.
    On top of the widely observed gender difference, a small number of studies have also investigated
age effects in competitiveness. Flory et al. (2018), in a sample of over 700 participants from villages
in Malawi and a smaller US sample, find that the gender gap in competitiveness disappears above
age 50 due to a large increase in the competitiveness of women. Mayr et al. (2012), in a sample
of over 500 adults recruited in a US shopping mall, find a midlife-peak in competitiveness with
men and women from 45 to 54 years old being more competitive than both their younger and
their older counterparts. They find a significant gender difference for all ages. Bönte (2015),
using an unincentivized survey measure of competitiveness, finds that the gender difference in
competitiveness stays roughly constant across the life cycle.
    We will now check whether we detect similar patterns for our measures of competitiveness in
our representative sample. Figure 10 shows the fraction of men and women competing in the
experiment as well as the average competitiveness score for five ten-year groups spanning the ages
of 15 to 64. Both measures show a general decline with age. We observe neither an increase in the
competitiveness for women above 50 nor a midlife peak.

4                    Conclusion
A large literature documents individual and gender differences in competitiveness in the lab. Fol-
lowing up on this literature, a number of studies link competitiveness, typically measured through
an incentivized choice experiment in a classroom setting, to educational decisions and early career
choices. Many important questions remain unanswered, including whether competitiveness pre-
dicts choices and outcomes along the whole career cycle, where individual and gender differences
in competitiveness originate and how average competitiveness differs across other demographic
groups and across countries. Answering these questions requires new ways of measuring prefer-
ences for competition that do not necessitate gathering respondents in the same physical location.
Many applications will require a measure that can be added to large-scale surveys without any
significant increase in survey time (and therefore cost).
    In this paper we introduce such measures of competitiveness. The first is incentivized and is
an online adaptation of the original Niederle-Vesterlund measure. The second is a single unincen-
tivized survey question which can be quickly elicited in any setting. The two measures are strongly
correlated at the individual level and both measures are strong and consistent predictors of com-
pleted level of education, field of study in college, occupation and income. The predictive power of
the unincentivized measure for these outcomes is robust to controlling for other traits, including
risk seeking, confidence and the big five personality traits. For most outcomes, the predictive
power of competitiveness exceeds that of the other traits.
    The new survey measure will open up new avenues for research that we aim to explore in future
work. This includes repeat elicitation of competitiveness in survey panels, which allows following


                                                                      33
people over time and using panel data methods to better isolate causal pathways. Some European
survey panels allow linking to registry data, which opens up the possibility to make use of natural
experiments to explore the causal origins of individual differences in competitiveness. Furthermore,
our survey question can be used for eliciting competitiveness in cross-country surveys.
   We also contribute to the literature on gender differences in the labor market. We find that
gender differences in competitiveness can explain 5-10% of the observed gender differences in
education and labor market outcomes and that gender differences in competitiveness, risk seeking,
confidence and the big five personality traits combined can explain up to 25% of gender differences.
Our results are also relevant to the ongoing discussion in the experimental economics literature on
whether gender differences in willingness to compete in the lab are due to individual differences in
preferences for competition or rather due to differences in beliefs and risk preferences. We show
that competitiveness and risk attitudes predict a separate set of outcomes. Risk attitudes are only
weakly related to career outcomes. On the other hand, risk attitudes, but not competitiveness,
predict choices that are intrinsically risky but not competitive (investing in stock, self-employment
and smoking).
   The relations that we have unveiled are (conditional) associations and cannot be interpreted
causally. Neither omitted variable bias nor reversed causality can be ruled out. The introduction
and validation of a unincentivized survey measure of competitiveness, however, makes it possible
to measure competitiveness repeatedly and in much larger samples than has been the case so far.
This in turn paves the way for research that can uncover which factors influence competitiveness,
and, in cases where these factors can be manipulated or considered exogenous, isolate the causal
impact of competitiveness on outcomes. Such research could also shed light on the question to
what extent competitiveness is a productive trait and to what extent it is merely a trait that helps
people to enter certain occupations without actually being more productive.

Note: Each figure shows the coefficient from a separate OLS regression of a dummy indicating that a respondent
is in the top 30% (vs bottom 30%) on a given trait on an outcome variable. Each coefficient is from a separate
regression controlling for gender, age, education level (in the case of the first two graphs). The sample in each
regression consists of respondents aged between 25 and 65 who are either in the bottom or top 30 percent on the
given trait. Error bars represent 95-percent confidence intervals.

Note: the figures show the percentage point increase in R-squared in OLS regressions of a given trait variable on
an outcome variable. Each effect is from a separate regression controlling for gender, age and (in the case of the
first two graphs) education level. The sample consists of respondents aged between 25 and 65.

Note: Each estimate comes from a separate regression of a career outcome on the response to the unincentivized hypothetical Niederle-Vesterlund question
and the control variables indicated in the bottom rows. Education level is measured by dummy variables indicating different levels. Big 5 are obtained from
the 50 question elicitation of the big 5 personality traits: extroversion, agreeableness, conscientiousness, stability and intellectual openness. Risk attitudes
is measured by the Dohmen et al. (2011) survey measure which we elicited at the same time as our unincentivized measures of competitiveness. We use two
separate measures for confidence: their Rosenberg's self-esteem scale and their confidence in their own capabilities judged on a seven-point scale. Standard

Note: The figures show the percentage point increase in R-squared in OLS regressions of a given trait variable on
an outcome variable. Each effect is from a separate regression controlling for gender, age, education level (in the
case of the first two graphs), and all other traits (with the exception of confidence and self-esteem where we control
for all other traits except the other confidence measure). The sample consists of respondents aged between 25 and
65.

Note: The figures show the part (in percent) of the gender gap in an outcome variable that can be explained by each
trait separately and jointly. The estimates are from separate OLS regressions of gender, age, and age squared on
an outcome variable with and without a trait variable added to the regression. The sample consists of respondents
aged between 25 and 65. Error bars represent 95-percent confidence intervals.
