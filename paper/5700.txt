        A country’s suitability for entry into a currency union depends on a number of economic

conditions.   These include, inter alia, the intensity of trade with other potential members of the

currency union, and the extent to which domestic business cycles are correlated with those of the

other countries.   But international trade patterns and international business cycle correlations are

endogenous,    This paper develops and investigates the relationship between the two phenomena.

Using thirty years of data for twenty industrialized     countries, we uncover a strong and striking

empirical finding: countries with closer trade links tend to have more tightly correlated business

cycles. It follows that countries are more likely to satisfy the criteria for entry into a currency union

after taking steps toward economic integration than before.

                     The Endogeneity        of the Optimum Currency Area Criteria

L       Introduction

        Countries considering whether to enter the proposed European Economic and Monetary

Union (EMU) weigh the potential benefits ofjoining the currency union against the inevitable

costs. Joining a currency union brings benefits such as a reduction in the transactions costs

associated with trading goods and services between countries with different moneys. Countries

with close international trade links would potentially benefit greatly from a common currency and

are more likely to be members of an optimum cumency area (OCA). Thus, the nature and etient

of international trade is one criterion for EMU entry, or, more generally, membership in an OCA.

        On the other hand, joining EMU brings costs. Cited most frequently is foregoing the

possibility of dampening business cycle fluctuations through independent counter-cyclic monetary

policy.] Countries with idiosyncratic business cycles give up a potentially important stabilizing

tool if they join a currency union, Another criterion for EMU entry is therefore the cross-count~

correlation of business cycles. Countries with “symmetric” cycles are more likely to be members

of an OCA. Succinctly, countries with tight international trade ties and positively correlated

business cycles are more likely to join, and gain from EMU, ceterisparibus.

        These topics have already been closely studied by economists.              Estimates of the

transactions costs that might be saved by EMU have been summarized by the Commission of the

European Communities (1990).           A number of economists, including Bayoumi and Eichengreen

(1993A 1993b, 1994, 1996), have analyzed the business cycles and shocks affecting different

potential EMU members, so as to be able to quantifi the potential importance of national

uniom or if an effective international or intertemporal system of fid transfers exists. We do not focus explicitly
on these issues in this paper, although the European Commission (1990) provides extensive references.

monetary policy, Our aim in this paper is to link the two issues so as to make a simple point. We

argue that a ntive examination of historical data gives a misleading picture of a country’s

suitability for entry into a currency unioq since both criteria are endogenous.z

         Entry into a currency union may significantly raise international trade linkages (and

therefore the benefits foregone by not joining a currency union). More importantly, tighter

international trade ties may significantly affect the nature of national business cycles. Countries

that enter a currency union are likely to experience dramatically different business cycles than

before. In part this will necessarily reflect changes in monetary policy; but in it will also be a

result of closer international trade with the other members of the union. From a theoretical

viewpoint, closer international trade could result in either tighter or looser correlations of national

business cycles. Cycles could, in principle, become more idiosyncratic.                   Closer trade ties could

result in countries becoming more specialized in the goods in which they have comparative

advantage, as noted by e.g., Eichengreen (1992), Kenen (1969), and Krugman (1993).                           The

countries might then be more sensitive to industry-specific shocks, resulting in more idiosyncratic

business cycles. However, if demand shocks predominate, or there are important shocks which

are common across countries – or intra-industty trade accounts for most trade – then business

cycles may become more similar across countries when countries trade more. We believe the

latter case to be the more realistic one, but consider the question to be open.


         We test our view empirically, using a panel of bilateral trade and business cycle data

spanning twenty industrialized countries over thirty years. The empirical results are strong and

clear-cut.   They indicate that closer international trade links result in more closely correlated

business cycles across countries.         This finding is interesting since a number of economists have

claimed the opposite.

         Our findings lead to a number of conclusions on the prospects and desirability of EMU.

Continued European trade liberalization can be expected to result in more tightly correlated

European business cycles, making a common European currency both more likely and more

desirable. Indeed, monetary union itself may lead to a firther boost to trade integration and hence

business cycle symmetry.      Countries which join EMU, no matter what their motivation, may

satis~ OCA criteria ex post even if they do not ex ante!

        In part 11of the paper, we provide a theoretical framework for our analysis, drawing

heavily on the large literature on Optimum Currency Areas (OCAS). We next discuss the

literature briefly, and present our empirical methodology and data set. Section V contains our

actual empirical results, and section VI has a brief conclusion.




IL      Theoretical Framework

         Since Mundell (1961) first developed the concept of an optimum currency are% a vast

literature has developed in the area. This literature includes classic contributions    by McKinnon

(1963) and Kenen (1969).       Recent surveys are available in Tavlas (1992) and Bayoumi and

Eichengreen (1 996). Much of this literature focuses on four inter-relationships       between the

members of a potential OCA. They are: 1) the extent of trade; 2) the similarity of the shocks and

cycles; 3) the degree of labor mobility; and 4) the system of fiscal transfers (if any). The greater

the linkages between the countries using any of the four criteria, the more suitable a common

currency,




EMU will rtiuce the incidence of country-specific shocks.”
                                                       3
        Given the theoretical consensus in the area, it is natural that the OCA criteria have been

applied extensively.    For instance, when most researchers judge the suitability of different

European countries for EMU, they examine the four criteria (or some subset) using European

da~ frequently using the United States as a benchmark for comparison.

        Such a procedure maybe untenable, since the OCA criteria arejointly endogenous. For

instance, the suitability of European countries for EMU cannot be judged on the basis of historical

data since the structure of these economies is likely to change in the event of EMU.               As such, this

paper is simply an application of the well-known “Lucas Critique”.            Without denying the

importance of the third and fourth criteria, we focus on the first two OCA criteria.


ILa     The OCA Paradigm

        Countries that are highly integrated with each other, with respect to international trade in

goods and services, are more likely to constitute an optimum currency area. Openness is one

criterion for membership in an OCA since greater trade leads to greater savings in the transactions

costs and risks associated with different currencies, as already noted. Further, the high marginal

propensity to import associated with an open economy reduces output variability and the need for

domestic monetary policy, since openness acts as an automatic stabilizer.


        Of course, openness is not the ordy criterion for membership in a common currency area.

Ever since Mundell (1961) it has been appreciated that the more highly correlated the business

cycles are across member countries, the more appropriate a common currency.                  Ordy countries

whose business cycles are imperfectly synchronized with others’ could benefit from the potential

stabilization tiorded   by a national monetary policy.’




3 We take it for granted hat monetary policy cannot permanently tiwt   either a country’s real income level or
groti rate; henee our focus on business cycles.
                                                       4
        In Figure 1 we graph conceptually the extent of trade among members of a potential

common currency area, against the correlation of their incomes. The OCA line is downward-

sloping: the advantages of adopting a common currency depend positively on both trade

integration and the degree to which business cycles are correlated internationally.        Points high up

and to the right represent groupings of countries that should share a common currency; the

benefits outweigh the costs of lost monetary independence.          Points down and to the Iefi represent

countries that should float individually, since monetary sovereignty outweighs the transactions

cost savings of a common currency.

        Can the degree of integration between potential members of a common currency area be

considered independently of income correlation?         Surely not, since the correlation of business

cycles across countries depends on trade inte~ation. Though it is ofien treated as a parameter,

integration changes over time. European countries trade with each other more than in the past,

and this trend may continue.    It is driven in part by regional trade policy: such initiatives as the

completion of the single market in 1992 and the expansion of the EU to 15, members. ~U                  itse~

maypromote intra-European trade, If the effects of the exchange rate risk and transactions costs

are important, ~ EMUproponents claim. Thus cyclic correlation is endogenous with respect to

trade integratio~   while integration is also affected by policy.

        Our hypothesis is that this relationship is positive: the more one country trades with

others, the more highly correlated will be their business cycles. This is certainly the relationship

pictured by the Commission of the European Communities (1990).             But it is not universally

accepted.   Authors such as Eichengreen (1992), Kenen (1969), and Krugman (1993) have pointed

out that as trade becomes more highly integrated, countries specialize more in production,             They

seem to expect that increased degree of specialization will reduce the international correlation of


                                                    5
incomes, given sufficiently large supply shocks.

11.b     Further Analysis

         Ideally, we would use a genera! equilibrium model of international trade to derive testable

hypotheses.      Such a model would have to involve barriers to trade (either “natural,” such as

transportation    costs, or “created” such as tariffs and non-tariff barriers), since our objective is to

gauge the impact of reduced trade barriers on the international co-movements                of business cycles.

Because of the latter point, this model, unlike many models of international trade, would have to

be stochastic with roles for both industry-specific          and aggregate shocks. Further, it would have

to involve both inter-sectoral     trade (so as to be able to accommodate         specialization) and intra-

industry trade (since the effects on the latter of opening trade are thought to be large and different

from those on inter-industry trade).’


        Creating such a model from scratch is beyond the limited scope of this (chiefly empirical)

paper. Our objective here is much more modest.               We seek in this section merely to provide some

intuition for the interplay between trade intensity and business cycles. We begin by expressing

output as:




where: Ayt represents the growth rate of real output for the domestic country at time t; UL1is the

sector-specific deviation of the growth rate of output in sector i at time t from the country’s


4 Ricci (1996) provides a theoretical analysis which contains many of these elements. His analysis focuses on the
relationship betw=n the exchange rate regime and firm location (with cortsequenas for the extent of international
trade). Using a static model which incorpomtes both inter-industry and intra-industry trade, he finds thatflexibfe

                                                         6
average growth rate at time t, Vt;a i is the weight of sector i in total output (Xi~i= 1); and g is the

trend rate of output growth for the country. The analog for the foreign country is:




        Ay*t = Xia *.,U,,t
                         +v*L+g*




where an asterisk denotes a foreign value, and we assume that the sector-specific              shocks (but not

necessarily the sector-specific    output shares) are common across countries.           Stockman (1988)

provides one simple way to derive and use univanate output models like this in a standard

neoclassical setting.


        We assume that the {uiL} are distributed independently across both sector and time of each

other, with sectoral variance ~2i. We firther assume that the {v~}are distributed independently

over time, independently of the sector-specific shocks. For simplicity, we also abstract from trend

effects in the analysis which follows, though we return to the issue below.

        The cross-country      covariance of output is:




        COV(Ayt,    Ay*t) = cov(~iaiui,t, Eia*iui,t) +   COV(VI, V*~)



                          = Zi~,a*i02i +   ~v,@




where oV,+ is the covariance between the country-specific           aggregate shocks,



exchange mtes induce pialization      compared with fixed rates, sin~ they automatically dampen the effects of
industry-specific (and other) shocks.
                                                         7
         In our empirical analysis, we work with correlation coefficient estimates, that is the

covariance adjusted for the country-specific volatility of aggregate income. The degree to which

business cycles are correlated internationally rises or falls depends on how this covariance changes

with increased integrations      Increased integration may affect both terms; we consider them

sequentially.


         & noted by Eichengreen and Krugman, increased trade results in greater specialization if

most trade is inter-industry.     As countries tend to produce and export goods in which they have a

comparative advantage, a negative cross-indust~             correlation between Ui and u*i tends to

develop; the covariance falls accordingly.       If much trade is wilhin rather than between industries,

such specialization effects may be small. The latter sort of trade -- intra-industry – has attracted

much attention of late and is commordy considered to account for a major share of international

trade.

         The covanance of the country-specific aggregate shocks may also be tiected            by increased

integration.    There are a number of potentially important channels. The spill-over of aggregate

demand shocks will tend to raise the covanance, since e.g., an increase in public or private

spending in one country tends to raise demand for both foreign and domestic output.             This may

not be the ordy channel. The presence of greater trade integration may also induce a more rapid

spread of productivity shocks, raising the covariance (e.g., Coe and Helpman).           Further,

government-induced      policy shocks may become more coordinated in the presence of increased

integration.


         It seems to us that closer international integration will tend to raise the covariance of

country-specific   demand shocks and aggregate productivity shocks. This tends to increase the

international coherence of business cycles. On the other hand, integration tends to raise the

degree of industrial specialization, leading to more asynchronous business cycles. The importance

of this effect depends on the degree of specialization induced by integratio~     which may not be

large if most trade is intra-industry rather than inter-industry.   And the net effect on business cycle

coherence depends on the relative variances of aggregate and industry-specific       shocks. If the

former are larger than the latter (as in e.g., Stockman (1988)), then we would expect closer trade

integration to result in more synchronized business cycles.

        Casual empiricism leads us to the view that integration results in more highly correlated

national business cycles. However, the alternative view is defensible on theoretical grounds.         The

matter can only be resolved empirically. We now turn to that task.




IIL     Related Results from the Literature

        A number of papers have examine the international correlation structure of business

cycles. We review the relevant papers briefly.

        Cohen and Wyplosz (1 989) examined the correlation of output growth rates for Germany

and France; Weber (1991) did so for other members of the European Community.             Stockman

(1988) decomposes cross-countries      growth rates of industrial production for European countries

into industry-specific and country-specific   components.    Bayoumi andEichengreen(1993~b,c,

1994) argue that these studies coflate    information on the incidence of disturbances and on

economies’ responses.    Accordingly, Bayoumi and Eichengreen use structural vector auto-

regressions to distinguish underlying aggregate demand and aggregate supply disturbances from

the subsequent dynamic response.      They use the results to find plausible groupings of countries

for monetary union. We see little justificatio~    however, for the assumption that supply


                                                    9
disturbances are the only ones to which independent monetary policy may wish to respond.

          De Grauweand     Vanhaverbeke (1993) find that’’asymmetric”            or idiosyncratic shocks tend

to be more prevalent at the level of regions within a country than at the level of nations within

Europe.    This seems to support the view that increasing integration, may resu!t in more

idiosyncratic activity. However, De Grauwe and Vanhaverbeke use the stanhrd deviation of the

d~ference in percentage changes in income between the two regions instead of the correlation of

percentage changes in income between two regions,.             This may be a less usefil measure of income

links. There is every reason to think that the variance of income at the regional level is much

higher than the variance of income at the national level. Since national income is the sum of

regional income, some local variation is bound to wash out despite the presence of potentially

high inter-regional correlations.G


          Close in spirit to our view is a recent paper by Artis and Zhang (1995), which finds that

most European countries’ incomes were more highly correlated with the U.S. during 1961-79, but

(with the exception of the UK) have become more highly correlated with Germany since joining

the ERM.7

          All this work is subject to the Lucas Critique discussed above. Perhaps more importantly,

no existing work to the best of our knowledge, attempts to endogenize international business

cycle correlations.

        In this section, we present some empirical evidence on the relationship between bilateral

income correlations and bilateral trade intensity. The evidence is consistent with a strong positive

effect of trade intensity on income correlations,



IV.a    Measuring Bilateral Trade Intensity and Business Cycle Correlations

        Our empirical analysis relies on measures of two key variables: bilateral trade intensity;

and bilateral comelations of real economic activity. We discuss these in tum.s

        We are interested in the bilateral intensity of international trade between two countries, i

and j at a point in time t. We use three different proxies for bilateral trade intensity.               The first uses

export data exclusively; the second uses only imports, and the final (and prefemed) measure uses

both exports and imports:



                 WX~~ = Xij,/(Xi,t   + Xj,~)


                 wmtil = M~t/(Mi.t+ Mj.t)

                 titit = (Xijt+ Mtit)/( Xi.t+ Xj.t+ Mi.t+ Mj.t)



where: Xot denotes total nominal exports from country i to country j during period t; Xi.t denotes

total global exports from country i; and M denotes imports.               (In practice we take natural

logarithms of all three ratios.) We think of higher values of e,g., wtij~as indicating greater trade

intensity between countties i and j.

        The bilateral trade data are taken from the International Monetary Fund’s Direction of

Trade data set. The data are amual and cover twenty-one industrial countries from 1959 through



* The STATA 4,0 data set and pro-       are available for one year upon aipt   of two fomtted   3.5” diskettes and a slf-

1993.’

         There are a variety of problems associated with bilateral trade data (e.g., Xijt z Mjit). Our

data measure actual trade intensity, which may understate the potential importance of trade.

Further, from a theoretical point of view, it is unclear which set of weights is optimal; some

countries may have specialized exports or imports,        Thus we conduct our tests with all three

measures of trade intensity.    Reassuringly, our answers appear to be insensitive to the exact way

that we measure trade intensity. This is unsurprising, as the three different measures are highly

positively inter-comelated.    Figure 2 provides scatter-plots   of each measure of trade intensity

graphed against the others; non-parametric      data smoothers are also provided to “connect the

dots”.

         Our other important variable is the bilateral correlation between real activity in country i

and country j at time t. Again, it is difficult to figure out the optimal single empirical analog to the

theoretical concept.   We therefore use a variety of different proxies.

         We use four different measures of real economic activity: the first pair taken fi-om the

International Monetary Fund’s International Financial Statistics; the other two from the OECD’S

Main Economic Indicators. In particular, we use: real GDP (typically IFS line 99); an index of

industrial production (line 66); total employment (OECD mnemonic “et”); and the unemployment

rate (“uti’).   All the data are quarterly, covering (with gaps) the same sample of countries and

years as the trade data.

         We transfom    our variables in two different ways. First, we take natural logarithms of

each variable except the unemployment rate. Second, we de-trend the variables so as to focus on

business cycle fluctuations.   Given the importance of different de-trending procedures,        and the

lack of consensus about optimal de-trending techniques, we employ four different de-trending

methodologies,

        First, we take simple fourth-differences     of the (logs of the) variables (i.e., we subtract the

fourth lag of e.g., real GDP from the current value), multiplying by 100 (so that the resulting

variable can be interpreted as a growth rate). Second, we de-trend the variables by examining the

residual from a regression of the variable on a linear time trend, a quadratic time trend, and three

quarterly dummies.     Third, we de-trend the variables using the well-known Hodrick-Prescott

(“HP”) filter (using the traditional smoothing parameter of 1600). Finally, we apply the HP filter

to the residual of a regression of the variable on a constant and quarterly dummies.

        We have also constructed a fifih transformation        of our dependent variable. This is similar

to our second variant in that we de-trend the variables by examining the residual fi-om a regression

of the variable on a set of controls,    But we add a control which is meant to account for the

dependency of the economy to imported oil price shocks. In particular, we take the real price of

oil (the price of oil in dollars per barrel, divided by the CPI for industrial countries), and multiply

it by net exports of&e], expressed as a percentage of nominal GDP. This variable, meant to

measure the degree of dependency on imported oil, is then added to our other antrol              variables

including linear and quadratic time trends, and quarterly dummies.

        Mer appropriately transforming our variables, we are able to compute bilateral

correlations for real activity, These correlations are estimated (for a given concept of real

economic activity), behveen two countries over a given span of time.           Thus, for instance, we

estimate the correlation between real GDP de-trended with the HP filter for two countries i and j

over the first part of our sample period. We begin by splitting our sample into four equally-size

parts: the beginning of the sample through 1967Q3; 1967Q4 through 1976Q2; 1976Q3 through


future work we hope to include developing countries. We thti   Tam Bayoumi for providing these data.

1985Q1; and 1985Q2 through the end of the sample. Since we have twenty-one countries, we are

thus lefi with a sample size of 840 observations; 210 bilateral country-pair correlations

[%21x.20)/2], with four observations (over different time periods) per country-pair.

        While our three measures of trade intensity are similar to one another, the same is not true

of our sixteen measures of business cycle correlations.    Both the measure of economic activity

(GDP/industnal    production   etc.) and the de-trending technique matter (though all sixteen

measures of bilateral activity correlation are positively correlated with each other),   Figure 3

graphs different of business cycle correlations against each other, holding the de-trending method

constant (at fourth-differencing)   but allowing the underlying activity measure to vary. Figure 4 is

an analog which vanes the de-trending technique but only portrays real GDP. Since the

international business cycle correlations are so impetiectly related to one another, we check the

sensitivity of our results extensively.



IV.b    Econometric     Methodology

        The regressions we estimate take the form:



                 Corr(v,s)ij,l = a + ~Trade(w) iJ,~ + GiJ,r.




Corr(v,s)ti,r denotes the correlation between couniry i and count~j over time span r for activity

concept v (corresponding    to: real GDP (denoted “y”); industrial production (i); employment (e);

or the unemployment     rate (u)), de-trended with methods (corresponding    to: fourth-differencing

(d); quadratic de-trending (t); HP-filtering (h); HP-filtering on the SA residual (s); or quadratic

de-trending with the oil control (o)). Trade(w) iJ,l denotes the natural logarithm of the average



                                                    14
bilateral trade intensity between country i and country j over time span ~ using trade intensi~

concept w (corresponding       to: export weights (x); import weights (m); or total trade weights (t)).

Finally, s ~,. represents the myriad influences on bilateral real activity correlations above and

beyond the influences of international trade, and a and ~ are the regression coefficients to be

estimated.

        We have sixteen versions of the regressand (as we consider four activity concepts and four

de-trending methods) and three versions of the regressor (since we have three sets of trade

weights).     We estimate all 48 versions of our regression to check results for robustness,

        The object of interest to us is the slope coefficient ~. We are interested in both the sign

and the size of the coefficient.    The sign of the slope tells us whether the Eichengreen-Krugman

specialization effect dominates (in which case we would expect a negative ~, since more intense

trading relations would be expect to lead to more idiosyncratic business cycles and hence a lower

wrrelations      of economic activity) or the expected traditional effect prevails (in which case ~

would be expected to be positive).       The size of the coefficient allows us to quanti~ the economic

importance of this effect.

        A simple OLS regression of bilateral activity income correlations on trade intensity maybe

inappropriate.     Countries are likely deliberately to link their currencies to those of some of their

most important trading partners, in order to capture gains associated with greater exchange rate

stability. In doing so, they lose the ability to set monetary policy independently of those

neighbors,     The fact that their monetary policy will be closely tied to that of their neighbors could

result in an obsewed positive association between trade links and income links. In other words,

the association could be the rewlt of countries’ application of the OCA criterion, rather than an

aspect of economic structure that is invariant to exchange rate regimes.


                                                     15
         To identi~ the effect of bilateral trade patterns on income correlations in such

circumstances, we need exogenous determinants of bilateral trade patterns.                 Such determinants

muld be used as instrumental variables to produce consistent estimates of ~, Our prefemed set of

instrumental variables includes the most basic variables of the well-known “gravity” model of

bilateral trade: distance between the pair of countries in question, and dummy variables for

common border or language.          (We examine our “first-stage” instrument equations explicitly

below.)”


         Parenthetically,   estimation of the standard error for ~ is potentially complicated.             Our

observations may not be independent; the e.g., French-Belgian observation for the first quarter of

the sample may depend on either the French-Belgian observation for the second quarter, or the

French-Dutch     observation for the first quarter (or both). We ignore such potential dependencies

in computing our covariance matrices, and instead try simply not to take their precise size too

seriously. It turns out there is no need to do so, but this is a possible extension for future

research.l 1



v.       Empirical Resu!ts

         We begin our analysis with simple ordinary least squares,             Consistent with our priors,

estimation with instrumental variables turns out to deliver the same message even more strongly.

V.a      OLS Work

         Ordinary least squares (OLS) estimates of ~ are tabulated in Table 1. The estimates, along

with their standard errors, are presented in three columns, corresponding               to the three different


10 LnstrumenM variable estimation is also appropriate since the regressors are measured with error.
]1 The data set revds few signs of such dependenq. White covariance matrices are very similar to traditional
ones; non-parametric tests for dependencies across periods reveal no trends; boot-strapping our standard errors
results in very similar standard error estimates. Parenthetically, our IV standard errors should be consistent in the
                                                          16
measures of bilateral trade intensity. For each measure, sixteen estimates (four measures of

economic activity each de-trended in four different ways) are presented in the rows.

        The estimates indicate that a closer trade linkage between two countries is strongly and

consistently associated with more tightly correlated economic activity between the two countries.

The size of this effect depends on the exact measure of emnomic activity (as is expected), but

does not depend ve~ sensitively on the exact method of de-trending the data or the measure of

bilateral trade intensity. Parenthetically, the adjustment for the oil price reduces the size of the

coefficients slightly, although they remain positive and significant.

        We have checked these results in a number of different ways, and they seem to be robust.

For instance, a consistently positive estimate of ~ appears whether or not the trade intensity

measure is transformed by natural logarithms, and whether or not the observations are weighted

by country size. More importantly, the results do not appear to be very sensitive to the exact

sample chosen. The data from the last quarter of the sample show more evidence of a strongly

positive estimate of ~ than does that from the first quarter, but the exact choice of countries does

not matter. We have also tested for the importance of important non-linearities in the relationship

between trade intensity and activity correlations by estimating the equation with a non-parametric

data smoother (similar to locally weighted regression but without neighborhood         weighting); the

non-linear effects are typically statistically insignificant and the strong positive effect of trade

intensity on business cycle correlations is not affected. Adding either time-specific or country-

specific “fixed effect” controls (or both) also does not affect the sign or statistical significance of

~. Finally, we have split our data set into two sub-periods across time (instead of four), and re-

estimated our equations.     The resulting point-estimates   of ~ remain quite similar to those recorded

in Table 1.


presenm of generated regressors.                    17
         The issue of simultaneous causation is potentially serious, since integration is itself

endogenous.      For this reason, we take instrumental variable (IV) estimates of ~ more seriously

than our OLS estimates.       We use three instrumental variables: the natural logarithm of the

distance between the business centers of the relevant pair of countries; a dummy variable for

geographic adjacency; and a dummy variable which indicates if the pair of countries share a

common language.       Each of these variables is expected to be correlated with bilateral trade

intensity, but can reasonably be expected to be unaffected by other conditions which affect the

bilateral correlation of economic activity.

        Direct evidence on the “first-stage” linear projections of (the natural logarithm o~ bilateral

period-average    trade intensity on our three favored instrumental variables is presented in Table 2.

Distance (more precisely, the natural log thereof) is strongly negatively associated with trade

intensity, as predicted by standard “gravity” models of international trade. Countries that share

either a common border or a common language also have significantly more trade than others.

The fist-stage    equations appear to fit relatively well,

        Also included in Table 2 is a minor perturbation to our standard first-stage equatio~

namely the “default equation”, augmented by a variable registering membership in a regional trade

agreement,    There are two relevant agreements: 1) the US/Canada FT& and its successor,

NAFT& and 2) the EEC/EC.’2 Membership in a regional trading agreement is strongly

associated with more intense international trade in both an economic and statistical sense. Entry

into a regional trade agreement appears to raise bilateral trade intensity by almost 50°/0 (although

firther effects may also appear later on). ~lle          the variable appears to be approximately

orthogonal to our three default instrumental variables, we do not use it as one of our default


12 We compute this variable by taking a pair-specfic indicator variable (e.g., unity for UK/France in 1975, zero for
tie US/Japan in 1975) and estimating sub-period averages over time (e.g., the sub-period for the last quarter of the

                                                        18
instrumental variables since it is potentially associated with tighter income correlations directly

(e.g., through exchange rate arrangements; there is a high correlation between EC and EMS

membership),     Happily, our ~ estimates are insensitive to inclusion or exclusion of the extra

instrumental variable.



V.b      Instrumental     Variable Estimation

         Instrumental variable estimates of j3 (estimated with our three default instrumental

variables) are tabulated in Table 3, which is a direct analog to Table 1. As expected, the results

are consistent with the OLS results of Table 1, but they are somewhat stronger in both economic

and statistical significance,    The effect of greater intensity of international trade on the correlation

of economic activity remains strongly positive and statistically significant, but is larger than the

simple OLS estimates indicate (though we try not to interpret the t-statistics too literally, given

the potential problems of cross-sectional       or inter-temporal    dependency).      The oil-adjusted results

are now slightly large than the other coefficients.

         As with the OLS results, our IV estimates of ~ are robust to a wide range of perturbations

to our basic econometric methodology.           We have performed all the experiments mentioned in

conjunction with Table 1 without disturbing our central results. We have also changed the list of

instrumental variables in a number of different ways without changing our results. For instance,

adding dummy variables for membership in GATT or regional trade arrangements as extra

instrumental variables does not change our results, as does adding country population and output.



V.c     More Sensitivity Analysis

                                                        19
         We have augmented our relationship by adding a dummy variable that is unity if the two

countries shared a bilateral fixed exchange rate throughout the sample. This is an important test.

The Bayoumi-Eichengreen          view is that the high correlation among European incomes is a result

not of trade links, but of Europeans’ decision to relinquish monetary independence vis-a-vis their

neighbors.    If this is correct, putting the exchange regime variable explicitly on the right-hand side

should show the effect, and the apparent effect of the trade and geography variables should

disappear.    Instead, the addition of this exchange rate variable does not significantly alter ~. The

actual estimates are provided in Table 4, which is an analog of Table 3 (with the same

instrumental variables) when the equation is augmented by an indicator variable which is unity if

the pair of countries maintained a mutually fixed exchange rate during the relevant sample period.

For simplicity, only the results with total trade weights are reported.               The positive ~ coefficient

still appears quite strong; indeed its sign and magnitude is essentially unchanged from Table 3. By

way of contrast, the effect of a fixed exchange rate regime per se is not well determined.                    The

coefficients vary in sign and magnitude depending on the exact measure of economic activity and

de-trending method used to compute the bilateral activity correlation, 13

         Global oil price shocks are thought to be a major source of positively correlated business

cycles, regardless of the exchange rate regime. We have petiormed a direct check for the

importance of oil price shocks by augmenting our relationship with a variable meant to measure

the degree of dependency on imported oil. The oil shock variable (the same used to adjust the oil-

adjusted regressands tabulated in Tables 1 and 3) is the product of two variables: the real price of

oil (the price of oil in dollars per barrel, divided by the CPI for industrial countries), and net

exports of fiel, expressed as a percentage of nominal GDP. We add the oil shock variable to our

indicator variable.

default regression and estimate the coefficients with instrumental variables.    The results are

presented in Table 5. There are two sets of columns. The second is a minor perturbatio~            in that

the extra regressor is the percentage change of the real oil price multiplied by next exports of

fiel.   AgaiL as in Table 4, the same instrumental variables as in Table 3 are used, and for

simplicity, only the results with total trade weights are reported.

         The positive ~ coeticient   still appears quite strong; indeed its sign and magnitude is

essentially unchanged horn Tables 3 and 4. By way of contrast, the effect of oil price dependency

is not firmly established.   The coefficients vary in sign and magnitude when the level of the oil

price is used, When the percentage change of the oil price is used, the oil price regressor has a

consistently positive (though not always significant) coefficient. But the durable sign and

significance of ~ is unaffected.



VL       A Conclusion

         In this paper we have considered the relationship between two of the criteria used to

determine whether a country is a member of an optimum currency area. From a theoretical

viewpoint, the effect of increased trade integration on the cross-country    correlation of business

cycle activity is ambiguous.    Reduced trade barriers can result in increased industrial specialization

by country and therefore more asynchronous business cycles resulting from industry-specific

shocks. On the other hand, increased integration may result in more highly correlated business

cycles because of demand shocks or intra-industry trade.

         This ambiguity is theoretical rather than empirical, Using a panel of thirty years of data

from twenty industrialized countries, we find a strong positive relationship between the degree of

bilateral trade intensity and the cross-country bilateral correlation of business cycle activity. That



                                                    21
is, greater integration historically has resulted in more highly synchronized cycles.

        The endogenous nature of the relationship between various OCA criteria is a

straightforward   application of the celebrated Lucas Critique.   Still, it has considerable relevance

for the current debate on Economic and Moneta~         Union in Europe.   For instance, some countries

may appear, on the basis of historical data, to be poor candidates for EMU entry. But EMU entry

per se, for whatever reason, may provide a substantial impetus for trade expansion; this in turn

may result in more highly correlated business cycles. That is, a country is more likely to satisfi

the criteria for entry into a currency union ex post than ex ante.
