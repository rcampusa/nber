                                          ABSTRACT

This paper is about the spending choices of youth, with a particular focus on how the demand for
cigarettes, alcohol and marijuana are influenced by changes in the prices of other products. Youth
tend to have small incomes and limited wants, with the result that many students spend the bulk of
their income on only a few items. Fast food, clothing and entertainment make up the majority of
products purchased by teenagers. The hypothesis to be tested in this project is that changes in the
prices of the other goods commonly bought by teenagers will affect budget allocations and thereby
affect the demand for substances. We estimate own and cross price effects using the prices of
cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana and other consumer products including gasoline, clothing,
entertainment, and fast food. Income effects are also estimated and show that teens with higher
incomes and allowances are more likely to use substances. The policy implications of the results are
discussed.

1. Introduction

       Teenage “bad” behaviors, including smoking, drinking and drugs use, have been the

cause for much concern over recent years. Many public and private resources have been devoted

to the reduction of these behaviors, with efforts ranging from anti-use campaigns to community

education to excise tax increases and even a war (i.e. the war on drugs). The tremendous effort

exerted to reduce teenage substance use is not unwarranted. Current estimates show that 23.2

percent of 12th graders smoke, 47 percent drink alcohol and 23.1 percent use illegal drugs

(Johnston et al. 2005a; 2005b). The harm which can result from these behaviors include poor

schooling and labor market outcomes, violence, crime, injury and even death (Chaloupka and

Warner 2000; Cook and Moore 2000).

       Economist have tended to focus their research on the ways in which policy tools--

primarily excise taxes--can reduce teenage smoking and drinking. Other policies that have been

studied include laws relating to drunk driving, youth access laws (pertaining to both alcohol and

cigarettes), clean indoor air laws, and fines and penalties associated with drug use. This paper

extends this research by examining the effects of prices of other items in a teenager’s budget

constraint on their demand for cigarettes, alcohol and marijuana. Youth tend to have small

incomes and limited wants, with the result that many students spend the bulk of their income on

only a few items. Fast food, clothing and entertainment make up the majority of products

purchased by teenagers (Klein 1998). We explore the possibility that changes in the prices of the

other goods commonly bought by teenagers will affect budget allocations and thereby affect the

demand for alcohol, marijuana and cigarettes. We pay particular attention to the role of

increasing gasoline prices in affecting substance use since gasoline may be an important




                                                 1
component of the budget for some teenagers. The policy implications of higher gas taxes and

other excise taxes are discussed.



2. Background

Sources of Income

       Teenagers primarily get their income from allowances, wages, and gifts (Meeks 1998;

Doss et al. 1995). McNeal (1990) estimates that family members supply 83 percent of a child’s

income while the rest comes from outside the home. Estimates of the proportion of children

receiving allowances range from a high of 90 percent (Doss et al. 1995) to a low of 50 percent

(Meeks 1998).

       The Bureau of Labor Statistics reports that during the 1996-1998 period 2.9 million

youths ages 15-17 worked during the school months and 4 million worked during the summer

months. The probability of working increases with age, with only 9 percent of 15 year olds

working during the school year and 18 percent working during the summer, while 26 and 36

percent of 16 year olds work during the school year and summer, respectively. Thirty-nine

percent of 17 year olds work during the school year and 48 percent work in the summer (BLS

2000). Earnings of these working teens are fairly low. Sixty-three percent earn less than $2,000

per year, 32 percent earn between $2,000 and $5,000 per year, and 7 percent earn more than

$5,000 (Johnson and Lino 2000).

       Meeks (1998) finds that teenage girls are more likely to earn money from wages (55

percent for girls versus 47 percent for boys), while boys are more likely to earn money from paid

jobs at home (50 percent for boys versus 38 percent for girls). A recent poll of teenagers ages

12-17 found that 73 percent of teens earn money from doing odd jobs and 36 percent hold down




                                                2
a regular or part-time job (Coinstar 2003). These earnings outrank parents and gifts as the

primary source of spending money.



Expenditures

       One estimate of teenage expenditures shows that in 1994 teens had an aggregate income

of $96 billion and spent 68 percent of that income (Zollo 1995). Studies highlighting exact

products on which teens spend their incomes are scant, although it is known that most of a

teenager’s income is used for discretionary purchases (Meeks 1998). Doss et al. (1995) report

that middle school children ages 10-15 spend 73 percent of their income, save 18 percent and use

the rest on gifts. Younger children may have different spending habits as Belk et al (1985) show

in a study of seventh graders. These children spend 39 percent of their income on themselves,

save 37 percent, and spend the rest on gift purchases. Teenage contributions to household

expenses are also very low. Using data from the National Survey of Families and Households,

Meeks (1998) finds that only 20 percent of teens are expected to contribute to family expenses.

       The products that youth buy and the corresponding spending patterns differ by gender but

typically most income is spent on clothing, stereos and music, televisions, eating out, gas,

recreation, gifts and personal expenses (Bachman 1983; Doss et al. 1995; Bailey 1992; Zollo

1995). In studies that examine the proportion of income spent on certain products, food and

clothing top the list. Doss et al. (1995) find that 26 percent of middle school children’s total

income is spent on clothing, 9 percent is spent on food, 6 percent is spent each on

books/magazines and sports/recreation, and 5 percent is spent on videos and movies. Older

children have slightly different spending habits. Klein (1998) finds that 34 percent of teenagers’




                                                  3
expenditures go towards clothing, 22 percent go for entertainment and 16 percent go towards

food. The most popular items within each of these categories are jeans, music and fast food.

       Transportation is a major source of expenditures for families with teenagers, particularly

those families with employed teenagers. Johnson and Lino (2000) analyze the 1997-1998

Consumer Expenditure Survey and find that transportation accounts for 26.2 percent of total

expenses for households with an employed teen, compared to 22.5 percent for households with

teens who are not employed. The authors hypothesize that “teenage employment likely results in

families driving more miles in a vehicle, using public transportation more often, or even having a

second vehicle.” (p 19) This indicates that transportation expenses, including gas prices, are

likely have an influence on a teenager’s probability of working and the hours or days worked.

       Data on expenditures on alcohol, cigarettes and illegal drugs by teenagers are not readily

available for the U.S. However, a survey of Dutch teenagers measured spending patterns for 20

categories of goods. In 1992, the latest year reported by Warnaar and Van Pragg (1997), average

monthly expenditures by students were the highest among the following categories: clothes and

shoes (103 Dfl.), alcoholic beverages (95 Dfl.), savings (76 Dfl.), drugs (72 Dfl.), school books

(67 Dfl.) and smoking (63 Dfl.). Note that the average expenditure amounts are calculated only

for students who report buying the product. Only 37 percent of students report buying alcoholic

beverages, 24 percent smoke, and 6 percent report buying drugs.

       Using an Almost Ideal Demand System, Warnaar and Van Pragg (1997) estimate some

cross price elasticites that are relevant for this study. They use pseudo-prices of clothing, school,

traveling (i.e. public and private transport) and magazines in the system. These pseudo-prices

are the fraction of expenditure that adolescents have to pay themselves, with parents acting as co-

spenders paying the rest. They find that as the pseudo-price of clothing and magazines increases




                                                  4
(the student pays more of the total) the share of alcohol in the budget decreases. A similar result

holds for the category of vice which includes expenditures on gambling and drugs. The share of

tobacco in the budget, by contrast, is not statistically related to these cross prices except for girls

when the price of clothing is considered, and boys, when travel expenses are considered. These

results hold in only one of the two years analyzed. The authors also find that the income

elasticities of alcohol, tobacco, and vice (gambling and drugs) are all positive and greater than

one for teens of both genders. However, having a job, ceteris paribus, lowers spending on

tobacco and vice.


The relationships between drugs, alcohol, and cigarettes for youth.

        There is much debate in the existing literature as to whether cigarettes, drugs, and alcohol

are complement or substitute goods. Differences in the age of the sample respondents, time

periods, level of consumption (individual vs. state aggregate), measures of substance use,

measures of prices and methodology all contribute to the diverging estimates among studies.

Even the subset of literature on teenagers reaches contradictory conclusions.

        Alcohol and Marijuana: The bulk of the evidence shows that alcohol and marijuana are

substitutes for youth (Theis and Register 1993; Chaloupka and Laixuthai 1997; Chaloupka et al.

1999; DiNardo and Lemieux 2001), although Pacula (1998) finds alcohol and marijuana to be

complements among teenagers and Williams et al. (2004) finds the same result for college

students. Theis and Register (1993), Williams et al. (2004), Chaloupka and Laixuthai (1997),

Chaloupka et al. (1999) and Pacula (1998) all use individual level data and look at participation

decisions, and the latter three studies also examine quantity decisions conditional on

participation. DiNardo and Lemieux (2001) examine state level rates of use. In these studies,

the price of alcohol is measured by beer prices (Chaloupka and Laixuthai 1997), beer taxes



                                                   5
(Chaloupka et al. 1999, Pacula 1998; Williams et al. 2004) or by the alcohol component of the

CPI (DiNardo and Lemieux 2001). All of these papers include as a measure of the price of

marijuana an indicator of whether or not the state has decriminalized the possession of small

amounts of marijuana for personal use. Two studies also use a measure of the monetary price of

marijuana (Chaloupka and Laizuthai 1997 and Williams et al. 2004). Pacula (1998) includes an

additional proxy for the price of marijuana which is the crime per officer ratio. It is this variable,

not the decriminalization variable used in the other studies, that shows complementarity with

alcohol consumption, which partly explains why her results differs from the others.

       Alcohol and Cigarettes: Only a few studies have examined specifically the relationship

between alcohol and cigarettes consumption for youth, although a number of other studies have

examined this relationship among adults (Picone et al. 2004; Goel and Morey 1995; Bask and

Melkersson 2004; Cameron and Williams 2001; Zhou and Harris 2004). The literature for both

youth and adults shows very mixed results. Among youth in the United States, Dee (1999) finds

that alcohol and cigarettes are complements. Using state-level rates of smoking and drinking for

teenagers, Dee estimates reduced form models, where consumption is regressed on own and

cross prices, and structural models, where consumption of the other good is entered on the right

hand side of the equation. Both models suggest that alcohol and cigarettes are complements.

Using individual level data, Chaloupka et al. (1999) and Williams et al. (2004) also find evidence

of complementarity between these two goods for high school age children and college students,

respectively, but their estimates are statistically insignificant. Pacula (1998) finds that the

coefficient on the cigarette taxes in the probability of drinking equation is positive and

significant, implying that smoking and drinking are substitutes. However, this relationship does

not persist when the frequency of drinking is considered.




                                                  6
       Cigarettes and Marijuana: The evidence regarding the relationship between cigarettes

and marijuana consumption for youth is extremely limited. Farrelly et al. (2001) find evidence

of a complementary relationship for youth ages 12-20. A similar result arises in Chaloupka et al.

(1999), but only when marijuana consumption is regressed on the price of cigarettes.

Insignificant coefficients result when cigarette consumption is regressed on the proxies for the

price of marijuana. In addition, the studies by Pacula (1998) and Williams et al. (2004) find no

statistically significant relationship between the price of cigarettes and marijuana consumption.


3. Theory

       The relevant theory for this paper is the basic theory of consumer demand. We ignore the

role of addiction in determining the demand for cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana primarily

because we estimate models for teenagers who are typically not addicted to these substances,

who may discount the future heavily and who may lack information about their capacity to

become addicted (Grossman et al. 1994; Glied 2002; Ross and Chaloupka 2003). Following

Pacula (1998) and Dinardo and Limieux (2001) , the model starts with a utility function that

includes alcohol (A), cigarettes (C), marijuana (M), and a vector of other goods purchased by

teenagers (G).

1)     U =u(A, C, M, G).

The youth maximizes utility subject to a budget constraint:

2)     I = PaA + PcC + PmM + PgG,

and

3)     A    0, C   0, M   0, G   0.

In the budget constraint, total youth income (I) consists of earned and unearned income, the latter

of which includes allowances and gifts. Income is spent on the goods described in the utility



                                                 7
function. The prices of alcohol (Pa), cigarettes (Pc) and the vector of prices of other goods (Pg)

are monetary prices. Data on the market price of marijuana (Pm) are difficult to obtain and

therefore will be represented by the statutory monetary penalty that a person may incur if caught

possessing marijuana. Details on all price measures are below.

       The constraints laid out in equation (3) allow for both interior solutions (positive levels of

consumption) and corner solutions (abstinence). The Kuhn-Tucker conditions resulting from the

maximization problem take the general form:

4)     Us – Ps     0, S[Us – Ps] = 0

where S is one of the commodities in the utility function and is the marginal utility of income.

       For positive values of consumption, the youth will consume at the point where the

marginal gain in utility equals the marginal loss in terms of utility. Participation decisions for

each substance are determined by comparing the marginal benefits to the marginal loss,

evaluated at a zero consumption level. For any specific S, when the loss is greater than the

benefit, a youth will abstain. Note that when substances are complements or substitutes, the

probability of use of one substance will depend in part of the marginal utility of the other

substances. Dinardo and Limieux (2001) consider the joint decision to consume alcohol and

marijuana and present a detailed theoretical model deriving the possible combinations of use and

abstinence. We refer the reader to their paper for details.

       The basic reduced form demand equations that are derived for both the probability of use

and the quantity consumed conditional on use take the same general form:

5)     A = a(Pa, Pc, Pm, Pg, I),

6)     C = c(Pa, Pc, Pm, Pg, I),

7)     M = m(Pa, Pc, Pm, Pg, I).




                                                  8
Equations 5, 6, and 7 are estimated below. Our interest lies not only in the signs of the

coefficients on the own and cross prices of alcohol, cigarettes, and marijuana, but also of Pg, the

vector of prices of other goods in the budget constraint. Specifically, these are the prices of

gasoline, clothing, movies, bowling, sporting goods, soda, and fast food.

       Linear probability models are used to estimate all probability equations and Ordinary

Least Squares is used for the frequency models. The standard errors in all models are adjusted

for clustering at the state level. Also, all prices and income variables are expressed in real (1982-

1984) dollars.

       These demand equations provide estimates of gross (Marshallian) cross price effects. For

purposes of public policy, the gross price effects are relevant since they represent the total

change in quantity resulting from a change in price, irrespective of whether the source of the

change is an income or substitution effect. From a public health perspective, for example, a

reduction in cigarettes smoked resulting from a tax increase is desirable no matter whether the

reduction comes from people substituting away from smoking in order to consume other goods

that provide utility, or whether it comes from a reduction in the available amount of income to

spend on all goods. One caveat with the gross estimates is that the relationships between the

goods need not be symmetric.



4. Data

       Data on individuals come from the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997 Cohort

(NLSY97). The NLSY97 is a nationally representative sample of 9,022 youths aged 12-16 as of

December 31, 1996. The first wave was conducted in 1997, with follow-ups annually. The last

wave used in this paper is the 2001 wave (which includes some interviews conducted in 2002)




                                                  9
because this represents the last year with a significant number of respondents still in high school.

We limit the sample to high school students because we want to capture the time period for

which the students are most likely to be in school, live with their parents, derive most of their

income from part-time work or allowances, and have limited wants and expenditures.

       In each year of the survey the respondents are asked about their current smoking,

drinking and marijuana use. The responses to these questions are used to construct six different

dependent variables. For each substance, a indicator of probability of use is constructed as well

as a measure of consumption among current users.

       Participation in current smoking is a represented by a dichotomous indicator that equals

one for respondents who indicated that they smoked cigarettes in the 30 days prior to the survey

and is equal to zero otherwise. Participation in drinking is represented by a dichotomous

indicator equal to 1 for respondents who indicate that they drank any amount of alcohol in the 30

days prior to the survey and is equal to zero otherwise. A similar marijuana participation

measure is created based on whether the respondent had smoked any amount of marijuana in the

30 days prior to the survey.

       Average smoking among current smokers is a continuous measure of monthly cigarette

consumption based on the number of days each smoker smoked in the past 30 days multiplied by

the average number of cigarettes smoked per day on days smoked. This number is divided by 20

to get the number of packs smoked per month. Average drinking among current drinkers is a

continuous measure of monthly alcohol consumption based on the number of days each person

drank in the past 30 days multiplied by the average number of drinks consumed per day on days

that they drank. Lastly, frequency of marijuana use among users is represented by the number of

days in the past 30 on which the respondent used marijuana.




                                                 10
       Table 1 shows the proportions and means of the substance use variables. Twenty-two

percent of the respondents in high school are current smokers, 29 percent are current drinkers

and 12 percent smoke marijuana. The average consumption among current smokers is 7.4 packs

of cigarettes per month, the average consumption among current drinkers is 34 drinks per month,

and marijuana is used an average of 9 days by users.

       Table 1 also shows summary statistics for only those students who have a driver’s

license. We impose this restriction on the sample in the regressions so that we can examine the

effects of higher gas prices on the substance use behaviors of teenagers who drive and who

therefore are much more likely to have gasoline expenditures in the budget constraint. This

group of students is obviously older than the full sample and displays different substance use

patterns. Among this group, 27 percent smoke, 41 percent drink alcohol, and 15 percent use

marijuana. Average levels of consumption is only slightly higher. Smokers consume 8.3 packs

of cigarettes per month, drinkers consume 35 drinks per month, and marijuana is used an average

of 9 days per month.

       In all regression models, certain characteristics of the youth and family are included as

additional regressors: age, gender, race (black, Hispanic, mixed race, and all other races as the

omitted reference category) household size, and family structure (child lives with no parents,

child lives with a step parent, child lives with one parent, and child lives with both parents as the

omitted reference category). Youth income is measured separately by earned income and

allowances from parents. Earned income includes money from salary, wages, odd jobs,

temporary or seasonal jobs, commission and tips. Parental income is also included along with an

indicator if this income is missing. Table 1 shows means and standard deviations for all of these

variables.




                                                 11
        It is important to account for as much of the unobserved heterogeneity in the error term as

possible that may be correlated with prices and consumption. To do so, all models include

indicators for the survey year, the female labor force participation rate in the state, the percent of

state residents with at least a college degree, and the unemployment rate of the state. Beyond

including these variables, we take two alternative approaches to the heterogeneity problem. The

first is to include state fixed effects which will account for time-invariant state-level sentiment

towards the outcomes. However, the state fixed effects tend to be highly correlated with the

prices, and including them can result in the problems of multicollinearity and induce wide

swings in the magnitude and significance of the price coefficients. The alternative approach we

take is to exclude the state fixed effects and include other variables designed to represent the

characteristics of the state that may be correlated with substance use. These models contain

indicators for the nine census regions of the country and two variables that are specific to the

beer and cigarette industries. The first is an indicator for whether the respondent lives in one of

the six tobacco producing states: Kentucky, North Carolina, Georgia, South Carolina,

Tennessee, and Virginia. The second is the number of persons in each state employed in

breweries.1 These data come from the Beer Institute for 2004. Both of these variables reflect a

strong presence of the industry in the state, which in turn may influence legislated tax rates, and

state sentiment towards using the products.

        Prices

        Cigarette price data were obtained from the annual Tax Burden on Tobacco. Until 1999,

the Tobacco Institute published state level cigarette prices, since then, Orzechowski and Walker

(2001) have published the data. The prices are weighted averages for a pack of 20 cigarettes and

1
 Models were tested with the per capita number of employees and results do not change. The absolute number of
employees is used as a proxy for presence of large breweries within the state.


                                                      12
are inclusive of state level excise taxes applied to cigarettes but are exclusive of local cigarette

taxes. The cigarette price data are merged in with the survey data based on the quarter and year

of the interview and the state of residence.

       ACCRA provides market prices for a number of different consumer goods in the Inter-

City Cost of Living Index. Price are available quarterly for between 250 and 300 cities, although

not all cities are represented in every quarter of data. From ACCRA, we use the prices of the

following consumer products: 1) a six-pack of beer; 2) a man’s long sleeve dress shirt; 3) a first

run evening movie ticket; 4) a game of bowling on a Saturday night; 5) a can of 3 Wilson or

Penn brand tennis balls; 6) a 2-liter bottle of Coca Cola; 7) a ¼ lb hamburger sandwich with

cheese from McDonalds; 8) an 11-12’’ pizza from Pizza Hut or Pizza Inn; and 9) a thigh and

drumstick chicken meal from KFC or Church’s. These products are chosen because they

represent the categories of products commonly consumed by teenagers. The ACCRA prices are

merged with the NLSY97 data by year and quarter of interview and residence. The merge based

on location depends on whether a respondent lives within an area represented in the ACCRA

data. NLSY97 reports the county of residence for all respondents. All ACCRA cities are placed

in a county, and all counties are placed within a Core Based Statistical Area (CBSA). The

merging of prices to the NLSY data therefore is done first based on county and second by CBSA.

When a respondent lives in a CBSA that does not have an ACCRA city, the respondent is

assigned a state price which is simply the average price of the ACCRA cities in that state.

Dummy variables indicating the level of the residential match are included in all regressions.

       No reliable state-level data are available for the price of marijuana. Following Farrelly et

al. (2001) and Williams et al. (2004) we use the midpoint of the statutory minimum and

maximum monetary penalty for possession of a small amount of marijuana to represent this




                                                  13
monetary price. These fines come from state statutes, collected by the lawyers and policy

analysts for the ImpacTeen Illicit Drug Team.

        Monthly gasoline prices come from the U.S. Department of Energy, Energy Information

Administration., and data on state and federal gas taxes come from U.S. Department of

Transportation Federal Highway Administration. The monthly price and tax data were combined

to create the full price, inclusive of sales and excise taxes, on gallon of regular grade gasoline.

These gas prices are merged with the NLSY97 data based on the respondent’s state and the

month and year of the interview.



RESULTS

       Tables 2, 3 and 4 show the results of the participation demand equations for cigarettes,

alcohol, and marijuana respectively. The columns 1 and 3 include the region dummies, the

indicator for tobacco producing states, and employment in breweries, and columns 2 and 4

include instead the state fixed effects. The models in columns 1 and 2 include all individuals in

high school, while in columns 3 and 4, the sample is limited to those individuals who report

having a driver’s license. This restriction is imposed so that we can examine the effects of

higher gas prices on the substance use behaviors of teenagers who drive and who therefore are

much more likely to have gasoline expenditures in the budget constraint.



Smoking Participation: Own Price and Cross Price Effects

       Table 2 shows the results for the probability of smoking. The first result to note is the

negative own price effect, and these coefficients are statistically significant in three of the four

models. As expected, adding the state dummies to the models changes the size of the




                                                  14
coefficients and standard errors. In column order, the elasticities of demand are -0.43 and -0.26

for the full sample and -0.53 and -1.03 for drivers.

         The results also show some interesting cross price elasticities with regard to the

probability of smoking. Higher fines for marijuana use are negatively related to the probability

of smoking and are statistically significant in three of the four models. The beer price

coefficients are negative in three of the four models, but are statistically insignificant. The

coefficient on gasoline prices, by contrast, are positive and statistically significant in all models

indicating that gas is a substitute for cigarettes.2 The magnitude of this effect increases when the

sample is limited to drivers only. The elasticity of the probability of smoking with respect to gas

taxes is approximately 0.30 for the full sample and 0.41 for drivers.

          Few of the other consumer products are related to the probability of smoking, and those

that are, vary according to the sample under consideration. The different effects are not

surprising since the sample of drivers tend to be older, work more and earn more. For the full

sample of teens, bowling is a complement to smoking, while none of the other products displays

a relationship. For the sample of drivers, bowling is no longer related, but here fast food chicken

may be a substitute good.



Drinking Participation: Own Price and Cross Price Effects

         Table 3 contains the results for the probability of drinking. The own price effects for the

probability of drinking are negative and statistically significant for the full sample and negative,

but not significant for the sample of drivers. The elasticities of participation are inelastic and

average -0.37 for the full sample and -0.17 for drivers.

 Teens who do not have a driver’s license may still incur gasoline expenditures if they contribute to their peer’s
driving expenses in exchange for rides.


                                                         15
       Recall that the cross price effect of the price of beer on the probability of smoking

implies complementarity (without achieving statistical significance). When the probability of

drinking is considered, however, the cross price effect is positive and statically significant in the

full sample, implying that beer and cigarettes are substitutes. Recall that in Marshallian demand

estimates, symmetry is not guaranteed.

       The fines associated with marijuana use are negatively related to the probability of

drinking for the full sample when state fixed effects are excluded, but are positively related in the

sample of drivers when state fixed effects are included. Gas prices are negatively related and

achieve significance in the sample of drivers. The models also present some evidence that

bowling, clothing, and fast food chicken may all be complements to the probability of drinking.

However, pizza appears to be a substitute for drinking participation.



Marijuana Participation: Own Price and Cross Price Effects

       Table 4 contains the results for the probability of using marijuana. The own price effects

for the probability of marijuana use are measured very imprecisely. However, the coefficients on

cigarette prices are positive and statistically significant in three of the four models. These results

indicate that marijuana and cigarettes are substitute goods, which is contrary to the relationship

implied in Table 2.

       Beer prices are negatively related to the probability of marijuana use for the full sample,

but the coefficients are at about the 10 percent level of significance. Gas prices are not related to

the probability of marijuana use, nor are many of the other consumer products. However,

bowling and fast food hamburgers may be complements to the probability of marijuana use.




                                                 16
Frequency of Substance Use

        Full results for the frequency of smoking, drinking and marijuana are not shown for

brevity but we discuss the results here and will make the full results available upon request. In

general, we do not estimate precise own and cross price effects when the frequency of substance

use is concerned. The lack of precision may come from a severely reduced sample size as the

percent of all high school teens and the percent of teens with drivers’ licenses who use the

substances are relatively small. In the full sample, 22 percent smoke, 29 percent drink and 12

percent use marijuana. Among the drivers, 27 percent smoke, 41 percent drink and 15 percent

use marijuana.

        The cigarette, beer, and marijuana own and cross price elasticities for the frequency of

use are shown in Table 5, along with the participation elasticities. For the frequency of smoking

conditional on positive use, the own price coefficient is negative only in the models with the

state fixed effects, and is statistically insignificant in all models. Despite the insignificance, the

calculated elasticites of frequency

(–0.37 and –0.62) from the models with state fixed effects are reasonable and in line with those

found in previous studies of youth (Lewit et al. 1981; Chaloupka and Grossman 1996; Tauras,

Markowitz, and Cawley 2005). The own price elasticity for beer is also always insignificant. As

for marijuana, the fine for marijuana is the only own price effect that is negative and statistically

significant. Such a finding could indicate that legal penalties are a determinant of use primarily

for the heaviest users.

        The cross price effects for frequency of use in Table 5 reveal that higher prices of beer

and marijuana are negatively associated with the frequency of cigarette use, although statistical

significance depends on the sample and model under consideration. Note that the same




                                                  17
complementary relationship is also found for the probability of smoking. The coefficients and

corresponding elasticities for marijuana fines are also negative and statistically significant in the

alcohol frequency equations, again indicating complementarity.

          Few consumer products are related to the frequency of smoking, drinking or marijuana

use. The only relationships worth discussing are some of the fast food results. We find that the

price of hamburgers is negatively related to the frequency of marijuana use within both samples

and also to the frequency of smoking for the sample of drivers. While hamburgers may be

complements to smoking and marijuana, strangely, fast food chicken appears to be a substitute

for all three substances among the sample of drivers.



Income Effects

          We measure youth income with earned wages and allowance/gifts. These income effects

for the probabilities of use are shown in Tables 2-4. Not surprisingly, earned income is

positively related to the probability of use for all three substances. Earned income is also

positively related to the frequency of use of all three substances, although in the models

examining the frequency of alcohol use the coefficients achieve statistical significance at just

above the 10 percent level. Among the full sample, every additional $100 in annual earned

income increases the probability of smoking by 0.11 percentage points, the probability of

drinking by 0.17 percentage points and the probability of marijuana use by 0.06 percentage

points.

          Increases in youths’ allowances are associated with a higher probability of smoking in

the full sample. Higher allowances are also positively associated with a higher probability of

alcohol and marijuana use for the full sample and for drivers. Allowances, however, do not




                                                 18
predict an increase in frequency of use for any of the substances. The magnitudes of the

allowance effect are much larger than the earned income effects. Among the full sample, every

additional $100 in annual allowances (about $1.92 per week) increases the probability of

smoking by 0.62 percentage points, the probability of drinking by 0.96 percentage points and the

probability of marijuana use by 0.45 percentage points.

       Holding youth income constant, parental income is negatively associated with both

measures of smoking indicating that this income measure is likely reflecting some unobserved

levels of household environment or parental smoking. Previous research has shown that both

adults and children in low income families are more likely to smoke (USDHHS 1994; Husten

and Jackson 2004). However, the results show that unlike with cigarettes, higher parental

income will not prevent teenagers from any use of alcohol or marijuana, although higher parental

income reduces the frequency of drinking and marijuana among users.



Discussion

       Generally speaking, we find that marijuana use is a complement to smoking, but smoking

is a substitute for marijuana. We find similar contradictory results between alcohol and

cigarettes. Alcohol is a complement to smoking, but smoking is a substitute for alcohol.

Marijuana and alcohol appear to be complements. All of these conclusions are made with the

caveat that some estimates are statistically insignificant.

       The finding of complementarity between marijuana and alcohol does not help settle the

question of the nature of this relationship in the literature. Our finding corresponds to that of

Pacula (1998) and Williams et al. (2004), but disagrees with the aforementioned earlier studies.

One explanation is that the nature of the relationship may simply have changed over time. Our




                                                  19
study along with that by Williams at al. are the only studies to use data collected after the mid-

1990s. Another explanation is that all studies suffer from poor measures of the price of

marijuana. Without a reliable representation of the monetary price, it will be difficult to get

consistent price effects across studies. This data problem may also explain the inconsistent

results for marijuana and cigarettes.

       The lack of symmetry in the cross price elasticities between cigarettes and alcohol is

somewhat perplexing, but is not inconsistent with the results found by other researchers. For

example, the papers by Chaloupka et al. (1999) and Pacula (1998) find evidence of

complementarity and substitutability, respectively. However, Chaloupka et al. only examine the

effect of the price of alcohol on cigarette consumption, while Pacula only examines the effects of

the price of cigarettes on alcohol consumption. Our results confirm the findings from both of

these studies. In a sample of adults, Decker and Schwartz (2000) estimate the own and cross

price elasticites for cigarette and alcohol consumption. Their results are also similar to ours:

higher beer prices decrease smoking participation, while higher cigarette prices increase drinking

participation. They offer the explanation that as higher beer prices reduce the propensity for

individuals to go to bars, they lose the social environment for smoking and therefore smoke less.

The converse is that as cigarette prices rise, people may quit smoking and use alcohol to replace

the palliative effects of smoking.

       We know that state and federal governments can use excise taxes to influence smoking

and drinking among youth. Gasoline is another product that is subject to state and federal excise

taxes, and the relationship between gasoline and youth substance use makes gas taxes another

potential policy tool to influence youth behaviors. We find that among students with driver’s

licenses, higher gas prices are associated with a reduced probability of drinking but an increased




                                                 20
probability of smoking. In other words, gas is likely to be a complement to drinking, in that

teens may have to drive to get to places where they can consume alcohol. When higher gas

prices reduce driving, drinking may also diminish. Gasoline, however, appear to be a substitute

for smoking. This result likely arises from a strong substitution effect, where teens replace

driving with time spent smoking.

       Fast food is currently not taxed separately from other food products, but the idea has been

mentioned as a solution to the growing problem of obesity (Propper 2005). Increasing the prices

of fast foods may have an influence on substance use behaviors of teenagers in the following

ways: Higher hamburger prices may reduce the probability and frequency of use of marijuana

and the frequency of smoking among drivers. However, fast food chicken has a positive

relationship with the frequency of use for all three substances among teens who are drivers,

indicating substitutability. Pizza also is a substitute for the probability of drinking as well.

Therefore, raising the prices of fast food chicken and pizza are predicted to increase some

substance use as teenagers reallocate their budgets away from these fast food towards mind-

altering substances.

       The price of a game of bowling is negatively related to the probability of use for all three

substances. The price of a man’s shirt, which may represent the price of clothing generally, is

negatively related to the probability of drinking among older teens. It is impossible to know

whether such negative relationship arises because of strong income effects or whether the goods

are complements in the sense that the consumption of one enhances the consumption of the

other. It is easy to imagine a story where bowling and the substances are jointly consumed and

enjoyed. For clothing and drinking, complementarity could arise if having the right party

clothing or a new outfit enhances the drinking experience, however, it is more likely that the




                                                  21
coefficient reflects a strong income effect.

       Given the robust result that higher youth earned incomes increase the probability and

frequency of substance use, a relevant policy question is whether increases in state or federal

minimum wage laws would have the unintended consequence of increasing teenage substance

use. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that slightly more than one-quarter of minimum

wage workers (about 605,000 workers) in 2002 are teenagers (BLS 2003). However, in our

sample of high school teens, 79 percent of the teens who work at employer based job earn an

hourly wage higher than the legislated state minimum. Given this, it is not clear the extent to

which changes in the minimum wage would affect the income of these teens and their

corresponding substance use. This is a direction for future research.
