        This paper examines monetary policy in Rudebusch and Svenssonâ€™s (1999) two equation
macroeconomic model when the policymaker recognizes that the model is an approximation and is
uncertain about the quality of that approximation. It is argued that the minimax approach of robust control
provides a general and tractable alternative to the conventional Bayesian decision theoretic approach.
Robust control techniques are used to construct robust monetary policies. In most (but not all) cases, these
robust policies are more aggressive than the optimal policies absent model uncertainty. The specific robust
policies depend strongly on the formation of model uncertainty used, and we make some suggestions about
which formulation is most relevant for monetary policy applications.
