        Despite the persistent fears that production abroad by U.S. multinationals reduces
employment at home, there has, in fact, been almost no aggregate shift of production or employment
to foreign countries. Some continuing shifts to foreign locations by U.S. manufacturing firms have
been largely offset by shifts into the United States by foreign manufacturing multinationals.
        An analysis of individual firm data indicates that higher levels of production in developing
countries by a firm are associated with lower employment at home for a given level of production.
The reason is that U.S. multinationals tend to allocate their more labor-intensive production to
developing country affiliates and retain more capital-intensive and skill-intensive operations in the
United States.

    Introduction

            There has long been a suspicion in the United States that investment abroad by U.S. firms,

    especially manufacturing firms, involves replacing U.S. workers by foreign workers, with a

    resulting loss of employment and decline in wages for the firms workers in the United States.

    That suspicion was probably at its peak during the late 1960s and the 1970s, and has declined

    somewhat since then, but it still exists, Worries about the impact of outward FDI led to

 Congressional proposals to restrict it and to administration measures to limit itsfinancing in the

 United States.

            The adverse effect on home labor was thought to occur through two main channels. One

was the replacement of home production for the U.S. market by imports from the affiliates and

the other was the replacement of home production for export by affiliate production in the host

countries. Since imports into the United States from manufacturing affiliates abroad were

relatively small, most attention was focussed on export replacement. However, a series of studies

of export replacement failed to find evidence that it had taken place. Most studies, including

parallel ones for Swedish firms, seemed to find that the net effect of affiliate production on parent

exports was positive, if there was any effect at all. For the most part, these studies have found

 little or no effect or found that production abroad,
                                                        on net balance, promoted parent exports and,
 presumably, parent employment in the United States.

         Much of the concern over outward NM arose from the impression that production and

 employment abroad had been rising rapidly. That was the case from the 1950s through the

 mid-1970s, but in the ten years after 1977, employment in foreign affiliates of U.S. firms outside

 banking fell by almost a million. It has recovered since then, but did not reach the 1977 level again

 until 1995. Most of this decline took place in manufacturing affiliates, and the number of these

 employees was still below the 1977 level in 1995.

        It is clear from the data, as is demonstrated more ftilly below, that there has been no

aggregate shift of production or employment by U.S. multinationals out of the United States to

their foreign affiliates, at least in the last 20 or 25 years. If there is any impact of foreign

operations by U.S. firms on U.S. labor markets, it must be through some different mechanism.

The issue we explore here is a different one. We take the level ofproduction by U.S.

multinationals in the United States as given, determined by each firm's judgment as to the optimal

geographical allocation of its worldwide production, We then ask whether these geographical

allocations affect the firms' home employment or wage levels by altering the labor intensity or the

skill intensity the firms' home production. They might do so if, for example, firms allocated their

most labor-intensive or least skill-intensive activities or products to their foreign affiliates or to

their affiliates in low-wage countries.

       Foreign direct investment, or FIN, is one vehicle by which production is allocated among

countries, or reallocated over time. The basic long-term forces behind these reallocations are the

rising per capita incomes of home countries, which force their comparative advantagesup the

capital-intensity and skill-intensity scales, and the economic growth of foreign markets. For some



                                                                                                         2
 countries, the depletion of a natural resource alters
                                                         comparative advantages. In other cases, major

 changes in currency values induce investment abroad. Often, home country firms have
                                                                                     acquired,
 over a long time, firm-specific advantages in the industries that are seen to be
                                                                                    inevitably declining
 at home. They may have built up
                                 technological skills, marketing skills, networks of trade, and
 brand names that provide market access at home and abroad. In that
                                                                           case, these firms can retain
 some of the rents on their firm-specific skills by FDI, establishing
                                                                        or acquiring production facilities
 in the countries to which comparative advantages in production, or in parts of a production chain,

 is migrating. Some familiar examples are U.S. petroleum industry firms that invested in crude

 production abroad as the cost of U.S. petroleum resources increased, and Swedish firms in the

forest products and forest product machinery industries.

        These shifts in the location of production are presumably reflected in the
                                                                                       composition of a
firm's home production. We would expect that home production within a firm would shift away

from industries, or segments of industries, in which the home country was losing comparative

advantage. Thus, we would expect that U.S. firms with foreign production facilities would

allocate the more labor-intensive segments of their production to locations
                                                                                where labor, or
unskilled labor, was relatively cheap. The result at home would be a shift toward more

capital-intensive or skill-intensive types of production.

        The data for the individual firm regressions used in this
                                                                    study are from the confidential
individual firm responses to the benchmark survey of U.S. direct investment abroad in 1989

conducted by the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) of the U.S. Department of Commerce.

The calculations had to be performed at the BEA to preserve the confidentiality of
                                                                                        the responses.

Have US. Firms Moved Their Production and Employment to Foreign Countries?

        There are several ways to measure the importance of foreign production and employment

by U.S. firms relative to economic activity at home. The two measures we use here are

production, as represented by gross product, and employment. Activity abroad can be compared

with parent production and employment at home or with production and employment in the whole

domestic U.S. economy. The comparison with parent activity describes the choices made by the

multinational firms themselves and the comparison with the U.S. as a whole describes the

potential impact on the U.S economy. The gross product data for parents begin only in 1977,

after the major part of the expansion of overseas production, and are available only for benchmark

survey years until 1994. The gross product data for the MNCs foreign operations apply only to

majority-owned affiliates (MOFAs).

       From 1977 to 1982 the share of foreign operations in the output of U.S. MINCs declined,

by more than 10 per cent. After that there was some recovery, to the point that the 1997 share

was almost identical to the 1977 level:

 Over these 20 years, taken as a whole, U.S. MNCs seem to have increased home and foreign

 production more or less in step with each other, without any substantial shift in or out of the

 United States.

        The comparison with production in the United States as a whole, as represented by Gross

Domestic Product (GDP) can be carried back to the earlier period of rapid growth in production

 abroad by U.S. firms:

                  Gross Product of U.S. MOFAs as Per Cent ofU.S. GD?, 1966-1997

                                     1966                   4.89

                                     1970                   6.88

                                     1977                   7.95

                                     1982                   6.90

                                     1989                   5.88

                                     1995                   6.40

                                     1996                   6.50

                                     1997                   6.40

                                     Source: Appendix Table 1.

We can describe this comparison as measuring the shift to foreign production by all U.S. firms,

including non-multinationals. After the large increase in the relative importance of overseas

production between 1966 and 1977, over 60 per cent, as compared with total U.S.

domestic output, the foreign share fell back for more than a decade, although not to its 1966

level. After 1989, MOFA production rose again, relative to total U.S. production, by more than

10 per cent, but in 1997 it still remained almost 20 per cent smaller relative to U.S. domestic

production than in 1977.



                                                                                                   5
        Employment has the advantage over production as a measure of foreign and domestic

activity that it is not distorted by exchange rate changes, and lends itselfto examination of

absolute, as well as relative, movements. The number of employees of foreign affiliates of U.S.

MNCs grew by almost 3&1/2 million between 1957 and 1977, more than doubling (Appendix

Table 2). After that, there was a reduction by almost a million foreign workers over the next

decade. That pullback was followed by a recovery that did not pass the 1977 ievel until 1995.

Over the whole 20 years since 1977, only about 800 thousand overseas employees were added by

U.S. finns, a negligible number compared with the up to 40 million added by the U.S. economy as

a whole. However, parent firms increased their home employment only slightly; their employment

in 1997 was only a million more than in 1977, and their share oftotal U.S. employment dropped

from 21 to 15 per cent between 1977 and 1997. The MNCs were clearly occupying a different

universe from that of the United States as a whole.

       The affiliate share of MNC employment, which we can observe only since the peak in

1977, declined until the late 1980s, and then recovered, passing the 1977 level in 1995:

 Thus, within the multinationals, there was a small shift in the location of employment from the

 United States to foreign locations.

        Relative to the whole domestic U.S. economy, U.S. firms' affiliate employment has not

 come near to returning to its 1977 levels:

Alter growing by over SO per cent relative to total domestic U.S. employment between 1957 and

1977, foreign employment by U.S. firms then declined by over 30 per cent to a level not far above

that of 1957. The ratio began to rise again during the 1990s, but remained far below that of the

late 1970s.




                                                                                                   7
        All in all, it seems safe to conclude that there has been no shift ofemployment in the

aggregate from the domestic U.S. economy to the foreign operations of U.S. firms.


Have U.S. Firms Moved Their Manufacturing Production and Employment to Foreign Countries?

       Since manufacturing and petroleum are much more important in the internationalized

output of U.S. firms than in domestic output, the internationalized shares of output are much

larger in these two sectors than in others. The share of the petroleum output of U. S. firms that is

produced abroad has increased greatly as U.S. domestic reserves of petroleum have declined or

become more expensive to exploit, relative to those abroad. In manufacturing too, the foreign

share of U.S. multinationals' production has risen even since 1977, the year in which the share of

foreign production in general reached a peak and began to decline:

 In 1977, 21 per cent of the total output of U.S. manufacturing MNCs was produced outside the

 United States, and that share had risen to 29 per cent by 1997. Thus, U. S. manufacturing MNCs

 have allocated more of their worldwide output to their foreign operations.

         Since these MNCs are a large, though declining, part of U.S. manufacturing output, their

 foreign production was large also relative to total U.S. manufacturing output.

Since 1977, U.S. manufacturing finns production outside the United States has increased from

17½ to 23 per cent of all manufacturing production in the U. S., including that of non-

multinational and foreign owned firms.

       Since 1977, the share of the MNC parent firms in U.S. manufacturing output has fallen

from 65 to 55 per cent. This does not mean that non-multinational firms are taking over U.S.

manufacturing. Instead, the share of U.S. manufacturing affiliates of foreign multinational firms

has increased. Foreign-owned manufacturing affiliates in the United States, which produced only

3½ per cent of U.S. manufacturing output in 1977, accounted for 12&1/2 per cent in 1997 (Zeile,

        The data on employment show that from 1977 through the 1980s. therewas essentially no

change in the share of foreign employment in the total employment of U.S. manufacturing MINCs.

Then the foreign share began to creep up during the 1990s, reaching 37 per cent in 1997. As can

be seen in Appendix Table 4, the number of employees outside the United States in 1997

remained below the 1977 level, but while foreign employment fell by about 250 thousand, the

parents' domestic employment fell by over 3 million.

        The comparison with total manufacturing employment in the United States can be made

for a longer period, and puts the 1980s and 1.990s in a different perspective:

The move to overseas manufacturing employment took place mainly between 1957 and 1977,

when about 300 thousand foreign employees were added, almost tripling the number. Domestic

manufacturing employment was also rising during those two decades, by 2.6 million, so that the

growth of foreign employment was not a matter of reducing employment in the United States.

       The absolute number of affiliate employees fell sharply in the decade after 1977, by

something like 850 thousand, and the ratio to domestic U.S. manufacturing employment fell also.

Then, the number of foreign employees increased again, but in 1997 it remained below the 1977

level. Relative to domestic employment, foreign employment regained its earlier level and, by

1997, was slightly above it.

       While the extent of internationalization of U.S. manufacturing MNCs was about the same

in 1996 as in 1977, the parent share of U.S. manufacturing employment has declined steadily,

from 60 per cent in 1977 to 46 per cent in 1997. As was the case for production, the parents'

place as employers was mostly taken by foreign manufacturing firms. Employment in U.S.

affiliates of foreign manufacturing firms jumped from 3&1/2 per cent in 1977 to more thanl2 per



                                                                                                11
cent in 1997 (Zeile, 1999, Table 8) Thus, U.S. and foreign manufacturing MNCs were both

internationalizing; each group increased its employment in the othergroup's region. In the U.S.

at least, the main result was a shift of manufacturing employment from U.S. MNCs operating at

home to foreign MNCs operating in the United States.



The Geokranhjcal Ailocation of Production and Employment

       Even if there had been no major growth in the overall importance of foreign production or

employment, there could have been geographical shifts that might have affected domestic labor

markets, such as an increase in the proportion of employment in developing, or low-wage,

countries. If we divide the affiliate locations roughly into developed and developing, treating

Canada, Europe, Japan, Australia, and New Zealand as developed, we find the following trend

and 1982.

       The developing countries' shares of U.S. firms' foreign employment are somewhat larger

than their shares of production, because output per worker is lower in developing countries than

in developed ones. The fluctuations in shares are much smaller, however, perhaps because the

influence of exchange rate changes is eliminated. The trend seems to be toward a larger share of



                                                                                                   13
employment in developing countries, especially in the I 990s, but most employment continues to

be in developed countries. The developing country share of MOFA employment rose from a little

under 30 per cent in 1966 to 34 per cent thirty years later, probably not enough for major effects

on U.S. labor markets.

       On the whole, it does not appear that aggregate movements in the location of production

by U.S. MNCs have been of a type or size to have any major effects on U.S. labor markets as a

whole. If that is the case, the place to look for possible impacts may be within the individual firm,

rather than in aggregates of employment.



Parent Emoloyment in Individual Firms

        Since the aggregate movements in production and employment, especially since 1977, do

not appear likely to have had major domestic labor market effects in the United States, we turn

next to studying possible impacts of overseas production on an individual firm's home

employment. Md since, as pointed out in the introduction, there are no indications from past

studies that foreign production by a U.S. firm reduces the firm's exports, and therefore its total

production, we look for possible impacts elsewhere. We ask whether, even given the total level

of production by a parent firm, its level of employment is affected by its choices about the

allocation of different types of production to its home and foreign operations. Two firms with the

same total parent firm (home) output might have different levels of home employment if they had

made different allocations of their worldwide production. For example, one firm may have placed

its labor-intensive operations abroad and retained only its capital-intensive operations at home

while the other firm either had no foreign operations or did have them but did not split production

between home and abroad by this criterion. The first firm would then have lower home


                                                                                                     14
employment for the same home production level. Mother possibility might be that one firm

places all the supervisory activity and research and marketing support for its worldwide

production at home while the other firm spreads them around to its production locations. In that

case, the first firm would have a higher level of home employment, given its home production.

       A study for an earlier period (Lipsey, Dravis, and Roldan, 1982) found strong evidence

that capital intensities in US affiliates differed among locations in response to differences in factor

prices. Capital intensities were much higher in developed country affiliates than in those in

developing countries, where wages were far lower. That was true for affiliate aggregates within

industries, and remains true, according to the latest BEA survey (US Department of Commerce,

1998b).

       It was also true among affiliates within individual US multinationals, and it was pointed

out that a positive relationship between the price of labor and the capital intensity of affiliate

production could represent several different phenomena. One is adaptation to factor price

differences by choosing different factor proportions along a single isoquant. Another is

adaptation by choosing different technologies to produce the same product in different countries.

A third is various types of allocation or, as described there, selection of products or sub-industries

from among those in the firm's repertoire.

          The first two explanations of the relationship would not imply any impact on an MNC's

home production, but the third one would, if the allocation included the firm's home country

operations. The earlier study could not distinguish among these alternative explanations because

home country operations were not covered, but they are included in this paper.

          We examine this question here by running a set of regression equations in which parent

employment (PEMP) is related to parent production (PNS), proxied by parent net sales (sales



                                                                                                     15
minus imports from affiliates abroad) and affiliate production (ANS), proxied by affiliate net sales

(affiliate sales minus imports from the parent). We also have experimented with variants

separating different types of affiliates. The equations presented here for all affiliates are similar to

those for manufacturing alone in BlomstrOm, Fors, and Lipsey (1997), and in some respects to

those in Kravis and Lipsey (1988).

       The first equation (with constant term suppressed, t-values in parentheses) suggests that

there is some allocation of labor-intensive activities to foreign operations, since the coefficient for

ANS is negative.

(1) PEMP = 5.55 PNS(53.7) - lAO ANS(8.9)                RSQ(corr.) = .666 No. Obs. 2,054

However, the same equation in log form gives the opposite result:

(2) Lii PEMP =867 Ln PNS (75.4) +020 Ln ANS(1 .9) RSQ (corr.) = .815 No. Obs. = 2,054

The log form gives a heavier weight to the differences at the lower end of the size scale, and the

difference in the signs of the coefficients suggests that the negative influence comes from the

largest affiliates. That suspicion is confirmed to some degree by arithmetic equations omitting the

150 largest affiliates, which produce positive, but only marginally significant, coefficients for

ANS.

       If we divide parent firms into manufacturing and non-manufacturing parents, we find the

overall negative effect in both groups:

(3) MPEMP=5.95PNS(55 .8) -O.775ANS(5.56) RSQ(corr.).853 No. Obs,=1296

(4) INMPEMP=5 O3PNS(263)-I .446ANS(6.9) RSQ(corr.)=.495                   No. Ols.=759

Despite the emphasis on reallocation in manufacturing, the effect seems to be stronger in the non-

manufacturing sector. One problem is the heterogeneity of that sector. A major part of




                                                                                                     16
production there is in the Petroleum industry, which includes all activities of firms in that group,

whether they are in extraction, refining, transportation, or retailing.

        If we separate affiliate net sales into those by manufacturing affiliates (ANSM) and those

by affiliates in non-manufacturing industries (ANSNM), the negative effect on home employment

appears, somewhat surprisingly, to be concentrated in the non-manufacturing affiliates.

(5) PEMP= 5.52PNS(53.6) -0.37ANSM(1.7) -225 ANSNIM(7.2) RSQ(corr.)=.668

                                                                          No. Obs.=2,054

However, if we examine manufacturing parents separately, it is clear that the negative coefficient

for non-manufacturing affiliates comes entirely from the non-manufacturing sector:

(6) MPEMP= 6.O2PNS(56.9)-1 .63ANSM(8 .2)+1 .66ANSNM(3 .9) RSQ(corr.)rz. 866

                                                                          No. Obs.=1,295

Among manufacturing MNCs, the negative association is only with the sales of manufacturing

affiliates; higher sales by non-manufacturing affiliates are associated with higher home

employment. The allocation of labor-intensive activities to foreign affiliates by manufacturing

firms mainly involves manufacturing operations themselves.

        If firms are reallocating production to take advantage of factor price differences, and in

particular, labor price differences, it would be reasonable to expect that production in developing

countries would reflect this motivation more than production in developed countries. Average

wages in developed country affiliates of manufacturing parents in 1989, the year of this cross-

section, were only 10 per cent below parent firm averages. Average wages in developing country

affiliates, however, were about 75 per cent below the parent level. It would therefore be to such

countries that production would be allocated for labor cost saving. We therefore test whether the

negative influence on parent employment, given parent production, comes mainly from production


                                                                                                       17
by affiliates in developing countries (ANSLDC) or from production by affiliates in developed

countries (ANSDC).

       RSQ (corr.)=.679 No.Obs.2.054

That expectation is strongly confirmed by equation 7. Production in developed countries adds to

parent employment per unit of home output while production in developing countries reduces it.

       It should be noted that the log version of the equation does not suggest this type of

allocation of production.

(8) LnPEMP=.S49LnPNS(77. 1 )+03 6LnANSDC(6. 5)+ OO4LnANSLDC(0.9)

       RSQ(corr.) = .818 No. Ohs. = 2,054

The log equation, giving heavier weight to the smaller affiliates, suggests that affiliate production

in developed countries adds to parent employment, given parent production, but that production

in developing countries has no effect on parent employment.

       If we examine the impact separately for manufacturing and non-manufacturing parents, the

strong influence of the production in developing countries is evident:

   RSQ(corr.)=.511 No. Obs.759

Given the supposed non-tradability of many of the services included in the non-manufacturing

sector, the large negative coefficient for production in developing countries is surprising, because

the MNCs could not allocate production to developing countries for sale in developed countries.

However, if the petroleum industry is important in the results, the negative coefficient would be


                                                                                                   18
more understandable, although the motivation would in that case involve mainly resource costs

other than labor, Only a disaggregation of the non-manufacturing sector could answer this

question.

       The ability of MNCs to allocate production in response to factor price differences might

be affected by host country characteristics, including trade policies. To test this possibility, we

divided developing countries into two groups, one we thought of as outward-oriented, and the

other inward- oriented. The former group includes Asian countries, except for India, and Mexico,

and the latter group includes other developing countries. The coefficients for sales by the two

groups were sharply different, despite the crudeness of the classification:

(11) MPEMP=6. 1 5PNS(54.7)+0.I 1ANSDC(0.5)+0.S6ANSLDCO(0.3)-23 .5OANSLDCI(1 0.2)

               RSQ(corr.)=.876      No. Obs.=1,296

All of the effects on parent employment appear to be associated with production in countries with

relatively inward-looking trade policy. Neither production in developed countries nor production

in outward-oriented developing countries affected home employment. These results raise the

possibility that some allocation in response to factor costs may be a consequence of production

location biased by host country rules.

        Within manufacturing, it is possible to examine some of these relationships in several

major groups of industries. A listing of only the ANS coefficients from equations explaining

parent employment, given parent production, shows that negative coefficients, which we interpret

as indicating allocation by degree of capital intensity, are not ubiquitous.

In two major industries of U.S. manufacturing direct investment abroad, the two machinery

industries, the relationship of affiliate production to home employment is positive; more affiliate

production means more home employment, given the level of home production. Only in

Transport Equipment, mainly motor vehicles, is their strong evidence for the allocation of labor-

intensive production to affiliates.

       If we characterize the affiliates by the distinctions made in Equatior 11, there is

considerably more evidence of effects on home employment in the various ANS coefficients:

For only one industry group, Foods, was the equation substantially improved by this breakdown

of affiliate locations. In three of the industry groups, Foods, Metals, and Transport Equipment,

the coefficients for developed country affiliate net sales are negative and significant, suggesting

some allocation of labor intensive activities to affiliates, but in the two machinery industries, the

coefficients are positive. Food industry affiliates are particularly oriented to their host country

markets, as are, to a smaller extent, affiliates in Chemicals and Metals, but those in the Transport

Equipment group are export-oriented, as are those in the two machinery groups. Thus, the

apparent allocation effect is not associated with export orientation, as we expected, but more with

orientation to local sales among these developed country affiliates, Transport Equipment being a

conspicuous exception.

        Among developing country affiliates, the evidence for allocation of labor intensive

production is mainly in the countries classified here as inward-oriented, the exceptions being

Chemicals and Transport Equipment, where the affiliates in outward-oriented developing

countries showed the negative coefficients we associate with allocation by the MINCs. On the

whole, appears that it is the outward oriented industries and locations that require complementary

employment at home and the inward oriented ones that involve the allocation of labor-intensive

activities to affiliates.

        In general, the coefficients for sales by developed country affiliates are smaller than those

for affiliates in developing countries. One reason may be that the wage differences between the

United States and many other developed countries were not large in 1989, and some developed

countries had higher nominal wages. The motivation for allocating labor-intensive production to

developed countries was therefore slight.




                                                                                                        21
       A possible ground for skepticism about some of these coefficients is the fact that when

squared terms for affiliate sales are added to the equations, the coefficients for ANS change

considerably. For example, in foods, both ANS terms turn positive while the squared terms are

negative and significant. The Chemicals equation is not affected much but the large positive

coefficient in Metals is much reduced and becomes insignificant, while the squared term is positive

and significant. In the two machinery industries, the terms for inward-oriented countries become

positive and significant. In fact, no significant negative term for ANS remains. It is difficult to

judge without access to the data, but the effects of including the squared terms suggests that the

results are heavily influenced by the largest affiliates. Taken literally, the coefficients could imply

that small affiliates tend to lead to higher home employment for supervisiofl or other headquarters

functions while large affiliates are used as locations for labor-intensive activities.



Affiliate Production and Parent Wage Levels

        If foreign operations affect the labor intensity of a firm's home operations, they might also

affect the skill intensity of the parent firm. Again, there are at least two poisible avenues for such

effects. One is that low-skill operations may be allocated to foreign affiliates, particularly those in

developing countries, resulting in a higher skill mix, and presumably a higher average wage, at

home. The other avenue is that higher levels of foreign activity may require more staff at home

for supervision and financial oversight. In this case, both effects go in the same direction; more

foreign production should lead to higher wages at home.

        Average parent wages increase with size of parent, as represented by parent net

sales(PNS). However, the effect does not appear to be linear, but declines as parent firms are

larger, and we therefore include in the equations a term for PNS squared:


                                                                                                      22
(12) PW= .055PNS(2.43)-.O1 IPNSSQ(3 .34)+.OS2ANS(2.78) RSQ(corr.)=.025

Not much of wage variation among parents is explained by this equation, but larger foreign

production is associated with higher average earnings, presumably from a higher average skill

level, at home.

        To the extent that allocation of low-skill activities to low wage countries was an important

element of this effect, production in developing countries should have a greater impact than

production in developed countries:

(12) PW=.OSPNS(2. 17)-O.I IPNSSQ(3.33)+.O54ANSDC(1 .53)+.OO39ANSLDC(1.8 1)

                         RSQ(corr.)=.026.

If anything, production in developed countries seems to have a greater impact on parent wage

levels than production in developing countries, but neither coefficient is significant and too much

weight should not be placed on them. Similar equations with dummy variables for 3 digit

industries do not alter the results.

        Wage equations for the individual industry groups produced few coefficients for affiliate

sales that were even marginally significant. In Chemicals and in the miscellaneous collection

called "Other manufacturing," coefficients for sales by developing country affiliates were a

 positive influence on parent average wages, but the coefficients for the squared terms were

 negative. In metals, the coefficient for production in affiliates in inward-oriented regions was

 positive and significant.

         The weak evidence we find on wages points to positive relations between affiliate

 production and parent wage levels. However, there is hardly any evidence to support the idea

 that allocation of low-skill operations to affiliates, rather than requirements for headquarters

 services, is the crucial factor.


                                                                                                    23
Conclusions

         There is no indication in aggregate data that movements of production from the United

States to foreign affiliates of U.S. firms have had any negative effect on employment by parent

firms or in the United States as a whole, at least in the last twenty years. Even if such movements

in production by U.S. MNCs could have that effect, they cannot explain recent labor force

developments because there has been almost no shift of production or employment by U.S. firms.

Some continued shifts to foreign locations have taken place in U.S. manufacturing firms, but these

have been offset by matching shifts into the United States on the part of foreign manufacturing

firms.

         A regression analysis of individual firm data does point to some effects of foreign

production on employment within finns. Higher levels of affiliate production in developing

countries are associated with lower parent employment for any given level of parent production at

home. The allocation by MNCs of the more labor-intensive segments of their production to their

developing country affiliates and the more capital-intensive segments to their home operations

reduces the labor intensity of their home production and thus their demand for labor for any given

level of home production. There is only weak evidence for a wage or skill effect. If there is any

effects it is that foreign operations are associated with higher wages at home.

         We do provide at least a partial answer to the question raised in an earlier paper by Lipsey,

Kravis, and Roldan (1982). That is whether the low capital intensities of affiliates in developing

countries involve simply responses to low labor costs by changing factor porportions for identical

products or processes. The answer here is that at least some of the reason for low capital

intensities is the MNCs' choice of which products to produce in low wage countries.
