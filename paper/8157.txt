             A Quantitative Analysis of Pricing Behavior In
     California's Wholesale Electricity Market During Summer 2000

1.      Introduction

        During the summer of 2000, wholesale electricity prices in California were nearly
500% higher than they were during the same months in 1998 or 1999. This explosion of
prices was unexpected (CEC, 2000) and has called into question whether electricity
restructuring will bring the benefits of competition promised to consumers. Federal and
State government officials have initiated investigations and issued reports about the
behavior and performance of California’s wholesale electricity market.1 Unlike previous
price spikes observed in other US wholesale electricity markets, the California experience
has not been a transient phenomenon of a few days' duration, but a persistent series of
events lasting from June through September.2

      The purpose of this paper is to examine the factors that explain this increase in
wholesale electricity prices. There were a number of changes in supply and demand

  FERC (1998) gives a detailed account of price spikes in Midwestern markets in 1998. Price spikes in the
Eastern US during 1999 were related to reliability problems of various kinds (DOE, 2000). Prices in
California remained remarkably high in October and November and then reached unprecedented levels
during December 2000. The latter part of this period was also accompanied by an order of magnitude
increase in gas prices, the evaporation of imports from the Northwest, a large fraction of California’s
generating capacity was unavailable to supply due to planned or forced outages, some of which were
mandated by environmental regulators, new regulatory interventions, and utility credit problems that may
have made some suppliers reluctant to supply voluntarily. It is clear that by late 2000, the normal
functioning of the wholesale electricity markets had completely broken down. The analysis reported here
does not cover the post-September 2000 period, however.


                                                                                                       1
conditions in 2000 that would suggest that prices should have been expected to increase
from the previous years: natural gas prices increased, demand increased, and power
imports available to California decreased in 2000 compared to 1998 and 1999. The first
objective of this paper is to determine how much of the observed price increases can be
explained by these three “market fundamentals,” assuming that the wholesale power
market is perfectly competitive. We do so by simulating competitive benchmark prices
given these supply and demand factors prevailing over the summer of 2000 and then
compare the simulated competitive benchmark prices with the actual prices observed.
We find that while these three supply and demand factors can explain a portion of the
observed increase in prices, there is still a large gap between the observed prices and
simulated competitive benchmark prices.

        The second objective of this paper is to determine whether and how much of this
residual can be explained by the prices of tradeable permits for NOx emissions. These
emissions permits must be held by generating plants and other affected sources in the
South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) pursuant to the Regional
Clean Air Initiatives Market (RECLAIM) program.3 The prices for these emissions
permits increased dramatically during the summer of 2000 compared to earlier periods.
Including the emissions permit prices in the supply costs of those generators subject to
RECLAIM increases competitive benchmark prices for electricity significantly,
especially by the end of the summer 2000. However, even after taking account of NOx
permit costs, during most of the summer there remains a large gap between the simulated
benchmark prices and actual market prices. We attribute this gap to market power and
related market imperfections associated with the structure of California’s wholesale
electricity markets.

        The final objective of this paper is to examine whether our attribution of the
observed gap between benchmark competitive prices and actual prices is consistent with
available data on supplier behavior. Public data are presently available to examine
generator operation on an hourly basis from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
through the month of June. Southern California Edison supplied us with information
from the WSCC on hourly generation by California plants for the months of June through
September.4 We show that during high demand periods in California it is profitable for
suppliers holding a portfolio of generating units with diverse marginal supply costs to
withdraw capacity from the market even under otherwise competitive conditions. Our
examination of the data shows that many of the price setting units produced much less
energy than could have been produced at marginal costs below observed market clearing
prices. This behavior cannot be explained by the demand for ancillary services by the

  We have not examined air quality regulations that may restrict production through command-and-control
regulations. It is our impression that such regulations are not binding in California.

 We discuss the comparability of these data sources below. The WSCC data are available to all members
of the WSCC for a nominal price. The EPA data are available on the EPA’s web site.



                                                                                                          2
CAISO. Therefore, either the units were suffering from unusual operational problems or
they were being withheld from the market to increase prices. 5

        A number of previous studies have examined wholesale electricity prices in
California and found that there is some evidence of market power, especially during high
demand periods. Most of this analysis relies on confidential data available only to the
California Independent System Operator (CAISO) or to the California Power Exchange
(PX). In addition to extending this kind of analysis to the summer of 2000, with its
extraordinarily high prices, our paper provides three innovations. First, it relies on data
which are generally available to the public rather than on confidential data available only
to the CAISO or PX and their respective market surveillance committees. Second,
previous analyses of wholesale market prices in California have not systematically taken
into account the prices for NOx emissions permits which generating plants located in the
Los Angeles area must hold to cover there emissions of NOx Third, we extend the
analysis of pricing behavior to include an examination of the output supplied by
generators in California to determine whether generating plants that should be
economical to operate when prices are high are being systematically withheld from the
market, consistent with attributing the gap between competitive benchmark prices and
actual prices to the exercise of market power.


2. Background

       California’s current wholesale market institutions began operating in April 1998 after
four years of debate about electricity sector restructuring and the design and creation of
complex new wholesale market institutions. Under California’s electricity restructuring and
deregulation program, wholesale market prices would be “market-based.”6 A non-profit
5
  The data available to us are not sufficient to measure supplier withholding behavior by generators located
outside of the CAISO. Nor can we measure the control over generation supplies acquired by wholesale
market aggregators or their bidding and supply behavior. Yet, as we will demonstrate, net imports into
California can have significant effects on market-clearing prices. These imports declined significantly in
Summer 2000 compared to Summer 1999 and wholesale marketers were likely to have been active
participants as buyers and sellers in the California markets. It is possible that generators, or wholesale
market aggregators, controlling supplies from generating units outside of California may also have the
incentive and ability to increase wholesale market prices in California (and the rest of the WSCC).
Accordingly, a complete and definitive picture of wholesale market behavior and performance in California
this past summer, and the effects of strategic behavior by suppliers with market power, requires an analysis
of demand and supply conditions in those portions of the WSCC that historically have provided the bulk of
the net supplies to California. Such an analysis should also take account the control over generation
supplies accumulated by wholesale marketers operating in the WSCC. The information necessary to
perform this analysis is neither publicly available nor available to the CAISO. This is the area where
additional data collection and appropriate empirical analysis by responsible regulatory agencies can provide
value-added to the extensive analysis of market behavior and performance of California suppliers that has
been completed over the last two years.

  Technically, wholesale prices have not been “deregulated.” They are subject to regulation by the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) pursuant to the Federal Power Act. The Federal Power Act
requires FERC to approve wholesale prices only if they are “just and reasonable.” Traditionally, FERC
fulfilled its obligations under the Federal Power Act by using various cost benchmarks to cap wholesale
prices (Joskow (1989). During the 1990s FERC began to grant suppliers “market-based pricing authority”


                                                                                                          3
California Independent System Operator (CAISO) was created to operate the transmission
networks owned by the state’s Investor Owned Utilities (IOU) and a Power Exchange (PX)
was created to operate day-ahead hourly auction markets for wholesale electrical energy.7
CAISO also operates hourly auction markets for operating reserves (ancillary services), for
energy to balance supply and demand on short notice, and for generating capacity that can be
used to manage congestion. All supply from generators selling into the CAISO control area
and all demand by “load serving entities” located in the CAISO control area must ultimately
be physically scheduled with or dispatched by CAISO.

         The suppliers of generating capacity to serve demand in California are composed of
in-state generators and out-of-state generators. The in-state generators consist of four nuclear
power plants, hydro-electric plants that are located primarily in Northern California, gas-fired
steam and peaking turbines, and cogenerators and other generation sources that are
“Qualifying Facilities” (QFs) under the Public Utility Regulatory Policy Act of 1978
(PURPA). About half of the conventional in-state generating capacity is accounted for by
gas-fired steam and peaking units and these units are the marginal supply sources during
most hours in the summer when electricity demand in California is highest. It is fairly easy
to measure the marginal costs of these units since their thermal efficiencies at different output
levels are well known and spot market prices for natural gas are available from a variety of
sources. No new generating capacity has entered the California market since it began
operating in 1998 and most of the gas-fired capacity dates back to the 1960s and 1970s.

         During the summer months, the marginal supply resource that clears supply and
demand is typically a conventional steam or combustion turbine unit fueled by natural gas or
oil. Figure 1 depicts the marginal cost curves for this gas-fired generating capacity in the
ISO’s control area, assuming that the price of gas is either $2.50/Mcf (as in 1999) or $6/Mcf
(as in late summer 2000). These marginal cost curves can be thought of as the “top” of the
CAISO areas’s competitive generation supply curve during the summer months. During
summer hours a competitive market would clear somewhere along these supply curves.
Changes in natural gas prices shift the supply curve up or down and, other things equal,
competitive market prices would move up or down along with the changes in gas prices.
Changes in demand move the equilibrium competitive price along this supply curve so that
competitive prices increase directly with demand. As we shall discuss, tradeable permits for
NOx emissions increase and “twist” the marginal cost curve depending on the price of NOx
credit and differences in emissions rates across generating units, so that the competitive price
for electricity increases directly with NOx permit prices. In addition, at high demand levels,
the competitive supply curve is much steeper with a NOx permit trading system than without
one. This is the case because the generating units with the highest emissions rates produce as
much as 50 times more NOx per unit of electricity output than those with the lowest
emissions rates while the difference in marginal fuel costs between the most efficient and
least efficient generating unit is only a factor of about two.




if they could demonstrate that they did not have market power (Joskow 2000). This is the basis for
“deregulation” of wholesale market prices in California.

 The PX also operates “hour-ahead” and monthly block forward markets, but they are of little quantitative
or financial significance and will not be discussed further here.


                                                                                                       4
        Until 1998 and 1999, the 18,000 Mw of gas-fired capacity in the CAISO’s control
area was owned by the three vertically integrated IOUs. Under California’s restructuring
program, these utilities were required to sell this capacity to independent companies or New
Generation Owners (NGOs). Most of this capacity was ultimately sold to five out-of-state
companies with large national unregulated power plant businesses. The nuclear and
hydroelectric capacity, and the high-price contracts with QFs, were retained by California’s
three IOUs. This amounts to about half of the original in-state generating capacity originally
owned by or contracted for by these utilities prior to restructuring. The hydroelectric
capacity retained by the IOUs has limited energy production capabilities over the course of
the year dictated by reservoir storage capacity, water runoff, and water release constraints.

        California has historically imported large quantities of electricity from neighboring
states. During the 1960s and 1970s long high voltage transmission lines were built from
California to the Northwest and the Southwest to facilitate transfers of energy to and from
California. California typically imports electricity from the Southwest (primarily nuclear,
coal and gas-fired capacity) all year round and imports large amounts of electricity from the
Northwest (primarily stored hydro) during the Spring and Summer months. During the late
Fall and Winter months California historically exported some electricity to the Northwest,
primarily during off-peak hours. The generating capacity in the Southwest and the Northwest
available to sell electricity to California is primarily owned by vertically integrated IOUs or
Federal Power Marketing agencies. These entities in turn have legal or contractual
obligations to supply their local “native loads” and can only sell any excess supplies to


                                                                                             5
California. One of California’s investor-owned utilities (Southern California Edison) owns
nuclear and coal capacity in the Southwest and has contractual entitlements to some
hydroelectricity produced at Hoover Dam. Though the nuclear and coal plants have been put
up for sale at auction and winning bidders for some of this capacity have been chosen, this
capacity continued to be controlled by Southern California Edison during the period we
studied.

        Electricity demand in California is highest during the summer months and lowest in
the Spring and Fall months. It is highest during the day and lowest at night and on weekends.
The peak demand in the CAISO control area in 1999 was about 43,000 Mw. Demand fell to
less than 20,000 Mw during some off-peak periods. California’s restructuring program
included a “retail competition” option which permitted all retail consumers to arrange for
their power supplies with an unregulated retail electricity service provider (ESP) of their
choice. ESPs arrange for power supplies in the wholesale market and deliver it to consumers
over one of the utilities distribution networks. The distribution and transmission charges are
regulated separately based on cost by the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) and
FERC respectively. Consumers who do not voluntarily choose an ESP continue to receive
“default service” from one of the three IOUs as they always have. About 90% of the retail
demand continued to be supplied by the utilities during 2000.

         It is particularly important to note for our purposes that the short run elasticity of
demand for electricity in California is close to zero and is almost completely unresponsive to
swings in hourly prices since few consumers have hourly recording meters or the
communications and control equipment to interact directly with the wholesale market.
Moreover, during the time period we study, while wholesale prices were effectively
deregulated, retail prices for generation service continued to be regulated based on a pre-
determined retail price of roughly $60/Mwh. When this cap was set in 1996, it was expected
that wholesale prices would be far below this figure (about $30/Mwh) for several years and
that the “head room” between the $60/ Mwh retail price and the expected lower wholesale
price would allow the utilities to recover quickly the costs of nuclear plants and QF contracts
whose total costs were thought to be higher than their competitive market values in the
wholesale market (“stranded costs”). As soon as these stranded costs were recovered retail
prices for electric energy were then supposed to be deregulated and “fall” to reflect wholesale
market conditions. The year 2000 led to some surprises on this front.

        California’s restructuring and competition rules required the IOUs to serve all of their
default service demand from the PX and ISO spot energy markets. They were also required
to bid all of their remaining generation supplies into the PX and ISO spot markets.
Independent generation suppliers and non-utility demands were not required to deal through
the PX or ISOs markets, but could instead enter into bilateral contracts and self-supply
ancillary services. Since the utilities retained responsibility for such a large fraction of the
demand, most of the wholesale trade in electricity took place either in the PX’s day-ahead
market or in the ISO’s real time balancing market.

        Our analysis of prices focuses on the hourly day-ahead unconstrained prices observed
in the PX during the summer of 2000. We focus on the PX because it was the venue where
the bulk of the energy was traded. Moreover, there appears to be reasonably efficient
arbitrage between the PX market, the bilateral day-ahead market (Joskow, 2000), and the real
time market ( Borenstein, Bushnell, Knittel and Wolfram, 2000). We focus on unconstrained


                                                                                              6
prices (that is, pre-congestion management) for simplicity, though there is relatively little
significant transmission congestion during summer of 2000. We do take congestion into
account in our analysis of supplier withholding.

        Table 1 displays the average hourly volume weighted prices for each month from
April 1998 through December 2000. The fourth column of the table is a comparable set of
forecast prices for year 2000 published by the California Energy Commission in March 2000.
The Table indicates that PX prices were roughly in line with expectations during 1998 and
1999 and the first four months on 2000. In May 2000 prices began to rise and then rose to
unprecedented levels in June. Prices moderated somewhat in July and then jumped
significantly in August before moderating a bit again in September. Prices throughout the
summer months of 2000 were four to five times higher than in 1998 and 1999 and the CEC’s
projections for 2000. While we have not yet analyzed the post-September prices, it should be

clear that prices did not return to “normal” levels and exploded again in December. There
are a number of unusual events that affected California’s electricity markets after October
that make this period difficult to analyze; an order of magnitude increase in gas prices during
December, gas shortages, changes in market rules, a large quantity of plant outages, utility
credit problems, and other factors that make this latter period difficult to analyze. Our
analysis focuses on PX market clearing prices during the May through September 2000
period.

       It should be noted that the prices in Table 1 do not reflect “fully unregulated”
wholesale prices. Until July there was a $750/Mwh cap on prices. This cap was reduced to
$500/Mwh during July and then to $250/Mwh in early August. The $500/Mwh and then
$250/Mwh cap were binding during many hours in August and September.9


3. Method for Estimating Competitive Benchmark Prices with Public Data

        In this section we estimate competitive wholesale market benchmark prices and
compare these benchmark prices to the prices that were actually observed. These
benchmark prices are for sales of energy in the day-ahead market. (Generators earn
additional revenues from supplying ancillary services to the ISO. These revenues are
especially important for covering the fixed costs of peaking units that supply energy
infrequently but serve as operating and replacement reserves much more frequently.)
The more the observed price exceeds the competitive benchmark price, the more one can
presume that either market power was being exercised or some other source of market
imperfection has interfered with the competitive interplay of supply and demand. The
competitive price benchmark that we utilize is the short run marginal cost of supplying
electricity from the last unit that clears the market in each hour. Comparing realized
prices with marginal supply costs in this way is a widely accepted method for measuring
the presence of market power, and is especially useful for examining market prices in
commodity markets with homogeneous products like spot electricity markets.10 We
recognize that small departures from ideal competitive conditions do not necessarily
imply that there is sufficient market power to be of policy concern; many markets that are
not subject to price control are imperfectly competitive. Moreover, any empirical
analysis of pricing behavior is subject to some degree of uncertainty. However, this
approach allows us to quantify how far realized market prices depart from competitive
benchmark prices and provides a metric which policymakers can utilize to come to a

9
  Technically, the cap was on prices in the ISO’s real time market. However, since it would have been
irrational to pay more than the real time market price cap in the day-ahead market, this became the effective
cap on day-ahead prices in the PX as well. During emergency situations, it was widely known that the ISO
would pay more than the price cap for supplies and this probably had the effect of creating more
emergencies as generators withheld scheduling supplies day-ahead or hour-ahead in the hope of getting
higher prices from the ISO through a last-minute “out of market” sale.
10
   Economists frequently use the "Lerner Index" to measure market power. The Lerner Index is calculated
by taking the difference between realized prices and marginal supply costs and dividing by the realized
prices: L= (P-MC)/P. In a perfectly competitive market the Lerner Index is zero and in a pure monopoly it
is equal to one. The more the Lerner Index differs from zero, the greater is measured market power. See
Carlton and Perloff (1999), pages 92, 264, and 269 and Tirole (1988), pages 66, 70, 80 219-220, and 222.


                                                                                                           9
judgment about whether the gap between competitive benchmark prices and actual prices
is so large that regulatory interventions are justified.

       This approach to measuring market power in wholesale electricity markets was
pioneered by Wolfram (1999) in her study of the electricity market operating in England
and Wales. The same approach has been applied previously in studies of the California
market (Borenstein, Bushnell and Wolak, 2000; Wolak, Nordhaus and Shapiro, 2000; and
Hildebrandt, 2000). We will discuss these earlier studies of market power in California's
wholesale electricity markets further below, though we note here that these studies relied
on confidential data to which we do not have access.

       The only published estimates of the competitive benchmark prices for energy in
California’s wholesale electricity market have been made by researchers with access to
confidential CAISO data. In particular, Borenstein, Bushnell and Wolak (hereafter BBW)
and Wolak, Nordhaus and Shapiro (hereafter WNS) adopt a methodology that takes
advantage of CAISO data to simulate the competitive wholesale market price for energy
in every hour.11 Hildebrandt (2000) also makes such estimates, using a methodology
described in CAISO (2000). We also refer to Hildebrandt's approach, but because the
method is described in less detail, we emphasize BBW in what follows. We describe
BBW’s procedure briefly and then discuss how approximations must be made when the
confidential data they rely upon are not available. Because WNS use the same methods as
BBW, but they are described in detail only in BBW, all of our discussion of WNS
procedures refers to BBW.

        We begin by summarizing how BBW estimate the output and competitive
benchmark price for the different types of resources that serve demand in California.
BBW rely on CAISO settlement data for the hourly output of must-take generation,
geothermal and hydro production.12 The sum of the output from these resources generally
exceeds 20,000 MW. CAISO peak loads are typically in the range of 30,000 to 45,000
MW. Imports and California in-state fossil generation make up the difference. Net
imports are not used directly by BBW. Instead they adjust observed net imports to reflect
competitive responses to price. SCE's share of Mohave is metered as must-take
generation and is reflected in the settlements data. It is therefore treated as in-state
production by BBW. Production from other plants owned by in-state utilities apparently
is classified as imports. If observed market prices are above the competitive level, then
observed imported quantities will be above the level that would be obtained under lower
competitive prices. BBW rely upon adjustment bids to characterize the price




11
  Sheffrin (2000), discussed below, also has an estimate of the “competitive benchmark” price, but there is
no discussion of the procedure used to construct it.
12
  Must-take generation consists primarily of nuclear and Qualifying Facilities under PURPA. BBW argue
that the behavior of geothermal and hydro owners is competitive during the period they examine and so
they use the hourly settlements data on that behavior in their calculation.



                                                                                                        10
responsiveness of imports.13 They then simulate a dispatch of the in-state fossil
generation included within the CAISO grid against the remaining demand. To take
account of random forced outages, BBW use a Monte Carlo procedure, taking draws
from the outage distribution based on public data.

       Our procedure differs from BBW because it must be adapted to the limitations of
public data, and our goal of making relatively simple, but robust estimates. We describe
each major element of our analytical approach below.

Load Slices
        We are constrained to analyze months as homogeneous periods because we only
have hydro data available on a monthly basis (see below). Within each month, we rely,
for simplicity, on 10 load periods. We segment the hourly demand in each month into 10
load deciles. Within each decile, we look at the mean load in the decile and use the
intersection of that demand with the supply curve for the month to estimate the mean
price for that decile. We add 10% to each demand level reflecting the CAISO’s demand
for ancillary services capacity.14

Hydro
        Public data on hydroelectric output is only available on a monthly basis. EIA
Form 759 gives output at the unit level. These data allow us to separate units that are
dispatched by the CAISO from other California hydro units, but provide no information
about how to allocate the energy from the relevant units to different time periods. We
have tried assigning this energy to periods within each month using different algorithms.
These algorithms assign energy to higher demand periods up to a maximum subject to the
constraint that every period receive some minimum amount of hydro energy. Our base
case relies on an algorithm which limits the amount of hydro energy in each period to a
minimum of 60 percent of the amount that would be assigned to each hour if hydro
energy were spread evenly throughout the month and a maximum of 8,000 MW. This is
a conservative procedure that may tend to allocate less hydro capacity to high demand
periods than actually occurs, leading to higher estimates of competitive peak period
prices for electricity.

        The 8,000 MW hydro maximum is plausible since it represents approximately two
thirds of the hydro capacity inside of the ISO.15 Because of long-term contracts and
agreements, such as those between WAPA and many CA municipal utilities, not all
hydro capacity is available to meet peak demand. 8,000 MW is approximately the


13
   Adjustment bids are supply and demand curves representing offers by scheduling coordinators to
increase or decrease output at potentially congested interfaces. BBW aggregate these bids over all
interfaces on the boundary of the California ISO control area. This information is not publicly available.
14
   Hildebrandt (2000) uses a similar adjustment, representing 3% for regulation and 7% for WSCC
guidelines on reserves .
15
   Based on EIA Form 860, we count just under 12,000 MW of hydro capacity inside of the ISO including
all hydro and pump-storage capacity in California besides that owned by LADWP.


                                                                                                       11
capacity that can be dispatched by SCE and PG&E and hence is likely to be price-
responsive.

Imports
        Our measure of imports differs slightly from BBW. The settlements data utilized
by BBW treat SCE’s share of Mohave as must-take generation, and include it as part of
in-state production. In contrast, we use the line flow data as posted on the CAISO
website. Using line flows treats all out of state production, including that from SCE's
Mohave plant as imported.

        Otherwise we adopt the BBW philosophy with regard to adjusting imports. They
argue that the high observed prices in California would draw in more imports than would
occur under lower competitive prices, other things equal. Confidential data on adjustment
bids are used to characterize this elasticity. Instead of the transmission bid data, we use
data on the ex post realizations of net imports16 and PX prices and an assumed elasticity
of net imports to impute net imports under marginal cost pricing. In other words, for
each period and for every price level c, we calculate the amount of infra-marginal net
imports as follows:
                                                        η
                                               c 
                                  netimp(c) =       ⋅ netimp( p px )
                                              p 
                                                px 

where η is the elasticity of net imports, ppx is the realized PX price, and netimp(ppx) is the
realized level of net imports at the realized PX price. We have assumed an elasticity of
0.33. This elasticity is loosely based on BBW’s claim that imports would be 5.3 percent
lower (p. 30) and prices approximately 15.5 percent lower (p. 33) under marginal cost
pricing. Given the imprecision of their elasticity estimates,17 an elasticity of 0.33 is well
within the range of what they find.

In-state Fossil
        Natural gas costs for weekdays at the Southern California burnertip and at Malin
were provided to us by Southern California Edison, from trade publications. We add
transport costs to the Malin prices to bring the costs to the burnertip in Northern
California. Because we are constrained to a monthly level of analysis, we use monthly
averages of these prices. The monthly gas price values used are given in Section 3, where
we present results.

        We rely upon the Henwood Energy Services Incorporated (HESI) commercially
available database for the WSCC to characterize heat rates, capacities, forced outage
rates, and variable O&M costs for instate fossil generators. The heat rate data are
consistent with those found in Klein (1998).

16
  These data are only available beginning in January 1999. For benchmarking purposes, to estimate
imports for the last six months of 1998, we use data on realized net imports from the last six months of
1999.
17
  BBW’s estimate of 5.3 percent has a standard deviation of 8.1 percent.


                                                                                                     12
        Forced outages and planned outages are accounted for separately. We take a
simplified view of forced outages. We use the HESI data on forced outage rates to
reduce, or “derate,” the capacity of each generating unit in every load period. Planned
outages for maintenance, however, we allocate exclusively to low demand months. Our
procedure for scheduling maintenance seeks to equalize the reserve margin across
months. This is a common procedure in production simulation modeling, and it reflects
standard industry practices. Details are given in the Appendix.

        Our methods for reflecting forced outages differ from those of BBW. They use a
Monte Carlo simulation of forced outages for instate fossil generation. BBW argue that
maintenance decisions for these units are strategic variables and, therefore, they make no
estimate of such outages for instate fossil generators. By relying on settlements data for
must-take resources, BBW are reflecting both maintenance and forced outages for all of
this capacity. In contrast, we apply the outage treatment for instate fossil to must-take
resources as well, since we do not have hourly outage information.

 RECLAIM NOx RTC Prices
    One factor that can affect competitive market prices for electricity which neither
BBW nor the CAISO addresses involves the impact of the air emissions regulatory
framework in California. California has extremely stringent air quality regulations. One
pollutant of particular concern is nitrogen oxide (NOx). As explained above, regulation of
emissions in the Los Angeles area is controlled by the SCAQMD which utilizes the
Reclaim Trading Credit (RTC) emissions permit trading program for NOx emissions
from electric generating units and other stationary sources. Under this program NOx
emissions are regularly reported during pre-established cycle periods. The owners of a
source of NOx emissions must reconcile NOx RTC allowances with reported emissions
within 60 days of the end of the reporting cycle.18 The RTC program resembles the SO2
permit trading regime authorized under the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments.19

    We would expect competitive generation suppliers to include the prices of RTC NOx
credits in their bids even if these credits had been previously acquired at much lower
prices (or for free). This is the case because these emissions credits could be sold to other
affected sources at their market value and thus represent a legitimate competitive market
opportunity cost.20 RTC allowances had been selling at very low prices ($1-2/pound)
through the early part of 2000. Since most generation in the SCAQMD area emits 1
lb/MWh of NOx or less, emissions costs internalized into electricity prices would be $1-
2/MWh at most during this period. Starting in Spring 2000, however, RTC prices began

18
     NOx RTC allowances have expiration dates that correspond to the end of each cycle period.
19
     The SO2 emissions trading program is described in detail by Ellerman et al, (2000).
20
   Obviously, generators which acquired these RTC NOx credits at much lower prices will earn very
significant profits as a consequence of the run-up in NOx credit prices and its impact on wholesale
electricity prices. Thus, the impact of changes in NOx credit prices on electricity prices in a competitive
wholesale market is far larger than it would have been under traditional cost-of-service regulation where
consumers would have captured any infra-marginal "rents" associated with changes in NOx credit prices.


                                                                                                        13
to increase substantially.21 By June they were nearly $10/pound. This would add
$10/MWh to MCP most of the time, and much more when gas turbines with much higher
emissions rates, e.g., some turbines emit in excess of 6 lb/MWh, are producing
electricity. NOx RTC prices continued to climb throughout the summer, rising to around
$35/pound by late August. At these levels, NOx RTC requirements significantly affect
price during all hours for which fossil plants in the SCAQMD clear the market, but
especially during peak periods when gas turbines are on the margin. Therefore, we
decided to add the effects of NOx RTC prices to our estimates.

    For most units in SCAQMD that were formerly owned by SCE, we rely on estimates
provided to us by SCE based on publicly available data and regulatory filings. For other
units we rely on NOx emissions from the HESI databases.


4. Results

    Table 2 below presents our estimates of the competitive wholesale spot market
benchmark prices for May through September 2000. We report a range of prices,
reflecting alternative assumptions about NOx RTC prices. Table 2 also displays the
actual average day-ahead PX prices during these months of year 2000 for comparison
purposes. The data on NOx RTC prices are difficult to interpret for a variety of reasons.
There is general agreement that NOx RTC prices were increasing between May and
September. Finding an appropriate price for each month requires that we interpret the
data from SCAQMD carefully. We give a full discussion of the choices we have made in
the Appendix. Table 2 indicates in bold the benchmark wholesale market price associated
with our choice of the most appropriate NOx RTC price for each month.

      It is clear from Table 2 that there is a significant gap between the competitive
benchmark prices that we estimate and actual market prices in June, July and August

21
  We have not analyzed why NOx RTC credit prices increased so much during the summer of 2000 or
whether the observed price increases are consistent with competitive behavior in the RTC credit market. A
careful analysis of behavior and performance of the RTC credit market would also be a worthwhile
undertaking.


                                                                                                      14
2000. The gap for September is much smaller and is within the error bounds of our
methodology. We want to emphasize that this gap between competitive benchmark
prices and actual market prices takes into account the effects of gas prices, load levels,
imports levels, and NOx credit prices; the "market fundamentals" that have often been
identified as contributing to higher prices in summer 2000 than in summer 1999. It is
also important to recognize that if NOx credit prices had remained at 1999 levels,
competitive benchmark prices would have been very significantly reduced. We believe
that the estimated price gap is large enough to provide credible evidence that market
power or other market imperfections lead to a significant increase in prices above
competitive levels during summer 2000. At the very least, this finding makes it clear that
additional analysis of generator and marketer behavior based on data which are not now
available to us is warranted.

        Our estimates of competitive benchmark prices are very similar to those obtained
in other studies using similar techniques and confidential data to which we do not have
access. BBW does not include the cost of RTC allowances in their estimates. Given the
very low level of RTC prices until the Spring of 2000, these costs would not have a
significant impact the estimates made in BBW, since these only extend through
September, 1999. In the Appendix we compare the results from applying our approach
with those reported by BBW for January-September 1999, ignoring NOx RTC prices.

        Hildebrandt’s estimates of the May-September competitive prices are similar to
our estimates in the zero RTC price case. For May, June and July our estimates are within
$1/MWh of his. For August and September our estimate is $4-8/MWh higher.

Sensitivity Cases
        One use of the framework that we have applied to develop competitive
benchmark prices is to examine hypotheses about the effects of key variables on
competitive market prices. Here we examine three significant issues; (1) the effect on
wholesale prices of reductions in net imports between 1999 and 2000, (2) the effects on
wholesale prices of installing NOx control equipment on the five most polluting gas
turbines in the SCAQMD, and (3) the effect of retrofitting NOx controls both on the gas
turbines as well as on all steam generators in SCAQMD.

        First, we look at the effect of reductions in net imports between 1999 and 2000 on
the competitive benchmark wholesale market prices for electricity estimated using our
approach. Many commentators have remarked on the significant decline in net imports
between summer 1999 and summer 2000. Table 3 shows the mean difference in actual
net imports from year to year. It also compares the estimated benchmark price before
considering effects of RTC credit prices (i.e., based on the zero RTC credit price column
in Table 2) with our estimate of what the competitive benchmark price would have been
if the 1999 level of imports had occurred. It is clear that prices are higher in Summer
2000 as a result of lower net imports, but if NOx emissions were not an issue, the impact
of reduced imports alone accounts for a relatively small fraction of the actual increase in
wholesale prices from Summer 1999 to Summer 2000. As NOx RTC prices rise toward
the end of the summer, the reduced level of imports becomes a much more important
factor in explaining wholesale price increases.

        Next we examine the potential effect on wholesale market prices of additional
NOx controls applied to the five most polluting gas turbines in SCAQMD. Engineering
estimates of the cost and performance of water injection retrofits for gas turbines suggest
that 65% reduction in emission rates are achievable for costs of less than $1 million per
unit.22 We illustrate the dramatic effect that such reductions would have had on
wholesale electricity prices in August 2000, when these units set market-clearing prices
for electricity during high load periods. With these modest NOx control expenditures,
wholesale market prices would have been $24/MWh lower in August 2000, assuming
$35/lb RTC prices. At lower loads, such as in the months of June, July and September,
the effect is half as large.

       Table 4 shows the effect of NOx controls on the gas turbines and the installation
of SCRs on steam units by load decile for August. Table 5 shows the impact of both
kinds of controls on average benchmark prices for June-September for various NOx
RTCs prices. This enhanced NOx control initiative, including both emissions controls on
gas turbines and the installation of SCRs on steam units, further reduces benchmark
competitive prices.     Overall, these NOx emissions controls reduce benchmark
competitive prices by over $17/MWh on average during June through September 2000.23

 Overbuin (1994) gives the performance data on tests for the Alamitos gas turbine. This is a representative
case. Cost estimates come from C. Alcaino, SCE.
23
  Using the bold figures in Table 4 to identity the changes in RTC prices over the period, we get
benchmark price reductions of $5 in June, $9 in July, $34 in August and $21 in September.



                                                                                                        16
This translates into a reduction in payments by buyers to electricity suppliers of roughly
$1.5 billion during the June through September period.24

        Note, as well, that our calculations only take account of the fact that NOx controls
reduce the number of NOx RTCs required to supply a MWh of electricity from these
units, holding NOx RTC prices constant. However, a program of accelerating NOx
controls would also lead to a reduction in the demand for NOx RTCs. This in turn would
lead both to lower NOx RTC prices and, as a consequence, to lower wholesale electricity
prices. Thus, the implementation of NOx controls would have a second indirect impact
on wholesale electricity prices by reducing the price of NOx RTCs.

        It is clear that initiatives aimed at significantly reducing NOx emissions in the
SCAQMD could lead to much lower competitive wholesale electricity prices.
Accordingly, policies aimed at accelerating the implementation of cost-effective NOx
control strategies in the SCAQMD should be given the highest priority by policymakers
in California.

5.   Physical Withholding: The Economic Logic

    The previous analyses shows that "market fundamentals" cannot fully account for the
high levels of observed prices in the Summer of 2000. Even after accounting for lower
levels of imports and very high NOx RTC prices, we still observe a large deviation of
wholesale market prices from the competitive benchmark price, i.e., marginal costs of
supplying additional electricity at the associated market clearing quantities. However,
while we observe large price/marginal cost margins during the Summer of 2000 which
are inconsistent with competitive markets, our analysis so far does not measure behavior
that is likely to be the cause of these high prices. In the next two sections we investigate
the hypothesis that withholding behavior by generators in California is one cause of high
prices. It is clear from first principles that supply withholding could be the source of high
prices. Whether this is, in fact, the case is an empirical question. McCullough (2000)
strongly suggests that output levels from California generators were less than was
economic during the summer of 2000.

   We begin by outlining simply the profit maximization logic behind capacity
withdrawal and show that rational capacity withholding does not require collusion among


                                                                                          18
suppliers. We consider the unilateral case, i.e. only one portfolio player adopts this
strategy and all other generators behave competitively and bid in their supplies into the
market at prices equal to their marginal cost. We can characterize the profit effects of
capacity withdrawal simply as the sum of two effects. These are (1) the increased profits
on the capacity offered after withdrawal due to the ability to raise price, (2) the lost
profits of capacity withdrawn (see Wolfram, 1998). The profit changes must-take account
of the cost reduction due to not producing on the withdrawn capacity. We can express
these effects as follows:

       Δ Profit = Δ Price* Remaining Quantity - Δ Capacity * Competitive Price
       + Δ Operating Cost.

This expression is derived formally in the Appendix.

        As is apparent from the formula, whether withdrawing capacity is in the self
interest of a portfolio generator will depend critically upon the slope of the supply curve
during the period of withholding. It must be steep enough to result in MCPs sufficiently
high so that the increase in profit on generation still tendered to the market more than
offsets the profits lost on the capacity withdrawn. We construct some examples based on
our benchmark estimate of the supply conditions that prevailed in June 2000. These
estimates come from our June simulations (without NOx effects). We examine one case,
at high loads, where a load increase or capacity withdrawal of 1000 MW results in a
price increase of about $10 per MWh. Our second case, at lower loads, produces only a
$1 price increase for the same 1000 MW withdrawal.

        Table 6 displays the profitability effects of capacity withholding for the two
examples. In both cases, we make three assumptions: 1) the portfolio generator with
3,000 MW of capacity produces only half that amount; 2) the competitive MCP is
$60/MWh; 3) the generator’s marginal cost is $55/MWh. In the first case, where capacity
withdrawal raises price significantly, the revenue gain is large. In the second case, the
impact of withholding capacity on price is relatively small because supply is much more
elastic over the relevant range of output. The revenue effect of withholding is a net loss,
since the increase in price on the tendered generation does not offset the lost profits on
generation withheld. The details of these results are shown in the following table.

                     Table 6. Unilateral Market Power Examples

            Case      Revenue loss      Revenue gain       Cost savings           Δ Profit
  Δ Case 1, High           90,000          25,714.29             78,750         14,464.29
   Price Increase
  Δ Case 2, Low              90,000          2,571.43            82,500         -4,928.57
   Price Increase

These examples rely on the assumption that only one supplier withholds capacity, while
all of the other suppliers behave competitively. In the California electricity market
during the Summer of 2000, it appears that more than one portfolio player was
implementing a withholding strategy. We illustrate this claim empirically in the next


                                                                                        19
section. If multiple suppliers are behaving strategically, the effects of withholding on
wholesale market prices could be larger.


6. Empirical Analysis of Withholding

    Now we turn to the analysis of physical supply and withholding behavior. We use
plant and unit level output data from EPA and the WSCC to examine the physical
behavior of the price setting firms to determine whether there is really “scarcity” or
whether it appears that the generators are withholding supplies from the market when it
would be profitable for a generator without market power to supply more.

    We restrict our analysis to a set of high priced hours when it should have been
economical for virtually all of the fossil generators to have found it economical to supply
in a competitive market. These are all hours for which the PX Day Ahead Unconstrained
Price exceeded $120/MWh in June, $90/MWh in July, $130/MWh in August and
$110/MWh in September. We compare observed levels of production by unit generators
likely to be setting prices, with their maximum generating capacities during those hours.
NP 15 generation is analyzed separately from SP 15. There is a substantial "output gap"
between observed and maximum levels of generation in both zones. Three factors may
explain this gap: (1) capacity may be covering the CAISO's ancillary services
requirements, (2) capacity may be out of service due to forced outages, and (3) interzonal
transmission constraints (South to North) may limit economic dispatch of SP 15 plants.
Therefore, we test whether the gap can be explained by these three factors. If the gap
cannot be explained, we conclude that it is indicative of generator withholding resulting
either from high bids that do not clear the day-ahead or real time energy markets or direct
withholding of capacity from these markets.

•   The tests of the output gap for ancillary services requirements have two elements: (1)
    We compare the zonal CAISO ancillary services requirement in the selected hours
    against the output gap and (2) We consider whether the CAISO dispatched
    replacement reserves during our sample hours. If reserves were dispatched, they will
    appear as production in our data and would, therefore, not explain any output gap.

•   The test of the output gap for forced outages is necessarily limited in its applicability.
    As explained in detail below, we rely on two data sources: EPA and WSCC. The
    EPA data are sufficiently disaggregated to support an analysis of forced outages,
    whereas the WSCC data are not. We apply three outage tests to the EPA data to
    ascertain whether forced outages might explain output gaps.

•   The test of the output gap for the effects of interzonal transmission constraints
    requires that we review congestion during our sample hours, between the CAISO
    zones that might limit economic dispatch of plants. Production levels in hours
    without a constraint should not be affected by transmission issues.




                                                                                            20
    We rely on two data sources for this analysis; both have hourly production data, but
the sources differ by the level of aggregation. The first source gives unit-specific data.
These data are available from the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) Continuous
Emissions Monitoring System (CEMS). The CEMS database tracks hourly production
and emissions of certain pollutants that are regulated under the Clean Air Act. CEMS
data for the second quarter of 2000 are available on the EPA’s website.25 CEMS data do
not include gas turbines and some small thermal units. Table 7 below lists the units in
SCAQMD that are omitted from the CEMS database, their ownership, capacity and NOx
emission rates. The second source gives data at the plant level, not the unit level. These
data are from the WSCC’s Extra High Voltage (EHV) database. The EHV data, which
are available to all WSCC members, were provided to us by SCE. These data exclude
plants of less than 250 MW.26

       The overlap between these two data sources is incomplete; the EPA data are more
disaggregated, but exclude small steam units and gas turbines. To determine the extent of
the comparability between the data sets, we compared hourly generation reported by both
sources for June for five plants: El Segundo, Pittsburg, Moss Landing, Morro Bay, and
Ormond Beach. None of these plants have units that are excluded from the EPA dataset.
Thus, hourly production reported should be comparable between the two sources. We
found that the correlation between the hourly production data was about 95 percent for
each plant and that the mean hourly output over the month differed by about 5 percent.
On this basis we concluded that we could use both data sources to develop a reasonably
complete picture of physical behavior during the June-September period. We begin our
discussion with an analysis of June based on the EPA data. We will address data
comparability further when we turn to the analysis that uses the EHV data.

     CEMS data for the third quarter of 2000 will not become available until after 1/1/2001.

     For example, the Potrero plant in San Francisco is included in the EPA data but not in the EHV data.

EPA CEMS Analysis of June
       Within June, we confine our attention to hours when the unconstrained PX price
was at $120/MWh or more. There were 137 such hours in June. Our analysis attempts to
discover if there is an unexplained gap between maximum production by generators and
observed production during the so-called scarcity periods. An otherwise unexplained gap
would tend to support our hypothesis that production was withheld by generators in an
attempt to drive up price during these periods.

        First, we compute the aggregate output gap for all generators in the EPA database
for June hours when the Unconstrained PX price is above $120/MWh; there are 137
hours that meet this criterion. In each of the 137 hours when the price is above
$120/MWh, we observe the hourly output of generators owned by Duke, Southern, AES,
Dynegy and Reliant. At $120/MWh, the price is above the marginal costs of all
generators in the EPA database,27 thus, we expect to find that production in these hours
will be at maximum levels. Next, we sum up the hourly output for each firm in NP15 and
in SP15 separately. We compare the June production of each generator over each of the
137 hours to their observed aggregate maximum output in the second quarter of 2000.
We define the output gap for each firm to be the difference between that maximum
output and the observed output in each of the 137 high priced hours. It is important to
note that the dispatch of these generators may be controlled by contractual arrangements
with third parties other than the owners of the generating plants. We do not know for a
fact to what extent this is the case. We use the owners simply to identify the generating
plants examined and any apparent withholding observed.

       Next, we want to see how much of the gap can be explained by the CAISO’s
reservation of capacity for Ancillary Services (we include Up Regulation, Spin, Non-Spin
and Replacement Reserves).28 Public data on CAISO demands for Ancillary Services
(AS) are available by zone. We compare the output gap by zone to AS capacity by zone
for each hour. The AS demand includes both the Day Ahead and the Hour Ahead
demands. Table 8 below summarizes our results.




27
  The June gas prices were under $5/MMBtu. The marginal heat rates for these generators are less than
12,000 Btu/kWh. This means that marginal fuel cost is <$60/MWh. For those units in SCAQMD, their
NOx emission rates are all <2 lbs/MWh. Therefore at $10/lb RTC costs, these units have marginal costs of
< $80/MWh.
28
     We exclude Down Regulation, because that does not require that capacity be held in reserve.

          High-price hours are hours for which the PX price exceeded
          $120/MWh.


        For SP15, the mean of the output gap is 3351 MW compared to 1672 MW for the
mean of the AS demands in the zone. This leaves an average unexplained output gap of
1679 MW during the 137 hours, assuming that all of AS capacity requirements were
covered by these plants. Based on these results, it looks as if capacity is being withdrawn
on average during this period in SP15. The results for NP15 are different. Here the mean
of the output gap is 983 MW, which is less than the mean demand for AS services, 1510
MW. Therefore, we cannot conclude definitely that there was capacity withholding in
NP15. It is important to point out, however, that this assessment is quite crude and
supplies an upper bound on AS capacity requirements that might explain the output gap.
This is due to three factors: (1) it neglects the possibility that hydro capacity or imports
are supplying some of the AS demand; (2) ramp rate restrictions might have made it
physically impossible for the plants to supply the AS full requirement; (3) replacement
reserve was frequently dispatched by the CAISO during the summer, dispatched reserves
would have been reflected as production in these data. While we attempt to account for
the effects of dispatching reserves on our analysis, we are unable to test the effects of
alternative suppliers of AS services or those of ramp rate restrictions because of data
limitations. If we had access to confidential data available to the CAISO, we could also
determine if these additional factors would affect our results.

        An alternative way of expressing these results is to identify the size of the hourly
output gaps (net of AS procured in the zone) together with the number of hours in which
the gap occurs. We have computed this distribution both with and without accounting for
the effect of dispatched reserves on the net output gap. Table 9 below displays these


                                                                                         23
calculations, starting at a level of 500 MW of withheld capacity net of AS demands. For
example, there were 88 hours in June when net capacity of more than 1000 MW appear
to have been withheld in SP15 before accounting for dispatched reserves. After including
the potential effects of dispatched reserves in our analysis of AS capacity requirements,
there were 126 hours in June when net capacity of more than 1000 MW appear to have
been withheld.

        Thus far our calculations make no attempt to assess whether the output gap can be
explained by unscheduled outages. We examine this question next. Evaluating the effects
of unscheduled (forced) outages is not completely straight-forward, because of the
discretionary element in outages. Therefore we apply three different tests for forced
outages. Test 1 measures the maximum output for a generation portfolio by looking only
at units that were producing any output in the hour in question. This is the strictest
definition of a “no outage condition.” Test 2 measures the maximum output for a
generation portfolio by looking only at units that were producing any output in the day in
question. Finally Test 3 measures the maximum output for a generation portfolio by
looking only at units that were producing any output in the day in question or the day
before. Another way of describing Test 3 is that an outage is real only if it occurred both
the day before the day of our scarcity hours as well as the day of such an event.

        Table 10 shows that the mean gap falls compared with the results on Table 8 as
expected. Qualitatively, SP15 shows a mean output gap that is between 282 and 682 MW
greater than the mean zonal AS requirement (1672) in the zone depending on the outage
test used. These results change if adjusted for the average 628 MW of replacement
reserve capacity (see Table 12) that may have been dispatched during the sample hours in
June. Following that adjustment, the mean output gap in SP15 after accounting for
outages is between 910 and 1310 MW.

Test 1 includes all units with positive production in a specific hour in the calculation of maximum potential

Test 2 includes all units with positive production in the same day in the calculation of maximum potential

         For SP15, Table 11 shows the number of hours that the output gap minus the total
 AS demand exceeds particular levels under each of the three outage tests identified
 above. As can be seen from the table, there are still roughly 50 high-price hours during
 June 2000 when more than 1000 MW appears to have been withheld from the market
 before inclusion of hours during which AS reserve capacity may have been dispatched.
 Inclusion of these additional 38 hours (see Table 9) would leave 88 high-price hours
 when more than 1000 MW appears to have been withheld from the market.

        Logically, congestion on the transmission system could help to explain the output
gaps we have identified. While intrazonal constraints would not affect production levels
within a zone, interzonal constraints potentially could. We therefore have examined data
on interzonal transmission levels and congestion to determine if transmission congestion
has had the affect of contributing to the output gaps. Since it appears that withholding
was most likely in the SP15 zone, we have reviewed the possible impacts of South to
North congestion on our findings. Tables 9 and 11 include hourly distribution of the
output gaps, after eliminating hours for which this transmission path is constrained. We
found that while interzonal transmission constraints do occur occasionally, in June they
are limited to less than 10 percent of the scarcity hours. Thus, the effects of constraints on
the production levels and output gaps analyzed here are minor.

EHV Data Analysis
        First we use the same approach to analyze the June EHV data that we applied to
the EPA data above, and then we compare our analysis using the June EHV data with the
previous discussion. Table 12 parallels Table 8 above. The main difference between these
tables is that the EHV data includes about 1300 MW of capacity in SP15 that is excluded
from the EPA data.29 However, the mean output in SP15 using the EHV data only
increases by about 350 MW, so the mean output gap increases by about 1000 MW in this
zone. The results for NP15 are about 115 MW less than are shown on Table 8.

            High-price hours are hours for which the PX price exceeded
            $120/MWh.




       Next, we extend our analysis from June, to cover the remainder of the summer.
We summarize, in a more aggregated fashion, the mean output gaps as estimated in Table
12 for SP15 in June, July, August and September and include the estimated effects of
dispatched reserves and of transmission congestion on the output gaps. Table 13 presents
these data for each of the months June through September. For each month, we first
show the SP15 mean output gap (net of AS requirements with and without replacement
reserves) over all hours and then over hours for which interzonal transmission lines are
unconstrained. In June and July, less than ten percent of high priced hours occur during
periods of transmission congestion, and the average output gap remains relatively stable.
However, in August and September almost a third of high-priced hours occur at the same
time as South to North interzonal line constraints and the mean output gaps for these

and gas turbines (see Table 6 above).

High price hours are hours for which the PX price exceeded $120/MWh in June, $90/MWh in July,
$130/MWh in August, and $110/MWh in September. (See Sheffrin (2000))



Data for September are through September 20.



        The data in Table 13 from the WSCC database are unadjusted for the effect of
price caps on the economics of plants in SCAQMD with high NOx emission rates. The
five gas turbines with emission rates greater than 4.5 lbs/MWh would have RTC costs
greater than $157/MWh in August and September when RTC prices were at $35/lb. The
fuel costs of the gas turbines would be at or above $100/MWh during this period as well.
When the price cap was lowered to $250/MWh on August 7, these units had marginal
costs above the cap. Therefore their capacity, about 600 MW total, should be excluded
from the output gap estimates in Table 13. There may also be a related issue for units
with NOx emission rates that are in the 2 lb/MWh range. At $35/lb, these units would
have $70/MWh marginal costs for RTC credits at the gas prices prevailing in August and
September. Some of these units might have marginal costs above the cut-off level for the
scarcity hours that we examine in the aggregate here. We have not tested precisely the
extent to which cost considerations could account for the output gap in August and
September. These issues do not arise in June and July when RTC prices were lower.

       The outage tests that we developed with the EPA data cannot be applied to the
EHV results. Outages are events that occur to units, whereas the EHV data reports
production only at the more aggregated station level. However, our results without
consideration of outages reveal SP 15 net unexplained output gaps that are sufficiently



                                                                                                      29
large to suggest that power supplies were withheld in the zone during the June through
September period.

    We recognize that this analysis of capacity withholding is very rough and necessarily
plagued by data imperfections. Moreover, the analysis does not examine behavior of
generators outside of California, and does not account for aggregation and contractual
arrangements by and with wholesale marketers. A more complete analysis is not possible
without access to confidential supplier data.

7. Conclusions

    It is clear that increases in gas prices, increased demand, reduced availability of
power imports, and higher prices for emissions permits contributed to significantly higher
wholesale market prices in California during 2000, compared to the previous two years.
However, based on our analysis of available data, we conclude that wholesale electricity
prices in California far exceeded competitive levels during the June, July and August of
2000. The high wholesale electricity prices observed in Summer 2000 cannot be fully
explained as the natural outcome of "market fundamentals" in competitive markets since
there is a very significant gap between actual market prices and competitive benchmark
prices that take account of these market fundamentals. Moreover, there is considerable
empirical evidence to support a presumption that the high prices experienced in the
summer of 2000 reflect the withholding of supplies from the market by suppliers
(generators or marketers). We base these conclusions on results of the two analyses
described herein:

•   Competitive Benchmark Price Analysis: Observed prices in California in Summer
    2000 were greater than benchmark competitive price levels; these differences are not
    fully explained by higher loads, reduced levels of imports, high gas prices or by high
    prices for NOx RTCs.

•   Capacity Withholding Analysis: The information that we have available to us
    suggests that withholding of capacity in SP 15 to drive up price occurred during
    Summer 2000. We find a substantial gap between maximum levels of generation and
    observed levels in those hours identified as scarcity hours by others. This gap cannot
    be explained by the CAISO's requirements for ancillary services or by reasonable
    estimates of forced outages. While our analysis of withholding is necessarily limited
    by the data available to us, there is sufficient empirical evidence to suggest that the
    high observed prices reflect suppliers exercising market power.

We believe that the largest contributor to the differences between our monthly estimates
and those of BBW have to do with scheduled and unscheduled outages. As noted
previously, BBW have available the hourly level of production by must-take resources.
This includes the effect of both kinds of outages. We have relied on ex ante estimates and
a maintenance scheduling heuristic, which is likely to be imprecise.

B. Net Import Adjustment

 The following table shows actual PX prices, estimated marginal costs using our methods,
actual net imports, and estimated competitive net imports for each load decile in July
2000. Our estimates of competitive net imports are uniformly below observed net
imports because our estimates of marginal costs are uniformly below observed PX prices.

D. Unilateral Market Power

This exercise explores the profitability of a generator withholding capacity relative to a
competitive baseline in which price is set by industry marginal cost and all generation
with marginal cost below the market-clearing price is dispatched. We assume that all
other generators produce at competitive levels and demand is completely inelastic.
Under these assumptions, the effect of withholding on price is the same as a leftward shift
of the industry supply curve by the amount of withholding.

Suppose that all of a generator’s capacity qc is economic at a hypothetical competitive
market-clearing price pc. If it bid all of the capacity at below the market-clearing price, it
would earn profits

Π c = p c q c − c(q c )

where c(qc) represents its total cost of producing qc.

Now, suppose that the same generator can raise the market-clearing price by withholding
and producing ql<qc. In this case, its profits would be


Π l = p l ql − c ( ql )

where




                                                                                           34
             ∆p
pl = p c +      ⋅ ∆q
             ∆q

and ∆q is the extent of the generator’s withholding.

The change in the generator’s profits due to withholding is then

                         ∆p
∆Π = pc (ql − qc ) +        ⋅ ∆qql + (c(qc ) − c(q l ) )                                          (1)
                         ∆q

The first term represents the revenue loss from producing at a lower level of output, the
second term represents increased per unit revenue on remaining output, and the final term
represents the cost savings from producing less. The profits from withholding are the
sum of these three components.

If the generator’s marginal costs at qc and ql are MC(qc )and MC(ql) and we assume that
marginal cost is linear between qc and ql, then

c(q c ) − c(ql ) = (0.5 ⋅ MC (q l ) + 0.5 ⋅ MC (q c ) ) ⋅ (qc − ql )

Based on assumptions about the generator’s marginal costs at different output levels and the slope
of the industry supply curve, i.e. the extent to which prices rise as inframarginal capacity is
withheld, we can calculate the gains from withholding a specific quantity of capacity. Table 5
shows a few numerical examples. The following table shows how to estimate the slope of the
supply curve for June. Table 6 employs slopes based on a similar methodology to estimate
hypothetical profits from unilateral withholding.

   E. RTC NOx Credit Prices
           A unique characteristic of the RTC program is that while allowances periodically
   expire, the settlement procedures in the program give NOx emitters up to two months
   following the close of the cycle period to reconcile RTC allowances with actual
   emissions. There is an active market in expired allowances during those two months. It
   is improper, however, to correlate current prices for electric power with price movements
   in expired allowances. Competitive prices will reflect the marginal costs of current
   inputs to current generation; competitive prices do not recoup unanticipated increases in
   sunk costs from past periods. We have therefore examined the prices of RTC NOX
   credits over the study period in two groups: prices for June are represented by June
   prices for RTCs expiring on June 30, 2000, and prices for the post-June period are
   represented by contemporaneous prices for RTCs expiring on December 31, 2000.

           The main data issue for the SCAQMD's list of transactions at more that $4.00 is
   that the date given for an observation is the "registration recording date" (rrd) not the date
   the transaction was executed or received by SCAQMD. We believe that the lag between
   the rrd and the "deal date" is about 1.5 weeks. It looks like almost all of the rrd's are
   either Tuesdays or Fridays plus there is a memo in the materials discussing the receipt of
   a transaction at $30 on the 27th of July. The rrd for this transaction is the 4th of August.

          With that caveat, we reviewed transactions over time for RTCs both for the period
   ending 6/30/00 and for that ending 12/31/00. The graphs of these transactions by
   estimated date are shown below. On the basis of these data, we choose $10/lb as the June
   RTC price, $20/lb as the July price and $35/lb as the August and September prices.
