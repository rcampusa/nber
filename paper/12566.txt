This paper contrasts the properties of dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin models with overlapping generations
with those of models with infinitely lived consumers. In both environments, if capital is mobile across
countries, factor price equalization occurs after the initial period. In general, however, the properties
of equilibria differ drastically across environments: With infinitely lived consumers, we find that factor
prices equalize in any steady state or cycle and that, in general, there is positive trade in any steady
state or cycle. With overlapping generations, in contrast, we construct examples with steady states
and cycles in which factor prices are not equalized, and we find that any equilibrium that converges
to a steady state or cycle with factor price equalization has no trade after a finite number of periods.

1. Introduction
       This paper studies the properties of dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin models — combinations of
static Heckscher-Ohlin trade models and two-sector growth models — with two different
demographic environments, an infinitely lived consumer environment and an overlapping
generations environment. In the model, a finite number of countries that differ only in population
sizes and initial endowments of capital interact with each other by exchanging two traded goods,
which are produced using capital and labor. The traded goods are used either in consumption or in
the production of a nontraded investment good. Consumers supply labor inelastically and choose
levels of consumption and capital accumulation to maximize their lifetime utility.
       We find that the equilibrium properties of the model depend crucially on the assumptions
made on international capital markets and on the choice of demographic environment. If
international borrowing and lending are permitted, factor prices equalize after the first period,
independently of the environment. Furthermore, the levels of capital and of international
borrowing are not determined in equilibrium. At any given point in the equilibrium path, there is a
continuum of possible continuation paths that have all the same prices and aggregate variables, but
differ in the distribution of capital and international borrowing across countries and in the pattern
of production and trade.
       If international borrowing and lending are not permitted, then the equilibrium properties
vary depending on the demographic environment. In the infinitely lived consumer environment, if
a nontrivial steady state exists, there is a continuum of nontrivial steady states, indexed by the
distribution of capital across countries. To which steady state the world economy converges
depends on initial endowments of capital. Factor prices equalize in all steady states and trade is
positive in all steady states except the one where capital-labor ratios are equal across countries. In
the overlapping generations environment, any nontrivial steady state with factor price equalization
is autarkic and has no trade. Furthermore, we show using examples that factor price equalization
does not need to occur in steady state. Both environments also differ in the behavior of equilibrium
paths that converge to a steady state. In the overlapping generations environment, any equilibrium
converging to a steady state where factor prices equalize becomes autarkic in a finite number of
periods. No corresponding result exists for the infinitely lived consumer environment.
       As in two-sector closed economy models, equilibrium paths may exhibit cycles and chaotic
behavior. In the infinitely lived consumer environment, we show that factor prices equalize in any



                                              1
equilibrium cycle. In the overlapping generations environment, we show using examples that there
may exist equilibrium cycles in which factor prices are not equalized. The paper develops a
methodology for constructing two-country, two-sector overlapping generations models from closed
one- and two-sector economies in such a way that preserves their properties in terms of multiplicity
of equilibria or cyclical behavior.
       The literature on dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin models was pioneered by Oniki and Uzawa
(1965), Bardhan (1965), Stiglitz (1970), and Deardorff and Hanson (1978). In their models,
countries produce two traded goods, a consumption good and an investment good, using production
functions that differ across sectors but not across countries. In addition to differences in
endowments, these papers also assume that countries have different savings rates or rates of time
preference, so that the steady state is determined independently of initial conditions. Their
assumptions prevent factor prices from equalizing in the steady state. Our model differs from
theirs in two crucial aspects: we consider utility-maximizing consumers and we do not impose any
modeling assumptions restricting the equilibrium behavior of factor prices. Baxter (1992) studies
the long-run behavior of a dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin model where countries differ in tax policy
and shows how changes in tax policy may lead to reversals in comparative advantage. Cuñat and
Maffezzoli (2004a) calibrate a specific dynamic trade model and study issues of convergence in
income levels across countries under the assumption that factor prices do not equalize over time.
       In contrast to the previous studies, more recent papers in the literature impose, by
assumption or by the choice of production functions, factor price equalization along the equilibrium
path. Cuñat and Maffezzoli (2004b) introduce technology shocks and study the business cycle
properties of a dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin model under the assumption of factor price equalization.
Chen (1992) studies the equilibrium properties of a dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin model with elastic
labor supply under the assumption that factor prices equalize along the equilibrium path. Ventura
(1997) adds additional structure to the model that guarantees that factor prices equalize in
equilibrium, independently of initial conditions, and that rules out the possibility of cyclical and
chaotic behavior. He derives results regarding convergence of income distribution across countries
over time. Bajona and Kehoe (2006) study the properties of a generalized version of Ventura’s
model without imposing factor price equalization. They show that the convergence results of
Ventura (1997) depend crucially on the factor price equalization assumption.




                                              2
          A related literature considers two-sector growth models with infinitely lived consumers
under the small open economy assumption. In the infinitely lived consumer environment, these
papers include Findlay (1970), Mussa (1978), Smith (1984), Atkeson and Kehoe (2000), Chatterjee
and Shukayev (2004), and Obiols-Homs (2005).
          The literature on dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin models in an overlapping generations
environment is less abundant. Galor (1992) characterizes the dynamics of a two-sector, two-
period-lived overlapping generations model of growth in a closed economy. Two-country models
of trade with an overlapping generations environment assume some difference across countries
besides factor endowments. For example, Bianconi (1995) assumes differences in tax rates across
countries; Galor and Lin (1997) and Mountford (1998) assume that countries differ in their rates of
time preference; Sayan (2005) assumes differences in population growth rates. All these papers
study the long-run properties of the model under the factor price equalization assumption. Papers
that study the two-sector overlapping generations environment under the small open economy
assumption include Serra (1991), Gokcekus and Tower (1998), Kemp and Wong (1995), and Fisher
(1992).
          A recent literature constructs dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin models that exhibit endogenous
growth. In the infinitely lived environment, Nishimura and Shimomura (2002) and Bond, Trask
and Wang (2003) derive some results regarding indeterminacy of equilibria. Guilló (1999) and
Mountford (1999) introduce production externalities in the overlapping generations environment.

2. The model

          There are n countries in the model, which differ in their population sizes and their initial
endowments of capital. Each country can produce three goods: two traded goods — a capital
intensive good and a labor intensive good — and a nontraded investment good. The technologies
available to produce these goods are the same across countries. Each traded good j , j = 1, 2 , is
produced using capital and labor according to the production function

                                              y j = φ j (k j , A j )                                 (1)


A.1. The functions φ j are increasing, concave, continuously differentiable, and homogeneous of

degree one.




                                                3
We assume that φ j is continuously differentiable to simplify the exposition, and we let additional

subscripts — φ jK (k j , A j ) , φ jL (k j , A j ) — denote partial derivatives. It is an open question whether

any substantive conclusion depends on this assumption. In particular, our analysis is easily
extended to the fixed coefficient production functions, y j = min[k j / a jK , A j / a jL ] .

         Producers minimize costs taking prices as given and earn zero profits:

                                       r ≥ p jφ jK (k j , A j ) , = if k j > 0                              (2)

                                       w ≥ p jφ jL (k j , A j ) , = if A j > 0                              (3)

for j = 1, 2 . Here r is the rental rate, w is the wage, and p1 and p2 are the prices of the traded
goods.

A.2. Good 1 is relatively capital intensive and there is no capital intensity reversal. That is,

                                 φ1L (k / A,1) φ2 L (k / A,1)
                                              <               for all k / A > 0 .                           (4)
                                 φ1K (k / A,1) φ2 K (k / A,1)

This condition and the concavity of φ1 and φ2 imply that for any wage-rental ratio w / r , the profit
maximizing capital-labor ratios satisfy

                                                     k1 k2
                                                       > .                                                  (5)
                                                     A1 A 2

Notice that, if the production functions φ j , j = 1, 2 , display constant elasticities of substitution,

assumption A.2 implies that both production functions have the same elasticity of substitution.
         The investment good is produced using the two traded goods:

                                                  x = f ( x1 , x2 ) .                                       (6)


A.3. The function f is increasing, concave, continuously differentiable, and homogeneous of
degree one. Capital depreciates at the rate δ , 1 ≥ δ > 0 .

The first-order conditions for profit maximization are

                                        p1 ≥ qf1 ( x1 , x2 ) , = if x1 > 0                                  (7)



                                                    4
                                            p2 ≥ qf 2 ( x1 , x2 ) , = if x2 > 0 ,                             (8)

where q is the price of the investment good.

A.4. Labor and capital are not mobile across countries, but are mobile across sectors within a
country.

2.1. Infinitely lived consumers

         In the environment with infinitely lived consumer-workers, each country i, i = 1,..., n , has a

continuum of measure Li of consumers, each of whom is endowed with k0i > 0 units of capital in
period 0 and one unit of labor at every period, which is supplied inelastically. Consumers have the
same utility functions, within countries and across countries. In each period, the representative
consumer in country i decides how much to consume of each of the two traded goods in the
economy, c1it , c2i t , how much capital to accumulate for the next period, kti+1 , and how much to lend,

bti+1 . Consumers derive their income from wages, wti , returns to capital, rti , and returns to lending,

rtbi . The representative consumer in country i solves the problem

                                                  max ∑ t =0 β t u (c1it , c2i t )
                                                               ∞




                             s.t.   p1t c1it + p2t c2i t + qti xti + bti+1 ≤ wti + rti kti + (1 + rtbi )bti   (9)

                                                     kti+1 − (1 − δ )kti ≤ xti

                                                 c ijt ≥ 0 , xti ≥ 0 , bti ≥ − B

                                                       k0i ≤ k0i , b0i ≤ 0 .

Here B is a positive number large enough so that the constraint bti ≥ − B rules out Ponzi schemes
but does not otherwise bind in equilibrium.

A.5. The period utility function u (c1 , c2 ) is homothetic, strictly increasing, strictly concave, and

continuously differentiable, with lim c j →0 u j (c1 , c2 ) = ∞ , and lim c j →∞ u j (c1 , c2 ) = 0 .


         The first-order conditions of this consumer’s problem (9) imply that




                                                           5
                                                     u2 (c1it , c2i t ) p2t
                                                                       =                               (10)
                                                     u1 (c1it , c2i t ) p1t

                         u1 (c1it , c2i t )
                                              ≥
                                                 p1t
                                                        ( qi (1 − δ ) + rti+1 ) , = if xti > 0
                       β u1 (c1t +1 , c2t +1 ) p1t +1qti t +1
                              i         i
                                                                                                       (11)


Furthermore, the returns to capital and to international bonds, if permitted, have to be the same:

                                                qti+1 (1 − δ ) + rti+1
                                 1 + rtbi+1 ≥                          , = if xti > 0 .                (12)
                                                          qti

       The feasibility conditions for each traded good j , j = 1, 2 , in period t , t = 0,1,... , is

                                        ∑          Li (c ijt + x ijt ) = ∑ i =1 Li y ijt .
                                            n                                    n
                                            i =1
                                                                                                       (13)

Here y ijt and xijt denote, respectively, the output and input into investment of traded good j in

country i , both expressed in per worker terms. Notice that, because each consumer-worker is
endowed with one unit of labor in every period, these quantities are also the same quantities per
unit of labor. It is easy to modify the model, as does Ventura (1997), so that the endowment of
labor per worker differs across countries, as long as these differences remain constant over time.
The feasibility conditions for factors and for the investment good are

                                                        k1it + k2i t ≤ kti                             (14)

                                                         Ai1t + Ai2t ≤ 1                               (15)

                                                   kti+1 − (1 − δ )kti ≤ xti .                         (16)

The market clearing condition for international bonds is

                                                       ∑
                                                             n
                                                             i =1
                                                                    Li bti = 0                         (17)

when international borrowing and lending are permitted. If not, this condition becomes bti = 0 .


2.2. Overlapping generations

       In the environment with overlapping generations, a new generation of consumer-workers is
born in each period in each country. Consumers in generation t , t = 0,1,... are born in period t and



                                                         6
live for m periods. Each of these generations in country i has a continuum of measure Li of
consumers. In period of life h, h = 1,..., m , each consumer is endowed with A h units of labor,
which are supplied inelastically. Consumers can save through accumulation of capital and bonds.
We assume that they are born without any initial endowment of capital or bonds. The
representative consumer born in country i in period t , t = 0,1,... , solves

                                                                 ∑            β huh (c1itt + h −1 , c2itt + h −1 )
                                                                      m
                                                        max           h =1

where uh is the utility function in period of life h and satisfies the analogue of assumption A.5:


A.5'. For every h , h = 1,..., m , the utility function uh (c1 , c2 ) is homothetic, strictly increasing,

strictly concave, and continuously differentiable, with lim c j →0 uhj (c1 , c2 ) = ∞ and

          In addition, there are m − 1 generations of initial old consumers alive in period 0. Each
generation s, s = −m + 1,..., −1 , in country i has a continuum of measure Li of consumers, each of

whom lives for m + s periods and is endowed with A h − s units of labor in period h , h = 1,..., m + s .

Each initial old consumer is also endowed with capital k0is and bonds b0is . The representative

The feasibility conditions for factor inputs and for the investment good are the same as in the
infinitely lived consumer environment, and are given by equations (14), (15), and (16).
        Given intergenerational heterogeneity, we need to impose additional feasibility conditions
in the overlapping generations environment:

3. Equilibrium

          We give unified definitions of equilibrium and of steady states for Heckscher-Ohlin models
with infinitely lived consumers and with overlapping generations.

Definition 1. There are n countries of different sizes, Li , i = 1,..., n , and different initial

endowments of capital and bonds: k0i and b0i , i = 1,..., n , in the environment with infinitely lived

consumers and k0is and b0is , s = −m + 1,..., −1 , i = 1,..., n , in the environment with overlapping
generations. An equilibrium is sequences of consumptions, investments, capital stocks, and bond
holdings, {c1it , c2i t , xti , kti , bti } in the environment with infinitely lived consumers and

{c1ist , c2ist , xtis , ktis , btis } , s = t − m + 1,..., t , in the environment with overlapping generations, output and

inputs for each traded industry, { y ijt , k ijt , l ijt } , j = 1, 2 , output and inputs for the investment sector

{xti , x1it , x2i t } , and prices { p1t , p2t , qti , wti , rti , rtbi } , i = 1,..., n , t = 0,1, 2... , such that

1. Given prices { p1t , p2t , qti , wti , rti , rtbi } , the consumption and accumulation plan {c1it , c2i t , xti , kti , bti }
     solves the consumers’ problem (9) in the environment with infinitely lived consumers, and the
     consumption and accumulation plan {c1ist , c2ist , xtis , ktis , btis } solves the consumers’ problems (18)
     and (19) in the environment with overlapping generations.

2. Given prices { p1t , p2t , qti , wti , rti , rtbi } , the production plans { y ijt , k ijt , l ijt } and {xti , x1it , x2i t } satisfy

     the cost minimization and zero profit conditions (2), (3), (7), and (8).

3. The consumption, capital stock, {c1it , c2i t , xti , kti , bti } or {c1ist , c2ist , xtis , ktis , btis } , and production plans,

     { y ijt , k ijt , l ijt } and {xti , x1it , x2i t } , satisfy the feasibility conditions (1), (6) and (13)–(17) in the



                                                                 9
    infinitely lived consumer environment and (20)–(28) in the overlapping generations
    environment.

Definition 2. A steady state is consumption levels, an investment level, a capital stock, and bond
holdings, (cˆ1i , cˆ2i , xˆ i , kˆ i , bˆi ) in the environment with infinitely lived consumers and

(cˆ1is , cˆ2is , xˆ is , kˆis , bˆis ) , s = 1,..., m , in the environment with overlapping generations, output and inputs

for each traded industry, ( yˆ ij , kˆ ij , lˆji ) , j = 1, 2 , output and inputs for the investment sector,

( xˆ i , xˆ1i , xˆ2i ) , and prices, ( pˆ1 , pˆ 2 , qˆ , wˆ i , rˆi , rˆbi ) , i = 1,..., n , that satisfy the conditions of a competitive

equilibrium for appropriate initial endowments of capital and bonds, k0i = kˆi , b0i = bˆi in the

environment with infinitely lived consumers and k0is = kˆis and b0is = bˆis in the environment with

overlapping generations. Here we set ν t = νˆ for all t , where ν represents a generic variable.


Definition 3. An equilibrium displays sustainable growth if there exists a constant 1 < γ < ∞ such

that lim inft →∞ kti+1 / kti = lim inft →∞ cti+1 / cti = γ , i = 1,..., n .

          We will often assume that the initial conditions are such that all countries produce a
positive amount of the investment good in every period, xti > 0 , and we normalize qti = qt = 1 for

all t . We make two remarks regarding this assumption: First, since the investment good is
produced using the two traded goods, and these prices are equalized across countries by trade,
even if a country does not produce the investment good in a given period, the price of the
investment good is the same as in countries that produce the investment good. Second, in the
examples presented in this paper, we assume complete depreciation, δ = 1 , and the assumption of
positive investment becomes an assumption of positive capital, xti = kti > 0 . Positive capital in all
countries in every period can be ensured by assuming Inada conditions on the production functions
φ j . Bajona and Kehoe (2006) construct an example where there are corner solutions in investment
and in capital in a model where production functions do not satisfy Inada conditions.
          The characterization and computation of equilibrium of the models described above is
difficult in general because it involves determining the pattern of specialization in production over
an infinite horizon. In particular, for any prices of the traded goods, p1t , p2t , there exists threshold



                                                              10
values κ1 ( p2t / p1t ) and κ 2 ( p2t / p1t ) such that a country produces positive amounts of both traded

goods if and only if its capital-labor ratio kti satisfies

                                           κ1 ( p2t / p1t ) > kti > κ 2 ( p2t / p1t ) .                                 (29)

The set of capital-labor ratios that satisfy weak versions of these inequalities is called the cone of
diversification. Figure 1, known as the Lerner diagram, depicts the cone of diversification
graphically. Any two countries with endowments in the cone of diversification use capital and
labor in the same proportions and face the same factor prices, rt and wt . If the assumption of no
factor intensity reversals, A.2, is violated, there can be more than one cone of diversification and
more than one pair of factor prices compatible with production of both goods in equilibrium.
         If all countries have endowments in the cone of diversification at some prices of the traded
goods, we say that factor price equalization occurs at those prices. This result is the factor price
equalization theorem of static Heckscher-Ohlin theory. Notice that, given the endowments of
capital and labor in each country in each period, the production of traded goods is identical to that
in a static, two-sector Heckscher-Ohlin model. Consequently, the Rybszynski theorem and the
Stolper-Samuelson theorem also hold in our model.
         To prove a version of the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem for this model — that, in any period, a
country exports the good that is intensive in the factor in which it is abundant — we would need to
make assumptions to ensure that trade is balanced for each country and that expenditures on the
two traded goods are proportional across countries. In the next section, we assume that there is no
international borrowing and lending, which ensures that trade is balanced for each country.
Assumption A.3 ensures that x1it / x2i t is equal across countries. In the infinitely lived consumer

environment, assumption A.5 ensures that c1it / c2i t is equal across countries, but our assumptions do

not impose any restrictions on (c1it + x1it ) /(c2i t + x2i t ) . If we assume that u (c1 , c2 ) = v( f (c1 , c2 )) ,

where v is strictly concave and increasing, then we know that c1it / c2i t = x1it / x2i t , which implies that

(c1it + x1it ) /(c2i t + x2i t ) is equal across countries and that the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem holds.
Similarly, in the overlapping generations environment, we would need to strengthen assumption
A.5' by assuming that uh (c1 , c2 ) = vh ( f (c1 , c2 )) for all h to be able prove the Heckscher-Ohlin
theorem. If we do not make this sort of assumption on the relation between consumption and



                                                         11
investment, there is no reason to expect the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem to hold. It is easy to
construct examples in which a capital abundant country exports the labor intensive good.
        If factor price equalization occurs in every period, the equilibrium prices and aggregate
variables of the model can be determined by solving for the equilibrium of the integrated economy,
a closed economy with factor endowments equal to the world endowments of the factors of
production. (See Dixit and Norman 1980 for a description of the methodology.) The equilibrium
of the n -country model is then computed by disaggregating the consumption, production, and
investment allocations of the integrated economy across countries in a way that is consistent with
initial conditions. The integrated economy approach greatly simplifies the characterization of
equilibrium in static models. As we will see, it is even more useful in the dynamic models
considered in this paper. The question arises of how general is a situation where factor prices are
equalized along the equilibrium path. The existing literature abstracts away from this question
either by assuming factor price equalization along the equilibrium path — as in Chen 1992,
Ventura 1997, and Cuñat and Maffezzoli 2004a — or by not allowing for factor prices to equalize
— as in Baxter 1992 and Cuñat and Maffezzoli 2004b. This paper derives general results
regarding factor price equalization in long-run equilibria and along equilibrium paths.

4. General model with international borrowing and lending

        In this section, we obtain two results for models with both infinitely lived consumers and
overlapping generations when international borrowing and lending are permitted: First, factor
price equalization occurs after the initial period. Second, the equilibrium patterns of production,
trade, capital accumulation, and international borrowing are not determinate. All proofs are in
appendix 2.

Proposition 1: In both a model with infinitely lived consumers that satisfies A.1–A.5 and a model
with overlapping generations that satisfy assumptions A.1–A.4 and A.5', assume that international
borrowing and lending are permitted. Also assume that xti > 0 for all i and all t . Then factor

price equalization occurs for all t = 1, 2,... .

Proposition 2: In both a model with infinitely lived consumers that satisfies A.1–A.5 and a model
with overlapping generations that satisfy assumptions A.1–A.4 and A.5', assume that international




                                                   12
borrowing and lending are permitted. Also assume that xti > 0 for all i and all t . Then countries’

production plans and international trade patterns are not determinate in any period t > 0 .

            The intuition for these propositions is the classic result in static Heckscher-Ohlin theory that
trade in goods is a substitute for factor mobility. (See, for example, Mundell 1957 and Markusen
1983.) The assumption that xti > 0 for all i and all t is a far stronger assumption than we need to
prove proposition 2 as we explain in the proof of the proposition in the appendix.
            In the rest of the paper, we study versions of the general model where international
borrowing and lending are not permitted.

            In addition, we will sometimes assume that consumers aggregate the two traded goods to
obtain utility in the same way that firms aggregate these goods to obtain the investment good.

Definition 4. A model with infinitely lived consumers that satisfies A.1–A.6 is one-sector
aggregatable if u (c1 , c2 ) = v( f (c1 , c2 )) for some v that is continuously differentiable, strictly
concave, and strictly increasing. Similarly, a model with overlapping generations that satisfies
A.1–A.4 and A.5'–A.6' is one-sector aggregatable if uh (c1 , c2 ) = vh ( f (c1 , c2 )) for some vh ,

h = 1,..., m , that satisfy these properties.

As we have seen, this assumption — which is very restrictive — guarantees that trade patterns
obey the Heckscher-Ohlin theorem. As we shall see, it is also useful in restricting the possible
dynamic behavior of equilibria.

5. Results for economies with infinitely lived consumers

             In this section, we study the behavior of equilibrium paths for the model with infinitely
lived consumers. We define a social planner’s problem for country i and prove that in equilibrium
the allocation in each country solves this planner’s problem. In fact, the planner’s problem is that



                                                                         13
of a small open economy that takes the sequence of prices of the two traded goods as exogenously
given. We use properties of the value function for this problem to derive results on the evolution of
relative factor abundances along equilibrium paths.

5.1. Country social planner’s problem

       In this section, we argue that equilibrium allocations in country i solve a country planner’s
problem in a one-sector growth model with a time varying production function. We begin by
aggregating consumption of the two traded goods. The homotheticity assumption A.5 implies that
u (c1 , c2 ) = v ( g (c1 , c2 ) ) , where g is strictly increasing, concave, and homogeneous of degree one,

and v is strictly increasing and strictly concave. Define c = g (c1 , c2 ) to be an aggregate

consumption good and p( p1 , p2 ) to be its unit cost function

                                          p( p1 , p2 ) = min p1c1 + p2 c2

                                                   s.t. g(c1 , c2 ) ≥ 1                                 (30)

                                                         cj ≥ 0.

       We next aggregate production of the two traded goods by defining the revenue function

                              π ( p1 , p2 , k i ) = max p1φ1 (k1i , A1i ) + p2φ2 (k2i , Ai2 )

                                                  s.t. k1i + k2i ≤ k i                                  (31)

                                                      Ai1 + Ai2 ≤ 1

                                                   k ij ≥ 0 , Aij ≥ 0 .

This revenue function indicates, for any given prices of the two traded goods, the maximum
income that a country can obtain by allocating capital and labor over the production of the traded
goods. (See, for example, Dixit and Norman 1980, who refer to this function as the revenue
function; many other authors refer to it as the GDP function.) Figure 2 shows how the revenue
function is constructed. As is seen in the figure, this function is strictly increasing, concave, but
not strictly concave, and continuously differentiable, but not twice continuously differentiable.
       Using the first-order conditions for the revenue maximization problem (31), we obtain a
characterization of the relation between factor endowments, factor prices, and production patterns.




                                                      14
We state the following result, which is standard in Heckscher-Ohlin theory, because it is useful in
the rest of the paper.

Lemma 1. The optimal capital-labor ratios in interior solutions to the revenue maximization
problem depend only on relative prices:

                                                     k ij
                                                            = κ j ( p2 / p1 ) , j = 1, 2                                (32)
                                                     A ij

If κ1 ( p2 / p1 ) ≥ k i ≥ κ 2 ( p2 / p1 ) , then factor prices only depend on goods prices,

                                 r ( p1 , p2 ) = p1φ1K (κ1 ( p2 / p1 ),1) = p2φ2 K (κ 2 ( p2 / p1 ),1)                  (33)

                                w( p1 , p2 ) = p1φ1L (κ1 ( p2 / p1 ),1) = p2φ2 L (κ 2 ( p2 / p1 ),1) .                  (34)

If k i > κ1 ( p2 / p1 ) , then country i produces only good 1, r i ( p1 , p2 , k i ) = p1φ1K (k i ,1) < r ( p1 , p2 ) , and

wi ( p1 , p2 , k i ) = p1φ1L (k i ,1) > w( p1 , p2 ) . If k i < κ 2 ( p2 / p1 ) , then country i produces only good 2,

r i ( p1 , p2 , k i ) = p2φ2 K (k i ,1) > r ( p1 , p2 ) , and wi ( p1 , p2 , k i ) = p2φ2 L (k i ,1) < w( p1 , p2 ) .


          Given a sequence of prices p t = ( ( p1t , p2t ), ( p1t +1 , p2t +1 ),...) and an initial endowment of

capital k0i , the country social planner takes the sequence of prices as given and solves

                                                 V (k0i ; p 0 ) = max ∑ t =0 β t v(cti )
                                                                               ∞




                                             s.t. p( p1t , p2t )cti + xti ≤ π ( p1t , p2t , kti )                       (35)

                                                            kti+1 − (1 − δ )kti ≤ xti

                                                               cti ≥ 0 , xti ≥ 0

                                                                  k0i given.

Notice that this problem is like that of a planner in a one-sector model, except that the analogue of
the production function, π ( p1t , p2t , kti ) , changes every period as prices change and consumption is

weighted by the price index p( p1t , p2t ) .




                                                                 15
Lemma 2: In a model with infinitely lived consumers that satisfies A.1–A.6, let the sequence

{ci
  1t   , c1it , kti , xti , p1t , p2t } be the equilibrium consumption, investment, and capital stock in country i

and the equilibrium prices for the traded goods. Then, for any equilibrium prices
p t = ( ( p1t , p2t ), ( p1t +1 , p2t +1 ),...) , the country value function V (k ; p t ) is continuous, strictly

increasing, and strictly concave in k for all k > 0 . Furthermore, for each i = 1,..., n , the sequence

{c , x , k } , where c
  i
  t
        i
        t   t
             i           i
                         t   = g (c1it , c2i t ) , solves the country planner’s problem (35) in which the prices are

the equilibrium prices and the initial capital stock is k0i .


            Lemma 2 says that the country value function V (k ; p 0 ) completely summarizes the
situation of a country i . We have not imposed conditions on φ1 , φ2 , f , and u to ensure that an
equilibrium of the world economy exists. It may be that the economy is so productive that the
representative consumer in some country can attain infinite utility, or it may be that the economy is
so unproductive that consumption in some country converges so quickly to zero that the consumer
can attain no more than utility minus infinity. What lemma 2 says is that, if an equilibrium exists,
−∞ < V (k ; p 0 ) < +∞ , not just for the initial endowments k0i , i = 1,..., n , but for all k > 0 , and that

V (k ; p t ) satisfies the features of a dynamic programming value function.

            The country social planner’s problem and associated value function V (k ; p t ) are even
closer to those of a planner in a one-sector growth model when the model is one-sector
aggregatable. In this case, p( p1t , p2t ) = 1 for any possible p1t and p2t .


5.2. Relative factor abundance

            In this section, we show that countries maintain their relative factor abundance along
equilibrium paths. Notice that the n countries’ social planner’s problems — one for each country
— have the same sequence of prices and differ only in the initial endowments of capital, k0i .
Therefore, comparing equilibrium allocations of capital across countries is equivalent to doing
comparative statics with respect to k0i on the planner’s problem (35).




                                                       16
Proposition 3. In a model with infinitely lived consumers that satisfies assumptions A.1- A.6, let

{k } , {k } , t = 0,1,... , be the equilibrium capital stocks for two countries i and i ' . Assume that
  i
  t
          i'
          t


k0i > k0i ' . Then kti ≥ kti ' for all t . Furthermore, if xti > 0 , then kti > kti ' implies kti+1 > kti+' 1 .

The proof of proposition 3 applies a monotonicity argument similar to those of Milgrom and
Shannon (1994) to the country social planner’s problem.

5.3. Steady states

         In this section, we analyze the properties of steady states of the model with infinitely lived
consumers.

Definition 5. A nontrivial steady state is a steady state in which aggregate capital is positive,

kˆ = ∑ i =1 Li kˆ i / ∑ i =1 Li > 0 , that is, kˆ i > 0 , for some i = 1,..., n .
       n                n




Bajona and Kehoe (2006) construct an example in which φ2 (k , A) = A and in which one country has
zero capital in the steady state but the other country has positive capital.

Proposition 4: In a model with infinitely lived consumers that satisfies A.1–A.6, there is factor
price equalization in any nontrivial steady state.

Proposition 5: In a model with infinitely lived consumers that satisfies A.1–A.6, if there exists a
nontrivial steady state, there exists a continuum of them. These steady states have the same prices
and the same aggregate capital-labor ratio, k̂ . The steady states are parameterized by the
distribution of capital per worker across countries, kˆ1 ,..., kˆ n . Furthermore, international trade

occurs in every steady state in which kˆi ≠ kˆ for some i = 1,..., n .

         Proposition 5 is a standard result in dynamic Heckscher-Ohlin models where countries only
differ in their initial factor endowments. Chen (1992), Baxter (1992) and Bond, Trask and Wang
(2003) derive similar results in environments only slightly different from ours.
         The next example illustrates the dependence of the steady state distribution of capital on the
initial distribution.




                                                           17
Example 1. Consider a discrete-time version of the model studied by Ventura (1997). There are
n countries. We assume that the production functions for the traded goods each use one factor of
production:

                                             φ1 (k1 , A1 ) = k1                                 (36)

                                           φ2 (k2 , A 2 ) = A 2 .                               (37)

This assumption ensures that factor price equalization always holds:

                                              rti = rt = p1t                                    (38)

                                             wti = wt = p2t                                     (39)

We further assume that the model is one-sector aggregatable with a Cobb-Douglas investment-
consumption function:

                                         f ( x1 , x2 ) = dx1a x12− a .                          (40)

Making the additional assumptions that δ = 1 and that v(c) = log c , we can write the country social
planner’s problem (35) as

                                         max ∑ t =0 β t log cti
                                                    ∞




                                      s.t. cti + kti+1 ≤ p1t kti + p2t                          (41)

                                            cti ≥ 0 , kti ≥ 0

                                                 k0i ≤ k0i .

       Since factor price equalization holds, as long as there are no corner solutions in investment,
we can use the integrated approach to solve for equilibrium. To find the equilibrium of the
integrated economy, we solve the social planner’s problem

                                         max ∑ t =0 β t log ct
                                                    ∞




                                          s.t. ct + kt +1 ≤ dkta                                (42)

                                             ct ≥ 0 , kt ≥ 0

                                                 k0 ≤ k0 .




                                               18
The textbook solution to this problem, first obtained by Brock and Mirman (1972), is

                                      (1− at +1 ) /(1− a )
         kt +1 = β adkta = ( β ad )                          k0a , ct = (1 − β a ) dkta = (1 − β a ) d ( β ad )
                                                                t +1                                              (1− at ) /(1− a )     t +1
                                                                                                                                      k0a . (43)

Using the first-order conditions, the feasibility conditions, and the solution (43), we obtain

                                                      c1t = (1 − β a ) kt , c2t = 1 − β a                                                      (44)

                                                               x1t = β akt , x2t = β a                                                         (45)

                                                    p1t = adkta −1 , p2t = (1 − a ) dkta .                                                     (46)

To disaggregate across countries, we start by comparing the first-order conditions for the country
social planner’s problem (35) with those for the integrated economy equilibrium. (It is here that
the assumption of no corner solutions in investment is important.)

                                                        cti+1                       c

                                                         ct                          ct

Using (47) and the budget constraint in (41), we can write the demand of the consumer in country i
in period t as

                                                 ⎡ ∞ ⎛ s              1 ⎞                 ⎤
                                  cti = (1 − β ) ⎢ ∑ s =t ⎜ ∏τ =t +1     ⎟ p2 s + p1τ kt ⎥ .
                                                                                        i
                                                                                                                                               (48)
                                                 ⎣        ⎝          p1τ ⎠                ⎦

Subtracting the analogous condition for the integrated economy, we obtain

                                                       cti − ct = (1 − β ) p1t (kti − kt ) .                                                   (49)

Combining this with the feasibility condition yields

                                                                                ct
                                                             kti+1 − kt +1 =         (kti − kt ) .                                             (50)
                                                                               ct −1

Setting zt = ct −1 / kt = (1 − β a) /( β a) , t = 1, 2,... , and z0 = c0 / ( β r0 k0 ) = (1 − β a ) /( β a ) , we obtain

                               kti+1 − kt +1 zt +1 ⎛ kti − kt ⎞ zt +1 ⎛ k0i − k0 ⎞ k0i − k0
                                            =      ⎜          ⎟=      ⎜          ⎟=         ,                                                  (51)

which implies that kti / kt is constant. Letting γ i = k0i / k0 , we can solve for c0i / c0 to produce



                                                                       19
                            c1it = (1 − a + γ i a − γ i β a ) kt , c2i t = 1 − a + γ i a − γ i β a         (52)

                                              x1it = γ i β akt , x2i t = γ i β a .                         (53)

          Comparing levels of income per capita, measured in current prices, across countries, we
obtain

                             yti p1t kti + p2t γ i adkt + (1 − a )dkt
                                =             =                       = 1− a + γ ia .                      (54)
                             yt p1t kt + p2t    adkt + (1 − a)dkt

We now see the strong consequences of proposition 3. In a world of closed countries, we expect
every country to converge to the same steady state capital-labor ratio and level of income per
capita,

                                       kˆ = ( β ad )          , yˆ = d ( β ad )
                                                    1/(1− a )                   a /(1− a )
                                                                                           ,               (55)

no matter what its initial endowment of capital. In a world of countries open to trade, however,
differences in initial endowments of capital lead to persistently different capital stocks and income
levels. In this example, in fact, differences stay proportionally fixed. As the world economy
converges to its steady state, each country converges to a steady state that depends on its initial
endowment of capital relative to the world average, γ i = k0i / k0 ,

                            kˆ i = γ i ( β ad )          , yˆ = (1 − a + γ i a ) d ( β ad )
                                               1/(1− a )                                    a /(1− a )
                                                                                                       .   (56)


5.4. Sustained growth paths

          Equilibria in both one- and two-sector growth models can exhibit sustained growth. (See,
for example, Rebelo 1991.) Since our model generalizes these closed economy models to a world
with trade, sustained growth is also possible here. The next proposition extends the results in the
previous section to the limiting behavior of equilibria that exhibit sustained growth.

Proposition 6: In a model with infinitely lived consumers that satisfies A.1–A.6, assume that there
exists an equilibrium in which limt →∞ kti+1 / kti = limt →∞ cti+1 / cti = γ i for 0 < γ i < ∞ for all i and

γ i > 1 for some i . Then γ i = γ for all i . In this equilibrium with sustained growth, factor prices
are equalized in the limit. Furthermore, if there exists a sustained growth path, there is a continuum



                                                         20
of them, all of which have the same prices and aggregate capital-labor ratio, kt , but differ in the

initial allocation of capital per worker, k0i , and the limiting distribution of capital across countries,

limt →∞ kti / kt . International trade occurs in the limit of any equilibrium with sustained growth in

which limt →∞ kti / kt ≠ 1 for some i = 1,..., n .

        It is worth noting a limitation of proposition 6. While sustained growth is defined in terms
of the infimum limit of kti+1 / kti and cti+1 / cti , the proposition, which characterizes the limiting
behavior of equilibria, requires that the limits of these variables exist. On the other hand, rather
than assuming that these limits are equal across countries, the proposition proves that they are
equal. It is also worth noting that the proposition does not rule out the possibility that
limt →∞ wti = ∞ . If limt →∞ wti = ∞ for some i , however, the proposition proves that it does so for all

i . Furthermore, it is easy to show that, even if limt →∞ wti = ∞ ,

                                                              wti
                                           limt →∞                        =0.                             (57)
                                                     p1t y1it + p2t y2i t

Consequently, even if the wage grows without bound, it does so slowly enough that, in the limit,
the economy behaves like an economy with no labor. (See Bajona and Kehoe 2006.)
        The next example shows that the limiting distribution of capital in an equilibrium with
sustained growth depends on the initial distribution, just as example 1 does in the case of an
equilibrium that converges to a steady state.

Example 2. Consider a world economy identical to that in example 1 except that the production
function for consumption and investment is of the general constant-elasticity-of-substitution form


                                g (c1 , c2 ) = f (c1 , c2 ) = d ( ac1b + (1 − a)c2b )
                                                                                       1/ b
                                                                                              .           (58)

Assume that b > 0 and β a1/ b d > 1 . To find the equilibrium of the integrated economy, we solve
the social planner’s problem

                                               max ∑ t =0 β t log ct
                                                          ∞




                                     s.t. ct + kt +1 ≤ d ( ac1b + (1 − a)c2b )
                                                                                1/ b
                                                                                                          (59)



                                                     21
                                               ct ≥ 0 , kt ≥ 0

                                                    k0 ≤ k0 .

The solution to path for this problem exhibits sustained growth. Bajona and Kehoe (2006) show
that along this path zt = ct −1 / kt decreases and that

                                                          ct 1 − β
                                          zˆ = limt →∞         =   .                                (60)
                                                         kt +1   β
The analogue of equation (51) holds:
                                           kti − kt zt ⎛ k0i − k0 ⎞
                                                   = ⎜            ⎟,                                (61)
                                               kt   z0 ⎝ k 0 ⎠

although zt / z0 is not equal to 1 as it is in example 1. The limiting distribution of capital is
determined by the equation

                                           kˆi − kˆ zˆ ⎛ k0i − k0 ⎞
                                                   = ⎜            ⎟.                                (62)
                                               kˆ   z0 ⎝ k 0 ⎠


5.5. Cycles and chaos

        Equilibria in two-sector growth models do not need to converge to a steady state or to a
sustained growth path. Instead, the equilibrium may exhibit cycles or complex dynamics. General
conditions for the existence of two-period cycles in two-sector growth models are presented by
Benhabib and Nishimura (1985) and conditions for chaos are presented by Deneckere and Pelikan
(1986), Boldrin and Montrucchio (1986), and Boldrin (1989), among others. In what follows, we
present a specific example that has complex dynamics based on the two-sector closed economy
model developed by Boldrin and Deneckere (1990).

Example 3. Consider a world with two countries, each of which has a measure one of consumers.
Consumers have the period utility function

                                             u (c1 , c2 ) = c1α c12−α ,                             (63)

where α = 0.03 . The production function of the investment good uses the traded goods in fixed
proportions:




                                                  22
                                                    f ( x1 , x2 ) = min [ x1 , x2 / γ ] ,            (64)

where γ = 0.09 . The production for the traded goods is such that each of the traded goods uses
only one factor of production as in (36) and (37). Furthermore, δ = 1 .
          Boldrin and Deneckere (1990) show that such an economy exhibits stable two-period cycles
for β ∈ [0.093, 0.095] and chaos for β ∈ [0.099, 0.112] . If k01 = k02 , then the equilibrium of the

two-country economy coincides exactly with the equilibrium of the closed economy. If k01 ≠ k02 , if
one country finds it optimal to increase its capital stock, so does the other country. Therefore,
capital-labor ratios in both countries cycle in the same direction, mimicking the oscillations of the
integrated equilibrium. Chen (1992) makes a similar argument for a slightly different model.
          Notice that in this example u is not strictly concave and f is not continuously
differentiable. Given that the property of having cycles or chaos is structurally stable, however, it
would be easy to perturb the utility and investment functions to construct examples that satisfy
assumptions A.3 and A.5 and that have equilibria with cycles or chaos.

          The methodology used in this example is general and allows the construction of a two-
country trade model starting from any closed economy model with a consumption sector and an
investment sector, such as the model developed by Uzawa (1964). Let g (k , A) be the production
function for the consumption good, f (k , A) be the production function for the investment good,
and ν (c) be the utility function in the two-sector closed economy model. We set φ1 (k , A) = k ,

φ2 (k , A) = A , and u (c1 , c2 ) = v ( g (c1 , c2 ) ) .
          In the cycle in example 3, factor prices are equalized in every period. In fact, this is the
only sort of equilibrium cycle that is possible, at least if investment is positive.

Proposition 7: In a model with infinitely lived consumers that satisfies A.1–A.6, assume that there
exists an equilibrium s-period cycle, 1 < s < ∞ with xti > 0 for all i and all t . Then factor price
equalization occurs in every period of the cycle.

To prove this proposition in the appendix, we argue that, if an equilibrium with a finite cycle exists,
countries have to change relative factor abundance at least once over the cycle. This implies that




                                                              23
they have to change relative factor abundance an infinite number of times along the equilibrium
path, which contradicts proposition 3.
       As we have seen in lemma 2 and example 1, if consumers aggregate the two traded goods to
obtain utility in the same way that firms aggregate these goods to obtain investment, then the
equilibrium allocation of the integrated economy solves a one-sector social planner’s problem.
Although the integrated economy approach to characterizing equilibria applies only when we can
ensure factor price equalization, the assumption of one-sector aggregatability coupled with
proposition 7 puts strong restrictions on equilibrium dynamics.

Proposition 8: Assume that a model with infinitely lived consumers satisfies A.1–A.6 and is one-
sector aggregatable. Also assume that xti > 0 for all i and all t . Then there cannot exist an
equilibrium with cycles.

6. Results for economies with overlapping generations

       In this section, we derive some general results for equilibrium paths of the overlapping
generations model. In a closed economy setting, overlapping generations models exhibit a richer
variety of possible behavior than do infinitely lived consumer models. In particular, multiple
steady states and cyclical behavior can appear in one-sector, closed economy models with
homothetic period utility functions and C.E.S. production functions. This richness in behavior of
the closed economy models carries over to Heckscher-Ohlin models with overlapping generations,
and make such models significantly different from infinitely lived consumer models.
       It is also worth noting that, in closed economy models with infinitely lived consumers,
equilibria are generically determinate, while in closed economy models with overlapping
generations, there are robust examples with indeterminate equilibria. (See Kehoe and Levine 1985
and the related literature.) Although these sorts of results can be expected to carry over to dynamic
Heckscher-Ohlin models, we do not pursue these matters in this paper.

6.1. Steady state analysis

       In contrast with infinitely lived consumer models, an overlapping generations model can
have a steady state in which factor prices do not equalize. If prices do equalize in a steady state,
however, then all countries behave in exactly the same way, and there is no trade.




                                              24
Proposition 9: In a model with overlapping generations that satisfies assumptions A.1–A.4 and
A.5'–A.6', assume that there is a nontrivial steady state in which factor prices equalize. Then
kˆi = kˆ is in the interior of the cone of diversification and there is no international trade in this
steady state.

Proposition 10: In a model with overlapping generations that satisfies assumptions A.1–A.4 and
A.5'–A.6', any equilibrium that converges to a steady state in which there is factor price
equalization reaches factor price equalization and no trade within a finite number of periods. In
particular, the equilibrium becomes autarkic once all generations alive have been born under factor
price equalization.

       As in the infinitely lived consumer environment, these results can be extended to economies
with equilibria that converge to sustained growth paths. Sustained growth, however, can occur
only for economies that are not one-sector aggregatable and under strong conditions. See Jones
and Manuelli 1992 and Fisher 1992 for details.

Proposition 11: Suppose that a model with overlapping generations satisfies assumptions A.1–A.4
and A.5'–A.6' and is one-sector aggregatable. Then an equilibrium cannot display sustained
growth.

This proposition follows directly from theorem 1 in Fisher (1992). The intuition is that, because
the production functions are concave, the ratio of wage income relative to the capital stock
converges to zero as capital goes to infinity. Therefore, wage income is not able to purchase an ever
growing capital stock.
       Jones and Manuelli (1992) present an example of a two-sector overlapping generations
economy with sustained growth and Fisher (1992) derives necessary conditions for equilibria with
sustained growth to occur. These conditions are strong and involve both production technologies
and utility functions. It is easy to turn the Jones-Manuelli (1992) example into a two-country
Heckscher-Ohlin example as in example 3.

6.2. General structure of examples

       As we have mentioned, overlapping generations economies can have steady states where
factor prices do not equalize across countries. In what follows, we describe a general methodology


                                                25
for the construction of model economies with such properties starting from one-sector closed
economy models. We then use our methodology to derive four different examples that have steady
states without factor price equalization.
        The general structure of our examples is that of a model with two countries, i = 1, 2 with
C.E.S. production functions for the traded goods:

for ρ < 1 , ρ ≠ 0 , and

                                                                               α j 1−α j

for ρ = 0 . We assume that α 2 = α , α1 = α + ε , θ 2 = θ , and θ1 = θ + λε for 1 > α > 0 , ε > 0 ,

θ > 0 , and λ . This relationship between the parameters allows us to express the capital-labor
ratios that determine the cone of diversification as functions of α , ε , θ , and λ . Notice that ε > 0
guarantees that good 1 is the capital intensive good.
        The production function for the investment good is Cobb-Douglas:

                                                          f ( x1 , x2 ) = dx1a x12− a                                                     (67)

where 1 > a > 0 . Capital depreciates completely, δ = 1 .
        There is a measure one of consumers of each generation in each country. The
representative consumer in each generation t in country i lives for two periods, has labor
endowments ( A1 , A 2 ) , and has the utility function

                                  β1 log ( c1tt ) ( c2t t )           + β 2 log ( c1tt +1 ) ( c2t t +1 )
                                                     a         1− a                         a              1− a
                                                                                                                  .                       (68)

Notice that, since the parameter a in the utility function is the same as that in the production
function for the investment good, the model is one-sector aggregatable.
        To find the cone of diversification when ρ ≠ 0 , we calculate the optimal capital-labor ratios
in interior solutions to the revenue maximization problem (31). When ρ ≠ 0 , the solution is

Together with the endowments of capital and labor, the parameters ε , λ , d , and a determine the
pattern of specialization and trade. As α1 = α + ε and α 2 = α become more similar as ε

approaches zero, the cone of diversification narrows, collapsing into a straight line when ε = 0 . We
set p2 / p1 = 1 , α 2 = α , α1 = α + ε , θ 2 = θ , and θ1 = θ + λε and use l’Hôpital’s rule to take limits

as ε tends to 0 to obtain

         We derive each of our examples starting with a one-sector, closed-economy, overlapping
generations model that has multiple steady states. Let φ2 (k , A) be the production function of this

model. Let θ = θ 2 and α = α 2 be the parameters of this production function. We then construct
another one-sector, closed economy model that preserves the steady state behavior of the original
model by slightly perturbing this production function. Let φ1 ( k , A) with parameters α1 = α + ε and

θ1 = θ + ελ be the production function of this perturbed model. The key is to find values of ε and
λ so that there exists a steady state of the original model with capital-labor ratio and factor prices
(kˆ 2 , rˆ 2 , wˆ 2 ) and a steady state of the perturbed version of the model with capital-labor ratio and

factor prices (kˆ1 , rˆ1 , wˆ 1 ) that satisfy

                                            kˆ1 > kˆ 2 , rˆ1 < rˆ 2 , and wˆ 1 > wˆ 2                                  (80)
and
                                      either kˆ1 > κ1 (1) or kˆ 2 < κ 2 (1) , or both.                                 (81)
Condition (81) implies that, in a two-sector, two-country economy with production functions
φ1 (k , A) and φ2 (k , A) , at least one country specializes in production if prices are p1 = p2 = 1 and


                                                                28
countries’ capital-labor ratios are kˆi , i = 1, 2 . Condition (80) implies that rˆi and wˆ i are consistent
with lemma 1. We can choose λ and ε so that condition (81) holds. Specifically, we choose λ
so that the cone of diversification passes between the steady state k̂ 2 of the original one-sector
model and the steady state k̂ 1 of the perturbed one-sector model when ε = 0 and then increase ε .
Whether or not condition (80) holds in the constructed two-sector model depends on the properties
of the original one-sector model, as we will see in examples in the next section.
        By choosing d and a so that p1 = p2 = 1 , we ensure that trade is balanced. In any steady
state of a one-sector model, we can add up budget constraints to obtain

                           cˆi + xˆ i = ∑ h =1 (cˆih + xˆ ih ) = ∑ h =1 wˆ i A h + rˆi kˆi = wˆ i + rˆi kˆ i .
                                          2                        2
                                                                                                                 (82)

We construct the two sectors so that

                                                  wˆ i + rˆi kˆi = pˆ1 yˆ1i + pˆ 2 yˆ 2i .                       (83)

Since p1 = p2 = 1 , we know that cˆi = d (cˆ1i ) a (cˆ2i )1− a = cˆ1i + cˆ2i and analogously for xˆ i . Consequently,

                                          cˆ1i + cˆ2i + xˆ1i + xˆ2i = cˆi + xˆ i = yˆ1i + yˆ 2i .                (84)

                                           ( yˆ1i − cˆ1i − xˆ1i ) + ( yˆ 2i − cˆ2i − xˆ2i ) = 0 .                (85)


6.3. Steady state examples

        Using the methodology developed in the previous section, we construct four examples of
two-country economies that have steady states where factor prices are not equal across countries.
In the first two examples, there is positive fiat money in one of the countries but not the other. In
the other two examples, there is no fiat money.

Example 4. Consider a one-sector, closed economy model where the representative consumer in
generation t has the utility function

                                                        log ctt + 2 log ctt+1                                    (86)

and the labor endowment is ( A1 , A 2 ) = (0.8, 0.2) . The production function is

                                                  y = φ2 (k , A) = 4k 0.25A 0.75 .                               (87)



                                                             29
This economy has two steady states: a steady state with no fiat money where bˆ = 0 , kˆ = 1.4675 ,
rˆ = 0.75 , and wˆ = 3.3019 and a steady state with positive fiat money where bˆ = 0.4 , kˆ = 1 , rˆ = 1 ,
and wˆ = 3 . Notice that the steady state without fiat money has a higher capital-labor ratio, a lower
rental rate, and a higher wage than does the steady state with fiat money, allowing us to construct
an example that satisfies lemma 1.
        We perturb the production function φ2 to

                                              y = φ1 (k , A) = 3.96k 0.3A 0.7 .                                       (88)

That is, we set ε = 0.05 and λ = −0.8 . The perturbed economy also has two steady states. The
steady state without fiat money has bˆ = 0 , kˆ = 1.4219 , rˆ = 0.9286 , and wˆ = 3.0807 .
        Consider now a two-country, two-sector economy where good 1 has production function φ1

and good 2 has the production function φ2 . The cone of diversification for the two-country

economy for pˆ1 = pˆ 2 = 1 is determined by κˆ2 (1) = 1.0757 and κˆ1 (1) = 1.3830 . Set the steady state

capital-labor ratio in country 1 to kˆ1 = 1.4219 and in country 2 to kˆ 2 = 1 . We now have a steady
state of the two-country, two-good economy where country 1 specializes in the production of good
1, producing yˆ11 = 4.4010 and yˆ 12 = 0 , and country 2 specializes in the production of good 2,

producing yˆ12 = 0 and yˆ 12 = 4 . Figure 3 depicts the cone of diversification for this world economy.

To ensure that p1 = p2 = 1 , set d = 1.9977 and a = 0.5239 . Factor prices do not equalize in this

steady state: rˆ1 = 0.9286 and wˆ 1 = 3.0807 , but rˆ 2 = 1 and wˆ 2 = 3 .
        The calculation of the other variables is straightforward. Since cˆ1 = 1.0427 and cˆ2 = 1.9364
in the steady state of the perturbed one-sector economy, for example, and
( yˆ11 + yˆ12 ) /( yˆ11 + yˆ12 + yˆ 12 + yˆ 22 ) = 4.4010/8.4010 = 0.5239 , we set cˆ11
                                                                                     1
                                                                                        = (0.5239)1.0427 = 0.5462 ,

cˆ121 = (1 − 0.5239)1.0427 = 0.4965 , cˆ12
                                        1
                                           = 1.0144 , and cˆ122 = 0.9220 . Similarly, since

xˆ1 = kˆ1 = 1.4219 , we set xˆ11 = 0.7449 and xˆ12 = 0.6770 . Notice that trade is balanced: Country 1

exports yˆ11 − cˆ11
                 1
                    − cˆ12
                        1
                           − xˆ11 = 4.4010 − 0.5462 − 1.0144 − 0.7449 = 2.0955 of good 1 and imports

cˆ121 + cˆ122 + xˆ12 − yˆ11 = 0.4965 + 0.9220 + 0.6770 − 0 = 2.0955 of good 2.




                                                       30
Example 5. Consider a modification of example 4 where θ1 = 3.92 . That is, we set λ = −1.6 .

The cone of diversification is now determined by κˆ2 (1) = 1.3179 and κˆ1 (1) = 1.6944 , and

kˆ1 = 1.4507 is in its interior, as depicted in figure 4. In this steady state, country 1 diversifies in
production, producing yˆ11 = 1.6201 and yˆ 12 = 2.7736 , and country 2 specializes in the production of

good 2, producing yˆ12 = 0 and yˆ 12 = 4 . To ensure that pˆ1 = pˆ 2 = 1 , we set d = 1.6332 and

a = 0.1930 . Factor prices do not equalize: rˆ1 = 0.8130 and wˆ 1 = 3.2143 , but, once again, rˆ 2 = 1
and wˆ 2 = 3 .

Example 6. Consider now a model with the same utility function and labor endowments as in
examples 4 and 5, but where the production function is

                                    y = φ2 (k , A) = 4 ( 0.25k −3 + 0.75A −3 )
                                                                                  −1/ 3
                                                                                                      (89)

The one-sector closed economy model has three steady states. In one steady state, bˆ = 0.4 and
kˆ = 1 . In the other two, bˆ = 0 and either kˆ = 0.5675 or kˆ = 1.3355 . When kˆ = 0.5675 , rˆ = 0.75

and wˆ = 3.3019 , and, when kˆ = 1.3355 , rˆ = 0.75 and wˆ = 3.3019 , allowing us to construct an
example that satisfies lemma 1.
        The production function for the perturbed economy is

                                     y = φ1 (k , A) = 4 ( 0.3k −3 + 0.7A −3 )
                                                                                −1/ 3
                                                                                        .             (90)

That is, we set ε = 0.05 and λ = 0 . The perturbed economy has also three steady states, one
steady state with positive fiat money and two steady states with no fiat money.
        The cone of diversification is now determined by κˆ2 (1) = 0.9687 and κˆ1 (1) = 1.0315 . Set

the capital-labor ratio in country 1 to kˆ1 = 1.3908 , which is the perturbation of the steady state of
the one-sector model where kˆ = 1.3355 , and set the capital-labor ratio in country 2 to kˆ 2 = 0.5675 .
Country 1 specializes in good 1, producing yˆ11 = 4.2884 and yˆ 12 = 0 , and country 2 specializes in

the production of good 2, producing yˆ12 = 0 and yˆ 12 = 3.1147 . To ensure that pˆ1 = pˆ 2 = 1 , we set

d = 1.9749 and a = 0.5793 . Factor prices do not equalize: rˆ1 = 0.4237 and wˆ 1 = 3.6991 , but
rˆ 2 = 3.5452 and wˆ 2 = 1.1029 .



                                                    31
        The essential step in the construction of this example is to start with a one-sector closed
economy model that has multiple steady states without fiat money. It is impossible to do this with
a model with logarithmic utility and Cobb-Douglas production. Consider such a model with
production function φ2 (k , A) = θ k α A1−α , utility function β1 log ctt + β 2 log ctt+1 , and labor endowments

( A1 , A 2 ) . The unique steady state without fiat money is the solution to

                                                                     β1⎛                 (1 − α )θ k a A 2 ⎞
          k = w(k ) A − c1 ( w(k ), r (k )) = (1 − α )θ k A −
                      1                                    a   1
                                                                       ⎜ (1 − α )θ k A +
                                                                                    a 1
                                                                                                           ⎟.   (91)
                                                              β1 + β 2 ⎝                    αθ k a −1 ⎠

It is
                                                                                  1
                                              ⎛        β 2 (1 − α )αθ A1         ⎞1−α
                                        kˆ = ⎜⎜                                  ⎟⎟ .                           (92)
                                              ⎝ β1 (1 − α ) A + ( β1 + β 2 ) α
                                                              2
                                                                                  ⎠

Example 7. This example uses a different perturbation of the one-sector closed economy model
of example 6. In particular, this example exploits the fact that at one of the steady states without
fiat money — the one where kˆ = 0.5675 — the steady state capital stock and the wage increase and
the rental rate decreases as we increase α to α + ε , thus allowing us to satisfy lemma 1. It is
worth noting that we cannot do this at the other steady state without fiat money, where kˆ = 1.3355 .
Nor can we do this in a model with logarithmic utility and Cobb-Douglas production where

                                          β (1 − α )A 2 + ( β1 + β 2 ) α β1A 2 ( β1 + β 2 ) α
                          rˆ = αθ kˆα −1 = 1                            =       +               .               (93)
                                                 β 2 (1 − α )A1           β 2 A1 β 2 (1 − α )A1

Increasing α to α + ε , the rental rate increases, rˆ1 > rˆ 2 , which implies that lemma 1 is violated.
        Consider now the perturbation of the production function in example 6 where

                                       y = φ1 (k , A) = 4.12(0.3k −3 + 0.7A −3 ) −1/ 3 .                        (94)

That is, we set ε = 0.05 and λ = 2.4 . The steady state where kˆ 2 = 0.5675 becomes a steady state
where kˆ1 = 0.6305 . The wage increases from wˆ 2 = 1.1029 to wˆ 1 = 1.2283 , and the rental rate
decreases from rˆ 2 = 3.5452 to rˆ1 = 3.3283 . The cone of diversification is determined by
κˆ2 (1) = 0.5890 and κˆ1 (1) = 0.6271 . Country 1 specializes in the production of good 1, producing




                                                        32
yˆ11 = 3.3305 and yˆ 12 = 0 , and country 2 specializes in the production of good 2, producing yˆ12 = 0

and yˆ 12 = 3.1147 . To ensure that pˆ1 = pˆ 2 = 1 , we set d = 1.9990 and a = 0.5166 .

6.4. Cycles and chaos

          In this section, we present two examples of two-country economies that have equilibrium
two-period cycles.

Example 8. We start by constructing a one-sector, pure exchange economy with an equilibrium
two-period cycle. In this economy the representative consumer in generation t solves the problem

                                                                 (ctt+1 ) −4
                                                      max 100c −    t
                                                                    t
                                                                     4
                                                         s.t. ctt + btt+1 = 0.8                           (95)

                                                     ctt+1 = 0.2 + (1 + rtb+1 )bt +1

                                                         ctt ≥ 0 , ctt+1 ≥ 0 .

We can think of this economy as a production economy with the production function y = A and the

labor endowments ( A1 , A 2 ) = (0.8, 0.2) . This economy has an equilibrium cycle of periodicity 2,

with (cˆtt , cˆtt −1 , rˆt , bˆt ) cycling between

                                    (cˆ11 , cˆ12 , rˆ1b , bˆ1 ) = (0.7670, 0.2330, −0.9314, 0.4803)       (96)

and

                                (cˆ22 , cˆ12 , rˆ2b , bˆ2 ) = (0.3197, 0.6803,13.5766,3.295 × 10−2 ) .    (97)

Notice that (1 + rˆ1b )(1 + rˆ2b ) = 1 . Figure 5 depicts this cycle in an offer-curve diagram. The figure

graphs the set of excess demands ( y t , z t ) = (ctt − 0.8, ctt+1 − 0.2) that are utility maximizing for some

rtb+1 and the set of y t and z t that satisfy the feasibility condition z t −1 + y t = 0 . (See, for example,
Kehoe 1989.)
          The next step is to perturb this economy to allow production in which capital plays a role:

                                              y = φ2 (k , A) = ( 0.1k 3/ 5 + 0.9A3/ 5 )
                                                                                          5/3
                                                                                                .         (98)



                                                             33
This one-sector economy with production has a cycle of periodicity 2, with (kˆt , rˆt , wˆ t , mˆ t ) cycling
between

                                  (kˆ1 , rˆ1 , wˆ 1 , bˆ1 ) = (0.2214, 0.1754, 0.8639, 0.3958)            (99)

and

                           (kˆ2 , rˆ2 , wˆ 2 , bˆ2 ) = (3.422 × 10−5 ,5.6996, 0.8391, 6.945 × 10−2 ) .   (100)

Notice that rˆ1rˆ2 = 1 .
         We add another sector by perturbing production function in much the same way that we did
in the steady state examples in the previous section:

                                      y = φ1 (k , A) = 1.09 ( 0.15k 3/ 5 + 0.85A3/ 5 )
                                                                                         5/ 3
                                                                                                .        (101)

That is, we set ε = 0.05 and λ = 1.8 . The two-sector economy has a two-period cycle where
p1 = p2 = 1 over the cycle and countries alternate their positions between

                               (kˆ1 , rˆ1 , wˆ1 , bˆ1 ) = (9.726 × 10−2 , 0.3834, 0.8554, 0.3137)        (102)

and

                             (kˆ2 , rˆ2 , wˆ 2 , bˆ2 ) = (2.418 × 10−4 , 2.6083, 0.8394, 0.1203) .       (103)

The cone of diversification for this economy is determined by κˆ2 (1) = 8.452 × 10−3 and

κˆ1 (1) = 2.687 ×10−2 . When a country has capital kˆ1 = 9.726 × 10−2 , it specializes in the production

of good 1, producing yˆ11 = 0.8926 and yˆ 21 = 0 , and, when it has capital kˆ2 = 2.418 × 10−4 , it

specializes in the production of good 2, producing yˆ12 = 0 and yˆ 22 = 0.8400 . In the equilibrium
cycle, countries change their specialization pattern every period. Because the countries are
symmetric and alternate between the same two positions, the relative production of the two goods
stays constant.

Example 9. This example slightly modifies the production function of good 1 in example 8 so that
one of the countries diversifies in production. In particular, we set θ1 = 1.07 by setting λ = 1.4 .

The cone of diversification is now determined by κˆ2 (1) = 5.637 × 10−2 and κˆ1 (1) = 0.1792 . This
economy has a cycle where countries alternate their positions between

                                 (kˆ1 , rˆ1 , wˆ1 , bˆ1 ) = (0.1391, 0.2984, 0.8500, 0.3388)                       (105)

and

                             (kˆ2 , rˆ2 , wˆ 2 , bˆ2 ) = (1.291× 10−4 ,3.3515, 0.8392, 0.1011) .                   (106)

When a country has capital kˆ1 = 0.1391 , it now diversifies, producing yˆ11 = 0.6084 and

yˆ 21 = 0.2830 , and, when it has capital kˆ2 = 1.291× 10−4 , it specializes in the production of good 2,

producing yˆ12 = 0 and yˆ 22 = 0.8397 . Countries enter and exit the cone of diversification an

infinite number of times. To ensure that p1 = p2 = 1 , we set d = 1.9124 and a = 0.3515 .

         Notice proposition 7 implies that we cannot construct infinitely lived consumer examples
like examples 8 and 9 where factor prices are not equalized. Proposition 8 also implies that we
cannot construct infinitely lived consumer examples with any sort of cycle in models that are one-
sector aggregatable.
         As a final note, we observe that, as in the infinitely lived consumer environment, any two-
sector, closed economy model with overlapping generations can be made into a trade model.
Suppose that g (k , A) is the production function for the consumption good in the two-sector closed
economy model, that f (k , A) is the production function for the investment good, and that ν h (c ) is

the utility function in period of life h . Set φ1 (k , A) = k , φ2 (k , A) = A , and uh (c1 , c2 ) = vh ( g (c1 , c2 )) .
Since the cone of diversification is the entire nonnegative quadrant, factor prices equalize in any
equilibrium. The equilibrium is autarkic after m + 1 periods, where m is the length of a
consumer’s life. Consequently, all of the possibilities for equilibrium dynamics that are present in
two-sector growth models with overlapping generations are also present in our model. In
particular, two-sector, closed economy models with cyclical and chaotic behavior, like those
constructed by Reichlin (1992), can be made into examples of Heckscher-Ohlin economies.

Appendix 2: Proofs

Proof of proposition 1: The first-order conditions for the consumers’ problems, (9) or (18) and
(19), imply the no-arbitrage condition rti = rtb + δ for all t > 0 . Consequently, rental rates of capital
are equalized for all t > 0 . Since both goods are produced and each country produces at least one
good, pick two countries, say 1 and 2, such that country 1 produces good 1 and country 2 produces
good 2. Let p j (rt , wt ) be the unit cost function in sector j . Since country 2 produces good 2,
p2t = p2 (rt , wt2 ) ≤ p2 (rt , wt1 ) . Since φ2 is capital intensive, φ2 is strictly increasing in labor, which
implies that p2 is strictly increasing in the wage. This implies that wt1 ≥ wt2 .
       There are two cases to examine. First, suppose that φ1 is also strictly increasing in labor.
Then p1t = p1 (rt , wt1 ) ≤ p1 (rt , wt2 ) where p1 is strictly increasing in the wage. This implies that
wt1 ≤ wt2 . Consequently, wt1 = wt2 . Second, suppose instead that φ1 is not strictly increasing in
labor. Then it cannot employ labor at a positive wage. Since wt1 ≥ wt2 , if wt1 ≠ wt2 , then wt1 > wt2 .
Consequently, country 1 must also produce good 2, which implies that p2t = p2 (rt , wt2 ) = p2 (rt , wt1 ) .
Since φ2 is strictly increasing in labor, this implies that wt1 = wt2 . ■

Proof of proposition 2: We prove the proposition for the model with infinitely lived consumers.
The proposition for the model with overlapping generations follows the same argument with
changes in notation. Assume that an equilibrium { p1t , p2t , qti , wti , rti } , {c1it , c2i t , xti , kti , bti } ,
{ y ijt , k ijt , Aijt } , {xti , x1it , x2i t } exists in which xti > 0 for all i and all t. We provide a method for
constructing an infinite number of equilibria that have the same values of all variables in all periods
except for s and s + 1 . In periods s and s + 1 , we keep the values of prices p1t , p2t , qti = 1 , wti , rti ,
consumption c1it , c2i t in individual countries, and of aggregate production and investment fixed.
We change k si +1 to ksi+1 so as to change the production plans y ijs +1 , k ijs +1 , Aijs +1 to y ijs +1 , k ijs +1 , A ijs +1 ,
 j = 1, 2 . To accumulate the capital stock k i , we set x i = k i − (1 − δ )k i , x i = ( x i / xi ) xi , j = 1, 2 .
                                                                s +1             s         s +1            s      js   s   s   js

To satisfy the budget constraint, we set bsi+1 = xsi +1 + bsi +1 − xsi +1 . We then set xsi +1 = k si + 2 − (1 − δ )ksi+1 ,
x ijs +1 = ( xsi +1 / xsi +1 ) x ijs +1 , j = 1, 2 . It is easy to check that the budget constraint in country i period
s + 1 is satisfied because the constraint in s is satisfied.
         To find nonnegative production plans y ijs +1 , k ijs +1 , A ijs +1 consistent with profit maximization
at the equilibrium prices p , p , w , r , the capital-labor ratio k i needs to be in the cone
                                   1s +1      2 s +1     s +1     s +1                                     s +1

of diversification,
                                           κ1 ( p2 s +1 / p1s +1 ) ≥ ksi+1 ≥ κ 2 ( p2 s +1 / p1s +1 ) .                            (134)
We also want to keep investment nonnegative in periods s and s + 1 ,
                                                                ksi+1 ≥ (1 − δ )ksi                                                (135)

                                                           ksi+1 ≥ k si + 2 /(1 − δ ) .                                            (136)



                                                                   38
Together, these inequalities become
                min ⎡⎣κ1 ( p2 s +1 / p1s +1 ), k si +1 /(1 − δ ) ⎤⎦ ≥ ksi+1 ≥ max ⎡⎣κ 2 ( p2 s +1 / p1s +1 ), (1 − δ )ksi ⎤⎦ .                 (137)

Assumption A.2 ensures that the cone of diversification has an interior,
                                               κ1 ( p2 s +1 / p1s +1 ) > κ 2 ( p2 s +1 / p1s +1 ) .                                             (138)

Since we have assumed that xti > 0 for t = s, s + 1 ,

                                                       k si + 2 /(1 − δ ) > k si +1 > (1 − δ )ksi .                                             (139)

Proposition 1 ensures that k si +1 is in the cone of diversification, although it may be on the
boundary. Therefore, k si +1 satisfies inequality (137) and

                    min ⎡⎣κ1 ( p2 s +1 / p1s +1 ), k si +1 /(1 − δ ) ⎤⎦ > max ⎡⎣κ 2 ( p2 s +1 / p1s +1 ), (1 − δ )ksi ⎤⎦ .                      (140)

Consequently, we can set ksi+1 = k si +1 + ε i for some nonzero ε i small enough and still satisfy
inequality (137).
       If k si + 2 /(1 − δ ) > κ1 ( p2 s +1 / p1s +1 ) = ksi +1 , then we have to set ε i < 0 , and, if
(1 − δ )k si < κ 2 ( p2 s +1 / p1s +1 ) = ksi +1 , then we have to set ε i > 0 . Otherwise, we have freedom to set
n − 1 values of ε i independently. We want to keep the aggregate capital stock the same,

                                             ∑ L k                      ∑          Li (k si +1 + ε i )

                                                                s +1
                                                   i =1
                                                                       =     i =1
                                                                                                          = k s +1 ,                            (141)
                                              ∑ L                                ∑
                                                       n        i                       n
                                                       i =1                             i =1
                                                                                             Li

which implies that
                                                               ε n = −∑ i =1 ( Li / Ln )ε i .
                                                                             n −1
                                                                                                                                                (142)

There are two possible cases. First, k sn+1 is in the interior of the cone of diversification, in which
                                                                                                                                     ∑
                                                                                            n −1
case, by choosing ε i , i = 1,..., n − 1 , small enough, we can ensure that k n = k n −         ( Li / Ln )ε i        s +1   s +1       i =1

stays in the cone. Second, k          n
                                      s +1   is on the boundary of the cone, in which case, if we can choose
some of the deviations ε , i = 1,..., n − 1 , to be positive and others negative, we can set them so that
                                 i


ε n has any desired sign. If all of the deviations ε i , i = 1,..., n − 1 , have to be of the same sign, then
we know that all of the capital-labor ratios k si +1 , i = 1,..., n − 1 , are on the same boundary of the
cone. Since k s +1 = ∑ i =1 Li k si +1 / ∑ i =1 Li is in the interior of the cone, however, this implies that k sn+1 ,
                            n                  n



if it is on a boundary of the cone, is on the other boundary, which implies that ε n has the desired
sign.
          By reshuffling savings between capital and bonds, we have shown that there is an n − 1
dimensional indeterminacy in any period s + 1 for which xti > 0 for all i in periods s and s + 1 . If
xti = 0 in either of these periods for some country i , then it could be that




                                                                        39
                           min ⎡⎣κ1 ( p2 s +1 / p1s +1 ), k si +1 /(1 − δ ) ⎤⎦ = max ⎡⎣κ 2 ( p2 s +1 / p1s +1 ), (1 − δ )ksi ⎤⎦ ,               (143)

which would imply that we have to set ε i = 0 and would reduce the dimension of indeterminacy by
1 in period s + 1 . Notice that, if δ =1, then equation (143) can never hold, and we always have an
n − 1 dimensional indeterminacy in every period t > 0 . ■

Proof of lemma 1: The result follows directly from the first-order conditions for the revenue
maximization problem (31) and the strict concavity of φ j . See, for example, Dixit and Norman
(1980). ■

Proof of lemma 2: Suppose that the country social planner’s problem (35) is well posed in the
sense that there is a feasible {cti , xti , kti } such that lim infT →∞ ∑ t =0 β t v(cti ) > −∞ and there is no
                                                                          ∞



feasible {cti , xti , kti } such that lim supT →∞ ∑ t =0 β t v(cti ) = +∞ . We can show that the equilibrium
                                                                      ∞



{cti , xti , kti } solves the country planner’s problem (35) in which the prices p 0 are the equilibrium
prices and the initial capital stock is k0i by showing that the equilibrium conditions imply that the
first-order conditions and transversality condition of (35) are satisfied. Furthermore, if V is well
defined in the sense that −∞ < V (k ; p 0 ) < +∞ for all k > 0 , then it is straightforward to use the sorts
of arguments in Stokey, Lucas, and Prescott (1989) to show that the properties of v and π imply
that V is continuous, increasing, and concave as a function of k . Consequently, to prove the
theorem we need to argue that −∞ < V (k ; p 0 ) < +∞ for all k > 0 . Notice that V (k0i ; p 0 ) is finite
when the prices p 0 are the equilibrium prices and the initial capital stock in country i is k0i .
Similarly, V (kti ; p t ) is finite for any kti on the equilibrium path. Otherwise, the consumer’s
problem (9) would not be well posed and the prices p 0 would not be the equilibrium prices.
       We first argue that V (k ; p 0 ) < +∞ . Suppose, to the contrary, that V (kˆ ; p 0 ) = +∞ for some              0

kˆ0 > 0 , and let {cˆt , xˆt , kˆt } be the corresponding plan for consumption, investment, and the capital
stock. If kˆ ≤ k imax , where k imax ≥ k i , i = 1,..., n , we could reduce k imax to k̂ , follow the plan
                0      0                       0       0                                                 0         0

{cˆt , xˆt , kˆt } , and achieve infinite utility in equilibrium, which implies that the prices p 0 cannot be
equilibrium prices. If kˆ > k imax , then assumption A.5 implies that we can reduce c imax to c ,

                                                                                                    1        to k1 . Consider the
continuation plan
                    (ct , xt , kt ) = (θ cˆt + (1 − θ )ctimax , θ xˆt + (1 − θ ) xtimax ,θ kˆt + (1 − θ )ktimax ) , t = 1, 2,... ,           (144)

where θ = (kˆ1 − k1 ) /(kˆ1 − k1imax ) . Since {ctimax , xtimax , ktimax } satisfies the feasibility conditions in problem
(35) for the initial capital k imax and {cˆ , xˆ , kˆ } satisfies the feasibility for the initial capital k̂ ,

v(c0 ) < v(cimax

equilibrium plan {ctimin , xtimin , ktimin } and achieve a finite value of the objective function in problem

Proof of proposition 3. The proof follows the approach of Milgrom and Shannon (1994). We
prove that k0i ≥ k0i ' implies k1i ≥ k1i ' . By induction, the argument extends to any other period. Let us
write the country social planner’s problem as
                                                V (k0i ; p 0 ) = max v(c0 (k0i , k1i ; p 0 )) + βV (k1i ; p1 )                                                     (149)

                                                                                    i

                                                                                              i

                                                                                                  0



where c0 (k0i , k1i ; p 0 ) = (π ( p10 , p20 , k0i ) − k1i + (1 − δ )k0i ) / p( p10 , p20 ) , and
k (k0i ; p 0 ) = π ( p10 , p20 ) + (1 − δ )k0i . Define F (k0i , k1i ; p 0 ) = v(c0 (k0i , k1i ; p 0 )) + β V (k1i ; p1 ) . We prove
our result by contradiction. If k0i = k0i ' , then k1i = k1i ' . Therefore, assume, without loss of generality,
that k01 > k02 and k11 < k12 . Notice that, since k11 < k12 ≤ k (k02 ; p 0 ) < k (k01 ; p 0 ) , both k11 and k12 are
feasible. Since k1i maximizes F (k0i , k1i ; p 0 ) , i = 1, 2 , we know that

                               F (k01 , k11 ; p 0 ) − F (k01 , k12 ; p 0 ) ≥ 0 ≥ F (k02 , k11 ; p 0 ) − F (k02 , k12 ; p 0 )                                       (150)

Define the function g (k0 ) = F (k0 , k11 ; p 0 ) − F (k0 , k12 ; p 0 ) .

              g ′(k0 ) = ⎡⎣v′ ( c0 (k0 , k11 ; p 0 ) ) − v′ ( c0 (k0 , k12 ; p 0 ) ) ⎤⎦ ⎜⎜ k 10 20 0               ⎟⎟ < 0 ,   (151)
                                                                                         ⎝      p ( p10 , p20 )     ⎠
where π k ( p10 , p20 , k0 ) is the partial derivative of π ( p10 , p20 , k0 ) with respect to k0 . The inequality
follows from the fact that v is strictly concave and c0 is strictly increasing in k1 . Therefore,
k01 > k02 implies g (k01 ) < g (k02 ) , which contradicts (150).
        Suppose now that k01 > k02 . We have demonstrated that k11 ≥ k12 . We now demonstrate that,
if x10 > 0 , k11 > k12 . Suppose, to the contrary, that k01 > k02 and x10 > 0 , but that k11 = k12 . Since

                                       (1 − δ )k01 + x10 = k11 = k12 = (1 − δ )k02 + x02 ,                                    (152)

 k01 > k02 and x10 > 0 imply that x02 > x10 > 0 . We can therefore write the first-order condition for x0i
in (35) as an equality,
                              v(c0i )      β v(c1i )
                                         =
                           p( p10 , p20 ) p( p11 , p21 )
                                                         (π k ( p11 , p21 , k1i ) + 1 − δ ) , i = 1, 2 .                      (153)

Since k11 = k12 , c11 = c12 . Equation (153) therefore implies that

                                                           v(c01 ) = v(c02 ) .                                                (154)

Since c01 > c02 and v is strictly concave, however,

                                                           v(c01 ) < v(c02 ) ,                                                (155)
a contradiction. ■

Proof of proposition 4: Without loss of generality, assume that kˆ1 > 0 . The first-order condition
for the consumer’s problem (9) implies that
                                                     1
                                             rˆi ≤       − 1 + δ and = if xˆ i > 0 .                                          (156)
                                                     β
Therefore, for all i = 1,..., n such that xˆ i > 0 , rˆi = rˆ1 . Assume that there is a country i for which
xˆ i = 0 and rˆi < rˆ1 . Since the rental rate of capital is lower in country i , lemma 1 implies that
kˆ i > kˆ1 > 0 . Since in a steady state xˆ i = δ kˆi , xˆ i = 0 implies that kˆ i = 0 , which is a contradiction.
Consequently, rˆi = rˆ1 for all i = 1,..., n . Following the same argument as in the proof of
proposition 1, equal rental rates of capital across countries imply equal wages across countries. ■

Proof of proposition 5: Suppose that the economy has a nontrivial steady state with distribution of
capital (kˆ1 ,..., kˆ n ) . We argue that there exists a nontrivial steady state for all (k 1 ,..., k n ) that satisfy

                                                     ∑           Li k i =∑ i =1 Li kˆi

                                                              κˆ2 ≤ k i ≤ κˆ1 ,                                               (158)



                                                                 42
where κˆ j is the capital-labor ratio in industry j , j = 1, 2 . Each of these steady states has the same
prices and, by construction, the same aggregate capital and production. We need to define the other
steady state variables and show that these steady state variables satisfy the equilibrium conditions
listed in appendix 1. Let the distribution of capital and labor across industries in each country be
                                                       k i − κˆ2 i
                                               A1i =             , A 2 = 1 − A1i                                    (159)

                                                          k ij = κˆ j Aij .                                         (160)

Since k i > 0 , we can use the first-order conditions for the investment good (114) to set
                                                                   δ ki
                                                   x2i =                                                            (161)
                                                              f ( xˆ1 / xˆ2 ,1)

                                                       x1i = ( xˆ1 / xˆ2 ) x2i .                                    (162)

We also set bˆi = 0 . It is easy to check that all of the production feasibility conditions (107)–(115)
are satisfied in the new steady state. We are left with defining consumption patterns that are
consistent with the consumer’s first-order conditions and the feasibility conditions in each goods
market. Equation (116) and assumption A.5 imply that cˆ1i cˆ2i = cˆ1 / cˆ2 . We use the budget
constraint (118) to define

With these definitions the rest of the conditions that characterize equilibrium, conditions (117)–
(119) are satisfied. Condition (122) is satisfied by construction. ■

Proof of proposition 6: There are three steps in the argument. First, we show that, if γ i > 1 for
some i then γ i > 1 for all i . Second, we show that, if γ i > 1 for all i , then γ i = γ for all i . Third
and finally, we use γ i = γ for all i to prove that factor prices are equal in the limit.
         To prove that γ i > 1 for some i implies that γ i > 1 for all i , assume, to the contrary and
without loss of generality, that 0 < γ 2 < 1 < γ 1 . Notice that γ 1 > 1 implies that there exists T 1 such
that ct1 < ct1+1 for all t = T 1 , T 1 + 1,... . The strict concavity of utility implies that v '(ct1 ) > v '(ct1+1 ) for
all t = T 1 , T 1 + 1,... . Similarly, there exists T 2 such that ct2 > ct2+1 and v '(ct2 ) < v '(ct2+1 ) for all
t = T 2 , T 2 + 1,... . Consequently, for all t = T , T + 1,... , where T > max[T 1 , T 2 ] ,

                                                v '(ct2 )          v '(ct1 )
                                                            < 1 <             .                                     (165)
                                                v '(ct2+1 )       v '(ct1+1 )

Notice too that there exists T 3 such that kt1+1 > kt1 > kt2 for all t = T 3 , T 3 + 1,... . Consequently, we
can use the consumers’ first-order conditions (117) to obtain



                                                          43

              (1 + r − δ )

                    t +1                       =             >              ≥ (1 + rt 2+1 − δ )                      ,   (166)

                                                       1             2
                                                                                                p( p1t +1 , p2t +1 )
which implies that
                                                           rt1+1 > rt 2+1 .                                              (167)

Lemma 1 says that kt1+1 > kt2+1 and rt1+1 > rt 2+1 is not possible in equilibrium, however, which is the
desired contradiction.
       To prove that γ i > 1 for all i implies that γ i = γ for all i , assume, to the contrary and
without loss of generality, that γ 1 > γ 2 > 1 . Consider the function
                                                                 v '(c)
                                          h(γ i ) = lim c→∞                , i = 1,..., n .                              (168)
                                                                v '(γ i c)
The strict concavity of v implies that h '(γ i ) > 0 , which implies that h(γ 1 ) > h(γ 2 ) . Since
limt →∞ cti+1 / cti = γ i > 1 and v ' is continuous, there exists T such that

                                                       v '(ct1 )   v '(ct2 )
                                                                 >                                                       (169)
                                                      v '(ct1+1 ) v '(ct2+1 )

for all t = T , T + 1,... . Consequently, following the same logic as in the argument that γ i > 1 for
some i implies that γ i > 1 for all i , we can show that kt1 > kt2 and rt1 > rt 2 , which lemma 1 says is
not possible in equilibrium and which is the desired contradiction.
         Since γ i = γ for all i , we know that
                                                                 p( p1t , p2t )
                                       limt →∞ (1 + rti − δ )                        = h(γ ) ,                           (170)
                                                                p( p1t +1 , p2t +1 )
which implies that
                                                         limt →∞ rti = r                                                 (171)
for all i . The rest of the proof is a modification of the proofs of propositions 4 and 5. ■

Proof of proposition 7: Assume that the model has a cycle of periodicity s . Since xˆti > 0 , the
first-order conditions for the consumer’s problem (9) are satisfied with equality. Multiplying these
conditions for t = 1,..., s + 1 and using the fact that c ij1 = c ijs +1 , j = 1, 2 , and p11 = p1s +1 , we obtain

                                                 β s ∏ t =1 (1 − δ + rti+1 ) = 1 .
                                                         s +1
                                                                                                                         (172)

Assume that there is a period in which rental rates are not equal in two countries, that is, without
loss of generality, assume that rt1 < rt 2 for some t , t = 1,..., s . Equation (172) implies that there
exists t ′ = 1,..., s + 1 such rt1′ > rt ′2 . Lemma 1 implies that kt1 > kt2 and kt1′ < kt2′ , which contradicts
proposition 3. ■

Proof of proposition 8: Assume, to the contrary, that an equilibrium cycle exists. Proposition 7
says that factor prices are equalized along the equilibrium path. Therefore, since xti > 0 for all i
and t , there exists an equilibrium cycle for the integrated economy. Since the model is one-sector
aggregatable, the equilibrium of the integrated economy solves the one-sector social planner’s
problem
                                               max ∑ t =0 β t v(ct )
                                                          ∞


                                             s.t. ct + xt ≤ F (kt ,1)                                   (173)
                                              kt +1 − (1 − δ )kt ≤ xt
                                                  ct ≥ 0 , xt ≥ 0
                                                      k0 ≤ k0 .
Here F is the production function
                                           F (k , A) = max f ( y1 , y2 )
                                         s.t. y j = φ j (k j , A j ) , j = 1, 2                         (174)
                                                   k1 + k2 ≤ k
                                                   A1 + A 2 ≤ A
                                                 kj ≥ 0 , A j ≥ 0.

See Bajona and Kehoe (2006) for details. Standard results from, for example, Stokey, Lucas, and
Prescott (1989) imply that the aggregate kt is either monotonically increasing or monotonically
decreasing (or constant). Suppose, for example, that k < kˆ . Then proposition 3 implies that,
                                                                   0

since kt = ∑ i =1 L k is strictly increasing, then so are all kti , i = 1,..., n , which implies that there are
               m   i    i
                       t

no cycles. ■

Proof of proposition 9: Assumption A.5' implies that, for given prices, the solution to the
consumer’s maximization problem (18) is unique. In a steady state with factor price equalization,
each generation in every country faces the same prices and, therefore, chooses the same
consumption and saving plans. To see that the steady state is interior to the cone of diversification,
observe that, since δ > 0 , there is positive investment in every state and, consequently, assumption
A.3 implies that a positive amount of both goods is produced in every country. ■

Proof of proposition 10: Proposition 9 implies that, in a steady state, all countries produce
positive amounts of each good, j = 1, 2 . Assumption A.1 implies that the functions κ j , j = 1, 2 ,
that determine the cone of diversification are continuous functions of prices. Therefore, there exists
a period T such that for all t = T , T + 1,... the equilibrium is inside the cone of diversification and
factor prices are equalized. Furthermore, all generations born after period t = T + m face the same
prices. The same argument as the one used in proposition 9 assures that these generations choose
the same consumption and saving patterns, making the equilibrium autarkic. ■

Proof of proposition 11: See the proof of theorem 1 in Fisher (1992). ■
