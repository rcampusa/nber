                                                ABSTRACT

Many studies have shown that women are under-represented in tenured ranks in the sciences. We
evaluate whether gender differences in the likelihood of obtaining a tenure track job, promotion to
tenure, and promotion to full professor explain these facts using the 1973-2001 Survey of Doctorate
Recipients. We find that women are less likely to take tenure track positions in science, but the gender
gap is entirely explained by fertility decisions. We find that in science overall, there is no gender difference
in promotion to tenure or full professor after controlling for demographic, family, employer and productivity
covariates and that in many cases, there is no gender difference in promotion to tenure or full professor
even without controlling for covariates. However, family characteristics have different impacts on
women's and men's promotion probabilities. Single women do better at each stage than single men,
although this might be due to selection. Children make it less likely that women in science will advance
up the academic job ladder beyond their early post-doctorate years, while both marriage and children
increase men's likelihood of advancing.

            Does Science Promote Women? Evidence from Academia, 1973-2001


       Fewer women are present in science academe than in the workforce as a whole and

particularly in the higher levels of academe – such as tenured jobs and full professorships at

major research universities. This paper begins from the point when scientists receive their

Ph.D.s and investigates gender differences as they move up the academic career ladder, getting

tenure track jobs, being granted tenure, and being promoted to full professorships.

       There is a large body of literature about women and science, particularly since 1982

when Congress instructed the National Science Foundation (NSF) to report biennially on the

status of women and minorities in science. The NSF reports have consistently shown that since

1982 and through the most recent report (NSF 2004a), women continue to be less likely than

their male colleagues to be full professors and more likely to be assistant professors. Congress

also established its own committee, the Congressional Committee on the Advancement of

Women and Minorities in Science, Engineering and Technological Developments (CAWMSET),

to review the status of women in science. CAWMSET (2000) also found that women in SET

(Science, Engineering and Technology) academia are less likely to be tenured (29 percent of

women versus 58 percent of men among full time ranked academics at 4 year colleges) or hold

full professorships (23 percent of women compared to 50 percent of men). More recently, the

Government Accountability Office (GAO) reported to Congress that women scientists lag behind

men in terms of salary and rank (GAO 2004). In site visits, some women report that tenure track

positions at research universities create difficulty in balancing work and family. Others report

that a hostile climate makes academic employment unattractive. Another recent study by Donna

Nelson and Diana Rogers (2005) found that smaller percentages of women than men who receive




                                                 1
Ph.D.s proceed to become assistant professors in top 50 SET departments. These important

sources represent only a few of the many studies on women in science.

       Even though women are under-represented in upper echelons of academic science, one

cannot conclude from the NSF, CAWMSET or Nelson reports that unfair treatment in the

promotion process is the underlying cause of the gender gap in academic promotion. Two

alternative possibilities include that women choose careers that do not have the rigid academic

timetable or that women are less productive, particularly in terms of research, than men. Of

course, research productivity itself may result from the absence of an environment and the

resources that foster research, as demonstrated at MIT (Goldberg 1999).

       In contrast to these negative findings, Long et.al. (2001) studies the careers of women in

science from 1973-1995 and conclude that women have been successful in moving “from

scarcity to visibility.” They find that the impact of marriage and children on women’s careers

had largely been eliminated by 1995, although men were still 4 percent more likely to receive

tenure. On the other hand, Xie and Shauman (2003) find that marriage and children exacerbate

gender differences in promotion in nonacademic science. In addition, they find the gender

publication gap is smaller than in previous studies and declining over time, suggesting a

convergence in women’s and men’s academic productivity.

        A recent report by the NSF (NSF 2004b) is the most comprehensive study to date of the

factors contributing to promotion in academic careers of scientists and engineers. This work,

carried out contemporaneously to ours and also using NSF’s longitudinal Survey of Doctorate

Recipients (SDR), finds that controlling for human capital, personal characteristics and

institutional factors, there remains a significant female disadvantage in the likelihood of being in

a tenure track job, of receiving tenure and of being promoted to full. However, in most of their




                                                 2
specifications, they find that these gender differences become statistically insignificant when

family characteristics are allowed to affect men and women differently. Our findings are quite

different qualitatively from theirs, for reasons we discuss in the conclusion. We find that in

science, single women actually have an advantage over single men in obtaining tenure track jobs,

in being granted tenure and in being promoted to full after controlling for covariates and that

married men and women without children are quite similar at each of these stages overall.

However, the presence of children prevents some women from ever achieving a tenure track job

and thus stepping onto the academic career ladder.

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows: we first describe the data and

methodology. We then discuss the entry into tenure-track jobs, describe and model the tenure

decision and then describe and model promotion to full professor. The final section concludes.



       Data and Empirical Methodology

       Our analysis of promotion uses data from the 1973-2001 waves of the Survey of

Doctorate Recipients (SDR). The SDR is a biennial, longitudinal survey of doctorate recipients

from U.S. institutions conducted by the National Research Council. The SDR collects detailed

information on doctorate recipients including demographic characteristics, educational

background, employer characteristics, academic rank, government support, primary work

activity, productivity, and salary. The SDR has undergone substantial changes in the sampling

frame and survey content between the 1973 and 1993 waves (Mitchell, Moonesinge, and Cox

1998). Technical reports provided by the National Science Foundation have allowed us to

construct a longitudinal data set with consistent variable definitions over time.




                                                 3
       We have selected a longitudinal extract of doctorate recipients in the sciences who

received their Ph.D. between the years of 1972 and 1991 and remain in the survey 10 years after

the Ph.D. Individuals are excluded if they are not observed more than once or if they skip more

than three surveys.

       We estimate three career milestones. First, we examine the probability of obtaining a

tenure track job within five years of the Ph.D. Then we restrict the analysis to those who have

ever held a tenure track job to estimate two promotion milestones, the first award of tenure and

the first award of full professorship.

       From the 1973 through 1991 surveys, respondents provided the exact year that they

received tenure, which adds some accuracy given the biennial nature of the survey. For later

surveys, tenure year is imputed as the first year a person is observed with tenure in the sample.

We impute the year a person receives full professorship as the first year a person is observed as a

tenured full professor in the sample. Given the biennial nature of the survey, years until tenure

and years until full professor may be measured with one-year error.

       Our analyses below include both time-varying and non-time varying independent

variables. Non-time varying variables include gender, race, whether foreign born, field, and

aspects of the person’s Ph.D. institution. Time varying independent variables include marital

status, children, employer characteristics, primary and secondary work activities, government

support, and limited productivity measures (discussed below). These covariates are suggested by

previous studies of academic promotion (Long, Allison, and McGinnis 1993, Ginther and Kahn

2004). Table 1 gives descriptive statistics about both dependent and covariate variables at

different stages of academic careers of scientists.




                                                  4
         Research by Ginther and Hayes (1999, 2003), Ginther (2001, 2003, 2004), and Ginther

and Kahn (2004) demonstrates that employment outcomes differ by academic field. Thus,

promotion is analyzed for all scientific fields together and broken down into three major

scientific fields – biological and life sciences, physical sciences, and engineering.

         Measures of academic productivity are largely missing from the SDR data, but the SDR

does ask questions about publications in the 1983, 1995, and 2001 surveys. The 1983 question

refers to publications between 1980 and 1983 whereas the 1995 and 2001 questions refer to

numbers of publications in the previous five years. We use these data to create rough measures

of cumulative papers presented and publications per year past Ph.D. If productivity data are

missing for a particular year (as they are prior to 1980), average observed productivity is used to

impute total productivity – an admitted rough correction which nevertheless seems preferable to

omitting the information altogether.

         We evaluate gender differences in academic careers using both probit and hazard

methodologies. In our probit analyses, first we estimate whether significant gender differences

exist in the probability of a tenure track job within five years of the Ph.D. In this estimation, we

exclude doctoral recipients who were unlikely to have sought academic jobs as evidenced by

their immediately entering non-academic jobs upon or prior to receipt of their Ph.D.1 Second,

for those who hold a tenure track job at some point in their careers, we estimate probit models of

the probability of having tenure 11 years after Ph.D. In most scientific fields, this includes a

period of one or more post-doctorates in addition to a period in tenure-track assistant professor

jobs. In this analysis, time-varying covariates are evaluated 11 years after Ph.D. receipt. Third,

 Thus, we include anyone who held a post-doc, who had any academic appointment, or who had no job
immediately after receiving their doctorate. When the results differ substantially by including those who begin their
careers outside academia, we note this.


                                                          5
for those who receive tenure (by 15 years past Ph.D.), probit analyses model the probability of

being a full professor 15 years after Ph.D. In these latter probits, time-varying covariates are all

evaluated at 15 years past Ph.D.

         We also use proportional hazard models with time varying-covariates to estimate the

likelihood each year of becoming tenured, given that the individual has survived untenured until

that point, and to estimate the likelihood each year of being promoted to full, given that the

individual has received tenure but has not yet been promoted to full.2 The hazard analysis

allows time-varying covariates to change each year.

         Before proceeding, we inject a word of caution about overall trends among science

Ph.D.’s. We have grouped all scientists into three broad groups, life sciences, physical sciences

and engineering. In this analysis, these three areas often have different characteristics. The

problem is worse than usual when using averages, in that the combined science statistics on

women are more likely to be picking up trends in the life sciences, where most of the women are,

while the statistics on men are quite likely to pick up engineering which is heavily male.

Accordingly, we point out when major facts differ across these broad areas.



Stepping Onto the Academic Career Ladder

         The NSF conducts a census of doctorates granted in the U.S. in its Survey of Earned

Doctorates. Based on these data, Figure 1 illustrates the continuous growth in the percentage of

the Ph.D.’s granted in science going to females in all fields between 1974 and 2004. Life

 Hazard models are preferred to probit models because they account for censored observations. The proportional
hazard model is given by:
                                                l
                           hi (t ) = λ o (t ) exp β 1 xi1 +…+ β k xik   q
where the hazard of promotion hi(t) is a function of the baseline hazard λo(t) and covariates, x in equation (1). The
covariates in equation (1) influence the scale of the hazard rate and are not a function of time. In addition, the
hazard for any one individual is a fixed proportion to the hazard for any other person in the sample.


                                                           6
Sciences started this period with less than 20 percent of Ph.D.s granted to females, but by the

year 2004 nearly 50 percent were. Engineering started this period as the field with fewest female

doctorates, and remained so for the entire quarter century. Nevertheless, the percent female of

engineering doctorate recipients rose from just over one percent in 1974 to almost 18 percent by

2004.

        Figure 2 uses weighted estimates from the SDR to show the changing percentage female

in each academic rank over the quarter century. The general upward trend in the percentage

female among assistant professors mirrors the trend in science Ph.D. awards from Figure 1. Also

similar to doctorates granted, life sciences have the highest percentage female among assistant

professors, with physical sciences at much lower levels and engineering at the very lowest.

        Other aspects of the time trends in assistant professorships (in Figure 2) compared to

doctoral recipients (in Figure 1) differ by field. In life sciences, throughout the entire quarter

century, fewer women than men proceed from Ph.D. receipt to a tenure track assistant

professorship with the wedge during the last four years being especially large, averaging a

difference of 6 percentage points. In fact, during these four years, the proportion female among

assistant professors in life sciences has actually fallen despite the fact that given increasing time

trends in doctoral receipt, we would have expected them to have risen. In contrast, in physical

sciences the percent female among assistant professors has consistently kept pace with the

percentage of female doctorates. In 2001, 25 percent of doctorates awarded to women and 26

percent of assistant professors were women. Even more extreme, in engineering, from the late

1980’s until very recently, the percentage female among assistant professorships was greater

than among doctorates. Between 1990 and 1997 an average of 11 percent of doctorates in

engineering were granted to women whereas an average of 13 percent assistant professors were




                                                  7
women. However, since 1997, the percent female among doctoral recipients has pulled ahead of

that of assistant professors.

        Among those women entering academia, fewer women than men have tenure track jobs

within five years of Ph.D. receipt. Table 1 indicates that 58 percent of men held tenure track

jobs within five years of the Ph.D. compared with 54 percent of women. These gender

differences among the percentages female in tenure track jobs may not represent different jobs

among otherwise identical men and women, but instead be picking up a large variety of factors

such as field and Ph.D. quality that happen to be correlated with gender. Model 2 of Table 2

shows the gender differences once we control for covariates. (Results of the entire probit

specifications are presented in Appendix Table A1). Even after controlling for age at Ph.D.,

cohort, race, origin, Ph.D. quality tier3 and field in Model 2, there is a significant gender

difference in the likelihood of being in a tenure track job five years after Ph.D. receipt. This

difference is, however, entirely due to life sciences which has a significant and large gender

difference in the likelihood in being in a tenure track job that increases to 7.7 percent once all of

these covariates are added. In contrast, for engineering and physical sciences, the gender

difference is small and insignificant.

        Marriage and fertility decisions may be affecting women’s tenure track employment. To

investigate this possibility, we include marital status, total number of children, an indicator for

having children less than six years of age, and each of these interacted with gender (Table 2

Model 3). Some female interaction terms are statistically significant and suggest that family

variables affect women and men quite differently.

 Quality tiers are based on rankings from the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching and of
Comprehensive and Liberal Arts Institutions.


                                                       8
        With family characteristics entered as controls, the female coefficient in science as a

whole, in life sciences, and in physical sciences becomes positive and statistically significant.

This indicates that single, childless women are between 11 percent in life science to 21 percent in

physical science more likely to get a tenure track job within 5 years of the Ph.D. than single,

childless men. In engineering, there is no significant difference.

        Being married increases men’s probability of getting a tenure track job by a whopping 22

percent, in science as a whole and for each field separately. Women’s chances are also helped

somewhat by marriage, but only by 5 percent.4 As a result, in science as a whole a married man

without children and a married woman without children are about equally likely to have a tenure

track job five years after Ph.D..

        Children create a marked divergence between men and women. For science as a whole,

the presence of a pre-kindergarten aged child lowers women’s likelihood of having a tenure track

job by 8.1 percent. The presence of a grade school child has no effect. In contrast, for men, pre-

kindergarten children have no effect on their likelihood of having a tenure track job while each

child above six years old increases a man’s probability of getting a tenure track job by 2.9

percent.

        Some gender differences in the impact of marriage and children differ by scientific field.

One of these is the impact of marriage on women. At one extreme, in engineering both sexes

have equally large positive impacts of marriage (21-22%). In life sciences, marriage increases

women’s likelihood of entering a tenure track job by a more modest 7.9% (again compared to

22% for men). Finally, in physical science, marriage does not affect women’s chances at all.

4
  This calculation adds the coefficient of Married to the coefficient of Female*Married. Many other numbers later in
this section similarly add several coefficients. For instance, the impact on men of one young child adds the
coefficient on Total Children and the coefficient on Children <=6, while the impact on women adds to this sum the




                                                         9
        Disaggregating children’s impact by field, young children especially hurt the tenure-track

prospects of women in life sciences (by -8.1%) and in physical sciences by (-5.6%). In

engineering, while the point estimate is large (-9.8%), it is significant only at the 20% level.

Grade school children are negatively correlated with having a tenure track job for physical

science only, where the impact is relatively small (-3.4%).

        The positive impact of marriage and children on men’s prospects here recalls positive

impact on wages and promotion in the labor market as a whole. There are three primary

explanations for positive impacts. First, particularly with respect to marriage, it may be due to

selection: “good catches” in the marriage market are correlated with “good catches” in the labor

market. Second, it could be induced effort by people “responsible” for a family. Third, it could

be favoritism by employers who know that the man has a family to support. The positive –

although smaller -- effect of marriage on women here suggests selection. The favoritism

explanation seems not to apply to women, since employers are more apt to be prejudiced against

women with a family than for them. We return to these explanations in the conclusions.

        Gender differences in the likelihood of receiving a tenure track job have changed over

time. In additional specifications (available upon request), the gender difference between

comparable men and single women (Table 2, Model 3) was allowed to differ by year of Ph.D.

Later cohorts of women did better relative to men than earlier cohorts. For instance, single

women with 1972 Ph.D.’s in science had a 12.1 percent higher likelihood of entering tenure track

jobs within five years than single men of that cohort, and this gender difference widened to 24.4

percent for those with 1991 Ph.D’s. Disaggregating, life science and physical science fields




coefficient of Female*Total Children and the coefficient of Female*Children<=6. We note in the text when the sum
is not significant.


                                                      10
actually saw even larger changes over cohorts, while engineering had no significant cohort

differences between men and women.



       Empirical Analysis of Moving Up the Career Ladder: Promotion of Academic

       Scientists

A.     Estimates of the Probability of Promotion to Tenure

       Returning to Figure 2, the dashed line shows the changing percentage female among

associate professors, while Figure 3 shows the percentage female among all tenured faculty. In

science as a whole, the monotonically increasing trend in associate professorships mirrors trends

in assistant professorships 5 to 10 years earlier, and the levels are comparable. For instance, 26

percent female among associates in 1991 is the same as the percent female among assistant

professors six years earlier. Within broad fields, however, trends in percent female among

associate professorships are not at all smooth or monotonically increasing, with substantial drops

in the percentage female in 1996 in life sciences and in 1993 in engineering, and stagnation in

percentage female in physical sciences between 1989 and 1995.

       The top panel of Table 3 summarizes the impact of gender on the probability of being

promoted to tenure as captured by probit and hazard analysis, before we allow gender differences

in the impact of family variables. The top panel of Table 4 summarizes tenure results when

family-gender interactions are included. (Appendix Table A2 provides detailed parameter

estimates for the probit model. Hazard estimates are available by request).

       The first row of Table 3 shows the probit analysis of gender differences in the probability

of tenure by 11 years from the doctorate controlling for all variables including marriage and




                                                11
children, but without interaction terms. These results show no significant gender differences in

tenure; the point estimates of the impact of being female even vary in sign across fields.

          Hazard analyses are able to capture the entire year-by-year pattern of the likelihood of

receiving tenure and thus in the duration until tenure. A particular strength of this analysis is that

it takes into account those observed to not have received tenure by the last survey. The second

row of Table 3 presents the risk ratios from a proportional hazards model of promotion regressed

on a dummy variable for gender. This risk ratio can be interpreted as the effect of being female

rather than male on the probability of receiving tenure. A number less than one indicates that on

average the likelihood of tenure receipt in any given year for females is less than of males.

There is not a significant gender difference either for science as a whole or for any of the broad

fields.

          The third row of Table 3 (Model 1) shows the female risk ratio after accounting for

differences in academic field, demographic, family and employer characteristics, primary and

secondary work activity, and government grant support. The fourth row of Table 3 shows the

female risk ratios that include productivity as well (Model 2). The risk ratios fall after

controlling for these covariates in each field. This gender difference is not significant for science

as a whole. By field, it is not significant except in the life sciences where women are 8 percent

less likely to get tenure with all covariates, but only significant at the 10 percent level.

          To illustrate how gender affects the likelihood of being promoted, in Figure 4 we have

graphed a smoothed version of baseline survival function for men and women separately with the

full set of covariates given in Model 2. Each baseline survival function is evaluated at the

average characteristics of men and women respectively in the sample. The estimated survival

function is then smoothed using a nonparametric kernel density estimator described in Allison




                                                  12
(1995). The graphs demonstrate that for science as a whole and for each broad field, males are

slightly more likely to remain untenured over the entire period after controlling for all covariates.

Thus, the men’s covariates lead them to have slightly lower levels of tenure, even though an

identical man would have a higher level of tenure as a woman.

         Once again, adding in controls for family, children and female-interactions changes the

picture. Table 4 reports probit coefficients of these gender and family terms when included in

addition to other covariates.5 We have done the same estimation with hazard analyses (details

available on request). Those results are qualitatively similar except where noted.

         As was true with entrance into tenure track jobs, single women are more likely than

single men to receive tenure. For science as a whole, the difference is 5.9 percent.

Disaggregating by broad field, it is significantly true with a very large difference (20.7 percent)

in engineering. In the life and physical sciences, differences between single men and women are

not statistically significant.

         Marriage does not have as large an effect on men with regard to tenure receipt as it did

for obtaining tenure track jobs. Marriage only significantly increases men’s likelihood of tenure

in engineering (by 12.2%) and in science as a whole (6.2%). Marriage does not have a

statistically significant effect on women in any field. Combining this with the direct gender

effect, married (childless) women have similar likelihoods of tenure as married (childless) men

in life sciences and physical sciences. In engineering, married (childless) women have a 19%

higher likelihood of tenure in engineering ceteris paribus, similar to the difference between

single men and women in engineering.




5
 The covariates here include interaction terms with other variables found to have significant effects in some fields.
None of the qualitative results on the female interactions change with or without these additional terms.


                                                         13
       Each school-aged child has a positive impact on the promotion probability of men in all

fields. This is statistically significant in engineering (where the impact is 4.0 percent) and life

science (with an impact of 2.8 percent). In physical sciences, the impact is not significant in the

probit but is marginally significant in the more powerful hazard analysis. As was true in the

previous section for entering the tenure track, the impact of younger children on men’s tenure

likelihood is zero in all fields. For women, pre-school children have no significant impact in any

field (once again, adding together the 4 children coefficients). Grade school children have a

large negative (-22.8%) impact on women’s tenure in engineering only. This engineering result

must be seen in the context of two other differences between engineering and other scientific

fields. Engineering was the only field where young children did not hurt a woman’s likelihood

of being in a tenure track job five years after Ph.D., and engineering has the lowest incidence of

post-docs (NSF 2006). Together, these three facts suggest that women with children in all three

fields are more likely to drop off the tenure-track career path within several years post-Ph.D.

However, in engineering, this occurs while they are assistant professors.

       In these specifications, other variables were allowed to have different coefficients for

men and women if the interaction term was found significant in any specifications. We find that

in the life sciences (only), otherwise identical women were not as likely as men to get tenure in

the universities with the highest ranking. However, in the life sciences, private universities were

less likely to give tenure in general, but women were penalized less than men. For men, the

likelihood of receiving tenure fell over the cohort years. For women, this effect was smaller, still

negative in life sciences but marginally positive in engineering and physical sciences.

B.       Estimates of the Probability of Promotion to Full Professorship

         Returning to Figure 2, among full professors in science, the percentage female has been

steadily increasing over the quarter century shown but by 2001 had only achieved the level of

female representation that had been achieved in assistant professorships and Ph.D. recipients in

the early 1970s. Disaggregated, the same can be said for physical sciences and engineering. Life

sciences here is the “success story”, with the percentage female among full professorships

continually rising to 20 percent by 2001, comparable to the level of assistant professorships in

1983. Trends and levels among tenured faculty in Figure 3 combine the trends in associate

professors with those in full professors.

         The bottom panels of Tables 3 and 4 summarize the impact of gender on promotion to

full professorship.6 The probits and hazards reported here use two different beginning time

points. The probits estimate the likelihood that someone who has received tenure has a full

professorship 15 years after Ph.D. The hazards starts with first tenure receipt and study the

likelihood of becoming a full professor and the duration of time it takes to get there.

         The first row of the bottom panel of Table 3 gives the probit coefficient on promotion to

full professor (with covariates.). For all sciences pooled, there is a significant gender difference.

Breaking this down by broad fields allows us to see that this is entirely due to life sciences,

where women have a 9 percent lower likelihood of being promoted to a full professorship. In the

other two fields, differences are not significantly different from zero.7

  Appendix Table A3 provides detailed parameter estimates for the probit models. Hazard estimates are available on
request.
7
  In analysis not shown, we estimated the probability of promotion to full professor 17 and 19 years after Ph.D. for
life scientists as well. While women are 5 percent less likely to be promoted to full professor by 15 years after
Ph.D. receipt, they were 6 percent less likely by 17 years, but this difference is only significant at the 7 percent level.
There was no significant difference in the probability of being promoted to full professor by 19 years after Ph.D.
receipt.


                                                           15
       In the hazard analysis of Table 3, as before, the second row of the panel includes no

covariates. The risk ratio from the proportional hazard analysis (without covariates) indicates

highly significant gender differences in promotion to full in science as a whole. On average, the

likelihood of promotion to full in any given year for females is 90 percent that of males.

Disaggregating by field, physical science is the only one where women have a significantly

lower likelihood of being promoted to full than men on average. In fact, in physical science the

likelihood of being promoted to full professor in any given year for females is only 79 percent

that of males.

       Adding in a full set of controls in the last two rows of Table 3, however, moves the risk

ratio in both the full sample and in physical sciences closer to one and makes them insignificant

at standard levels of significance.

       Figure 5 shows a smoothed version of the baseline survival function for men versus

women with the full set of covariates, where each is evaluated at the average characteristics of

men and women respectively in the sample. We omit engineering from this analysis because of

the small numbers of women with tenure. The graphs demonstrate that for science as a whole

and for each broad field, females are slightly less likely to have been promoted to full at most

durations.

       Details on the family terms are reported in the bottom panel of Table 4. Adding gender-

family interaction terms, we see that in both life and physical sciences, single women are much

less likely to become full professors than single men by 15 years post-Ph.D (62% and 77%

respectively). This reverses the advantage that single women had over men in the earlier career

stages. In engineering, there is no significant difference between single men and women.

Marriage does not have an impact on men’s promotion to full. For women, a married woman in




                                                16
life science has a 6.3% lower chance of achieving full (p=.15) than a single woman, while in

physical science a married woman is 12.0 percent more likely to have a full professorship

(p=.08).

       Having school aged children has no effect on men’s promotion to full, except in

engineering where each child makes promotion 6.4 percent more likely. Having school aged

children has an effect on women’s promotion to full only in the physical sciences, where in this

case it lowers the probability of becoming full by 9.6 percent Finally, having young children has

no clear effect on full professorship for either sex in any field, with one exception: women in

engineering. In engineering, young children may raise the probability of a woman receiving full

in engineering (31.1%, significant at the 14% level).

       A few other variables were shown to have different impacts on men and women. As with

tenure, presently working in a Research I university hurt women’s chances of becoming full but

not men’s in life sciences and consequently in science as a whole. Similarly, for life sciences

(and hence sciences as a whole), private universities significantly hurt women’s chances of being

promoted to full in the hazard model specifications--opposite to the gender difference found at

promotion to tenure. Finally, unlike the tenure decision, both women’s and men’s likelihood of

promotion to full worsen for later cohorts.



Conclusions: Putting Gender Differences in Promotion into Perspective

       This paper has shown that within science as a whole, even without controls, there are no

appreciable gender differences in the probability of receiving tenure, and only a five percent

difference in the probability of promotion to full. Moreover, we can explain what differences

that do exist in tenure and promotion to full professor by differences in academic field,




                                                17
demographic and employer characteristics, primary and secondary work activity, government

grants, and publications. When broken down into broad fields, with controls there do seem to be

some gender differences in promotion to tenure for life sciences only, on the order of

approximately 8 percent. No broad fields demonstrate significant gender differences in

promotion to full professor after including these covarates. The stage where there are gender

differences is the entry stage, where there is a 3 percent gender difference in the likelihood of

starting out in a tenure track job (within 5 years of Ph.D. receipt) even after controlling for these

covariates.

           These small or nonexistent gender differences mask much more substantial differences

between men and women with identical kinds of family structures. In fact, single women are

significantly more likely than single men to enter tenure track jobs and to be granted tenure

ceteris paribus. Reversing this, single women who received tenure are much less likely to

become full professors within fifteen years of Ph.D.

           Marriage greatly increases the likelihood than men get tenure track jobs (by 22 percent),

but has smaller and generally less significant effects on men’s promotion at either level.

Marriage tends not to hurt women’s likelihood of getting tenure track jobs, being granted tenure

or becoming full.8 Often, it helps. It is striking that marriage does not hurt women in science.

Dual career problems do not seem to deter women from getting a tenure track job, from getting

tenure, or from becoming a full professor, despite the fact that more than 60 percent of women

scientists are married to scientists (Rosser 2004).

           The presence of children, however, does disadvantage women during the early post-Ph.D.

years that coincide with the child-bearing window. In life sciences and physical sciences,



8
    The single exception is a 6% lower chance of achieving full in life sciences.


                                                            18
children make it less likely for women to make it through the postdoc hurdle and get a tenure

track job. In engineering, people tend to go directly from the doctorate receipt to jobs, bypassing

the postdoc stage. Here, too, however, children make it less likely for women to be successful in

academia during the early career years, lowering their likelihood of receiving tenure . Our

results indicate that to some extent, women in science must make a choice between a family and

an academic career. Opting out of academic career jobs because of children dovetails with some

of Preston’s (2004) results that show a major reason that women leave science is because of

childcare responsibilities.

       In contrast, for men the presence of grade school children (but not young children) is

positively correlated with their likelihood of receiving tenure track jobs and receiving tenure. A

gender difference is not surprising, given that men spend much less time than women in

childcare, even in professional couples. Preston (2004) finds that those male scientists who do

childcare have similar impacts on their academic careers.

       Some of these gender differences in family variables are likely to be selection. The

widespread labor market disadvantages of single men suggests that the most able men tend to get

married and have children. It is possible that the negative impact of children on women entering

academic careers is also selection. We cannot know whether the women who have children

during the “formative” years of their careers would be less devoted to their careers even in the

absence of children (i.e. a selection story), or are being hampered by their presence. To some

extent, this is a chicken and egg problem.

       The estimated gender differences that we have found among women scientists entering

academic jobs post-PhD. are different from the recent NSF report (NSF 2004b) using the same

data set. Where we find that single women have greater rates entering tenure track jobs and




                                                19
being promoted to tenure and full (ceteris paribus), the NSF found no gender differences for

entering tenure track jobs and lower rates of women promoted to full. Where the NSF found

that marriage hurt women’s careers at various stages, we find that marriage in the absence of

children does not hurt. While NSF found negative impacts of children all levels, we find

negative effect of children at the point of entry into tenure track jobs only. What accounts for

these very different results?

       There are some small differences in our research that are not responsible for the large

discrepancies in results. For instance, our analysis uses the most recent data available from the

2001 SDR. Also, other studies stopped their analysis in 1999 or earlier. NSF 2004a included a

somewhat difference set of controls and did not include any publication controls.

       However, the important explanation for differences between our results and the others is

that we are looking only at the life sciences, physical sciences and engineering. In contrast, both

Long et. al. (2001) and NSF define science as including social science. Indeed, there is a gender

difference in academic promotion in social sciences which we have demonstrated in previous

work. Ginther (2002) and Ginther and Kahn (2004) estimates the probability and duration to

promotion for faculty in the social sciences and economics respectively. Ginther (2002a) finds a

gender promotion gap in the social sciences that ranges between 10 to 12 percent (through 1997)

with only half of the gap being explained by observable characteristics. In the field of

economics, Kahn (1993) and Ginther and Kahn (2004) both find large gender promotion

differences. Ginther and Kahn (2004) use data from the SDR (as well as independently collected

data) through 2001 and find a 21 percent gender promotion gap in economics with less than half

of the gap explained by observable characteristics. That paper also estimates an 8 percent

promotion gap in social sciences excluding economics through 2001.




                                                20
       Our results on promotion in sciences also differ from findings by Ginther and Hayes

(1999, 2001) for faculty in the humanities. Using the 1977-1995 waves of the SDR and

performing similar estimates, Ginther and Hayes find a gender promotion gap ranging between 7

to 9 percent. Some of the promotion gap in the humanities is explained by fertility and the

treatment of work experience.

       Taking all of this work together, women’s disadvantages in promotion to tenure not

explained by any covariates are largest in economics and other social sciences, are smaller in the

humanities (in part explained by marriage and family characteristics), and non-existent in the

physical or life sciences or in engineering once all variables are taken into account.

       This is not to say that there are no gender differences at all in academic science careers

once scientists enter tenure track jobs. Salaries of men and women are significantly different.

Ginther (2001, 2003, 2004) show a significant gender salary gap in academic science especially

at the full professor rank, after controlling for similar covariates including productivity. In

2001, male full professors in science earned 12 percent more than female full professors and one-

third of this salary gap is not explained by observable characteristics (Ginther 2004). Although

there is no significant difference in the likelihood of being promoted to full professor,

compensation is apparently not equivalent.

       There is some indication that the most prestigious schools are harsher on women than on

men in the promotion process in the life sciences. We see this in both promotion to tenure and

full, where working in a Research I university hurts women but helps men. Finally, in terms of

promotion, our results agree with evidence from Long et. al. (2001) of improving conditions for

women in science over the last quarter century.
