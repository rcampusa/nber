Optimal Price Indices for Targeting Inflation Under Incomplete Markets

JEL No. E31,E52,E61

                                               ABSTRACT

In models with complete markets, targeting core inflation enables monetary policy to maximize welfare
by replicating the flexible price equilibrium. In this paper, we develop a two-sector two-good closed
economy new Keynesian model to study the optimal choice of price index in markets with financial
frictions. Financial frictions that limit credit-constrained consumers’ access to financial markets make
demand insensitive to interest rate fluctuations. The demand of credit-constrained consumers is determined
by their real wage, which depends on prices in the flexible price sector. Thus, prices in the flexible
price sector influence aggregate demand and, for monetary policy to have its desired effect, the central
bank has to stabilize price movements in the flexible price sector. Also, in the presence of financial
frictions, stabilizing core inflation is no longer equivalent to stabilizing output fluctuations. Our analysis
suggests that in the presence of financial frictions a welfare-maximizing central bank should adopt
flexible headline inflation targeting—a target based on headline rather than core inflation, and with
some weight on the output gap. We discuss why these results are particularly relevant for emerging
markets, where the share of food expenditures in total consumption expenditures is high and a large
proportion of consumers are credit-constrained.

1. Introduction
The global financial crisis has led to a vigorous debate about the appropriate objectives for
monetary policy. For instance, it has been posited that a narrow version of inflation targeting
(IT) could pose risks if it implies that potential asset bubbles are ignored by central banks.
The emerging consensus appears to be that the IT framework has delivered price stability
and should be retained but that central banks should use prudential regulation and other
policy tools to counteract asset price bubbles. Whether or not IT is the chosen framework,
central banks around the world view low and stable inflation as a primary, if not dominant,
objective of monetary policy.


What is the right price index that should be the focus of the inflation objective? This is a
central operational issue in implementing not just IT but any version of monetary policy.
Two key issues about the choice of price index are--determining the level of inflation that is
consistent with the notion of price stability and determining the appropriate price index. In
this paper, we focus on the task of analytically determining the appropriate price index for
markets with financial frictions in general and emerging markets in particular.


In the literature, the choice of price index has been guided by the idea that inflation is a
monetary phenomenon. It has been suggested that core inflation (excluding food, energy
and other volatile components from headline CPI) is the most appropriate measure of
inflation (Wynne, 1999). The logic is that fluctuations in food and energy prices represent
supply shocks and are non-monetary in nature. Since these shocks are transitory and
volatile and do not reflect changes in the underlying rate of inflation, they should not be a
part of the inflation targeting price index (Mishkin, 2007, 2008).

Previous authors have used models with price and/or wage stickiness to show that the
choice of this price index is consistent with a welfare maximization objective. Existing
models have looked at complete market settings where price stickiness is the only source of
distortion (besides monopoly power). Infrequent price adjustments cause mark-ups to
fluctuate and also distort relative prices. In order to restore the flexible price equilibrium,
central banks should try to minimize these fluctuations by targeting sticky prices
(Goodfriend and King, 1997, 2001). Using a variant of a New Keynesian model, Aoki
(2001) has shown that under complete markets targeting inflation in the sticky price sector
leads to welfare maximization and macroeconomic stability. Targeting core inflation is
                                                2

equivalent to stabilizing the aggregate output gap as output and inflation move in the same
direction under complete markets.


Appropriateness of the core price index in these models relies heavily on the assumption
that markets are complete (allowing households to fully insure against idiosyncratic risks)
so that the central bank only needs to tackle the distortions created by price stickiness.
However, there is compelling evidence that not all agents in the economy may be able to
smooth their consumption (Campbell and Mankiw, 1989, 1990, 1991).1 This observation is
also consistent with the findings of a number of papers rejecting the permanent income
hypothesis. It has been shown that, in the presence of credit-constrained consumers,
policymakers’ welfare objectives are altered and the Taylor rule becomes too weak a
criterion for stability (Amato and Laubach, 2003; and Gali, Lopez-Salido and Valles, 2004) .


Our main objective in this paper is to develop a model to study the welfare implications of
targeting different price indices in an incomplete markets setting and to analytically
determine the appropriate price index to target. A major contribution of this paper is to
study the implication of financial frictions (modeled by the presence of credit constrained
consumers) on the choice of the optimal price index.


Financial frictions that result in credit-constrained consumers have not received much
attention in models of inflation targeting. To examine the significance of financial frictions,
we develop a model with heterogeneous agents, where a fraction of consumers cannot
smooth their consumption—that is, they simply consume their current labor income.2 When
markets are not complete and agents differ in their ability to smooth consumption, their
welfare depends on the nature of idiosyncratic shocks. Thus, this modeling choice also
allows us to look at the welfare distribution under alternative choices of the price index.

Under complete markets, the income distribution following a sector-specific shock does not
matter for the choice of consumption and, hence, welfare. However, under incomplete
markets, household income, which is influenced by the nature of shocks and the price

1
  Campbell and Mankiw estimate that in the U.S. nearly 50 percent of income accrues to
consumers who do not smooth their consumption. Muscatelli, Tirelli and Trecroci (2004) find
that about 37 percent of consumers are rule-of-thumb consumers and they account for 59 percent
of total employment. For further evidence on the proportion of credit-constrained consumers in
the U.S., see Jappelli (1990), Shea (1995), Parker (1999), Souleles (1999), Fuhrer (2000), and
Fuhrer and Rudebusch (2004).

  We introduce this friction in a manner similar to that of Gali, Lopez-Salido and Valles (2004).

elasticity of demand for goods, matters for the consumption choice.3 Price elasticity of the
demand for food, which has not attracted much attention in complete market settings,
becomes important under incomplete markets. We show that, through its impact on a
household’s income and expenditure, the low price elasticity of the demand for food is an
important determinant of the optimal choice of price index under incomplete markets.4


We also incorporate other important features relevant to emerging markets into the model.
The share of food in total household expenditures is much higher in emerging markets,
constituting nearly 40-50 percent of household expenditures compared to 10-15 percent in
advanced economies. Low price and income elasticities of food, and low income levels make
the welfare of agents in emerging markets more sensitive to fluctuations in food prices.
Since expenditure on food in total household expenditure is high and demand for food is
relatively inelastic, agents may factor in food price inflation while bargaining over wages.
Through this channel, food price inflation feeds into inflation expectations. Thus, in
emerging markets even inflation expectation targeting central banks have to be concerned
about food price inflation. 5


The key finding of the paper is that in the presence of financial frictions targeting core
inflation (i.e., inflation in the sticky price sector) may not be optimal. Lack of access to
financial markets makes the demand of credit-constrained consumers insensitive to
fluctuations in interest rates. Since their demand depends only on real wages, a link is
established between aggregate demand and real wages. Thus, in the presence of financial
frictions, the relative price of the good produced in the flexible price sector not only affects
aggregate supply but, through its effects on real wages, also influences aggregate demand.


This result is at variance with the prior literature based on complete markets settings. For
instance, in Aoki’s (2001) model, relative prices of the flexible price sector only appear as a
shift parameter of inflation in the sticky price sector. Under incomplete markets, by contrast,
the central bank cannot ignore fluctuations in the price of the good produced in the flexible

  A negative productivity shock related to a good with a low price elasticity of demand could
increase the income of net sellers of that good and raise the expenditure of net buyers on that
good.
4
  A survey by the U.S. Department of Agriculture suggests that the average price elasticity of
food is -0.34 in a sample of 114 countries; this estimate is smaller in absolute terms than the
elasticity normally used in other models, most of which assume a unitary price elasticity.
5
  Walsh (2010) documents the high pass-through from food price inflation to non-food inflation in
middle- and low-income countries.

price sector if it wants to affect aggregate demand. Financial frictions break the comovement
of inflation and output (as inflation and output may now move in opposite directions).
Stabilizing core inflation is no longer sufficient to stabilize output. Thus, in the presence of
financial frictions targeting flexible headline inflation is a better policy choice.


Since our model exhibits monetary super-neutrality, we limit our analysis to non-
inflationary steady states (long-run price stability) and do not have anything to say about the
optimal level of inflation. We also do not attempt to define optimal policy rules but focus on
evaluating welfare outcomes of different policy rules using alternative measures of inflation.


The paper is organized as follows. In the next section, we present some empirical facts to
further motivate the analysis. In Section 3, we develop a two-sector, two-good model with
heterogeneous agents that encapsulates the features discussed above. In Section 4 we
discuss the main results and in Section 5 we conduct various sensitivity experiments to
check the robustness of our baseline results and also present some extensions of the basic
model. Section 6 concludes the paper.

2.      Basic Stylized Facts
We begin by presenting some stylized facts about the share of household consumption
expenditures on food and also various measures of the elasticity of food expenditures. In a
cross-country comparison, emerging markets and advanced countries differ markedly on
these measures. Next, we present data on credit constraints in emerging markets. We also
look at the features of core and headline CPI inflation measures in some emerging and
advanced economies.


Engel’s law states that as average household income increases the average share of food
expenditure in total household expenditure declines. When this idea is extended to
countries, we expect poor countries to have a high average share of food expenditure in
total household expenditure. Figure 1 plots the expenditure on food (as a percentage of
total expenditure) against log real per capital income for the year 1996.6 It shows that
countries with lower per capita income levels have a higher share of expenditure on food
in total household expenditure. In order to examine how emerging markets differ from


6
 We use data for 1996 for illustrative purposes since data for a large number of countries were
available for that year.
                                               5


advanced countries, in Table 1 we present recent data on shares of food expenditure in
total expenditure for selected emerging and advanced economies.7 As expected,
expenditure on food constitutes a much larger share of total household expenditure in
emerging markets relative to advanced economies.


Income and price elasticities of the demand for food are important for our analysis.
Figure 2 plots the income elasticity of food against real per capita GDP for the year 1996.
The income elasticity of food is low, suggesting that food is a necessary good. Since
expenditure on food is not a major share of household expenditure in rich countries, the
income elasticity of food is much lower.8 We present the income elasticity of food for
selected emerging market and advanced economies in Table 2. The income elasticity of
food in emerging markets is on average twice as large as that in advanced economies.
Figure 3 plots, for a large sample of countries, the Slutsky own price elasticity of food
against the log real per capita GDP for the year 1996.9 The price elasticity of food
demand is nonlinear, decreasing at low income levels, and then increasing, with a range
from -0.4 to -0.1. We also present data on the Slutsky own-price elasticity of food for
selected countries in Table 2.10 The price elasticity of food is very low (suggesting that
the demand for food is inelastic). As the share of expenditure on food is high in emerging
markets, the price elasticity of food is higher in these economies. However, the overall
value of the price elasticity of food is much lower than what is used in the literature on
inflation targeting. Low price and income elasticities of the demand for food have
considerable significance for the choice of price index.


In order to examine the extent of credit constraints in emerging markets, in Table 3 we
present data on the percentage of the adult population with access to formal finance

7
  We looked at household surveys for each country in this table rather than the weight of food in
each country’s CPI index since those weights are changed only occasionally. However, data from
household surveys are available for only a few emerging markets. These data typically cover
expenditure on food consumed at home and don’t include expenditures on beverages and tobacco.
8
  A low income elasticity of demand also means that, as family income increases, consumption of
the commodity will not increase by much.
9
  The Slutsky own price elasticity is estimated by keeping real income constant.
10
   Frisch elasticity values lie between Slutsky and Cournot values and can be considered as an
average own price elasticity.
                                                 6


(measured by the share of the population using financial services) in emerging markets.
On average, more than half of the population in emerging markets does not have access
to the formal financial system.


Next, we examine the characteristics of core and headline inflation. We plot the levels
and volatility of inflation for selected advanced and emerging market economies (Figure
4-5). Values of average inflation, average volatility and the persistence of inflation (for
the period March 1991 – September 2009) are reported in Table 4. The two measures of
inflation have very different characteristics in advanced and emerging market economies.
Average inflation (both headline and core) has been higher in emerging market
economies during the period reported. Headline inflation is more volatile than core
inflation in both advanced and emerging market economies. However, the volatility of
both inflation measures is much higher in emerging markets. Core inflation has on
average been more than twice as volatile in emerging market economies compared to
advanced countries. The two measures of inflation exhibit a high degree of persistence in
both sets of economies.11


We also look at the evolution of two price indices over time. It is expected that they
would deviate from each other in the short run (as the core measure is constructed to
eliminate the fluctuations which do not reflect the underlying inflation developments).
However, since transitory shocks (shocks to food and energy) do not change the
underlying trend, headline inflation should return to its original level in a short period
(Mishkin, 2007). In other words, the headline inflation measure should not remain above
the core inflation measure for an extended period.




11
  In a cross-country study, Walsh (2010) finds that food price inflation is in fact more persistent
than non-food price inflation. This holds for both advanced and emerging market economies,
although he finds that food price inflation is more persistent in emerging markets.
                                                7


To verify this, we examine the two measures of inflation for two representative core
inflation targeting countries – Canada and Thailand.12 In Canada, in the period from the
spring of 1999 to the fall of 2001, headline inflation remained above core inflation for 30
months in succession (Figure 4a). In Thailand, headline inflation has remained above
core inflation for more than 5 consecutive years (Figure 5a). The core inflation measure
excludes a number of expenditure items and is less representative of the cost of living.
Thus, differences in the behavior of headline inflation (ostensibly a more accurate
measure of the cost of living) and core inflation over an extended period may have
important welfare implications.

3.      The Model
Our model builds upon a large literature that has developed and analyzed dynamic sticky
price models (Clarida, Gali and Gertler, 1999; Woodford, 1996; Rotemberg and
Woodford, 1997, 1999; Aoki, 2001). The model is rendered more realistic by
incorporating two features that are relevant to all economies but are particularly
important for emerging markets--a fraction of consumers who are credit constrained and
a subsistence level of food consumption. The model has two sectors and two goods—one
type of flexible price good, food ( C F ), whose prices adjust instantaneously, and a
continuum of monopolistically produced sticky price goods,
c( z ) indexed in z ! (0,1) which we call non-food and whose prices adjust sluggishly.13 In
the subsequent discussion, we interchangeably use the term food sector for the flexible
price sector and the term non-food sector for the sticky price sector.

3.1     Households

The economy is populated by a continuum of 1 + λ infinitely lived households,
where ! > 0 , is the continuum of households in the flexible price sector (food sector).
Each household owns a firm and produces one good. They provide labor to the firms in
their respective sector (we assume that labor is immobile across sectors) and consume
12
   Canada is an advanced economy that adopted IT in 1991 while Thailand, an emerging market
economy, adopted IT in 2000. Canada targets core inflation excluding food, energy and indirect
taxes. Thailand targets core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices.
13
   We model the sticky price sector by a continuum of monopolistic firms so that these firms have
market power and they can set prices. This is done to introduce price stickiness in this sector.

both the flexible price good (food) and all of the differentiated sticky price goods (non
food).14 The representative consumer, i, is indexed by f (flexible price sector) and s
(sticky price sector). Household i maximizes the discounted stream of utility

  We have assumed the immobility of labor for simplicity and to capture the large inter-sectoral
wage differential in emerging markets. Gali, Lopez-Salido and Valles (2004) have demonstrated
in their model that, even with free labor mobility, financial frictions lead to similar results as ours
(aggregate demand going up even when the central bank raises the policy interest rate).

θ >1 is the elasticity of substitution between any two differentiated goods, N ti is the

aggregate labor supplied by household i in period t and ! is the risk aversion factor
(inverse of elasticity of inter temporal substitution). The parameter ! is the inverse of
Frisch elasticity and ! n is a scaling factor.


The utility function used here is of a generalized Klein-Rubin form.15 This form is
selected to model the role of food in the economy. Since food is a necessity, households
must consume a minimum amount C* of food for survival.16 We assume that all
households always have enough income to buy the subsistence level of food. Even
though the subsistence level food consumption does not bind, it plays a vital role by
altering the elasticity of substitution between food and non-food and the marginal utility
of food and non-food consumption.

3.1.1 Flexible Price Sector (Food Sector) Households

Households in the flexible price sector (food sector) do not have access to financial
markets and they consume their wage income in each period.17 So these households are
akin to the “rule of thumb” consumers. Each household in the sector owns one firm and
produces food by linear technology in labor, given by


y f ,t = A f ,t N t f                                                             (5)


Af,t is a random productivity shock. Since we are interested in analyzing the effects of
sector-specific shocks rather than household-level idiosyncratic shocks, we assume that
all the households in the food sector face the same shock.


15
   Expenditure system corresponding to Klein-Rubin utility function is referred to as the Stone-
Geary linear expenditure system; Stone (1954) and Geary (1949).
16
   This is also similar to habit persistence with C* being independent of time.
17
   There is no storage technology in the model. So consumers in the flexible price sector cannot
smooth their consumption by saving their output. We have made this restrictive assumption to
keep the model tractable. Moreover, Table 3 shows that more than 50 percent of individuals in
emerging markets lack access to formal finance. Basu et al. (2005) have documented that 80
percent of individuals in India’s agricultural sector have no access to formal finance.

3.1.2 Sticky Price Sector (Non Food Sector) Households
Households in this sector can buy one period nominal bonds and smooth their
consumption. Each household owns a firm and provides labor to each firm in the sector.
They hold one share in each firm of the sector. Each firm uses a linear technology in
labor given by


yt ( z ) = As ,t N ts ( z )                                                   (6)


where yt (z ) is a sticky price good and N ts (z ) is the labor used in the firm producing

good indexed by z ( where z ! [0,1] ). As,t is a random productivity shock. We assume that
the shock is identical for all households in the non-food sector.

3.2        Consumption Decision

3.2.1 Food Sector Households (Credit Constrained Consumers)

All households in this sector face an identical budget constraint every period (as their
wage income is the same in every period). A representative household maximizes its
lifetime utility given by equation (1) subject to the budget constraint


Pf ,t C ff ,t + Ps ,t Csf,t = Wt f N t f                                      (7)


where Pf,t is the market price of food, Ps ,t is the price index of non-food (defined below)

and Wt f is the nominal wage in the food sector. The optimal allocation for a given level

of spending between food and all the differentiated non-food goods leads to a Dixit-
Stiglitz demand relation. The total expenditure to attain a consumption index C t f is given

by Pt C t f where Pt is defined as

3.2.2 Non Food Sector households (Unconstrained Consumers)
Each household in this sector provides labor to each one of the firms in the sector and
also holds one share in each firm. This setting is the one followed by Woodford (2003).18
In this setup, each household faces the same budget constraint each period and hence
chooses the same consumption stream. A representative household maximizes the
lifetime utility given by equation (1) subject to the following budget constraint


                  1                        1
Pt C ts + Bt = # Wt s ( z ) N ts ( z )dz + # " ts ( z )dz + Rt !1 Bt !1 ! Pf ,t C *          (15)

where Bt represents the quantity of one-period nominal riskfree discount bonds bought in

period t and maturing in period t+1 and Rt is the gross nominal interest rate between

period t and t+1. Wt s (z ) and N ts (z ) represent the nominal wage prevalent in firm z and

the amount of labor supplied to firm z by the household, respectively. ! ts (z ) is the profit

of firm z. Maximization with respect to C ts yields the Euler equation


                &            R #
(Cts ) () = *Et %(Cts+1 ) () t "                                                      (16)

                   Pt
where " t =             is gross headline inflation. The labor supply decision of the household
                  Pt !1
to a firm indexed by z is given by


     ( N ts ( z ))# Wt s ( z )
$n                 =                                                                  (17)
       (Cts ) !"      Pt



18
  Alternatively, we could use the other set up specified in Woodford (2003) in which each
household produces one of the differentiated products and there exist a complete range of
securities through which they can insure fully against idiosyncratic risks. In that formulation also,
each household will choose the same consumption stream and therefore the analysis will be the
same as in the present setting.

3.3.1 Firms in the Flexible Price Sector (Food Sector)

Firms are assumed to be price takers. Given a market price Pf ,t they set their price such

that


        Wt f
Pf ,t =                                                                     (21)

The supply function for the flexible price firm is obtained by combining equations (5),
(14) and (21), and is given by:

It can be considered as the total composite demand and hence equal to supply in
equilibrium.

" ! (0,1) of firms cannot change their price in each period. Firms are free to change the
price at time t; they choose a price X t to maximize the following objective function:

  Since the technology is linear, MCt,t+j = MCt+j That is, marginal cost is independent of the level
of production.

3.4         Inflation and Relative Prices
We define the relative prices as follows:
Pf ,t                                                 Ps ,t                                               Xt
          = x f ,t , relative price of food,                  = xs ,t , relative price of non-food; and         = xt ,

relative price charged by firms which are free to choose the price in time t. We define the
                                                     Pt
gross headline inflation as " t =                         , and gross inflation in the sticky price sector as
                                                    Pt !1

             Ps ,t
" s ,t =               . The relationship between headline and core inflation (inflation in the sticky
            Ps ,t !1

price sector) is given by:


            Ps ,t Ps ,t "1 Pt "1 ! s ,t x s ,t "1
x s ,t =                        =                                                                     (33)
           Ps ,t "1 Pt "1 Pt        !t


The system of equations in terms of stationary variables is presented in Appendix I.

3.5         Steady State
We characterize the steady state with constant prices (zero inflation) and no price
stickiness in the economy.20 This implies that ! t = 1 and ! s ,t = 1 for all t. Under

symmetric equilibrium, each firm faces the same demand and sets the same price. Thus,
                                                               "
X t = Ps ,t and xt = 1 . Therefore, xs ,t =                        MCtr . In the steady state, all firms set a price
                                                              " !1
which is a constant markup over the real marginal cost.21 We assume that productivity is
the same in both the sectors and normalize it to one.




20
   Our model exhibits monetary super-neutrality. Therefore, the level of steady state inflation does
not affect steady state values of real variables.
21
   We also compute the welfare gains when the steady state involves a tax rate which is set such
that the steady state level of output in the sticky price sector is efficient. All our results go
through under this alternative characterization of steady state.

3.6      Monetary Policy Rule

We assume that the monetary authority sets the short term nominal interest ( Rt )

according to a simple Taylor (1993) type rule of the following form


             _                  _                    _                _
log( Rt / R ) = ! i log( Rt $1 / R) + !" log(# t / # ) + ! y log(Yt / Y )           (34)
         _       _   _
where Y , ! and R are the steady state values of output, inflation and the nominal interest

rate, respectively. The term ! i represents the Central Banker’s preference for interest rate

smoothing. " ! and ! y are the weights on inflation and output gap assigned by the policy

makers.22 We characterize core inflation as the inflation in the sticky price sector, ! s,t ,

and headline inflation as the over all inflation, ! t , for our policy experiments.


We evaluate our model under the following monetary policy regimes:


Strict Core Inflation Targeting: The central bank cares only about interest rate smoothing
and stabilizing inflation in the sticky price sector.
             _                  _                         _
log( Rt / R ) = $ i log( Rt "1 / R) + $# log(! s ,t / ! s )                         (35)


Strict Headline Inflation Targeting: The central bank cares only about interest rate
smoothing and stabilizing headline inflation.
             _                   _                    _
 log( Rt / R ) = $ i log( Rt "1 / R) + $# log(! t / ! )                             (36)




22
   We include an interest rate smoothing parameter in our monetary policy rule as the benefits of
such smoothing are well documented in the literature (see, e.g., Lowe and Ellis, 1997; Sack and
Wieland, 1999). Various authors have argued that moving interest rates in small steps increases
its impact on the long-term interest rate; it also reduces the risks of policy mistakes and prevents
large capital losses and systemic financial risks. Mohanty and Klau (2004) find that all emerging
market central banks put substantial weight on interest rate smoothing. Clarida et al.(1998) find
that central banks of advanced economies also put a large weight on interest rate smoothing.

Flexible Core Inflation Targeting: The central bank cares about interest rate smoothing
and in addition to stabilizing sticky price inflation also tries to stabilize output by
assigning a weight to the output gap (deviation of output from trend).
            _                      _                            _                 _
log( Rt / R ) = ! i log( Rt $1 / R ) + !" log(# s ,t / # s ) + ! y log(Yt / Y )                        (37)


Flexible Headline Inflation Targeting: The central bank cares about interest rate
smoothing and in addition to stabilizing headline inflation also tries to stabilize output.
            _                      _                        _                 _
log( Rt / R ) = ! i log( Rt $1 / R) + !" log(# t / # ) + ! y log(Yt / Y )                              (38)


3.7       Exogenous Shock Process
We assume that the productivity in the flexible price sector and sticky price sector follow
AR(1) processes


A f ,t +1 = " af A f ,t + ! t   , ! t ~ i.i.d. (0, ! af )                                              (39)

As ,t +1 = " as As ,t + !t      , !t ~ i.i.d. (0, ! as )                                               (40)


In the literature, exclusion of food prices from the price index has been justified on the
ground that shocks to food (and energy) prices represent supply shocks. In order to
compare our model with those in the prior literature and also to highlight the role of
adverse supply shocks on the choice of price index, we focus on productivity shocks.

3.8       Competitive Equilibrium

A stationary competitive equilibrium is a set of processes
C tf , Cts , x f ,t , xs ,t , y f,t , ys, t , yt , ! s ,t , ! t , Rt , xt , mct for t = 0,1,… that remain bounded in

some neighborhood around the deterministic steady state and satisfy equations (52) – (62)
of Appendix I, given the exogenous stochastic processes A f ,t , As ,t and the monetary

policy rule given by equation (34).

3.9      Complete Markets Specification
We follow the setting of Aoki (2001) to study the choice of price index under complete
markets. In this setting all households can insure one another against idiosyncratic
income risks completely. It implies that given same initial wealth each household will
choose an identical consumption sequence.23 Thus, under this complete markets setting


                  Ct   Y
Ct f = Cts =         = t                                                           (41)
                 1+ ! 1+ !


and aggregate demand is given by


          ./
- Yt *                 &- Y * ./ Rt #
+     (          = 1Et $+ t +1 (        !                                          (42)
,1+ 0 )                $%, 1 + 0 ) ' t !"


Equations (53), (55)-(61) of Appendix I and (41)-(42) define the system of equations that
combined with the monetary policy rule and exogenous stochastic processes A f ,t and As ,t

determine the equilibrium path of the economy in the complete markets setting.

3.10     Welfare Evaluations
We are interested in the choice of policy rule that yields the highest level of lifetime utility
within the class of policy rules considered.24 In particular, we evaluate policy rules
according to the value of lifetime utility:

          !
Vt i # Et " $ jU (Cti+ j , N ti+ j ) for i = f,s                                   (43)
          j =0




We compute the total welfare of the economy as a weighted sum of households’ welfare

23
   Insurance contracts are assumed to be written before households know which sector they are
assigned to. The insurance contracts make the marginal utility of nominal income identical across
the households at any time t.
24
   We study the policy rule which is implementable and optimal as defined by Schmitt-Grohe and
Uribe (2007). Implementability refers to the local uniqueness of rational expectations equilibrium
while optimality means that it yields the highest lifetime utility within the class of policy rules
considered.
                                                   20


Vtotal = ! *Vt f + Vt s . Formally, we compute Vtotal associated with each policy rule and look

for a policy rule that yields the highest value of Vtotal .

3.11    Solution Method

Following Kydland and Prescott (1982) and King, Plosser and Rebelo (1988), it has
become commonplace to characterize the solution of nonlinear models using
approximation methods, with first-order approximation techniques being the norm.
However, it is now widely accepted that first-order approximation techniques are ill-
suited for the comparison of different policy environments using aggregate utility as a
welfare criterion.25 To enable accurate welfare comparisons across alternative policy
environments, we need at least a second-order approximation of the equilibrium welfare
function (Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe, 2004; Woodford, 2003).26


In recent years, scholars have come up with various methods to produce second-order
accurate approximation to the solutions of DSGE models. Jin and Judd (2002), Collard
and Juillard (2000) and Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2004) have used the perturbation
method for second-order and higher-order approximations. Kim and Kim (2003) and
Sutherland (2002) have developed the bias correction method that produces similar
results as the second order perturbation method.


We compute the second-order accurate consumer welfare measure with different
monetary policy regimes as in Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2004). To produce an accurate
second-order approximation of the welfare function, we use a second-order
approximation to the policy function. The policy function is approximated using the
perturbation method by employing a scale parameter for the standard deviations of the
exogenous shocks as an argument of the policy function and taking a second-order Taylor
expansion with respect to the state variables as well as the scale parameter. We use an

25
   Up to a first-order approximation, lifetime utility, Vt, is equal to its non-stochastic steady state
value. Hence, given the same non-stochastic steady state, all policy rules yield the same amount
of welfare up to a first-order approximation (Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe, 2007).
26
  See Kim and Kim (2003). However, if one is sure that nonlinearity is small in certain
dimensions one can justify using a first-order approximation by making specific assumptions,
Woodford (2003).

approximation algorithm developed by Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2004) with suitable
modifications.

3.12    Measuring Welfare Gains

Strict core inflation targeting is regarded as the welfare maximizing policy rule in the
literature. Therefore, we evaluate the welfare gains associated with a particular policy
regime by comparing it to the strict core inflation targeting rule allocation. Let the strict
core inflation targeting rule allocation be denoted by r, and an alternative policy regime
be denoted by a. We define the welfare associated with the core allocation conditional on
the economy being at its non-stochastic steady state at time zero:


           "
V0r = E0 ! # tU (Ctr , N tr )                                                  (44)
          t =0




where Ctr and N tr are the consumption and hours of work under the strict core inflation

targeting policy rule. Similarly, the conditional welfare under the alternative regime a is
defined as


           "
V0a = E0 ! # tU (Cta , N ta )                                                  (45)
          t =0




The use of the conditional rather than unconditional expectation is consistent with the
approach followed by Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2007) and Kollman (2004). The use of
the conditional expectation is preferable in our framework given that different policy
regimes will typically have different stochastic steady states even though their non-
stochastic states are identical. Hence, as pointed out by Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe (2007),
the unconditional expectation of utility ignores the transitional dynamics leading to the
stochastic steady state. As a result, we follow the procedure of conditioning our
calculation of expected utility on the fact that the economy starts from its non-stochastic
steady state.
                                             22


In order to evaluate the welfare implications of a particular policy regime, we calculate
the fraction of a consumer’s consumption that would make them indifferent between
regimes. Let ! be the welfare gain of adopting an alternative policy rule other than strict
core inflation targeting. We define ! as a fraction of additional strict core inflation
targeting regime’s consumption process that would make a household as well off under
regime a as under strict core inflation targeting regime. Then


           $
V0a = E0 # " tU ((1 + ! )Ctr , N tr )                                         (46)
          t =0




Under this specification, a positive value of ! means that welfare is higher under the
alternative policy rule. Rearranging equation (46), the welfare gain ! is given by


                   1
    'V a + D0r $ 1!(
) = % 0r     r "
                     !1                                                       (47)
    & V0 + D0 #



          r
                  '! N r 1+* $!
                   (
                        t    ( )
where D = E0 ) , &+n t
          0                   #                                               (48)
             t =0  !% 1 +* !"


A value of ! *100 = 1, represents a one percentage point of permanent consumption gain
under the alternative policy regime.


We study the choice of the optimal price index under two market settings–(i) complete
markets (similar to Rotemberg and Woodford, 1997; Aoki, 2001) and (ii) an incomplete
market structure characterized by the presence of ‘rule of thumb’ consumers (similar to
Gali, Lopez-Salido and Valles, 2004). We compute the welfare gains associated with the
four monetary policy regimes defined by equations (35)-(38).

3.13    Parameter Selection
Parameter selection for the model is a challenging task. There is no consensus on the
values of some parameters. Moreover, most of the parameters used in the literature are
based on micro data from advanced countries. Hence, our approach will be to pick
baseline parameters from the existing literature and to then do extensive sensitivity
analysis with respect to the choice of key parameters.


We choose ! =0.9902, which amounts to an annual real interest rate of 4 percent
(Prescott, 1986). We assume that ! =1 (that is, we have one representative consumer in
each sector, similar to Aoki, 2001). We use ! =2 as the baseline value of the risk
aversion parameter, (i.e., the intertemporal elasticity of substitution is 0.5). This is in the
range of values usually assumed in DSGE models and is also the most common value
used in the literature on emerging markets (Aguair and Gopinath, 2005; Schmitt-Grohe
and Uribe, 2007; Devereux, Lane and Xu, 2004).27


Following Chari, Kehoe and MacGrattan (1999), Basu and Fernald (1994, 1995), Basu
and Kimball (1997) and Basu (1996), we choose ! =10 (elasticity of substitution between
different differentiated goods), which implies a markup of 11 percent. Next, we set the
probability that a price does not adjust in a given period ( ! ) at 0.66 (Ferrero, Gertler,
Svensson, 2008; Rotemberg and Woodford, 1997). This implies that prices remain fixed
for a mean duration of 3 quarters, which is consistent with the micro evidence.

The appropriate value of the Frisch elasticity (         ) is both important and controversial.

The range of values used in the literature goes from 0.25 to 1.28 For our benchmark case
we assume it to be 0.33 (! =3). We choose the scaling parameter ! n such that the average


27
   Friend and Blume (1975) present empirical evidence suggesting that its value is around 2 for
industrial countries. Other estimates for these countries suggests that it lies between 0 and 5 (e.g.,
Hansen and Singleton, 1983; Dunn and Singleton, 1986).
28
   Christiano, Eichenbaum and Evans (1996) estimate it to be 0.25 while Rotemberg and
Woodford (1997) estimate it to be 0.40. Blundell and MaCurdy (1999) estimate the intertemporal
elasticity of labor supply to be in the range of [0.5, 1].
                                                 24


hours worked in the steady state is 0.38. The elasticity of substitution between food and
non-food goods, ! , is another parameter for which we don’t have a good approximation.
As the demand for food is inelastic, we set ! = 0.6 for the baseline case.29


One important feature of emerging markets is the high share of expenditure on food in
total household expenditure. Based on the household surveys from emerging markets,
the average expenditure on food is around 42 percent (see Table 1). In addition, we
assume that on average half of the households’ steady state food consumption is required
for subsistence.30 To match these values in the baseline model we choose subsistence
level food consumption parameter, C * =0.1013 and the weight on food in the
consumption index, ! equal to 0.3050 so that the steady state average household
expenditure on food is 42%. For the monetary policy parameters, we follow Woodford
(2003), Gali et al. (2004) and Mohanty and Klau (2004) and choose ! i = 0.7, " ! = 2 and

! Y = 0.5.

The major argument in favor of excluding food from the core price index is that the
shocks in that sector are seasonal and transient. We choose the value of AR(1) coefficient
of the food sector shock at 0.25 (implying that the shock lasts for four quarters, which
seems reasonable given the heavy dependence of agriculture on weather conditions in
emerging markets). Following the literature, we set the value of the AR(1) coefficient of
the non-food sector shock at 0.95 (Aguair and Gopinath, 2007; Schmitt-Grohe and
Uribe, 2007). Volatility of productivity shocks in emerging markets is higher than in
advanced countries (Pallage and Robe, 2003; Aguair and Gopinath, 2007). We choose the
standard deviation of food productivity shock, ! af =0.03 and the standard deviation of

non-food productivity shock, ! as =0.02.31 Table 5 shows a full set of baseline parameter

values for the calibrations.

29
   With the subsistence level of food consumption, this parameter choice implies a price elasticity
of demand for food of about -0.3 in the steady state, which is close to the USDA estimate.
30
   Naik and Moore (1996) find that about 50 percent of current consumption is due to habit
formation in food consumption.
31
   For advanced countries like the U.S., the values typically used in the literature are in the range
of 0.005 to 0.009.

4.      Baseline Results
We present the results in terms of the conditional welfare gains associated with each
policy choice. Welfare gains are defined as additional lifetime consumption needed to
make the level of welfare under strict core inflation targeting identical to that under the
evaluated policy. Thus, a positive number indicates that welfare is higher under the
alternative policy than under strict core inflation targeting policy. The choice of strict
core inflation targeting as a benchmark for comparison is motivated by the fact that in the
literature it is considered the optimal policy choice for maximizing welfare. We present
the results for three alternative policy regimes – strict headline inflation targeting,
flexible headline inflation targeting and flexible core inflation targeting as defined by
equations (35)-(38).


Table 6 shows the welfare gains from targeting different price indices under complete
and incomplete market settings. Under complete markets, the choice of targeting strict
core inflation is the best policy. Figure 6 plots the impulse responses of various
macroeconomic variables to a one percent negative food productivity shock under
complete markets. Each variable’s response is expressed as the percentage deviation from
its steady state level. Impulse responses under strict core inflation targeting rule are
shown in red. The dashed lines (in blue) are impulse responses under the strict headline
inflation targeting rule.32 As evident, strict headline inflation targeting regime results in a
higher volatility of consumption and output. Also, the policy response is more aggressive
under strict headline inflation targeting which leads to a further decline in output. These
results are similar to the ones documented in the existing literature on inflation targeting.


Following an increase in inflation, the central bank raises interest rates, reducing
aggregate demand (as consumers postpone their consumption following an increase in
interest rates) and, thus, inflation. So, under complete markets, inflation and output move
in the same direction and therefore stabilizing inflation is equivalent to stabilizing output


32
  We only plot the impulse responses under strict core inflation targeting and strict headline
inflation targeting rules as the welfare losses are much higher under other two policy regimes
(Table 6).
                                                  26


(Aoki, 2001). It also implies that there are no additional welfare gains by adopting
flexible inflation targeting. Thus, under complete markets, strict core inflation targeting is
the welfare maximizing policy choice for the central bank.


However, in the presence of credit constrained consumers, flexible headline inflation
targeting appears to be a better policy choice. Figure 7 plots the impulse responses of
various macroeconomic variables to a one percent negative food productivity shock.33
Aggregate demand responds differently to monetary tightening under the two policy
regimes. The central bank is able to reduce aggregate demand by increasing interest rates
only when it targets headline inflation. Aggregate demand, instead of going down, goes
up if central bank follows strict core inflation targeting. Thus, headline inflation targeting
(both strict and flexible) outperforms strict core inflation targeting. Since in the presence
of financial frictions inflation and output may move in opposite directions in response to
interest rate changes, stabilizing output results in welfare gains. Thus, flexible headline
inflation targeting is the optimal policy choice when markets are not complete.


In order to examine the mechanics behind this result, we look at the properties of
aggregate demand under incomplete markets. In the presence of financial frictions, the
consumption choices of different households vary (as opposed to complete markets,
where the consumption choice of each household is identical). While consumption
demand of unconstrained households is responsive to interest rates (as they optimize
inter-temporally), consumption demand of credit-constrained households is independent
of interest rate changes (their horizon is static and they consume their entire income each
period) and depends only on their current period wage income. Since only a fraction of
aggregate demand is influenced by interest rate changes, a monetary tightening does not
automatically result in the decline of aggregate demand. The response of aggregate
demand crucially depends on the behavior of credit-constrained households.




33
  We only plot the impulse responses under strict core inflation targeting and flexible headline
inflation targeting rules. The welfare gains relative to core inflation targeting are also positive but
lower under the other two policy rules (Table 6).
                                                              27


Figure 7 shows that, following a negative shock to food productivity, the central bank
raises the interest rate which lowers the demand of unconstrained households (as it is
optimal for them to postpone consumption). However, it has no bearing on the demand of
credit-constrained consumers. An increase in the relative price of food following a
negative food productivity shock increases the wage income and, therefore, consumption
demand of credit-constrained households. Thus, the demand of the two types of
households moves in opposite directions following a negative shock to food productivity.


Which of the two demands dominates is determined by the policy regime. Since core
inflation targeting ignores food price inflation, the increase in food prices (and, therefore,
the wage income of the food sector households) is higher than the increase under headline
inflation targeting. This higher wage income translates into higher consumption demand
by credit-constrained consumers (as they consume all of their current wage income),
which more than compensates for the lower consumption demand of unconstrained
consumers. Consequently, aggregate demand rises. By contrast, when the central bank
targets headline inflation, price increases in the food sector are much lower and the rise in
income and, therefore, the increase in consumption demand in that sector is not enough to
compensate for the decline in the demand of unconstrained consumers. Thus, monetary
intervention is effective in achieving its objective of reducing aggregate demand only
when the central bank targets flexible headline inflation.


To formalize the above arguments, we examine the log-linearized aggregate demand
equation, which is given by34

Equations (50) and (51) suggest that, in the presence of credit-constrained consumers, a
link is established between aggregate demand and the relative price of food. This is
because, in the presence of financial frictions, relative prices affect aggregate demand in
addition to aggregate supply.35 Thus, the presence of financial frictions implies that
managing aggregate demand requires the central bank to choose a policy regime that
would limit the rise in wages of credit-constrained consumers (and, therefore, the
increase in their demand).

4.1        Welfare Distribution
The focus of our paper is on average welfare but the incomplete markets setting allows us
to look at the welfare distribution in the economy. We do not report those results in detail
here but note that in our model flexible headline inflation targeting is better for both the
credit-constrained households and unconstrained households. Since there is no tradeoff
involved in terms of welfare of the two groups, the central bank is not likely to face any
political pressures in implementing this policy.

5.         Sensitivity Analysis
Our main result is that in the presence of financial frictions flexible headline inflation
targeting is the welfare-maximizing policy choice. In this section, we evaluate the

     Under complete markets, relative prices only affect aggregate supply (Aoki, 2001).

robustness of this result to changes in some of the key parameters – the elasticity of
substitution between food and non-food goods (! ), inverse of Frisch elasticity (! ), the
degree of price stickiness ( ! ), the elasticity of substitution between different non-food
goods which determines the mark-up in the sticky price sector ( ! ), and the proportion of
credit-constrained households in the economy ( ! ). We conduct additional sensitivity
analysis with respect to the persistence and volatility of the food productivity shock and
Taylor rule coefficients. When interpreting the results it should be noted that, since the
steady state values of the models differ, it is only possible to make a comparison across
regimes and not across different models.


Our key results are driven by the behavior of credit-constrained consumers. Since the
wage income of constrained consumers depends crucially on the price elasticity of the
demand for food, we first conduct sensitivity analysis with respect to parameters
influencing the price elasticity of demand. The presence of a subsistence level for food
expenditures affects the marginal utility of food and non-food consumption. It also
lowers the elasticity of substitution between food and non-food. The demand for food is
given by equation (23), which is the sum of an iso-elastic term " ( x f ,t ) #! Ct and a price

inelastic term (1 + ! )C * . The price elasticity of demand is a weighted sum of these two
terms (the weights are ! and zero, respectively). Thus, the presence of subsistence food
consumption lowers the price elasticity of the demand for food. Table 7 shows welfare
gains from different policy rules in the absence of a subsistence level of food
consumption. Clearly, our main result does not depend on the presence of subsistence
level of food consumption.


Next, we examine the sensitivity of the results to the elasticity of substitution between
food and non-food goods, denoted by ! (Table 8). Under complete markets, core
inflation targeting is the most appropriate policy choice for any value of the elasticity of
substitution. However, under incomplete markets, flexible headline inflation targeting
continues to dominate other policies for values of the elasticity as high as ! = 0.8. For
higher values of this elasticity, strict core inflation targeting seems to do marginally better
                                               30


than strict headline inflation targeting. The difference between strict core inflation
targeting and strict headline inflation targeting is almost negligible for higher values of
this elasticity.


The elasticity of substitution is an important parameter determining the income of credit-
constrained households. For low values of the elasticity of substitution, following a
negative shock to productivity of food the demand for food does not go down
substantially and leads to a large increase in the wage income of food-producing (credit-
constrained) households. Increased demand of credit-constrained consumers is enough to
counteract the decline in the demand of unconstrained households. However, when the
elasticity of substitution is high, demand for food goes down substantially and the
increase in the income and demand of credit-constrained households is no longer
sufficient to compensate for the decline in the demand of unconstrained households. In
fact, for sufficiently high values of the elasticity of substitution, the wage income of
credit-constrained households may even go down.


Again, even though we cannot strictly compare the impulse responses, it is instructive to
plot them for different values of the elasticity of substitution to understand how varying
the elasticity of substitution affects various macroeconomic variables. Figure 8 shows the
impulse responses of various macroeconomic variables to a 1 percent negative food
productivity shock under flexible headline inflation targeting for a high value of the
elasticity of substitution (! = 2 ) and also a low value ( ! = 0.6). For low values of the
elasticity of substitution, a positive deviation (from the respective steady state) in the food
price and wage of credit-constrained households is large. When the elasticity of substitution
is high, the wage of credit-constrained consumers in fact declines relative to the steady state
value (as the increase in the price of food is significantly lower).


In Tables 9-12, we present the results of sensitivity analysis with respect to the inverse of
the Frisch elasticity (! ), price stickiness ( ! ), fraction of credit-constrained households
( ! ) and the mark-up in the sticky price sector ( ! ). We have selected the most common
values of these parameters used in the literature to carry out the sensitivity experiments.
                                                31


Our results appear robust to the selection of parameter values around their baseline
values.


Following Gali et al. (2004), we conduct sensitivity analysis with respect to the coefficients
of the Taylor rule (Table 13). Flexible headline inflation targeting performs better than other
regimes irrespective of the choice of Taylor rule coefficients. We also compute the Taylor
rule parameters associated with optimal strict core inflation targeting under the baseline case
and compare the welfare gains associated with adopting flexible headline inflation
targeting.36 We find that the welfare gains are still positive.


Shocks to productivity in the food sector are regarded as transitory and highly volatile. So
we do additional sensitivity analysis for various combinations of the degrees of persistence
and volatility of these shocks. From the results shown in Table 14, it is evident that our
results are robust to various combinations and also that welfare gains from adopting flexible
headline targeting are even higher if shocks are less persistent and highly volatile. Of
course, in the case of an advanced economy like the U.S. where the volatility of these
shocks is an order of magnitude smaller than in typical emerging markets, the potential
welfare gains are considerably smaller.

5.1 Extensions of the Model

We consider two extensions of our baseline model. The first extension looks at an
alternative characterization of complete markets. Most existing models with complete
markets assume that agents can insure against income risks ex ante. In other words,
insurance contracts are written before households know which sector they are in (see,
e.g., Aoki, 2001). This assumption implies that, given the same initial wealth, consumers
will choose identical consumption streams. A more realistic way of characterizing
complete markets is to assume that consumers can insure against income risks but only
after being assigned to a particular sector. One could regard this as a complete market


36
  For computing optimal parameters, we restrict our search to [0,3] for "! and [0,1] for ! i . We
find that the best rule requires "! = 3 and ! i = 0.95. The value of "! is the largest value that we
allow for in our search. If we left this parameter unconstrained, then optimal policy would call for
an arbitrarily large coefficient on inflation. The reason is that in that case, under the optimal
policy, inflation would in effect be forever constant so that the economy would be characterized
by zero inflation volatility (Schmitt-Grohe and Uribe, 2007).
                                               32


setting conditional on worker assignment to sectors, which is determined ex-ante (before
insurance contracts are written). In other words, a household cannot insure against cross-
sector income risk. Under this alternate market structure, each type of household chooses
a consumption stream to maximize its lifetime utility subject to its idiosyncratic budget
constraint (see Appendix III for more details). In Table 15, we present the welfare gains
under this market structure and with flexible headline inflation targeting. It appears that,
for our baseline model, flexible headline inflation targeting does better than strict core
inflation targeting. However, for higher values of the elasticity of substitution between
food and nonfood goods, the welfare gains are essentially zero.


A second extension of our baseline model looks at a more general case where agents in
both sectors can be credit constrained. We assume that a fraction !1 > 0 and !2 > 0 of
households in the flexible price sector and sticky price sector, respectively, can insure
against income risks ex post.37 We look at combinations of !1 and !2 such that 50 percent
of the households in the economy are credit constrained.38 Table 16 presents the welfare
gains of pursuing flexible headline inflation targeting for some possible combinations of
!1 and !2 . It is clear that even under this general setting targeting flexible headline
inflation outperforms a strict core inflation targeting rule.

6.      Concluding Remarks
Inflation targeting, which had become widely popular in both advanced and emerging
market economies over the last two decades, has come under attack after the global
financial crisis as it is believed to leave no room for central bankers to pay attention to
asset price bubbles. Whatever the outcome of that broader debate, the reality is that the
primary objective of most central banks, whether or not they explicitly target inflation, is
still to keep inflation low and stable. To achieve this objective, the choice of the
appropriate price index to measure inflation remains a key operational issue. Previous
research has indicated that central banks should only focus on stabilizing core inflation.

37
  This implies that 1 + ! " (!1 + ! 2 ) fraction of households are credit constrained.
38
  This is consistent with the empirical evidence that only about 42 percent of households in
emerging markets have access to formal finance (Table 3).
                                             33


However, these results rely heavily on the assumption that markets are complete and that
price stickiness is the only source of distortion in the economy.


In this paper, we have developed a more realistic model with the following key features –
incomplete markets, characterized by the presence of credit-constrained consumers;
households requiring a minimum subsistence level of food to survive; low price elasticity
of demand for food items and a high share of expenditure on food in households’ total
expenditure. These features, particularly the last one, are especially relevant for emerging
market economies.


We show that, in the presence of credit-constrained consumers, targeting core inflation is
no longer welfare maximizing. Also, stabilizing inflation is not sufficient to stabilize
output when markets are not complete. Under these conditions, flexible headline inflation
targeting—which involves targeting headline inflation and putting some weight on the
output gap--is the optimal monetary policy rule.


Our results differ from those of traditional models due to the presence of financial
frictions in the economy. Lack of access to finance makes the demand of credit-
constrained households insensitive to interest rate fluctuations. Their demand is
determined by real wages, which depend on prices in the flexible price sector. Thus, if the
central bank ignores fluctuations in the flexible price sector, aggregate demand may in
fact move in the opposite direction to what is intended by the monetary policy
intervention. To have the desired effect on aggregate demand, the central bank has to
target a price index that would dampen the response of credit-constrained consumers. In
our setting, this means that the central bank should target headline inflation.


Our results have special significance for central banks in emerging markets, where food
consumption remains a major component of household consumption expenditures and the
share of the population that is credit-constrained is large. While our model is a simple
one, it amply highlights the significance of financial frictions for the choice of optimal
price index and the optimal monetary policy rule. The widely accepted result of focusing
                                                    34


on core CPI in order to stabilize inflation and output needs a careful re-examination in the
presence of financial frictions.39




39
  In related work, Catao and Chang (2010) show that, for a small open economy that is a net buyer of food,
the high volatility of world food prices implies that headline CPI inflation targeting is welfare improving
relative to core CPI targeting.

Notes: Core index for USA is defined as CPI excluding food and energy while for Canada it is
defined as CPI excluding food, energy and indirect taxes. Inflation is year-on-year inflation
calculated using quarterly price index. Volatility is measured as the standard deviation of inflation
using a rolling 20-quarter (5-year) window. We also computed the volatility using 8-year and 10-
year rolling windows and the results were similar.

Notes: Core index for Korea is defined as CPI excluding agricultural products and oil while for
Thailand it is defined as CPI excluding unprocessed food and energy. Inflation is year-on-year
inflation using quarterly price index. Volatility is measured as the standard deviation of inflation
using a rolling 20-quarter (5-year) window. We also computed the volatility using 8-year and 10-
year rolling windows and the results were similar.

              (Complete Markets, with subsistence level food consumption)




Notes: Each variable’s response is expressed as the percentage deviation from its steady state
level. Strict core inflation targeting means that central bank follows the policy regime given by
equation (35). Strict headline inflation targeting means that central bank follows the policy
regime given by equation (36).

Note: Core price index in USA excludes food and energy from the CPI while in Canada it
excludes indirect taxes in addition to food and energy. Thailand’s core index excludes
unprocessed food and energy while in Korea it excludes agricultural products and oil. Inflation is
year-on-year inflation rate calculated using a quarterly price index. Volatility is measured as the
standard deviation of inflation using a rolling 20 quarter (5 year) window. Persistence parameter
is the estimated co-efficient from a simple AR(1) model. The symbol *** indicates statistical
significance at the 1% level. Newey-West corrected standard errors (for MA(3) correction) are
reported in brackets.

Notes: Welfare gains ( ! *100) are defined as the percent increase in the strict core inflation
targeting consumption process necessary to make the level of welfare under strict core inflation
targeting policy identical to that under the evaluated policy. Thus, a positive number indicates
that welfare is higher under the alternative policy than under the strict core inflation targeting
policy. Targeting policy rules are defined in equations (35) - (38).

Notes: See notes to table 6. Persistence of food productivity is the estimated coefficient of AR(1)
process in equation (39). Volatility of food productivity shock is the standard deviation of random
shocks to productivity. Persistence and volatility of non-food shocks is held constant at 0.95 and
0.02, respectively, in the above welfare cost calculations.

A. Alternative Structure of Complete Markets

We consider a setting in which consumers can write contracts to insure against
idiosyncratic income risks but only after being assigned to a particular sector. One could
regard this as a complete market setting conditional on worker assignment to sectors,
which is determined ex-ante (before insurance contracts are written). In other words, a
household cannot insure against cross-sector income risk.

Households in the Flexible Price Sector

by equation (1) subject to the following budget constraint40

where Bt f is the quantity of one-period nominal riskfree discount bonds bought in period t
and maturing in period t+1. Maximization with respect to Ct f yields the Euler equation

Equations (53), (55)-(62) of Appendix I and (63)-(67) expressed in terms of stationary
variables define the system of equations that, combined with the monetary policy rule and
exogenous stochastic processes for A f ,t and As ,t , determine the equilibrium path of the
economy under this setting.

B. General Case with Credit-Constrained Households in Each Sector

We consider a more general case where households in each sector can be credit
constrained. Let !1 > 0 and !2 > 0 be the fractions of households that have access to
financial markets in the flexible price sector and in the sticky price sector, respectively.
So in this general setting there are four different kinds of agents in the economy based on
the sector of economy and access to financial markets. Here again we assume that
households with access to financial markets can only insure against income risks ex post.

Equations (55), (56), (60), (61) of Appendix I and (68), (69), (71), (73), (74), (76), (78)-
(87) expressed in terms of stationary variables define the system of equations that,
combined with the monetary policy rule and exogenous stochastic processes for A f ,t
and As ,t , determine the equilibrium path of the economy under this general setting.
