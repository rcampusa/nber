                                             ABSTRACT

In this paper, we perform a structural Bayesian estimation of the contribution of anticipated shocks
to business cycles in the postwar United States. Our theoretical framework is a real-business-cycle
model augmented with four real rigidities: investment adjustment costs, variable capacity utilization,
habit formation in consumption, and habit formation in leisure. Business cycles are assumed to be
driven by permanent and stationary neutral productivity shocks, permanent investment-specific shocks,
and government spending shocks. Each of these shocks is buffeted by four types of structural innovations:
unanticipated innovations and innovations anticipated one, two, and three quarters in advance. We
find that anticipated shocks account for more than two thirds of predicted aggregate fluctuations. This
result is robust to estimating a variant of the model featuring a parametric wealth elasticity of labor
supply.

1    Introduction
How important are anticipated shocks as a source of economic fluctuations? What type
of anticipated shock is important? How many quarters in advance are the main drivers
of business cycles anticipated? The central goal of this paper is to present a model-based
econometric answer to these questions.
   Specifically, we formulate a dynamic, stochastic, general equilibrium (DSGE) model of
the U.S. economy driven by a large number of unanticipated and anticipated shocks. We
then apply Bayesian methods to estimate the parameters defining the stochastic processes of
these shocks and other structural parameters. The resulting estimated DSGE model allows
us to perform variance decompositions to identify what fraction of aggregate fluctuations
can be accounted for by anticipated shocks.
    Our assumed theoretical environment is a real-business-cycle model augmented with four
real rigidities: internal habit formation in consumption, internal habit formation in leisure,
investment adjustment costs, and variable capacity utilization. In incorporating these fric-
tions into our equilibrium business-cycle model, we are guided by a large existing literature
showing that these frictions improve the model’s empirical fit. Our model is assumed to be
driven by four structural shocks. Namely, stationary neutral productivity shocks, nonsta-
tionary neutral productivity shocks, nonstationary investment-specific productivity shocks,
and government spending shocks.
    The novel element in our theoretical formulation is the assumption that each of the four
structural shocks features an anticipated component and an unanticipated component. The
anticipated component is, in turn, driven by innovations announced one, two, or three quar-
ters in advance. We estimate the model using Bayesian methods on U.S. postwar quarterly
data.
   We find that anticipated shocks are the most important source of uncertainty: They
explain about two thirds of the variance of output, consumption, investment, and hours
worked. Moreover, our results suggest that what matters most are anticipated changes in the
future path of total factor productivity (TFP). Indeed, anticipated shocks to the permanent
and stationary components of total factor productivity jointly explain more than two thirds
of the variance of output growth. By contrast anticipated movements in investment-specific
productivity or government spending play virtually no role in driving business cycles.
    We find that in response to the most important estimated anticipated shock, namely,
anticipated stationary changes in productivity, output, consumption, investment, and hours
all increase. The increase in hours is driven by a sharp increase in capacity utilization, which
drives up the marginal product of labor, thereby boosting labor demand. In response to the
second most important anticipated shock, namely anticipated changes in the permanent
component of TFP, we find that output, investment, and consumption comove, which is
in line with the empirical evidence presented in Beaudry and Portier (2006). However,
contrary to the empirical evidence presented by these authors, our estimated model predicts
a contraction in hours worked in response to an anticipated permanent increase in TFP.
   The predicted contraction in hours is the consequence of a positive wealth effect induced
by the expected future increase in TFP, which elevates the demand for leisure. In a recent
theoretical paper, Jaimovich and Rebelo (2008) emphasize that one way to produce posi-
tive comovement of output, consumption, investment, and hours in response to permanent
expected future changes in TFP is to assume a preference specification that minimizes the
wealth elasticity of labor supply as in Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Huffman (1988). Jaimovich
and Rebelo generalize the Greenwood et al. preference specification by introducing a para-
meter that controls the strength of the wealth elasticity of labor supply. We estimate a
variant of our model that incorporates preferences of the type suggested by Jaimovich and
Rebelo and find a near-zero wealth elasticity of labor supply. Also, our estimates indicate
that under this preference specification anticipated shocks explain the majority of aggregate
fluctuations at business-cycle frequency. This result is in accordance with those obtained
under our baseline preference specification. Furthermore, our estimate of the model with
Jaimovich-Rebelo preferences improves over the baseline model in that it predicts an in-
crease in hours in response to an anticipated permanent change in total factor productivity.
   The idea that changes in expectations about the future path of exogenous economic
fundamentals may represent an important source of aggregate fluctuations has a long history
in economics, going back at least to Pigou (1927). Recently, these ideas have been revived in
an important paper by Beaudry and Portier (2006). These authors propose an identification
scheme for uncovering anticipated shocks in the context of a vector error correction model
for total factor productivity and stock prices. Beaudry and Portier’s findings suggest that
innovations in the growth rate of total factor productivity are to a large extent anticipated.
Moreover, the anticipated shock they identify explains more than half of the forecast error
variance of consumption, output, and hours.
   Our approach to estimating the importance of anticipated shocks as a source of business-
cycle fluctuations departs from that of Beaudry and Portier in two important dimensions:
first our estimation is based on a formal dynamic, stochastic, optimizing, rational expecta-
tions model. Second, we employ a full information econometric approach to estimation. This
strategy allows us to identify a larger set of anticipated disturbances than does the VECM
approach of Beaudry and Portier. In particular, it allows us to identify not only anticipated
changes in the growth rate of total factor productivity, but also other anticipated sources


                                              1
of economic fluctuations, such as anticipated changes in the stationary component of total
factor productivity, in government spending, and in the growth rate of the relative price of
investment. This turns out to be an important distinction. For we find that, although news
about the nonstationary component of total factor productivity are a significant source of
business cycles, as suggested by the work of Beaudry and Portier, so are news about future
expected changes in the stationary component of total factor productivity. An additional
advantage of our estimation strategy is that it allows us to identify the length of anticipation
for each source of disturbance. For example, we find that stationary changes in productivity
are for the most part anticipated three quarters in advance, whereas nonstationary changes
in productivity are estimated to be learned only one quarter in advance.
   In this paper, we draw an important distinction between the effect of anticipated shocks
and the pure anticipation effect. This distinction is in order because anticipated shocks
eventually materialize in actual changes in exogenous economic fundamentals. In computing
aggregate volatilities in an economy buffeted by anticipated shocks, one necessarily puts
in the same bag the economic effects triggered by anticipation and the economic effects
triggered by the eventual realization of the anticipated shocks. To disentangle these two
effects, we define the pure anticipation effect as the difference between the volatilities of
two economies that differ only in the information set available to economic agents. In one
economy agents are able to anticipate some components of future changes in exogenous
economic fundamentals, whereas in the other economy agents are unable to do so. We find
that at short horizons the pure anticipation effect is significant. In particular, we show that
the variance of forecasting errors at horizons below 8 quarters can be remarkably different
in the economies with and without anticipation. We also find that in the long run, the pure
anticipation effect is small.
   The present paper is related to Davis (2007) who in independent and contemporaneous
work estimates the effect of anticipated shocks in a model with nominal rigidities. He
finds that anticipated shocks explain about half of the volatility of output growth, which is
consistent with the results reported in this paper. However, contrary to our results and those
reported in Beaudry and Portier (2006), Davis finds a negligible role for anticipated shocks
to TFP. Instead, he finds that the most important source of news shocks are anticipated
changes in the relative price of investment.1
    The remainder of the paper is organized in nine sections. Section 2 presents the theo-
retical model. Section 3 explains how to introduce anticipated disturbances into the model
and derives the autoregressive representation of the exogenous stochastic state variables.

    Our work is also related to Fujiwara et al. (2008). These authors estimate and compare the role of
anticipated shocks in Japan and the United States.



                                                  2
This section also demonstrates that our model of anticipated shocks nests as a special case
a model of technological diffusion. In addition, this section shows that our framework can
accommodate revisions in expectations, such as anticipated increases in productivity that
fail to materialize. Section 4 presents a Bayesian estimation of the deep structural parame-
ters of the model, including those defining the stochastic processes of the anticipated and
unanticipated components of the four assumed sources of business cycles. Section 5 contains
the central result of the paper. It performs a variance decomposition of output growth and
other macroeconomic indicators of interest into anticipated and unanticipated sources of un-
certainty. Section 6 defines and estimates the pure anticipation effect. Section 7 relates the
findings of our paper to those obtained using a structural VECM approach. Section 8 dis-
cusses the dynamic effects of anticipated shocks. Section 9 estimates a variant of the model
in which agents have preferences of the type developed by Jaimovich and Rebelo (2008).
Finally, section 10 concludes.


2    The Model
Consider an economy populated by a large number of identical, infinitely lived agents with
habit-forming preferences defined over consumption, Ct , and leisure, `t , and described by
the utility function
                               X
                               ∞
                           E0     β t U (Ct − θc Ct−1 , `t − θ` `t−1 ),                 (1)
                                t=0

where β denotes the subjective discount factor and θc and θ` govern the degree of internal
habit formation in consumption and leisure, respectively. It is well known that habit forma-
tion helps explain the smooth observed behavior of consumption. Habits in leisure are less
frequently introduced in business-cycle models. We motivate this feature as a natural way to
introduce adjustment costs in hours worked. In a recent paper, Jaimovich and Rebelo (2008)
suggest that adjustment costs in labor effort helps prevent a decline in equilibrium employ-
ment in response to anticipated productivity shocks. In effect, an anticipated increase in
productivity produces a wealth effect that induces households to work less. However, it also
makes households anticipate an increase in labor effort at the time the productivity shock
actually materializes. With labor adjustment costs, the prospect of having to increase hours
in the future provides an incentive for households to start adjusting labor supply upward
already at the moment they receive the news.
    We note that the introduction of habit formation implies adjustment costs in the supply
of labor. Alternatively, one could model adjustment costs in labor demand, as in Cogley and
Nason (1995). These authors model adjustment costs in labor as a direct resource cost that is

                                              3
proportional to the level of output. This proportionality ensures that labor adjustment costs
do not vanish along the growth path of the economy. In the habit formation formulation
presented here the condition that adjustment costs not fade over time is satisfied when
preferences are consistent with long-run balanced growth. In turn, this latter condition is
satisfied by the following assumed functional form for the period utility function:

                                                  (xy χ )1−σ − 1
                                     U (x, y) =                  ,
                                                      1−σ

with χ > 0 and σ > 1.
   We normalize the total time endowment per period to unity. Then hours worked, denoted
ht , are given by
                                           ht = 1 − `t .                                   (2)

   Households are assumed to own physical capital. The capital stock, denoted Kt , is
assumed to evolve over time according to the following law of motion
                                                                 
                                                               It
                         Kt+1   = (1 − δ(ut ))Kt + It 1 − S           ,                    (3)
                                                              It−1

where It denotes gross investment. Owners of physical capital can control the intensity with
which the capital stock is utilized. Formally, we let ut measure capacity utilization in period
t. The effective amount of capital services supplied to firms in period t is given by ut Kt .
We assume that increasing the intensity of capital utilization entails a cost in the form of
a faster rate of depreciation. Specifically, we assume that the depreciation rate, given by
δ(ut ), is an increasing and convex function of the rate of capacity utilization. We adopt a
quadratic form for the function δ:

                                                           δ2
                             δ(u) = δ0 + δ1 (u − 1) +         (u − 1)2 ,
                                                           2

with δ0 , δ1 , δ2 > 0.
    The function S introduces investment adjustment costs of the form proposed by Chris-
tiano, Eichenbaum, and Evans (2005). We assume that the function S evaluated at the
steady-state growth rate of investment satisfies S = S 0 = 0 and S 00 > 0. We will focus on a
quadratic specification of S:
                                            κ
                                     S(x) = (x − µi )2 ,
                                            2
                                  i
where κ > 0 is a parameter and µ denotes the steady-state growth rate of investment.
    Output, denoted Yt , is produced with a homogeneous-of-degree-one production function
that takes as inputs capital and labor services. This technology is buffeted by a transitory

                                                   4
productivity shock denoted zt and by a permanent productivity shock denoted Xt . Formally,
the production function is given by

                                          Yt = zt F (ut Kt , Xt ht ),                                        (4)

where F is taken to be of the Cobb-Douglas form:

                                            F (x, y) = xα y 1−α,

where α ∈ (0, 1) is a parameter.
   The government is assumed to consume an exogenous and stochastic amount of goods
Gt each period. The resource constraint of the economy is given by

                                           Ct + At It + Gt = Yt .                                            (5)

The variable At denotes the technical rate of transformation between consumption and in-
vestment goods. It is assumed to be exogenous and stochastic. In a decentralized equilibrium
At represents the relative price of investment goods in terms of consumption goods.
   Because this economy is free of distortions, the competitive equilibrium allocation co-
incides with the solution to a social planner problem consisting in choosing nonnegative
processes Ct , ht , `t , Kt+1 , ut , Yt , and It to maximize (1) subject to (2)-(5), given K0 and
exogenous processes for Gt , Xt , At , and zt . Letting Λt Qt and Λt denote the Lagrange mul-
tipliers on (3) and (5), respectively, the first-order conditions associated with this problem
are (2)-(5), and

             U1 (Ct − θc Ct−1 , `t − θ` `t−1 ) − θci βEt U1 (Ct+1 − θc Ct , `t+1 − θ` `t ) = Λt

  U2 (Ct − θc Ct−1 , `t − θ` `t−1 ) − θ`i βEt U2 (Ct+1 − θc Ct , `t+1 − θ` `t ) = Λt zt Xt F2 (ut Kt , Xt ht )

             Qt Λt = βEt Λt+1 [zt+1 ut+1 F1 (ut+1 Kt+1 , Xt+1 ht+1 ) + Qt+1 (1 − δ(ut+1 ))]

                                 zt F1 (ut Kt , Xt ht ) = Qt δ 0 (ut )
                                                                          2        

Here, the variable Qt can be interpreted as the relative price of installed capital in period
t available for production in period t + 1 in terms of consumption goods of period t. This
relative price is also known as marginal Tobin’s Q. A related concept is average Tobin’s Q,
which refers to the value of the firm per unit of installed capital. Let Vt denote the value of


                                                       5
the firm at the beginning of period t. Then one can write Vt recursively as:

                                                                Λt+1
                            Vt = Yt − Wt ht − At It + βEt            Vt+1 ,
                                                                 Λt

where Wt ≡ Xt F2 (ut Kt , Xt ht ) denotes the real wage rate that would result in a decentralized
version of our neoclassical economy and is given by the marginal product of labor. This
expression states that the value of the firm equals the present discounted value of current and
future expected dividends. Note that we use the representative household’s intertemporal
marginal rate of substitution to discount the future value of the firm, because households are
assumed to be the owners of the firms. Using the particular Cobb-Douglas form assumed
for the production function, we can then rewrite the above expression as

                                                            Λt+1
                               Vt = αYt − At It + βEt            Vt+1 .
                                                             Λt

Average Tobin’s Q is defined as Vt /Kt , which we denote by Qat . Using the above expression
we can write Qat recursively as

                                     Yt   At It       Λt+1 Kt+1 a
                           Qat = α      −       + βEt          Q .
                                     Kt   Kt           Λt Kt t+1

As we will discuss later on, marginal and average Q have very similar dynamic properties in
our estimated model.


3     Introducing Anticipated Shocks
The model is driven by four exogenous forces: the stationary neutral productivity shock zt ,
the nonstationary neutral productivity shock Xt , the investment-specific productivity shock
At , and the government spending shock Gt . We assume that all of these forces are subject
to anticipated as well as unanticipated innovations.
    To illustrate the way we introduce anticipated shocks, consider an exogenous process xt .
We will assume that xt evolves over time according to the law of motion:

                                         xt = ρxt−1 + µt .

We impose the following structure on the error term µt :

                               µt = 0x,t + 1x,t−1 + 2x,t−2 + 3x,t−3 ,



                                                   6
where jx,t for j = 0, 1, 2, and 3 denotes j-period anticipated changes in the level of xt . For
example, 2x,t−2 is an innovation to the level of xt that materializes in period t, but that
agents learn about in period t − 2. Therefore, 2x,t−2 is in the period t − 2 information set
of economic agents but results in an actual change in the variable xt only in period t. We
thus say that 2x,t−2 is a 2-period anticipated innovation in xt . The disturbance jx,t has mean
zero, standard deviation σxj , and is uncorrelated across time and across anticipation horizon.
That is, Ejx,t kx,t−m = 0 for k, j = 0, 1, 2, 3 and m > 0, and Ejx,t kx,t = 0 for any k 6= j.
These assumptions imply that the error term µt is unconditionally mean zero and serially
uncorrelated, that is, Eµt = 0 and Eµt µt−m = 0 for m > 0. Moreover, the error term µt is
unforecastable given only past realizations of itself. That is, E(µt+m |µt , µt−1 , . . . ) = 0, for
m > 0.
   The key departure of this paper from standard business-cycle analysis is the assumption
that economic agents have an information set much larger than one simply containing current
and past realizations of µt . In particular, agents are assumed to observe in period t current
and past values of the innovations 0x,t , 1x,t , 2x,t , and 3x,t . That is, agents can forecast future
values of µt as follows:
                                    Et µt+1 = 1x,t + 2x,t−1 + 3x,t−2

                                         Et µt+2 = 2x,t + 3x,t−1

                                             Et µt+3 = 3x,t

                                        Et µt+m = 0;      m ≥ 4.

Because agents are forward looking, they use the information contained in the realizations
of the various innovations jx,t in their current choices of consumption, leisure, and asset
holdings. It is precisely this forward-looking behavior of economic agents that allows an
econometrician to identify the volatilities of the anticipated innovations jx,t , even though the
econometrician himself cannot directly observe these innovations.

The vector of innovations νt is normal i.i.d. with mean zero and variance-covariance matrix
equal to the identity matrix.
   We apply the stochastic and informational structure described above to each of the four
driving forces in our model. Specifically, the stationary neutral productivity shock is assumed
to obey the following law of motion

                                ln zt = ρz ln zt−1 + 0z,t + 1z,t−1 + 2z,t−2 + 3z,t−3 ,

where iz,t is an i.i.d. normal innovation with mean 0 and standard deviation σzi for i =
0, 1, 2, 3. The disturbance 0z,t is an unanticipated shock to zt . This is the standard type of
shock assumed in most existing business-cycle models. The disturbance 1z,t represents an
innovation to zt+1 , which is announced in period t but materializes only in period t + 1.
Note that 1z,t does not appear in the expression for zt given above. Rather, the above
expression features 1z,t−1 , the one-period-ahead announcement in period t − 1. Similarly, 2z,t ,
and 3z,t represent two- and three-period-ahead announcements of future changes in the level
of technology.
    The natural logarithm of the nonstationary neutral productivity shock Xt is assumed to
follow a random walk process with drift of the form

                                              ln Xt = ln Xt−1 + ln µxt ,

where the natural logarithm of the gross growth rate of Xt , denoted µxt , is a stationary
autoregressive process of the form

                         ln(µxt /µx ) = ρx ln(µxt−1 /µx ) + 0x,t + 1x,t−1 + 2x,t−2 + 3x,t−3 ,               (6)

where ix,t is an i.i.d. process distributed normally with mean zero and standard deviation σxi ,
for i = 0, 1, 2, 3. Here 0x,t represents the unanticipated component of the innovation to the

                                                            8
growth rate of the permanent neutral productivity shock, and 1x,t , 2x,t , and 3x,t , represent
productivity changes anticipated one, two, and three quarters, respectively. The parame-
ter µx governs the drift in the level of the nonstationary component of labor augmenting
technological change.
   The investment-specific productivity shock At is also assumed to possess a stochastic
trend. Formally, we assume that

                                       ln At = ln At−1 + ln µat ,

with the gross growth rate of At , denoted µat , following the stationary autoregressive process

                  ln(µat /µa ) = ρa ln(µat−1 /µa ) + 0a,t + 1a,t−1 + 2a,t−2 + 3a,t−3 .

The innovations ia,t are assumed to be i.i.d. normal with mean zero and standard deviation
σai for i = 0, 1, 2, 3. Here again, 0a,t denotes the unanticipated innovation in the growth rate
of the relative price of investment, and 1a,t , 2a,t , and 3a,t represent anticipated changes in
the growth rate of the relative price of investment. The parameter µa represents the drift in
the price of investment.
    We assume that government spending, Gt , displays a stochastic trend given by XtG . We
let gt ≡ Gt /XtG denote detrended government spending. The trend in government spending
is assumed to be cointegrated with the trend in output, denoted XtY . This assumption
ensures that the share of government spending in output is stationary. However, we allow
for the possibility that the trend in government spending is smoother than the trend in
output. Specifically, we assume that
                                                   ρxg          1−ρxg
                                   XtG = Xt−1
                                          G                Y
                                                          Xt−1            ,

where ρxg ∈ [0, 1) is a parameter governing the smoothness of the trend in government
spending. In the present model, the trend in output can be shown to be given by XtY =
    α/(α−1)
Xt At       . Log deviations of government spending from trend are assumed to follow the
autoregressive process

                    ln(gt /g) = ρg ln(gt−1 /g) + 0g,t + 1g,t−1 + 2g,t−2 + 3g,t−3 ,

where ig,t is assumed to be an i.i.d. normal innovation with mean 0 and standard deviation
σgi , for i = 0, 1, 2, 3. This specification implies that innovations in government spending have
a unanticipated component, given by 0g,t , and anticipated components given by 1g,t , 2g,t , and


                                                     9
3g,t . Notice that XtG resides in the information set of period t − 1. This fact together with
assumption that gt is autoregressive, implies the absence of contemporaneous feedback from
any endogenous or exogenous variable to the level of government spending. At the same time,
the maintained specification of the government spending process allows for lagged feedback
from changes in the trend path of output.


3.2    A Special Case: Technological Diffusion
The stochastic and informational structure assumed above encompasses as a special case the
model of technological diffusion presented in Beaudry and Portier (2006). Specifically, these
authors assume that the nonstationary component of TFP, Xt , evolves over time according
to the following law of motion:
                                           X
                                           ∞
                                   ln Xt =   di ηt−i ,
                                                i=0

where ηt is white noise with standard deviation ση , and di is given by

                                   di = 1 − φi ;      φ ∈ [0, 1).

Notice that d0 = 0 and that di increases monotonically with i, reaching a maximum value
of one. This means that in this model technological innovations are incorporated gradually
into the production process.
   We wish to show that this diffusion process is a special case of the informational structure
described above. To see this, apply the temporal difference operator to ln Xt to obtain

                                                          X
                                                          ∞
                            ln Xt − ln Xt−1 = (1 − φ)            φi−1 ηt−i .
                                                           i=1


This expression can be written recursively as

                    ln Xt − ln Xt−1 = φ(ln Xt−1 − ln Xt−2 ) + (1 − φ)ηt−1 .

Comparing this expression with equation (6), and recalling the notation µxt ≡ ln Xt −ln Xt−1 ,
we have that the diffusion model is a special case of our assumed stochastic structure with
σx1 = (1 − φ)ση , σx0 = σx2 = σx3 = 0, ρx = φ, and µx = 1.




                                               10
3.3    Accommodating Revisions
The structure given above to anticipated and unanticipated innovations is flexible enough to
accommodate revisions in announcements. The innovation 0z,t , for instance, can be thought
of as incorporating period t revisions to announcements made in period t − 1 or earlier
regarding the level of productivity in period t.
   Similarly, the innovation 1z,t can be thought of as incorporating period t revisions to
announcements made in period t−1 or earlier regarding the level of productivity in period t+
1. More generally, iz,t can be interpreted as containing period-t revisions to announcements
made in period t − 1 or earlier regarding the level of productivity in period t + i.
   A similar interpretation can be assigned to innovations to the growth rate of nonstationary
neutral productivity, the growth rate of investment specific productivity, and deviations of
government spending from trend.


3.4    Inducing Stationarity and Solution Method
The exogenous forcing processes Xt and At display stochastic trends. These random trends
are inherited by the endogenous variables of the model. We focus our attention on equilibrium
fluctuations around these stochastic trends. To this end, we perform a stationarity-inducing
transformation of the endogenous variables by dividing them by their trend component.
Appendix A describes this transformation and presents the complete set of equilibrium con-
ditions in stationary form.
    We compute a log-linear approximation to the equilibrium dynamics of the model. We
have already shown how to express the law of motion of the exogenous driving forces of
the model in a first-order autoregressive form. Then, using familiar perturbation techniques
(e.g., Schmitt-Grohé and Uribe, 2004), one can write the equilibrium dynamics of the model
up to first order as
                                     xt+1 = hx xt + ηt+1 ,                                 (7)

                                       yt = gx xt + ξµt ,                                   (8)

where xt is a vector of endogenous and exogenous state variables, yt is the vector of ob-
servables, t is a vector of structural disturbances distributed N (0, I), and µt is a vector of
measurement errors distributed N (0, I). The matrices hx , gx , η, and ξ are functions of the
structural parameters of the model.

      Note: The time unit is one quarter.



4     Estimating Anticipated Shocks
We use Bayesian methods to estimate a subset of the deep structural parameters of the
model. Of particular importance among the estimated parameters are those defining the
stochastic processes of unanticipated and anticipated innovations. The parameters that are
not estimated are calibrated in a standard fashion.


4.1    Calibrated Parameters
Table 1 presents the values assigned to the calibrated parameters. The time unit is defined
to be one quarter. We assign a value of 2 to σ, the parameter defining the curvature of the
period utility function. This value is standard in the business-cycle literature. We set α equal
to 0.3, which implies a labor share of 70 percent. We assume that the annual depreciation
rate is 10 percent. We calibrate the parameter δ1 to ensure that capacity utilization, u, equals
unity in the steady state. We follow Campbell and Cochrane (1999) and set the discount
factor equal to 0.973 per quarter. This value of β matches the mean risk-free rate in their
habit-formation model with the average real return on Treasury bills. It delivers a relatively
high deterministic-steady-state interest rate of about 11 percent. Note that the exercise in
Campbell and Cochrane consists in matching the average risk-free rate that emerges in a
stochastic environment rather than the interest rate associated with the nonstochastic steady
state. Our results are robust to assuming higher values of β that are more conventional in
the RBC literature.
    We calibrate the steady-state growth rates of per capita output and of the relative price
of investment, µy and µa , respectively, to be 0.45 and -0.45 percent per quarter. These two
figures correspond to the average growth rates of per capita output and the price of invest-


                                              12
ment over the period 1955:Q1 to 2006:Q4. Finally, we set the share of government purchases
in output equal to 20 percent, which is in line with the average government spending share
in our sample.


4.2    Estimated Parameters
We perform a Bayesian estimation of the noncalibrated structural parameters of the model.
We follow the methodology described in the survey by An and Schorfheide (2007). Specif-
ically, given the system of linear stochastic difference equations (7) and (8) describing the
equilibrium dynamics of the model up to first order, it is straightforward to numerically
evaluate the likelihood function of the data given the vector of estimated parameters, which
we denote by L(Y |Θ), where Y is the data sample and Θ is the vector of parameters to
be estimated. Then, given a prior parameter distribution P (Θ), the posterior likelihood
function of the parameter Θ given the data, which we denote by L(Θ|Y ), is proportional to
the product L(Y |Θ)P (Θ). We use the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm to obtain draws from
the posterior distribution of Θ.
    The vector of estimated parameters, Θ, is given by the parameters defining the stochas-
tic process for anticipated and unanticipated innovations, namely, σji for i = 0, 1, 2, 3 and
j = z, x, a, g. In addition, the parameter vector Θ includes the parameters governing the
persistence of the four structural shocks in the model, ρj for j = z, x, a, g, the parameter gov-
erning the smoothness in the trend component of government spending, ρxg , the parameters
defining habits in consumption and leisure, θc and θ` , respectively, the preference parameter
χ linked to the Frisch elasticity of labor supply, the parameter governing the convexity of
the cost of adjusting capacity utilization, δ2 , and the parameter κ, governing the cost of
adjusting investment.
   We estimate the model on U.S. quarterly data ranging from 1955:Q1 to 2006:Q4. The
data includes six time series: the per capita growth rates of real GDP, real consumption,
real investment, and real government expenditure, the growth rate of the relative price of
investment, and the logarithm of the level of per capita hours worked. We assume that all
six time series contain measurement error. Formally, the vector of observable variables is
given by                                                  

4.2.1     Prior Distributions

Table 2 displays the assumed prior distribution P (Θ) of the estimated structural parameters
contained in the vector Θ. Because we could find no studies that helped us form priors on
the importance of the various anticipated disturbances modeled in this paper, we deliber-
ately choose flat and quite disperse priors. Specifically, we assign a common uniform prior
distribution to the standard deviation of the twelve anticipated shocks, σji , for i = 1, 2, 3 and
j = z, x, a, g, with a lower bound of 0 and an upper bound of 5 percent. We also assign a
common uniform prior distribution to the standard deviations of the four unanticipated in-
                                                                                     √
novations, σj0 , for j = z, x, a, g, with a lower bound of 0 and an upper bound of 5 3 percent.
The larger upper bound in the prior distribution of the unanticipated shocks guarantees
that at the mean of the prior distribution, the variance of the unanticipated component of
each shock equals the sum of the variances of the associated anticipated components. Our
choice of priors, which makes all unanticipated shocks taken together as important as all
anticipated shocks taken together, is guided by the work of Beaudry and Portier (2006) who
find that at least 50 percent of the variance of output growth is explained by anticipated
shocks.

                                                   14
    We also choose uniform prior distributions for the standard deviation of measurement
errors. We restrict the standard deviation of measurement errors in the observable variables
to be at most 25 percent of the standard deviations of the corresponding empirical variables.
Our results are robust to choosing upper bounds for these uniform distributions equal to 50
or 75 percent of the standard deviations of the underlying observable variables.
   We also give a uniform prior distribution to the parameter δ2 , which measures the con-
vexity of the function relating the rate of capacity utilization to the depreciation rate. We
bound δ2 away from zero by setting the lower bound of the prior distribution to 0.01. Such a
lower bound is necessary because capacity utilization is indeterminate up to first order when
the depreciation rate increases linearly with the rate of capacity utilization.
    We assign beta distributions to linear transformations of the parameters defining the
strength of habit formation in consumption and leisure, θc and θ` , the autoregressive coeffi-
cients of the four exogenous shocks, ρz , ρg , ρx , ρa , and the smoothing parameter of the trend
component of government purchases, ρxg . We assume that the parameters ρz , ρg , ρxg , θc ,
and θ` divided by 0.99 have a beta prior distribution, so that the maximum value that these
parameters can take is 0.99. We introduce this linear transformation to avoid numerical
instability when evaluating the likelihood at near-unity values for these parameters.
    The prior mean for the consumption habit formation parameter θc is 0.5, a value that
is within the range of values used in the related literature. There is little independent
econometric evidence on the degree of habit formation in leisure. Calibrated models with
habits in leisure are also rare. An exception is Lettau and Uhlig (2000) who study the asset
pricing implications of a real-business-model with habits in leisure and consumption. They
consider two extreme calibrations of the habit parameter for leisure, 0 and 0.95. The mean
of our prior for θ` falls between these two values.
    Stationary neutral productivity shocks as well as government spending shocks are typi-
cally estimated to be highly persistent. Based on this fact, we choose a relatively high mean
value of 0.7 for the prior distributions of the serial correlations ρz and ρg as well as for the
smoothness parameter in the trend component of government spending, ρxg . By contrast,
the growth rate of the nonstationary component of total factor productivity is typically esti-
mated to have a near-zero serial correlation (e.g., Cogley and Nason, 1995). Accordingly, we
set the mean of the prior distribution of ρx at a value of 0, and assume that ρx + 0.5 follows
a beta prior distribution.
   Our time series for the relative price of investment has a serial correlation of 0.5. We
therefore set the mean of the prior distribution of ρa equal to 0.5. We assume that ρa /0.7
has a beta prior distribution, which allows for a maximum value of 0.7 for ρa itself.
   Finally, we adopt gamma prior distributions with mean equal to 4 for the parameters χ


                                               15
and κ governing the elasticity of labor supply and the cost of adjusting investment. This
assumption implies that at the mean of the prior the Frisch elasticity of labor supply is 1.3
in the absence of habit formation in leisure. The mean of the prior distribution of κ is in line
with existing priors of this parameters (e.g., Justiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti, 2008).

4.2.2   Posterior Distributions

Table 3 displays salient aspects of the posterior distribution of the parameter vector Θ. It
displays the mean of the posterior distribution and 90-percent posterior intervals. These
statistics were computed from a chain of 10 million draws generated using a random walk
Metropolis-Hastings algorithm discarding the first 6 million draws.
   The estimated process for the stationary neutral productivity shock, zt , is highly persis-
tent and driven mostly by unanticipated innovations, 0z,t and three-quarter-ahead anticipated
innovations, 3z,t . Both of these disturbances have a standard deviation of about 3 percent
per quarter and are tightly estimated. One- and two-quarter-ahead anticipated innovations
are estimated to have a significantly smaller standard deviation of about 0.6 and display
much more dispersed distributions.
  The posterior distributions of the parameters defining the process for the growth rate of
the nonstationary neutral productivity shock, µxt , are shown in the second panel of table 3.
The persistence parameter, ρx , is centered at a value of 0.14, implying virtually no serial
correlation in the growth rate of the permanent component of TFP. The most important
component of the innovation to µxt is estimated to be 1x,t , the one-quarter-ahead anticipated
disturbance. Its standard deviation, σx1 , has a large posterior mean of 2.3 percent. All other
disturbances to this process have smaller posterior means and relatively flatter distributions.
    The estimated mean of the standard deviations of the innovations to the remaining two
exogenous processes, namely, the growth rate of investment-specific technological change,
µat , and deviations of government spending from trend, gt , are relatively small in magnitude.
      We obtain relatively tight posterior distributions for the structural parameters defining
preferences and technology. Our estimates indicate a significant amount of habit formation in
consumption, with a posterior mean of θc equal to 0.85. This value is in consistent with a large
number of existing estimates. The degree of habit formation in leisure is also estimated to
be substantial, with a 90-percent posterior interval of θ` equal to (0.50, 0.63). The estimated
posterior mean of the preference parameter χ is 6.1. It suggests a relatively low Frisch
elasticity of labor supply of about unity, a value consistent with a number of calibrated and
estimated real-business-cycle studies. Our estimate of κ, the parameter governing investment
adjustment costs, is 5.0. This value is somewhat higher than those estimated in related
studies. These studies, however, generally include nominal frictions in the form of sticky

prices and wages, which are absent in the present model. The mean posterior of δ2 , the
parameter measuring the convexity of the function relating the rate of capacity utilization
to the depreciation rate is 0.11. This value implies an elasticity of capacity utilization with
respect to the rental rate of capital of 0.6. This elasticity is larger than the one found in
related Bayesian estimations of DSGE models with nominal rigidities and no anticipated
shocks. (Justiniano et al. (2007), for instance, estimate an elasticity of about 0.2.)
   The bottom panel of table 3 presents descriptive statistics of the posterior distributions
of measurement errors. As is common in estimated DSGE models, measurement errors tend
to be significant. In this case, the estimated mean of most of this shocks are close to the
upper bound of their prior distributions.


5    The Importance of Anticipated Shocks
Table 4 presents the main result of this paper. It displays the share of the unconditional
variances of output growth, consumption growth, investment growth, and the logarithm of
hours worked accounted for by anticipated shocks. The table displays the mean posterior
share and the associated 90 percent posterior interval computed from 4 million draws from
the posterior distribution of the vector of estimated structural parameters.
   The table shows that news shocks account for 70 percent of the variance of output
growth. This is a remarkable finding in light of the fact that the long existing literature
on business cycles has implicitly attributed one hundred percent of the variance of output
growth to unanticipated shocks. Our results indicate that once one allows for unanticipated
and anticipated disturbances to play separate roles, the latter source of business cycles
emerges as the dominant driving force.
   Figure 1 displays the prior and posterior probability density functions of the share of the
variance of output growth accounted for by anticipated shocks. It is evident from this figure
that the posterior probability that the share of the variance accounted for by anticipated

shocks is less than 50 percent is virtually nil. This probability is given by the area below the
posterior density function and to the left of the vertical dashed line. By contrast, the prior
probability that the share of the variance of output growth explained by anticipated shocks
is less than 50 percent is 54 percent. This number results from computing the area below
the prior density function and to the left of the dashed vertical line. We interpret the results
displayed in figure 1 as suggesting that the data speaks clearly in favor of a significant role
for anticipated shocks in driving output fluctuations.
   Anticipated disturbances play a similarly central role in explaining the volatility of con-
sumption, investment, and hours. As shown in table 4, for each of these three variables,
anticipated shocks explain more than fifty percent of their variances with more than 95
percent probability.
   Table 5 addresses a standard question in business-cycle analysis. Namely, what is the
contribution of each of the sources of uncertainty considered in this study to explaining
business-cycle fluctuations. It presents the share of the overall predicted variance of the
variables of interest attributed to each of the sixteen shocks considered. Table 5 shows that
two thirds of the unconditional variance of output growth is explained by the stationary
productivity shock zt . That is, about two thirds of the variance of output growth is explained
jointly by the innovations 0z,t , 1z,t , 2z,t , and 3z,t . The remaining one third of the variance of

output growth. Government spending shocks and investment-specific productivity shocks
explain jointly a negligible fraction of the variance of output growth. A similar conclusion
emerges when one examines the variance decomposition of consumption growth, investment
growth, and hours. Here, also, stationary and nonstationary neutral technology shocks
explain virtually all of the variation predicted by the model.
   The insignificant role played by investment-specific productivity shocks may seem at odds
with some existing related studies. A recent example is the work by Justiniano, Primiceri,
and Tambalotti (2008), who estimate that investment-specific shocks are responsible for
more than fifty percent of output fluctuations in the postwar United States. An important
difference between our estimation strategy and that of Justiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti
is that we include the relative price of investment in the set of observable variables, whereas
they do not. Indeed, when we estimate our model excluding the relative price of investment
from the set of observables, we find that investment-specific shocks account for about one
third of the variation of output. The intuition for this finding is that including the price
of investment in the set of observables introduces restrictions upon the estimated stochastic
process of the relative price of investment as it must match the sample properties of its
empirical counterpart. When the relative price of investment is not included in the set of
observables, the estimated process of the investment-specific shock can more freely contribute
to explaining the observed statistical properties of other variables included as observables.
But this extra freedom comes at a cost. For instance, Justiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti
report that the standard deviation of their estimated investment-specific shock process is
four times as large as that of its empirical counterpart.
   It is worth noting that the central results of the present paper stand even when we
estimate the model excluding the relative price of investment from the set of observable
variables. For anticipated shocks continue to play a dominant role in driving business cycles.
Specifically, we estimate that they continue to explain more than two thirds of predicted
output variations. Also in line with our baseline estimation results, virtually all anticipated
disturbances take the form of variations in total factor productivity.
   The finding that government spending and investment-specific shocks play no role in
explaining the variance of the four macroeconomic variables we study, implies that the
anticipated component of these two sources of uncertainty must be virtually nil as well. We
therefore concentrate for the remainder of this paper on the dynamics induced by stationary
and nonstationary neutral productivity shocks.
   Inspecting the estimated contribution of disturbances anticipated zero, one, two, and
three quarters in advance to the overall variance of output, consumption, investment, and
hours reals that virtually all of the variance of output growth is explained by only three


                                              21
innovations: 3z,t , 0z,t , and 1x,t . Specifically, 35 percent of the variance of output is due to
three-quarter anticipated changes in the level of the stationary neutral technology shock,
3z,t . Another 20 percent of the variance of output is attributable to one-quarter anticipated
changes in the growth rate of the nonstationary productivity shock, 1x,t . And 28 percent
of the variance of output is due to unanticipated movements in the stationary neutral pro-
ductivity shock. The same pattern emerges from examining the sources of fluctuations in
consumption, investment, and hours.
   Notably, we find that all permanent changes in total factor productivity are anticipated.
This is because the contribution of 0x,t to explaining the variance of output growth is almost
nil. This result is in line with the empirical findings of Beaudry and Portier (2006). These
authors document a near perfect correlation between shocks that change TFP permanently
and shocks that fail to change TFP on impact. In section 7, we relate our findings to those
of Beaudry and Portier in more detail.


5.1    Marginal Data Densities
To further ascertain the significance of anticipated shocks as a source of business cycles, we
estimate a version of the model in which we restrict the variances of all anticipated shocks
to be zero (σki = 0, for i = 1, 2, 3 and k = z, x, g, a). That is, by construction, all sources of
uncertainty are unanticipated, which is the case typically considered in the related literature
on the sources of economic fluctuations. Table 6 reports marginal data densities for the
baseline model and for the model with no anticipation. The marginal data densities are
computed using Geweke’s modified harmonic mean estimator for various truncation values
and a Markov chain of 4 million draws for each specification. The table shows that the data
favors the model with anticipated shocks over the model without anticipated shocks. The log
Bayes factor, given by the difference between the two log marginal data densities, is about
310 and stable across truncation values.


5.2    The Role of Anticipated Shocks at Different Time Horizons
Thus far, we have analyzed the contribution of anticipated shocks to explaining the uncon-
ditional variance of variables of interest. Table 7 shows that the importance of anticipated
shocks is not limited to long horizons. It displays the share of the variance of forecast-
ing errors explained by anticipated shocks at different forecasting horizons. For horizons
between 8 and 32 quarters—the range typically associated with business-cycle frequencies—
anticipated shocks again account for the majority of the forecasting error variance of all four
macroeconomic indicators considered in the table.

5.3     Two Alternative Prior Distributions
Our baseline priors imply that at the mean of the prior distribution of the structural para-
meters, the share of the variance of output growth explained by anticipated shocks is about
50 percent. Also, under the baseline prior the standard deviations of all exogenous sources
of uncertainty are assumed to be uniformly distributed. We now study the robustness of
our results to reducing the importance of anticipated shocks under the prior distribution,
and to moving away from uniform distributions for the standard deviations of the exogenous
driving forces.

5.3.1   Alternative Uniform Prior Distribution

Our first robustness exercise assumes that the under the prior the variance of the unantici-
pated component of each of the four sources of uncertainty is twice as large as the variance
of the three associated anticipated components taken together. That is, we consider a prior
                                                                               P
distribution in which the mean of the standard deviations satisfies (σk0 )2 = 2 3j=1 (σkj )2 for
k = z, x, g, a. Specifically, we assume that the prior distribution of the standard deviation of
each anticipated component is uniform with lower bound equal to 0 and upper bound equal
to 3. At the same time, we assume that the standard deviation of each unanticipated shock
                                                                              √
follows a uniform distribution with lower bound 0 and upper bound equal to 3 6. The prior
distributions assumed for all remaining estimated parameters are as in the baseline case (see
table 2). After reestimating the model under this new prior distribution, we find that the
posterior distribution of the estimated parameter vector is little changed vis-a-vis the one
estimated under the baseline prior distribution. Figure 2 displays the prior and posterior
distributions of the share of output growth explained by anticipated shocks. We note that
the posterior distribution is virtually identical to the one obtained under the baseline esti-
mation strategy. However, the prior distribution of the share of output growth explained by
anticipated shocks shifted markedly to the left compared to the baseline case. Under the
current assumptions, the posterior probability that the share of output growth explained by
anticipated shocks is below 50 percent is, as in the baseline case, near zero. By contrast the
corresponding prior probability is 77 percent. We conclude that our central finding that the
majority of the estimated aggregate volatility is explained by anticipated shocks is robust to
significantly increasing the prior importance of the unanticipated sources of uncertainty.

5.3.2   Inverse Gamma Prior Distribution

One feature common to both the baseline and the alternative uniform prior distributions is
that they assign relatively little probability to the event that the share of the variance of

output growth explained by anticipated shocks be very small, say less than 10 percent. For
instance, in figure 2 the probability that the share of the variance of output explained by
anticipated shocks is less than 10 percent is only 2 percent. To address this issue, our second
robustness test replaces the uniform prior distributions for the standard deviations of the
exogenous shocks with inverse gamma distributions. We parameterize these distributions
as follows: (a) we impose that at the mean of the prior distribution the variance of each
unanticipated component is twice as large as the sum of the variance of all three of its as-
                                                                P
sociated anticipated components. That is, we impose (σk0 )2 = 2 3j=1 (σkj )2 for k = z, x, g, a.
(b) We impose that at the mean of the prior distribution, the share of the variance of output
growth explained by stationary neutral productivity shocks, nonstationary neutral produc-
tivity shocks, permanent investment-specific technology shocks, and government spending
shocks is about 30 percent, 30 percent, 30 percent, and 10 percent, respectively. (c) The co-
efficient of variation of the prior distribution of the standard deviations of all 16 innovations
is 3. (d) The volatility of output growth predicted by the model when the structural parame-
ters are evaluated at the mean of the prior is about 1 percent per quarter, as observed in our
sample. And (e) for each type of shock (z, x, a, or g), the prior distribution of the standard
deviations is common across anticipated innovations. These restrictions uniquely pin down

the 32 parameters defining the inverse gamma prior distributions of the standard deviations
of the 16 structural innovations of the model. The prior distributions of all remaining esti-
mated parameters are as in the baseline case (see table 2). We reestimate the model under
this new prior and, as in the first robustness test, find that the posterior distribution of the
estimated parameter vector is little affected by the change in the prior distribution.
    Figure 3 displays the prior and posterior probability densities of the share of the vari-
ance of output growth attributable to anticipated shocks. The posterior density is virtually
identical to the one we obtained under the baseline prior specification. In particular the
probability that the share of the variance of output growth explained by anticipated shocks
is less than 50 percent is practically zero. On the other hand, the prior density now assigns
a non negligible probability to the event that anticipated shocks explain a small fraction of
the variance of output growth. For example the area under the prior density and to the left
of 0.1 is 15 percent, compared with a corresponding value of 2 percent under the baseline
prior. We take this result to mean that the data strongly favors parameter specifications in
which anticipated shocks play a major role in generating business cycles.


6    The Pure Anticipation Effect
Our estimation results suggest that more than two thirds of business-cycle fluctuations are
caused by anticipated shocks. However, anticipated shocks have two components: One is the

                                                                        26
pure anticipation effect, resulting from the change in behavior triggered by the announce-
ment of future changes in exogenous fundamentals. The second component is a realization
effect. It takes place when the pre-announced shock materializes into an actual change in
fundamentals. Consider, for instance, a situation in which agents learn in period 0 that
in period three total factor productivity will increase permanently by one percent. This
announcement generates a wealth effect that induces households to increase consumption
and leisure. In turn, the change in labor supply causes movements in wages, employment,
and output. All of these effects begin to take place in period zero, three quarters before the
actual increase in total factor productivity. Compare this situation with one in which agents
are surprised in period three with a permanent, one-percent increase in TFP. In periods
0, 1, and 2 all endogenous variables are unaffected by the upcoming TFP shock. We note
that even from period 3 onward the behavior of endogenous variables will in principle be
different with and without anticipation. The reason is that the two economies will enter
period three with different values for the endogenous state variables, such as the capital
stock, the stocks of habit in consumption and leisure, and past investment. Note further
that the entire path of the exogenous state variables (in particular TFP) is identical in both
situations described here. The pure anticipation effect captures the difference between the
time paths of endogenous variables with and without anticipation.
    The use of an optimizing, rational expectations, DSGE model allows us to decompose the
total contribution of anticipated shocks into the pure anticipation effect and the realization
effect. To this end, we compare the variance of the forecast error induced by the baseline
economy, which we denote by V F E (and present in table 7), with the variance of the forecast
error induced by an economy without anticipation, which we denote by V F E na . To construct
V F E na , we change the information set of households as follows: Consider, for example, the
stochastic process for the stationary component of TFP, zt . The law of motion of this
exogenous variable is given by

                                   ln zt = ρz ln zt−1 + νz,t .

This process is identical to the one assumed in the baseline economy. That is, νz,t is a
Gaussian white noise process with unconditional mean zero and unconditional variance σν2z
given by
                                     2    2      2      2
                           σν2z = σz0 + σz1 + σz2 + σz3 ,

where all the parameters on the right-hand side of this expression take the values estimated
for the baseline economy (table 3). The key difference between the economy without antic-
ipation and the baseline economy is that in the economy without anticipation agents can

only observe realizations of νz,t and not realizations of its individual components, 0z,t , 1z,t−1 ,
2z,t−2 , and 3z,t−3 . Therefore, in the economy without anticipation νz,t is unforecastable by
economic agents, that is,
                                               Et−j νz,t = 0,

for all j > 0. By contrast, in the baseline economy, in which agents are assumed to observe the
individual components of νz,t given by 0z,t , 1z,t−1 , 2z,t−2 , and 3z,t−3 , νz,t is indeed forecastable
by economic agents. Specifically, in the baseline economy we have that

                                   Et−1 νzt = 1z,t−1 + 2z,t−2 + 3z,t−3 ,

                                       Et−2 νzt = 2z,t−2 + 3z,t−3 ,

                                            Et−3 νzt = 3z,t−3 ,

and
                                               Et−j νzt = 0

for j ≥ 4. In modeling the economy without anticipation, we impose the same change in
information structure just discussed for the stationary productivity shock, zt , to the three
other exogenous driving forces, µxt , µat , and gt .

for various forecasting horizons and four endogenous variables of interest. Values of this
ratio below unity indicate that the baseline economy (the economy with anticipation) has
a smaller forecasting error variance than the counterfactual economy without anticipation.
That is, a value of the ratio below one means that anticipation has a stabilizing effect on the
variable in question. The table shows that anticipation greatly dampens short-term volatility
in output, investment, and hours. In the case of output, the variance of the one-step ahead
forecasting error falls by about half when anticipation is taken into account. On the other
hand, consumption is much more unpredictable in the short run in the economy in which
agents obtain advanced notice of future changes in economic fundamentals. We note that for
output and consumption, the pure anticipation effect vanishes at long horizons. For hours
and investment, on the other hand, the dampening effect of anticipation is significant even
at very long horizons. For instance, unconditionally, hours worked are about 25 percent less
volatile in the economy with anticipation than in the economy without it.


7     Relation To VECM Estimates of Anticipated Shocks
In a recent paper, Beaudry and Portier (2006) estimate the importance of anticipated shocks
using an empirical vector error correction model (VECM). Their identification strategy is
designed to uncover anticipated permanent changes in total factor productivity. Specifically,
these authors impose two conditions for an innovation in TFP growth to be a news shock:
first, the shock affects TFP in the long run (we refer to this restriction as identification
scheme I). And second, the shock cannot affect TFP contemporaneously (we refer to this
restriction as identification scheme II). Applying the Beaudry-Portier definition of news
shocks to our DSGE model, would uncover some combination of the anticipated components
of the nonstationary neutral productivity shock. That is, a combination of 1x,t , 2x,t , and 3x,t .
      Table 9 reports the share of business-cycle fluctuations explained jointly by 1x,t , 2x,t , and
3x,t in our estimated DSGE model. For comparison, the table also shows the contribution of
the news shock estimated by Beaudry and Portier (2006), as reported in their figure 10. The
VECM of Beaudry and Portier identifies a larger contribution of anticipated shocks to TFP
growth to aggregate fluctuations than does our estimated DSGE model. Our estimates fall
closer to the ones obtained by Beaudry and Portier when applying the second identification
scheme (i.e., when the news shock is imposed to have no contemporaneous effect on TFP).
    An advantage of performing the estimation of news shocks in the context of a DSGE model
is that it allows for the identification of news shocks other that anticipated permanent changes
in TFP. Indeed, we find that news shocks explain 70 percent of the predicted variance of
output (see table 4). Of this figure only about half (30 percent) is attributable to anticipated

                                                  29

        Note: The numbers reported in the rows below the one entitled ‘Beaudry-Portier Es-
        timated VECM’ Estimate’ correspond to the share of the forecast error variance at
        horizon 30 quarters. Identification scheme I identifies an innovation that has a long-
        run effect on TFP, and identification scheme II identifies an innovation that has no
        contemporaneous effect on TFP. The numbers reported here are approximations, as
        they represent our reading of the bottom panels of figure 10 in Beaudry and Portier
        (2006).



permanent changes in TFP. The other half is attributable to anticipated temporary changes
in TFP.
   Finally, Beaudry and Portier document a near perfect correlation between the news
shocks identified under their schemes I and II, suggesting that both schemes identify essen-
tially the same news innovation. This turns out not to be the case in the context of our
estimated DSGE model. In effect, applying Beaudry and Portier identification scheme I
(i.e., permanent effect on TFP) to our DSGE model would uncover a combination of 1x,t ,
2x,t , and 3x,t . At the same time, applying the Beaudry and Portier identification scheme II
(i.e., no contemporaneous effect on TFP) to our estimated DSGE model would recover some
combination of 1x,t , 2x,t , 3x,t , 1z,t , 2z,t , 3z,t , 0g,t , 1g,t , 2g,t , 3g,t , 0a,t , 1a,t , 2a,t , and 3a,t . These
two combinations of shocks account for different fractions of business-cycle fluctuations in
our model. The difference is accounted for to a large extent by anticipated changes in the
stationary component of TFP (i.e., iz,t for i = 1, 2, 3). For instance, 3z,t alone explains about
one third of the predicted volatility of output growth.

factor productivity, 3z,t , and unanticipated stationary changes in total factor productivity,

growth (see table ??). In each case, the size of the shock is one standard deviation of the
respective innovation. All variables are measured in percent deviations of levels from trend.
   The equilibrium response to the three-quarter ahead anticipated stationary innovation
in TFP is shown with a crossed line in figure 4. TFP remains at its steady-state level in
periods 0, 1, and 2, and rises by about 3 percent in period 3. Households learn about this
upcoming increase in TFP already in period 0. Output, consumption, and investment all
display a hump-shaped boom in response to this innovation, starting in period zero, when
the future increase in TFP is announced. The expansion in consumption is driven by a
positive wealth effect associated with the expected future increase in TFP. The hump shape
of the consumption boom is governed by the presence of internal habit formation. Because
investment adjustment costs depend on the growth rate of investment, firms wish to arrive in
period 3, when the shock materializes in an actual increase in TFP, with a high level of past
investment. In order to achieve this goal, firms begin investing immediately upon learning
about the future increase in TFP.
   The increase in the supply of goods necessary to meet demand is brought about through
a rise in capacity utilization. In turn, the increase in capacity utilization during the early
transition raises the marginal product of labor, leading to an equilibrium increase in em-
ployment. The increase in hours worked occurs in spite of the fact that the anticipated
increase in productivity creates a positive wealth effect that tends to depress labor supply.
The increase in both hours worked and capacity utilization induces an expansion in output,
which inherits the smooth and hump-shaped characteristic of the responses of investment
and consumption.
   Using capacity utilization more intensively upon the announcement of the future increase
in TFP entails a cost in the form of an elevated depreciation rate. This effect is so strong in
this economy that in spite of the higher rate of investment the capital stock fails to increase in
the early transition. The flat path of capital in periods zero to three appears counterintuitive
in the sense that one would expect capital to increase when firms are engaged in above-
average levels of investment. These peculiar dynamics are the consequence of modeling
adjustment costs as depending on the growth rate of investment rather than on the growth
rate of the capital stock. In the present setup, firms are attempting to get rid of part of the
capital stock to free up resources for investment and consumption. As a result, the price
of installed capital, given by marginal Tobin’s Q, falls with the announcement of the future
increase in TFP. However, once the increase in TFP materializes in period 3, the marginal
product of capital rises, boosting the price of installed capital, or marginal Tobin’s Q. With
a higher price of capital, firms find it too costly to continue to operate with high rates of
capacity utilization—recall that the cost of higher capacity utilization is a higher rate of


                                               32
capital depreciation. Consequently, capacity utilization falls markedly in quarter 3. We also
find that average Tobin’s Q, not shown in figure 4, mimics the behavior of marginal Tobin’s
Q, falling on impact and rising sharply in period 3 with the increase in TFP.
     The economy’s response to an unanticipated, trend reverting increase in productivity
(0z,t ),
       is shown with solid lines in figure 4. This shock generates hump-shaped booms in
output, consumption, and investment. The expansion in economic activity takes place in
the context of a contraction in employment. The reason why employment falls is that the
increase in TFP entails a positive wealth effect, which induces households to contract labor
supply. In addition to the wealth effect, the increase in TFP gives rise to a substitution effect
toward labor and consumption. In the case of the labor supply, the wealth effect appears
to dominate the substitution effect. This wealth effect is exacerbated by the presence of
habit formation in consumption. Indeed, eliminating habit formation in consumption by
setting θc = 0 and holding all other structural parameters fixed, results in a positive and
hump-shaped response of hours.
   Figure 5 displays the response of the model to a one-quarter anticipated increase in the
nonstationary component of total factor productivity, 1x,t . This innovation is the third most
important source of business cycles in our estimated model, accounting for 18 percent of the
predicted volatility of output growth (see table ??). In period zero, TFP is unchanged. Nev-
ertheless, output, consumption, and investment all increase in anticipation of the permanent
increase in TFP that is expected to occur in period 1. By contrast, hours worked contract
upon the release of news in period 0. The contraction in hours is driven by a positive wealth
effect that induces households to demand more leisure and consumption. Capacity utiliza-
tion rises in period zero as a way to increase output. Higher capacity utilization raises the
marginal product of hours, thus creating an increased demand for labor, which ameliorates
the wealth-effect-induced decline in hours. As in the case of the stationary productivity
shock, households are willing to get rid of their holdings of physical capital in order to gen-
erate resources for consumption and investment purposes. As a result, the price of installed
capital, or marginal Tobin’s Q, falls in period 0. A similar fall occurs in average Q (not
shown). Indeed, in a competitive equilibrium it is the fall in the price of capital that induces
households to utilize capital more intensively.
   From the analysis of the impulse response functions implied by our estimated model, we
find that the model is capable of generating positive comovement in output, consumption,
and investment in response to anticipated productivity shocks. Moreover, in response to
the estimated single most important source of economic fluctuations, namely three-quarter
anticipated changes in the stationary component of TFP, or 3z,t , hours positively comove on
impact with output, consumption, and investment. While most studies in the literature on

news make positive comovement in response to news shock a desired prediction of any theo-
retical model of business cycles, we wish to emphasize that the available empirical evidence
is silent in regard to the response of macroeconomic aggregates of interest to news about
future changes in the level of the stationary component of TFP.
   By contrast, there exists some evidence on the macroeconomic effects of news about
future changes in the nonstationary component of total factor productivity. In effect, the
empirical findings of Beaudry and Portier (2006) suggest that output, investment, consump-
tion, employment, and stock price all rise in response to an anticipated permanent increase
in TFP. In accordance with the data, our estimated model predicts an increase in output,
consumption, and investment in response to a one-quarter anticipated permanent increase
in TFP. But the estimated model fails to generate the observed increases in hours and stock
prices. The success of the model in predicting an increase in output as well as its failure to
predict an increase in stock prices in response to an anticipated permanent increase in TFP
are closely linked through movements in capacity utilization. The predicted rise in capacity
utilization raises the number of effective units of capital employed thereby allowing output to
expand on impact. But at the same time, the higher intensity of capacity utilization comes
at the cost of lost physical capital, which can be supported in equilibrium only via depressed
prices for installed capital, i.e., via a decline in (marginal and average) Tobin’s Q.


9     Estimating Anticipated Shocks Under Jaimovich-Rebelo
      Preferences
In our estimated baseline model, an anticipated permanent increase in productivity generates
a wealth effect that causes households to reduce labor supply. The wealth effect on labor
supply is estimated to be sufficiently strong to dominate the substitution effect induced by
the increase in the marginal product of labor stemming from the higher equilibrium rates
of capital capacity utilization. This intuition suggests that a potential way to overturn the
counterfactual predictions of the baseline model regarding the response of hours to antici-
pated permanent productivity shocks is to adopt a preference specification that attenuates
the wealth elasticity of labor supply. Such a preference specification has been proposed by
Greenwood et al. (1988) and has recently been generalized and applied to explaining the dy-
namic response to anticipated permanent changes in TFP by Jaimovich and Rebelo (2008).
In the this section, we therefore estimate a variant of our model that features this type of
preferences.
    Consider an economy populated by a large number of identical agents with preferences

where β denotes the subjective discount factor, and St is a geometric average of current and
past consumption levels, which can be written recursively as

                                           St = Ctγ St−1
                                                     1−γ
                                                         .

We impose γ ∈ (0, 1] and θ > 1. Note that as γ → 0, the argument of the period utility
function becomes linear in consumption and a function of hours worked, which is the specifi-
cation considered by Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Huffman (1988). This special case induces
a supply of labor that depends only on the current real wage, and, importantly, is indepen-
dent of the marginal utility of income. As a result, when γ is small, anticipated increases in
productivity will not depress labor supply, contrary to what happens in the baseline model.
As γ increases, the wealth elasticity of labor supply rises. Because no econometric evidence
exists on the value of the parameter γ, a central goal of this section is to obtain an estimate
of this key parameter. We assume that the period utility function is of the CRRA family.
That is, U (x) = (x1−σ − 1)/(1 − σ). The remaining elements of the model are as in the
baseline model described in the previous sections.
   As in the baseline case, we calibrate some structural parameters and estimate others.
The calibration follows Jaimovich and Rebelo and is shown in table 10.
   We perform a Bayesian estimation of the model employing the same set of observables as


                                                  36
in the baseline model. We assume the same prior distributions for all estimated structural
parameters that are common to our baseline model. There are two new estimated parameters
in the present model. One of these parameters is γ, which governs the wealth elasticity of
labor supply. The prior distribution for this parameter is a uniform defined on the interval
(0, 1]. The second new parameter is θ, which determines the Frisch elasticity of labor supply
in the special case in which γ equals zero. We impose a uniform prior distribution for this
parameter over the interval (1.1, 11), which implies a wide range of wage elasticities between
10 and 0.1 when γ is close to zero.
   Table 11 displays the prior and posterior means and the 90-percent posterior intervals for
the 31 estimated structural parameters. These summary statistics were computed from the
last 4 million elements of a 10 million MCMC chain of draws from the posterior distribution.
Of particular interest is the estimate of the preference parameter γ. The estimated posterior
distribution has a mean of 0.007 and is highly concentrated, with a 90-percent posterior
interval ranging from 0.006 to 0.009. The near zero value for γ implies that preferences are
close to those proposed by Greenwood, Hercowitz, and Huffman (1988). It follows that in
our estimated model, the wealth elasticity of labor supply is near zero. To our knowledge,
this is the first estimate of this parameter using aggregate data and taking into account all
cross equation restrictions imposed by a fully-fledged DSGE model. With respect to the
remaining structural parameters of the model, we note that the estimated volatilities of the
innovations to TFP, σki , for i = 0, 1, 2, 3 and k = x, z, fall sharply relative to those obtained
under the baseline preference specification. At the same time, the serial correlation of the
growth rate of the nonstationary component of TFP, ρx , is estimated to be significantly
larger under Jaimovich-Rebelo preferences.
   Table 12 displays the share of the variance of endogenous variables of interest explained
by anticipated shocks. It shows that anticipated shocks explain about 80 percent of the
variance of output growth, consumption growth, investment growth, and hours worked.
The associated 90-percent posterior intervals all lie above 50 percent. These estimates are
consistent with those obtained under the baseline preference specification. Figure 6 displays
the posterior probability density function of the share of the variance of output growth
accounted for by anticipated shocks. The posterior probability that the share of the variance
accounted for by anticipated shocks is less than 50 percent is nil. This probability is given
by the area below the density function and to the left of the vertical dashed line.
   Table 13 displays the unconditional variance decomposition of output growth, consump-
tion growth, investment growth, and hours worked. In line with the results obtained under
the baseline preference specification, under Jaimovich-Rebelo preferences neutral technology
shocks explain virtually the totality of the unconditional variation of the four macroeconomic

variables considered. It follows that in this model, as in the baseline case, all of the variance
attributable to anticipated shocks stems from anticipated changes in neutral productivity.
Three innovations, namely, 3x,t , 3z,t and 0z,t , explain more than 93 percent of business cycles
in this model economy.
    Our estimation of the model specification with Jaimovich-Rebelo preferences assigns a
prominent role to news about future changes in the nonstationary component of TFP. For
instance, three-quarter-anticipated permanent changes in TFP (3x,t ) alone explain about half
of the predicted volatility of output, hours, consumption, and investment. This finding is in
line with the VECM evidence reported in Beaudry and Portier (2006). Table 9 compares the
share of volatilities of macroeconomic variables of interest explained by news about changes
in the permanent component of TFP in the baseline specification, in the Jaimovich-Rebelo-
preference specification, and in the Beaudry-Portier VECM model.
    Figure 7 displays impulse responses to a one-standard-deviation increase in 3x,t , the three-
quarter-anticipated, nonstationary, neutral productivity shock. This is the single most im-
portant source of business fluctuations in the present model (see table 13). The figure shows
that output, consumption, investment, and hours all experience hump-shaped booms in re-
sponse to the anticipated increase in TFP growth. The rise in hours worked contrasts with
the contraction in this variable implied by the baseline model (see figure 5). It is driven by
two factors: the absence of a wealth effect on labor supply (recall that γ is estimated to
be close to zero), and the initial increase in capital capacity utilization, which boosts the
marginal productivity of labor. The positive comovement of output, consumption, invest-
ment, and hours in response to anticipated changes in the permanent component of TFP is
in line with the empirical evidence presented in Beaudry and Portier (2006). In this respect,
therefore, the model with Jaimovich-Rebelo preferences improves upon the predictions of
the baseline model. However, like the baseline model, the current specification continues
to predict counter factually a decline in the price of installed capital in response to the
announcement of future permanent increases in TFP.
   Table 6 reports marginal data densities for the models with baseline preferences and
Jaimovich-Rebelo preferences. The marginal data densities are computed using Geweke’s
modified harmonic mean estimations for various truncation values and a Markov chain of 4
million draws for each specification. The table shows that the data favors the model with
Jaimovich-Rebelo preferences. The log Bayes factor, given by the difference between the two
log marginal data densities, is about 180 and stable across truncation values.

10     Conclusion
In this paper, we perform a Bayesian estimation of a dynamic general equilibrium model to
assess the importance of anticipated and unanticipated shocks as sources of macroeconomic
fluctuations. Our theoretical environment is a neoclassical growth model augmented with
four real rigidities: habit formation in consumption, habit formation in leisure, investment
adjustment costs, and variable capacity utilization.
   We consider four different sources of uncertainty, stationary neutral productivity shocks,
non-stationary neutral productivity shocks, permanent investment-specific technology shocks,
and government spending shocks. Each of these four sources of uncertainty features an unan-
ticipated component and components anticipated one, two, and three quarters.
    Our central finding is that at least two thirds of the variance of output growth and other
key macroeconomic variables is attributable to anticipated disturbances. Our results are
robust to assuming preferences that feature a low wealth elasticity of labor supply like those
suggested in a recent paper by Jaimovich and Rebelo (2008). Specifically, we find that in
the context of a model with this type of preferences anticipated shocks explain about 80
percent of the predicted variance of macroeconomic aggregates. An important byproduct of
the present study is to provide a Bayesian estimate of the parameter governing the wealth
elasticity of labor supply within this family of preferences. We find that the data favor a
preference specification displaying a near zero wealth elasticity of labor supply.
   To conclude, we relate our work to the early contributions on quantitative equilibrium
business cycle theory. The seminal work of Prescott (1986) argued that the majority of
business-cycle fluctuations in the postwar U.S. economy is attributable to exogenous sto-
chastic variations in total factor productivity. Our results are in line with this assessment.
Indeed, we find that neutral productivity shocks explain the vast majority of fluctuations
at business cycle frequency. Specifically, we estimate that stationary and non-stationary
neutral productivity shocks explain about two thirds and one third of business-cycle fluctua-
tions, respectively. On the other hand, we estimate that investment specific and government
spending shocks play a negligible role. However, by construction, Prescott allocated all in-
novations in total factor productivity to unanticiapted components. The contribution of the
present study can be interpreted as opening the door for the possibility that innovations
in total factor productivity be anticipated at least in part by economic agents. The cen-
tral finding of our investigation is that allowing for this possibility is not only relevant but
uncovers the dominant source of business-cycle fluctuations.
