                                               ABSTRACT

We present a hedonic framework to estimate U.S. households’ preferences over local climates, using
detailed weather and 2000 Census data. We find that Americans favor an average daily temperature
of 65 degrees Fahrenheit, will pay more on the margin to avoid excess heat than cold, and are not substantially
more averse to extremes than to temperatures that are merely uncomfortable. These preferences vary
by location due to sorting or adaptation. Changes in climate amenities under business-as- usual predictions
imply annual welfare losses of 1 to 3 percent of income by 2100, holding technology and preferences
constant.

 The chemistry of the human body makes our health and comfort sensitive to climate.

Every day, climate influences human activity, including diet, chores, recreation, and con-

versation. Households spend considerable amounts on housing, energy, clothing, and

travel to protect themselves from extreme climates and to enjoy comfortable moderation.

Geographically, climate impacts the desirability of different locations and the quality of

life they offer; few seek to live in the freezing tundra or oppressively hot deserts. Given

the undeniable influence climate has on economic decisions and welfare, we seek to es-

timate the dollar value American households place on climate amenities, including

sunshine, precipitation, humidity, and especially temperature.

  Valuing climate amenities not only helps us to understand how climate affects welfare

and where people live, but also helps to inform policy responses to climate change. Glob-

al climate change threatens to alter local climates, most obviously by raising

temperatures. A priori, the welfare impacts of higher temperatures are ambiguous: house-

holds may suffer from hotter summers but benefit from milder winters. Ultimately, these

impacts depend on where households are located, the changes in climate amenities they

experience, and how much they value these changes.

  In this paper, we estimate the value of climate amenities in the United States by exam-

ining how households’ willingness to pay (WTP) to live in different areas varies with

climate in the cross-section. Following the intuition laid out by Rosen (1974, 1979) and

Roback (1982), and later refined by Albouy (2011), we measure WTP by developing a

local quality-of-life (QOL) index based on how much households pay in costs-of-living

relative to the incomes they receive. The U.S. is a particularly appropriate setting in

which to use this method as it has a large population that is mobile over areas with di-

verse climates. Globally, the U.S. lies in a temperate zone, with some areas that are quite

hot (Arizona) while others are quite cold (Minnesota), and some with extreme seasonality

                                            1
(Missouri) while others are mild year-round (coastal California). This variation allows us

to identify preferences over a broad range of habitable climates.

  We adopt this hedonic approach as there are no explicit markets for climate amenities,

only an implicit market based on household location choices. Our estimates of amenity

values primarily reflect impacts of exposure to climate on comfort, activity, and health,

including time use (Graff Zivin and Neidell 2012) and mortality risk (Barreca et al. 2013,
Deschênes and Greenstone 2011). They exclude costs from residential heating, cooling,

and insulation. As such, the value of the climate amenities we estimate does not appear in

national income accounts, and so neither would the impact of climate change on these

amenities. Our study therefore complements work that assesses how climate directly af-

fects national income through agricultural and urban productivity (for a survey of the

climate and productivity literature, see Tol 2002 and 2009).

  We adopt a cross-sectional estimation strategy in the tradition of Mendelsohn et al.

(1994) rather than a time-series panel approach for several reasons. First, yearly changes

in weather are unlikely to affect households’ WTP to live in an area: WTP should depend

on long-run climate rather than the outcome of the weather in the most recent year. Sec-

ond, low frequency changes are not very informative as long-run secular climate changes

so far have been slight, particularly relative to changes in technology—especially air

conditioning (Barreca et al. 2013)—and local economic conditions. Third, Kuminoff and

Pope (2012) have shown that temporal changes in the capitalization of amenities do not

typically translate to measures of WTP. Finally, households can mitigate potential damag-

es from climate through adaptation—say, by insulating homes, changing wardrobes, or

adopting new activities—which cross-sectional methods account for, thereby making our

estimates more relevant for assessing the impact of climate change.



                                             2
  An unavoidable drawback of our estimation strategy is that it requires climate ameni-

ties to be uncorrelated with the influence unobserved local amenities have on QOL. This

untestable assumption is hard to circumvent, as there do not appear to be any viable in-

strumental variables for climate. Instead, we examine the potential for omitted viable bias

by testing the robustness of our estimates to an array of specifications and powerful con-

trols, following the intuition laid out by Altonji et al. (2005) and the literature on

agricultural yields and farmland values (Schlenker et al. 2006, Deschênes and Greenstone

2007, Schlenker and Roberts 2009, Deschênes and Greenstone 2012, and Fisher et al.

2012).1 While the stability of our estimates across these specifications is reassuring, we

nonetheless acknowledge that our research design cannot conclusively rule out the possi-

bility that unobserved factors at least partially explain our results.

  Prior hedonic studies investigating U.S. climate preferences have been few and con-

flicting. Estimates of WTP for incremental warming range from positive (Hoch and

Drake 1974, Moore 1998), to approximately zero (Nordhaus 1996), to negative (Cragg

and Kahn 1997 and 1999, Kahn 2009, Sinha and Cropper 2013).2 Our paper makes three

contributions to this literature. First, following Albouy (2011), our QOL estimates ac-

count for local expenditures beyond housing and net out federal taxes from local wage
differences. 3 We show that previous work, by ignoring these factors, over-emphasized

differences in wages relative to local costs in measuring QOL, which can lead to noisy


  1
     Deschênes and Greenstone (2007, 2012) argue that cross-sectional agricultural damage estimates are
not robust to minor changes in the econometric specification, while Schlenker et al. (2006), Schlenker and
Roberts (2009), and Fisher et al. (2012) argue the opposite.
   2
     Hedonic studies focusing on countries other than the U.S. include Maddison and Bigano (2003) in Italy,
Rehdanz (2006) in Great Britain, Rehdanz and Maddison (2009) in Germany, and Timmins (2007) in Bra-
zil. In addition, alternative non-hedonic approaches have been used to estimate the impact of climate
change on amenities. Shapiro and Smith (1981) and Maddison (2003) use a household production function
approach, Fritjers and Van Praag (1998) use hypothetical equivalence scales, and Rehdanz and Maddison
(2005) link a panel of self-reported happiness across 67 countries to temperature and precipitation.

     We also account for commuting costs and, in some specifications, for population flows.

and misleading estimates of climate valuations. Second, we characterize climates using

the full distribution of realized daily temperatures rather than seasonal or monthly aver-

ages, allowing us to explore how households value progressively extreme temperatures.

Prior research into climate amenities has ignored the importance of flexibly modeling
temperature profiles, even though other research has shown that extreme temperatures,

not averages, are especially harmful to crop yields (Schlenker et al. 2006, Schlenker and

Roberts 2009) and health (Deschênes and Greenstone 2011). Third, following methods

introduced by Bajari and Benkard (2005), we model unobserved heterogeneity in house-

holds’ preferences, thereby allowing for sorting based on differences in (dis)taste for cold

or heat and for adaptation to local climates. We show that all three innovations are conse-

quential in obtaining preferences for climate.

  Our estimates of climate preferences yield four main results. First, we find that Ameri-

cans most prefer average temperatures (average of daily high and low) near 65 degrees

Fahrenheit (°F), agreeing with standard degree-day models that predict little need for

heating or cooling at this temperature.4 Second, on the margin, households pay more to

avoid a degree of excess heat than a degree of excess cold. Third, we find that the mar-

ginal WTP (MWTP) to avoid extreme temperatures is not substantially greater than the
MWTP to avoid moderate heat and cold. Put another way, households will pay more to a

turn a moderately cold day into a perfect day than to turn a bitterly cold day into a mod-

erately cold day. This finding is consistent with evidence that households reduce their

time outdoors as temperatures become uncomfortable, reducing their sensitivity to further

temperature changes (Graff Zivin and Neidell 2012). Fourth, we find that households in

the South are particularly averse to cold. This result is consistent with models of both res-

      We define and discuss heating and cooling degree days in section II below.
                                                      4
idential sorting and adaptation. Conversely, we do not find evidence that southern house-

holds are less heat-averse than northern households.
    We apply our estimated climate preferences by simulating how climate change may

impact welfare by improving or reducing the value of climate amenities. For our climate

change forecast, we rely primarily on the business-as-usual A2 scenario used in the Inter-

governmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) fourth assessment report (2007), which

predicts an 8.3°F increase in U.S. temperatures by 2100. Our simulated welfare effects

are predicated on technology and preferences remaining constant and are therefore best

interpreted as a benchmark case.5 We view endogenizing technology and preferences as

beyond the scope of this paper’s climate change application, and we leave this issue for

future work.

    We project that on average, Americans would pay 1 to 3 percent of their annual income

to avoid forecasted climate change. While damages are rather severe in the South, we

find that most areas in the North also suffer because: (1) they lose many pleasant summer

days in exchange for only moderately warmer winter days, and (2) Northerners are will-

ing to pay less to reduce cold than are Southerners. Welfare impacts are reduced slightly

when we model migration responses.
    Below, we first discuss the model we use to derive local QOL estimates from wages

and housing costs. Section II describes the current and projected climate data, and section

III presents estimates of climate preferences assuming preferences are homogenous.

These results provide a baseline for section IV, which allows for heterogeneous prefer-

ences. Section V then discusses the implications of our preference estimates for climate

 The constant technology and preferences assumption is common to most estimates of climate change
damages, including the agricultural and health literatures referenced above.

change impacts. Section VI considers alternative models of QOL, and section VII con-

cludes.



                         I. Hedonic Estimates of Quality of Life
  The intuition underlying our approach is that households pay higher prices and accept

lower wages to live in areas with desirable climate amenities. Below we discuss the he-

donic framework underlying this intuition, how we calculate wage and cost of living

differences across areas, and how we combine these to create a single-index QOL meas-

ure for each location. Our approach is rooted in the conceptual framework of Rosen

(1974, 1979) and Roback (1982) and adopts important recent contributions to this

framework from the hedonic literature. In particular, we follow Albouy (2011) to properly

weight wages and housing prices when creating the QOL measure, and we adopt Bajari

and Benkard (2005) to allow for preference heterogeneity. These innovations ultimately

prove to be consequential in obtaining preferences for climate, as we discuss further be-

low.


          A. A model of QOL using local cost of living and wage differentials
  The U.S. economy consists of locations, indexed by j, which trade with each other and

share a population of perfectly mobile, price-taking households, indexed by i. 6 These

households have preferences over two consumption goods: a traded numeraire good x and

a non-traded "home" good y, with local price 𝑝 that determines local cost of living.

Households earn wage income 𝑤 that is location-dependent and own portfolios of land



  6
    In section VI below, we present results that relax the perfect mobility assumption (and allow for heter-
ogeneous returns to skill) via a procedure based on Dahl (2002). We have also estimated a model that
allows for mobility costs per estimates from Notowidigdo (2012). Doing so has only a minor impact on es-
timated preferences and welfare impacts.
                                                     6
and capital that pay a combined income of Ri. Gross household income is 𝑚 = 𝑅 + 𝑤 ,

out of which households pay federal taxes of 𝜏(𝑚 ). Federal revenues are rebated lump

sum.7

  Each location is characterized by a K-dimensional vector of observable amenities Zj,

including climate, and a scalar characteristic ξj that is observable to households but not

econometricians.8 We assume a continuum of locations so that the set of available charac-
                                                              K 1 9
teristics (Z, ξ) is a complete, compact subset of                 . Each household i seeks out the

location j that maximizes its utility, given by 𝑢 = 𝑉 (𝑝 , 𝑤 , 𝒁 , ξ ). This indirect utility

function is assumed to be continuous and differentiable in all its arguments, strictly in-

creasing in wi and ξj, and strictly decreasing in pj. Households are permitted to have

heterogeneous preferences over (Z, ξ).

  On the supply side, we assume that firms face perfectly competitive input and output

prices and earn zero profits, offering higher wage levels in more productive locations. We

model each household i's wage in location j as φiwj, where φi is household-specific skill

and wj is the local wage level.10

  Let 𝒑(𝒁 , 𝜉 ) and 𝒘(𝒁 , 𝜉 ) denote the functions relating wages and prices to local

characteristics. These functions are determined in equilibrium by households’ demands



  7
     We also apply adjustments for state taxes and tax-benefits to owner occupied housing, discussed in Al-
bouy (2011), which prove to be minor in practice.
   8
     This set up omits an idiosyncratic unobserved preference shock εij from households’ utility function.
Relaxing this assumption implies that the QOL measure may depend not just on prices and wages but also
on population levels or changes. We allow for such dependence in some of our specifications as discussed
below (for example, by adjusting our wage estimates for migration per Dahl (2002)), none of which sub-
stantially alters our conclusions. See Albouy (2011) for a more general discussion of addressing
idiosyncratic preferences in QOL estimates.
   9
     In our empirical implementation, this completeness assumption is an approximation, since we examine
a finite, though large, number of U.S. PUMAs. We discuss how this assumption can be relaxed in section
IV and Appendix 4 via a set identification procedure.
   10
      By using a single index of skill, we abstract away from the possibility that some households have a
comparative advantage in certain locations. Relaxing this assumption has implications similar to those for
allowing an idiosyncratic unobserved preference shock (see footnote 8 above).
                                                    7
for local amenities, firms’ location decisions, and the availability of land.11 On the de-

mand side, household utility maximization implies the following first-order condition for

each characteristic k:

            1 V ( p j , w j , Z j ,  j ) p j y j  ln p( Z j ,  j ) w j (1   ')  ln w( Z j ,  j )
                   i                            i                       i

(1)                                        i                         
           mij  ì     Z k                 mj          Z k                mij           Z k

where λi is the marginal utility of income and 𝜏′ is the average marginal tax rate on labor

income. This equation relates household i’s marginal valuation of characteristic k, as a

fraction of income, to differential changes in the logarithms of the cost of living and wage

differentials at j.

  Operationally, we develop a QOL index to indicate the willingness-to-pay of house-

holds, averaged by income, from the right-hand side of (1). This measure at j, denoted 𝑄̂ ,

is a weighted combination of 𝑝̂ and 𝑤
                                    ̂ , the differentials in log housing-costs and wages

relative to the U.S. income-weighted average, according to the formula

(2)                           Qˆ j  s y pˆ j  (1   ')sw wˆ j  0.33 pˆ j  0.50wˆ j

where sy denotes the average share of income spent on local goods and sw the average

share of income from wages.12 The second equality substitutes in values for these param-
eters of 𝑠 = 0.33, 𝑠 = 0.75, and 𝜏 = 0.33 . For additional details, including the

incorporation of local non-housing expenditures into sy, see Albouy (2011).



  11
       The existence and differentiability of 𝒑(𝒁 , 𝜉 ) and 𝒘(𝒁 , 𝜉 ) hold under mild conditions. Rosen
demonstrates the existence and differentiability of the quality of life function ̂ (𝒁 , 𝜉 ) under the assump-
tions on demand given here and perfectly competitive land supply, while Bajari and Benkard (2005) show
that a Lipshitz condition on 𝑉 (𝑝 , 𝑤 , 𝒁 , ξ ) is sufficient even under imperfect competition. Given this re-
sult, the separate existence and differentiability of 𝒑(𝒁 , 𝜉 ) and 𝒘(𝒁 , 𝜉 ) are given by the separate
mobility conditions on households and firms and an assumption that local productivity differentials are
continuous and differentiable in Zj and ξj.
   12
      In secondary specifications (columns VI and VII of Table 6) we allow these shares to vary by educa-
tional attainment.
                                                         8
  Let ̂ (𝒁 , 𝜉 ) denote QOL as a function of local characteristics, per (2) and the func-
tions 𝒑(𝒁 , 𝜉 ) and 𝒘(𝒁 , 𝜉 ) . Then, by condition (1), for any household i in j, the

marginal willingness to pay (MWTP) for characteristic k is equal to the derivative of
̂ (𝒁 , 𝜉 ) with respect to k:

                            1 V ( p j , w j , Z j ,  j ) Qˆ ( Z j ,  j )
                                   i

                           mij  i     Z k                    Z k

  Condition (3) is illustrated in Figure 1 in the case of a single characteristic, average

summer temperature Ts. The bold line denotes a hypothetical function ̂ (𝑇 ) that is de-

creasing in Ts, indicating that milder weather is “paid for” through either higher housing

prices or lower wages. The slope of ̂ (𝑇 ) at any given location is the hedonic price for a

marginal increase in temperature at that location. This hedonic price is equal to house-

holds’ MWTP for Ts at that location, as shown for locations A and B on the figure. As

shown, households at A have a higher MWTP to avoid heat than do households at B, con-

sistent with sorting or adaptation.



            B. Estimates of wage and housing cost differentials, and QOL
  We follow Albouy (2011) to estimate wage and housing-cost differentials using the 5

percent sample of Census data from the 2000 Integrated Public Use Microdata Series

(IPUMS). Geographically, these data are available by Public Use Microdata Areas (PU-

MAs), which contain populations of 100,000–300,000 and form the main unit of our

analysis. We summarize this procedure below; for more details see Albouy (2011).

  We calculate wage differentials by PUMA, 𝑤
                                           ̂ , using the logarithm of hourly wages for

full-time workers aged 25 to 55 and controlling for observable skill and occupation dif-

ferences across workers. Specifically, we regress the log wage of worker i on PUMA-

so that they reflect wages by place-of-work rather than place-of-residence, netting out dif-

ferences in commuting costs.

  Our model interprets the 𝑤
                           ̂ as the causal effect of a PUMA’s characteristics on a work-

er's wage, while the observable and unobservable skill differences across workers, the
X iw and  ijw , are an analogue to the φi factors in the model. This interpretation requires
that any sorting of workers across locations based on unobserved skills or a spatial match

component of wages does not substantially affect observed wage premia. This assump-

tion receives mixed support in the literature. Glaeser and Maré (2001) and Baum-Snow

and Pavan (2012) find that unobserved skill and match-based sorting contribute little to

city-size wage premia; however, Gyourko, Mayer, and Sinai (2013) find that a select

group of “superstar cities” may disproportionately attract high-skilled workers. Dahl

(2002) finds that selective migration biases estimates of the returns to education (though

not the range of returns across states), and Kennan and Walker (2011) finds a role for lo-

cation-specific job matches in migration decisions.

  In light of the uncertainty in the literature, we address the potential for skill and match-

based sorting in a series of alternative specifications. First, we adopt the method used in

Dahl (2002) to adjust our wage estimates 𝑤
                                         ̂ for selective migration by including a flexi-

ble control function of migration probabilities in our wage equation. Second, in a closely

related specification, we directly adjust our QOL estimates for each PUMA using the

PUMA’s rate of net in-migration between 1990 and 2000 (in percent) and a mobility cost

estimate from Notowidigdo (2012). Finally, we guard against effects from “superstar cit-

                                                10
ies” by estimating a specification in which superstar metropolitan areas (as defined in

Gyourko, Mayer, and Sinai (2013)) are dropped from the sample. These specifications are

described in more detail in section VI below and ultimately yield estimates of climate

preferences and welfare effects that are not qualitatively different from our baseline esti-

mates.
  To calculate housing cost differentials, we use housing values and gross rents, includ-

ing utilities. Following previous studies, we convert housing values to imputed rents at a

discount rate of 7.85 percent (Peiser and Smith 1985) and add in utility costs to make

them comparable to gross rents.13 We then calculate housing-cost differentials with a re-

gression of rents on flexible controls Yij (each interacted with renter status) for size,

rooms, acreage, commercial use, kitchen and plumbing facilities, type and age of build-

ing, and the number of residents per room. This regression takes the form
ln pij  Yij  p   jp   ijp . The estimates of the  jp are then used as PUMA-level housing

cost differentials 𝑝̂ . Proper identification of housing-cost differences requires that aver-

age unobserved housing quality does not vary systematically across locations.

  We incorporate energy and insulation costs in our housing-cost measure because doing

so allows us to interpret our QOL differentials as solely reflecting the value of nonmarket

climate amenities rather than the effect of climate on utility costs. Hence, our QOL dif-

ferentials will reflect the disamenity of outdoor exposure to climate and the disamenity of

adverse indoor temperatures to the extent they are not completely mitigated by insulation

and energy use. In addition, the QOL estimates will incorporate any disamenity from

spending more time indoors to avoid uncomfortable outdoor temperatures.




  13
    This approach follows the standard practice in the QOL literature from Blomquist et al. (1988) to
Chen and Rosenthal (2008) and is required by the data because utility costs are included in gross rents.
                                                  11
  Descriptive statistics for QOL are given at the bottom of Table 1,14 and QOL differen-

tials across PUMAs for the year 2000 are mapped in Figure 2. These estimates show that

households find the amenities in urban areas, coastal locations, and certain mountain are-

as to be quite desirable. Areas in the middle of the country, where seasons are more ex-

extreme, tend to be less desirable, although the variation is considerable. As discussed in

Albouy (2011), our QOL estimates correlate well with non-economic measures of QOL,

such as the “livability” rankings in the Places Rated Almanac (Savageau 1999). Moreo-

ver, the QOL model correctly predicts the relationship between housing costs and wages,

controlling for observable amenities.



                                                 II. Data
  We estimate our main specifications at the PUMA-level using 2,057 PUMAs covering

the contiguous 48 states as of the 2000 census.15 In this section, we summarize our da-

taset, covering recent historical climate, climate-change projections, and other variables.

Additional details are provided in Appendix 2.



                                 A. Recent historical climate data
  Our daily temperature data over 1970–1999 originate from Schlenker and Roberts

(2009), which provides historic daily temperatures at a 4 kilometer-square resolution.

From these data, we create temperature bins with a width of 0.9ºF (0.5ºC) and calculate

the average number of days at each 4 kilometer grid point, over 1970–1999, in which the

  14
     The mean QOL differential is not exactly zero in Table 1 because the table shows unweighted data,
while QOL differentials are defined so that the income-weighted mean is zero.
  15
     We have also aggregated our data to the msa-level and run some of our empirical specifications at an
msa-level resolution. The point estimates for preferences and climate change welfare impacts are similar to
those discussed below, with modestly larger standard errors (see Appendix Table A1.1, column R13). We
believe that the msa-level results are less precise because msas are frequently too large to capture important
micro-climates, particularly in densely-populated coastal areas such as San Francisco.
                                                     12
average temperature—calculated as the mean of the daily high and low—fell within each
bin. Within each PUMA, we average the bin distribution at each grid point to yield a

PUMA-level dataset.

  We obtain monthly precipitation and humidity data from the Parameter elevation Re-

gressions on Independent Slopes Model at the same grid points for 1970–1999, averaging

them by month-of-year at the PUMA-level. We obtain sunshine data, measured as the

percent of daylight hours for which the sun is not obscured by clouds, by month-of-year

from 156 weather stations from the National Climactic Data Center. We interpolate PU-

MA-level data on sunshine from the four closest weather stations.



                                B. Projected climate data
  Predicted climate change data (temperatures, precipitation, humidity, and sunshine) are

from the third release of the Community Climate System Model. These data were also

used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Assessment Report 4 (IPCC

AR4) released in 2007. We use two business-as-usual scenarios in which no actions to re-

duce greenhouse gas emissions are taken: the A2 scenario and the A1FI scenario. In both

models, data are provided at a resolution of 1.4 degrees longitude (120 km) by 1.4 de-

grees latitude (155 km), so we interpolate these data to the PUMA level. The A2 scenario

predicts average (population-weighted) U.S. warming of 8.3ºF from the baseline (1970-

1999) to the end of the century (2090-2099), while the A1FI scenario predicts warming of

9.6ºF. We focus on the A2 scenario but also provide results for A1FI.

  Data for present and projected (A2 model) climate variables are given in the top half of

Table 1, which summarizes temperature distributions using annual heating degree days

(HDD) and cooling degree days (CDD) statistics. HDD is a measure of how cold a loca-

tion is: it equals the sum, over all days of the year in which it is colder than 65ºF, of the

                                             13
difference between 65ºF and each day’s temperature. CDD, a measure of heat, is defined

similarly for temperatures greater than 65ºF. HDD and CDD are often used by engineers

as predictors of heating and cooling loads, and since Graves (1979) they have often been

used as measures of climate amenities.
  According to the CCSM model predictions, the effects of climate change will be mani-

fest primarily through changes in temperature, as shown in Table 1. The average U.S.

PUMA will see its number of HDDs fall by 36% and its number of CDDs rise by 113%

under the A2 scenario. In contrast, changes to precipitation, relative humidity, and sun-

shine are forecast to be minor on average. 16 The predicted temperature changes vary

considerably by geography, as shown in Figure 3. While substantial increases in both

January and July temperatures are predicted nationwide, the interior South is forecasted

to experience a particularly large increase in days for which the average temperature ex-

ceeds 90ºF.



                                         C. Other variables
  Table 1 also presents data on the control variables in our econometric specifications.

The geographic controls, used in all estimates, include the minimum distances from each
PUMA’s centroid to an ocean and Great Lakes coastline, as well as the average slope of

the land, to measure hilliness. Demographic data include measures of population densi-

ty, 17 educational attainment, age, and racial-ethnic composition. Table 1 also provides

statistics on the distribution of population across PUMAs and on the QOL measure.

  16
      Some areas are forecast to have appreciable changes, though these cancel out on average. Also note
that our study is meant to capture the impact of precipitation on QOL, not water supply.
   17
      We use population density rather than population because PUMAs are drawn to have similar popula-
tions. Our population density measure is “weighted” in the sense that, within each PUMA, we calculate the
population density of each of its census tracts and then take a population-weighted average of these densi-
ties. We feel that this weighted density gives a better sense of the population density experienced by
households in the PUMA than does a conventional unweighted measure.

       III. Estimation of WTP for Climate under Homogenous Preferences
                                           A. Specification
  We begin by estimating a simple hedonic model in which we assume that climate pref-
erences are homogenous across the U.S. population and that factors (including climate)

affecting QOL enter linearly. While this model is highly restrictive, it provides an intui-

tive introduction to our approach that resembles the previous literature, and it provides a

benchmark against which we can later compare a model that allows for preference heter-

ogeneity.

  We estimate the impact of marginal changes to climate on QOL using an OLS regres-

sion of each PUMA j’s QOL differential 𝑄̂ on vectors of climate variables 𝑿 and other

local characteristics 𝑫 :

(4)                                       Qˆ j  βX j  γD j   j

  The parameters β and γ represent the WTP of households for an additional unit of each

element of X j and D j respectively, measured as a fraction of income. The disturbance

term ξj is a vertical location characteristic that is observed by households but not by the

econometrician. We face two substantial challenges in estimating (4). First, we must se-
lect a functional form for how the climate variables – and in particular the temperature

distribution – enter into Xj. Our goal is to use a form that is both flexible and capable of

providing precise estimates.18 Second, consistent estimation of β and γ requires that un-

observed factors ξj be uncorrelated with 𝑿 and 𝑫 . In the absence of instrumental


  18
     We could in principle model rainfall, humidity, and sunshine as flexible distributions, as we do with
temperature. We instead simply include these variables as linear regressors, for two reasons. First, these
three variables are highly collinear even when entered linearly; allowing for substantial nonlinearities only
exacerbates this problem. Second, we wish to focus primarily on temperatures, given that in our climate
change application only temperatures change substantially.
                                                    15
variables, orthogonality between ξj and 𝑿 is a necessary assumption that cannot be test-
ed. We therefore assess the reliability of our estimates of β by studying their sensitivity to

a variety of alternative specifications. Ultimately, we view the estimates’ robustness

across these regressions as arguing in favor of their interpretation as preference parame-

ters, but it is important to caveat that these results cannot definitively rule out the

presence of confounding factors.

  We model the WTP for exposure to an additional day at temperature t, relative to a day

at 65°F, as the function f(t).19 65°F is a natural normalization point because conventional

HDD and CDD calculations treat 65°F as a “bliss point” at which neither heating nor

cooling is required. If discomfort from heat and cold, in terms of WTP, follow HDD and

CDD, then f(t) is a two-piece linear function with the kink point at 65°F. One of our ob-

jectives is to test whether f(t) follows this functional form.

  Given our data, the most flexible possible model for f(t) would include a dummy varia-

ble for each 0.9°F temperature bin, in which each coefficient would signify a WTP

relative to the bin containing 65°F. This model is impractical, however, as we have too

little data to provide estimates that are precise enough to be meaningful.20 Instead, we

model f(t) using cubic splines per (5)




  19
      This specification, under homogenous preferences, disallows a preference for “seasonality”, which
would be manifest as a lower WTP to avoid heat (cold) in a location with severe winters (summers). Pref-
erences for seasonality are, however, captured by our heterogeneous preference specification, which allows
the MWTP for any temperature bin to vary with the distribution of realized temperatures. Overall, we do
not find strong evidence of a preference for seasonality, as shown in Appendix Figure A1.1, which plots the
MWTP for 40ºF and 80ºF as functions of CDD and HDD. These plots would be upward-sloping in the
presence of a preference for seasonality.
   20
      We have experimented with wider bins and found that bins approximately 10ºF wide are necessary to
achieve a reasonable degree of precision. In Table A1.1 of robustness tests in the Appendix, column R12
shows that such a binned specification yields similar numerical results to those discussed below. Overall,
however, we find the continuous splines more appealing because we do not believe that human comfort
changes discontinuously every ten degrees.

in which S1 (t ) through S S (t ) are standard basis functions of a cubic B-spline of degree
S. We space the knots of the basis functions evenly on the cdf of the population-weighted

average temperature distribution.21 This spacing, rather than even spacing over the un-

weighted temperature support, clusters the nodes in the center of the distribution where

the data are richest, improving flexibility in this region.

  Defining Njt as the average number of days per year at location j for which the average

temperature is between t and t + 0.9, we flexibly estimate climate preferences by substi-

tuting into (4) the product of the spline function in (5) with Njt, summed over all

temperature bins:

             Qˆ j   N jt f (t )   r Rain j   h Humid j   s Sun j    D j   j

                    s 1     t



  As a reference case, we include in 𝑫 the “full set” of both geographic and demograph-

ic controls described above. In all of our regressions, we weight each PUMA

(observation) by its population.22 For inference, we use standard errors that are clustered
to allow for arbitrary spatial correlation of residuals across PUMAs within each state

(Arellano 1987, Wooldridge 2003).23


  21
      The support of the contiguous U.S. temperature distribution ranges from -39.1ºF to 111.2ºF, covering
167 0.9ºF bins. For a cubic spline of degree S, there are S – 2 nodes, including the nodes at the endpoints.
   22
      As shown in Appendix Table A1.1, column R11, this weighting does not materially affect the esti-
mates.
   23
      We have also experimented with clustering at the metropolitan statistical area (msa) level (in which
PUMAs that are not part of an msa are clustered within each state) and census division level. These ap-
proaches lead to estimated standard errors that are only slightly smaller and larger, respectively, than those
presented here. When clustering on census divisions (of which there are nine) we use the cluster wild boot-
strap to improve small sample performance (Cameron et al. 2008). This specification is displayed in
column R14 of Appendix Table A1.1.

                      B. Homogenous preference WTP estimates
Estimating the shape of f(t)

  Figure 4 presents estimated WTP curves for 5th through 10th degree splines given our
reference case controls described in Section III.A. These plots also depict, for reference,

the present and future (2090–2099, A2 scenario) U.S. population-weighted average tem-

perature distributions. While the 5th degree spline appears too restrictive, and the 10th de-

degree too noisy, several regularities emerge from the set of plots. First, the WTP curves

consistently have an interior maximum near 65ºF. We view this result—which is driven

by the data and not “forced” by our QOL variable or functional form—as an important

validation of our model and empirical strategy, since it accords with the intuition underly-

ing HDD and CDD that WTP is maximized at 65ºF. Second, there are too few days with

average temperatures over 90ºF to permit precise inference over this range, as evinced by

the extremely wide standard error bands. Third, it appears that WTP departs non-linearly

away from 65ºF, undermining the restriction from the HDD/CDD model that f(t) is linear.

In particular, the slopes of the WTP curves tend to be steep on either side of 65ºF but then

level off at more extreme temperatures. Fourth, the decline in WTP away from 65ºF is
steeper on the right than on the left, meaning there is a greater WTP to avoid heat than to

avoid cold.

  The result that WTP declines less steeply over extreme temperatures accords with the

intuition that households protect themselves from extremes by taking shelter in climate-

controlled environments. Once the temperature is sufficiently uncomfortable that house-

holds spend little time outside, further increases in extreme temperature are less

important. This result is consistent with research by Graff Zivin and Neidell (2012) that

uses time-diary data to show that households spend less time outside in cold or hot

                                             18
weather. It contrasts with the Schlenker and Roberts (2009) result that crop yields are se-

verely reduced by extreme heat, following the logic that humans can take shelter inside

while crops cannot.

  The result that, on the margin, increases in heat are worse than increases in cold also
follows intuition. Individuals can adapt to cold by wearing more clothing. However, op-

tions for thermoregulation are more limited in hot conditions.

  The imprecision of our estimates at the extremes of the temperature distribution inhibit

the ability of spline-estimated WTP functions to inform the welfare effects of climate

change. This is true especially at the high end: days exceeding 90ºF are rare at present but

common in climate change projections. To address this issue, we examine two functional

forms that maintain flexibility in the interior of the temperature distribution while project-

ing WTP at the far extremes.24 The first is a restricted 7th degree cubic spline, with WTP

assumed to be constant over the extreme 1% of realized temperatures. 25 The second is a

four-piece linear spline, with kink points at 45ºF, 65ºF, and 80ºF, allowing for a projection

of decreasing WTP over extreme temperatures.26 This second specification permits more

straightforward hypothesis testing of how WTP changes over the temperature distribu-

tion.



  24
      We are not the first to confront the issue of conducting inference at temperatures near and beyond the
limit of what is realized in present-day data. Prior work in the crop yield and health literatures has assumed
that the damage function is constant beyond the point at which inference is no longer feasible (Deschênes
and Greenstone 2007 and 2008, Schlenker and Roberts 2009). The first of our two restricted specifica-
tions—a 7th degree cubic spline with a restriction that MWTP is constant at the extremes—accords with
this prior practice.
   25
      Specifically, we impose constant WTP over the bottom 0.5% and top 0.5% of the population-weighted
temperature distribution. We apply this imposition after estimating the full 7th degree spline rather than be-
forehand, as reversing the order leads to unstable estimates at the cutoff points. We focus on a 7 th degree
spline because it visually appears to strike a balance between flexibility and precision. Using 6th or 8th de-
gree splines instead does not substantially affect the results.
   26
      The choices of 45ºF and 80ºF tend to yield the best fit to the data (per R 2) in most specifications. Al-
ternative choices such as 50ºF or 75ºF do not substantially impact the preference or welfare estimates.
                                                     19
  Panels A and B of Figure 5, and columns I and II of Table 2, present results for both

specifications, controlling for both geography and demographics. In both specifications,
WTP declines more steeply as temperatures increase away from 65ºF than as they de-

crease from 65ºF. With the linear spline, we reject a null hypothesis that the magnitudes

of the slopes on either side of 65ºF are equal with a p-value of 0.007. Both splines exhibit

flatter slopes over the extremes than over the center of the distribution, particularly on the

cold side of 65ºF. For the linear spline, the change in slope at the 45ºF kink point is statis-

tically significant (p = 0.056), though the change in slope at 80ºF is not (p = 0.534).

  Thus, while we have some confidence in the result that extreme cold is not substantial-

ly more disamenable than moderate cold, the lack of statistical power over extremely hot

days means that we cannot say the same about extreme versus moderate heat. 27 The re-

stricted cubic and linear spline specifications can therefore be viewed as two plausible

alternatives. The former is conservative in assessing the WTP to avoid extreme heat be-

cause it assumes that WTP is constant over this range, whereas the linear spline model is

more aggressive as it extrapolates the (negative) slope of the WTP function outside of the

observed temperature range.



Non-temperature climate variables, controls, and robustness

  The results in columns I and II of Table 2 indicate that households have a strong prefer-

ence for sunshine, a mild preference for precipitation, and no statistically significant taste

for humidity. Due to multi-collinearity, it is difficult to disentangle preferences for these

three climate variables: locations that are very sunny also tend to be dry and non-humid.28


  27
      The linear spline projection is sufficiently imprecise to the right of 80ºF that we also cannot reject the
hypothesis that WTP is constant over this range (p = 0.179).
   28
      Amongst the geographic control variables, we estimate strong tastes for hilliness (average land slope),
a taste for proximity to the ocean, but no preference for proximity to a Great Lake. The estimated coeffi-
                                                      20
  The demographic controls may themselves be endogenous, as demographic groups may

have different tastes and sort accordingly.29 That said, we believe that the benefits of con-

trolling for demographics outweigh the costs. First, their inclusion substantially improves

the precision of the estimated WTP for climate. Panels C and D in Figure 5, and columns

III and IV of Table 2, present estimates of specifications that do not include the demo-

graphic variables. These specifications have notably wider WTP confidence intervals and

less than one-half the R2 of those that include demographics. Second, including demo-

graphic variables helps guard against omitted variables bias and, in this case, provides

evidence that such bias may not be a substantial concern. Although the demographic vari-

ables are powerful correlates of QOL, as evidenced by their large effect on R2, they have

only a modest effect on the estimated WTPs for the climate variables. Nor, as we discuss

in section V below, do they substantially impact our estimates of the welfare impact of

climate change. Hence, following the logic of Altonji et al. (2005), these results suggest

that if unobserved demographics substantially bias our climate preference and welfare es-

timates, they would have to be more strongly correlated with climate than the “headline”

observable demographics included in our regressions.30

cients on the demographic control variables indicate that QOL increases with population density, educa-
tional attainment, average age, and percent Hispanic, while it decreases in percent black.
   29
      The coefficient on population density is particularly difficult to interpret, since it captures unobserved
amenities that come with population density (e.g., culture and restaurants) as well as idiosyncratic house-
hold-specific valuations of a location. The former drives the coefficient on population density upward,
while the latter drives it downward (because the cost of living must fall (or wages must rise) to attract addi-
tional households). Empirically, the amenity aspects of population density appear to dominate, since we
estimate a positive coefficient on this variable. Our estimated WTP for climate is robust to excluding popu-
lation density from the specification. In section VI, we discuss the related issue of adjusting our QOL
measure to account for changes in population between 1990 and 2000.
   30
      In other settings for hedonic studies—for example, measurements of the WTP for clean air—it has
been shown that estimates are sensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of demographic controls (see, for ex-
ample, Chay and Greenstone 2005). In such cases, the source of bias is often intuitive. For example,
emitters of pollutants are often concentrated in industrial areas that tend to be populated by lower-income
households. With regard to climate, however, a source of omitted variable bias from demographics is less
obvious ex-ante because a wide range of demographic groups and urban vs. rural locations can be found in
essentially every climate zone. Our result that adding demographic variables to the specification does not
substantially affect the estimated WTP for climate accords with this intuition.
                                                      21
  Specifications that include state fixed effects (FE) along with demographics are exam-

ined in Figure 5 panels E and F, and columns V and VI of Table 2. 31 These specifications

rely solely on within-state variation in climate for identification. Despite this substantial

change in identifying variation, we still find in panel E that WTP is maximized near 65ºF.

The inclusion of state FE does result in a loss of precision and an increase in the estimat-

ed WTP to avoid cold. This increase may arise from the fact that the statistical power of

the FE estimates comes from large, populous states with a large number of PUMAs and a

broad range of climates. Thus, states like California and Texas are more influential than

states in the Northeast and Midwest. If residents of these large, warm states have sorted

because they are more averse to cold—a possibility consistent with our findings in sec-

tion IV below—this may explain the difference between the FE and non-FE estimators.

Nonetheless, the estimated WTP to avoid cold remains smaller than the estimated WTP to

avoid heat, though this difference is no longer statistically significant. The estimates are

sufficiently imprecise that the state FE estimates are not statistically significantly differ-

ent than those without FE.32

  Estimated preferences derived from additional alternative specifications are presented

in Appendix Table A1.1. These regressions explore alternative control variables, specifi-
cations for f(t), subsamples of the data (e.g., omitting superstar cities), and weighting

schemes. This table also provides estimated impacts of climate change on amenity values


  31
      As shown in Appendix Table A1.1, specification R10, using census division fixed effects rather than
state fixed effects does not result in a substantial difference relative to the non-FE estimate.
   32
      We test the null hypothesis that the state FE are uncorrelated with the climate variables via block wild
bootstrapping, clustering on state (200 repetitions). For each draw, we estimate preferences both with and
without state FE. We then use all draws to obtain a standard deviation of the difference between the estima-
tors. This procedure, unlike a traditional Hausman test, does not require that the non-FE estimator be
efficient (see Cameron et al. 2005, p. 718). We find that we cannot reject equality of the WTP for 40°F
across the estimators (the p-values are 0.708 for the cubic spline and 0.501 for the linear spline). Moreover,
we cannot reject equality of the welfare impact of climate change across the two estimators (the p-values
are 0.208 for the cubic spline and 0.203 for the linear spline).

and estimates that allow for preference heterogeneity, as discussed below. Overall, our

conclusions do not qualitatively change across these specifications.


         IV. Estimation of WTP for Climate with Heterogeneous Preferences
                                       A. Empirical strategy
  Section III above and prior work on climate amenity valuation has assumed that house-

holds share homogenous preferences for climate. Here, we relax this assumption and

allow households to sort into locations that suit their preferences. 33 Estimation under

these more relaxed conditions is based on the framework developed by Bajari and

Benkard (2005) and applied by Bajari and Kahn (2005). The intuition of this approach

lies in the first order condition of equation (3) and is illustrated in Figure 1, which depicts

an equilibrium in which the only characteristic is average summer temperature, Ts. Given

a nonlinear hedonic price function Qˆ ( Z j ,  j ) , the MWTP of households located at j for a

characteristic k (e.g., a day in a given temperature bin) is simply given by
Qˆ ( Z j ,  j ) / Z k . Thus, flexible estimation of Qˆ ( Z j ,  j ) allows us to recover the distri-
bution of MWTP for each characteristic k across the population of households. In Figure

1, for example, the depicted equilibrium is consistent with positive sorting in which
households with a high MWTP to avoid heat settle in areas with low summer tempera-

tures.

  To flexibly estimate Qˆ ( Z j ,  j ) , we use local linear regression per Fan and Gijbels

(1996). We suppose that, local to location j*, Qˆ ( Z j ,  j ) satisfies (7) below:

(7)                                      Qˆ j    kj* Z jk   j
                                                 k




  33
     While this section emphasizes the sorting explanation for preference heterogeneity, we reiterate here
that heterogeneity could also reflect households’ adaptation to their local climate.
                                                     23
  In (7), the implicit prices β are superscripted by j*, as we estimate a distinct set of pric-
es at each location. We obtain the  j* at each location via weighted least squares per (8)

and (9):

(8)                              j*  arg min(Q  Z  ) 'W (Q  Z  )
                                              


(9)                   Q  Q j       Z   Z j  W  diag  Kh   j   j*  
                           

where W is a matrix of kernel weights defined so that locations that are similar to j* in

characteristics receive the most weight in the regression.34 This approach allows house-

holds in relatively hot or cold locations to have different MWTPs to avoid departures

from mild climates. To calculate W, we use a normal kernel function with a bandwidth h

of 2, per (10) and (11) below. 35 σˆ k denotes the standard deviation of characteristic k

across the sample:

(10)                                     K ( Z )   N ( Z k / ˆ k )
                                                     k

(11)                                      Kh ( Z )  K ( Z / h) / h

  Ideally, our estimator would allow for heterogeneity in households’ MWTP for all local

characteristics, not just the temperature profiles. Were the choice set continuous in char-


  34
      In principle, W can include every characteristic in the model, so that preferences can vary in the cross-
section not only with the climate variables but also with the controls. In practice, however, we include only
the temperature spline basis functions in W, since including the controls requires a very large bandwidth in
order to avoid collinearity in the weighted covariate matrix. In addition, when implementing our procedure
with the restricted 7th degree spline specifications, we only include a 5th degree cubic spline in W. Including
the full 7th degree cubic spline in W results in very noisy estimates of temperature preferences at extreme
locations (such as northwest Minnesota) that have few neighbors in climate space.
   35
      We follow Bajari and Benkard (2005) and Bajari and Kahn (2005) in choosing a normal kernel and in
choosing a bandwidth that yields visually appealing preference estimates, in the sense that estimated
MWTP varies smoothly over characteristics space (as in Figure 6). In contrast, using leave-one-out cross-
validation we find an “optimal” bandwidth of 0.22 in the cubic spline preference specification. This small
bandwidth leads to very noisy and imprecise preference estimates as well as an extremely large estimated
amenity loss from climate change (19.9% of income under the A2 scenario). In general, the estimated
amenity loss increases as the bandwidth becomes smaller, so our bandwidth choice of 2 is conservative.
                                                      24
acteristics, point identification of preferences for all characteristics at each location would

indeed be possible. In our setting, however, there is a discrete number of 2,057 PUMAs,

which implies that households’ preferences are only set identified. That is, there is a

range of MWTPs such that each household would prefer to stay in its PUMA rather than

move. We study these identified sets using a Gibbs sampling method per Bajari and

Benkard (2005) and find that they are often large enough to be uninformative when

households are permitted to have heterogeneous preferences over all characteristics (in-

cluding the control variables).36 Our main specifications therefore maintain the restriction

that households share a homogenous MWTP for non-temperature characteristics.37 With

this restriction, we find that the identified sets of MWTPs for temperature are sufficiently

small to closely approximate point identification. The results presented below therefore

follow Bajari and Kahn (2005) in treating MWTP as point identified at each location.

Appendix 4 presents set identified estimates and discusses our set identification proce-

dure in detail.

  Finally, we emphasize that we only identify the MWTP of each household for each

temperature at its chosen climate and cannot identify its WTP for a large change in cli-

mate, over which MWTP may vary. In figure 1, for instance, the MWTPs at locations A

and B are identified, but the shapes of the indifference curves are not. Estimating the wel-

fare impacts from non-marginal changes in climate therefore requires assuming a

functional form for households’ utility. We focus on welfare estimates that assume the in-

difference curves are linear, with a slope equal to the estimated MWTP. This approach is


  36
      Bajari and Benkard (2005) find similar results when the number of parameters over which preferences
may be heterogeneous is permitted to increase, relative to a fixed choice set.
   37
      Prior to running the local linear regression, we enforce preference homogeneity over the non-
temperature variables by stripping their effects from Q̂ using the OLS estimates from section III (this ap-
proach follows an example given in Bajari and Benkard 2005). Thus, the only characteristics involved in
the local linear regression are the temperature spline basis functions.
                                                    25
transparent, permits an apples-to-apples comparison to the homogenous preference esti-

mates, and is conservative: allowing for concavity would unambiguously increase the

estimated amenity losses, as the cost of each additional hot day would rise (and the bene-

fit from each reduction in cold days would fall).

  The assumption that households’ utility functions are linear in characteristics creates

the problem, however, that the second order condition for utility maximization may not

hold if the hedonic price function is not globally convex. Because we ultimately find that

the Qˆ ( Z j ,  j ) function is slightly concave in some dimensions, we have studied a speci-

fication in which households’ utility functions are sufficiently concave that their utility is

maximized at their present location. Our procedure for estimating this specification is

discussed in appendix 3. We find that allowing for concavity in the utility function in-

creases the estimated losses from climate change by roughly 0.6 percentage points

relative to the results given in section V below.



                    B. Heterogeneous preference MWTP estimates
  Estimated MWTPs for temperature by PUMA are graphed in Figure 6: panels A and C

from the restricted cubic spline, panels B and D from the linear spline, all controlling for

geography and demography, but not state FE. Panels A and B present the distribution of

MWTP, scaled up by 365, for an additional day at 40ºF relative to a day at 65ºF, as a

function of HDD. Each of the plotted points represents the preferences of a specific PU-

MA in the data. The strong upward slope in both panels indicates that households with

the most negative MWTP for cold weather tend to be located in areas with the fewest

HDDs. This result is consistent both with households sorting based on their aversion to

cold and with adaptation to cold climates. Panels C and D, in contrast, examine the

MWTP for an additional day at 80ºF as a function of CDD. Panel C, which uses the re-

                                             26
stricted cubic spline model, exhibits a weak downward slope, consistent with residents of

hot areas being more heat-averse on the margin and indicating mild concavity in house-

holds’ utility functions rather than sorting. This result also suggests that households have
only a limited ability to adapt to heat, relative to their ability to adapt to cold. The linear

spline model in Panel D, however, indicates a positive slope, suggestive of some sorting

on willingness to avoid heat, though the overall heterogeneity in MWTP is still smaller

than that for the willingness to avoid cold.

  An alternative depiction of heterogeneous climate preferences is given in Appendix

Figure A1.2. This figure plots MWTP curves under the cubic spline model at a few select

cities. Beyond showing that the magnitude of households’ MWTP to avoid cold is nega-

tively correlated with the amount of cold they face, this figure also shows that the

estimated maximum of the MWTP function occurs at slightly higher temperatures in

warmer locations, again consistent with sorting based on aversion to cold or with adapta-

tion.

  The average MWTP to avoid 40ºF and 80ºF for the cubic and linear spline models plot-

ted in Figure 6 are given in columns I and II of Table 3. The average MWTP to avoid heat

exceeds that to avoid cold, consistent with the homogenous preference model (columns I

and II of Table 2). Columns III through VI of Table 3 proceed through the same control

variable specifications that were used in Table 2, with similar results. Appendix Table

A1.1, panel (b) provides estimates from numerous additional alternative specifications.




                                               27
            V. Estimated Impacts of Climate Change on Climate Amenities
  In this section, we use climate preference estimates to calculate how forecasted climate

change may impact local amenity values. These results maintain technology and prefer-

ences (specifically, WTP as a share of income) at their present levels and are best
interpreted as welfare impacts that would occur if changes forecasted for the end of the

century were to occur now, allowing for spatial adaptation (e.g., households in the North

adopting southern behaviors and levels of air conditioning penetration) to occur instantly.

       We begin in section V.A with welfare calculations that assume homogenous prefer-

ences and then compare them in section V.B with those assuming preference

heterogeneity. In both cases, we focus on projections from the A2 scenario for 2090–

2100 and estimate welfare impacts that do not allow for migration. We then examine mi-

gration in section V.C.


                         A. Impacts under homogenous preferences
  Table 4 displays estimated changes in welfare using the homogenous preference esti-

mates. Our baseline model I, using the restricted cubic spline under A2, yields an average

welfare loss equivalent to 2.24% of income per year by 2090-2100 (estimates under A1FI

are given in Appendix Table A1.2). This net loss is driven by the result that the WTP to

avoid heat exceeds the WTP to avoid cold, so that the welfare loss from hotter summers

exceeds the gain from warmer winters. 38 These temperature-driven welfare losses are
slightly offset by increases in amenities from the small forecast changes to precipitation,

humidity, and sunshine.


  38
     In a restricted model in which the WTP function is forced to be symmetric around 65°F, the welfare
impact is estimated to only be -0.04% of income. We estimate this symmetric specification using the five-
piece linear spline, since it is not possible to impose symmetry around 65°F using the cubic spline. We
force the slopes of the segments below 45°F and above 80°F to equal in magnitude and we force the slopes
of the segments between 45°F and 65°F and between 65°F and 80°F to be equal in magnitude.
                                                   28
  The geographic distribution of welfare changes in this specification is shown in panel A
of Figure 7. The vast majority of the U.S. population will experience an amenity loss: the

benefits of warmer winters outweigh the cost of hotter summers for only the 3.9% of the

population that lives in the Pacific Northwest, northern Michigan, and the extreme North-

east. The amenity losses are largest along the southern Atlantic, Gulf Coast, and southern

Pacific coastlines; in the upper Midwest; and in the Great Basin region. The interior

South area of Oklahoma, Arkansas, north Texas, and north Louisiana is not projected to

experience particularly severe amenity losses despite the fact that this region is forecasted

to gain a large number of extremely hot summer days (recall Figure 3). This result occurs

because summer temperatures in these areas are already sufficiently hot that residents are

on the flat portion of the WTP curve. Thus, contrary to conventional wisdom, it may be

that Americans in relatively temperate climates—for whom summers are usually warm

but not severe—will suffer more from changes in climate amenities than southern house-

holds.

  While our estimates based on the restricted cubic spline model suggest the welfare dis-

tribution depicted in Figure 7, panel A, we cannot rule out an alternate distribution in

which amenity losses are greatest in the hottest regions. Such a distribution is generated

by our linear spline specification (corresponding to column II of Tables 2 and 4), for

which the estimated WTP to avoid an additional day beyond 80°F increases linearly with

temperature. Panel B of Figure 7 displays the estimated distribution of amenity losses un-

der this specification; these losses primarily occur in the interior South and the desert

Southwest. Table 4, column II shows that the average welfare loss is larger in magnitude

than for the restricted cubic spline of column I but is estimated less precisely. This lack of

precision reflects the fact that the present climate offers too few extremely hot days to al-

low a precise claim about the behavior of WTP over extreme heat.

                                             29
  Columns III and IV of Table 4 present amenity losses that use the corresponding esti-
mates from columns III and IV of Table 2. Removing the demographic controls reduces

the precision of the welfare impacts but does not substantially affect the point estimates.

Appendix Table A1.1 presents estimates of amenity losses from several other alternative

specifications with varying control structures, finding generally similar results. Finally,

columns V and VI use estimates that include state FE, which increase the disamenity

from cold. These specifications yield losses of roughly half the magnitude of those from

columns I and II, although they are not statistically significantly different (the Hausman

test p-values are 0.208 and 0.203, respectively).



                     B. Impacts under heterogeneous preferences
  Table 5 presents preference and climate change welfare impact estimates under the het-

erogeneous preference models, with columns I through VI corresponding to the same

specifications as in Tables 2 through 4. The baseline restricted cubic spline model pre-

sented in column I yields an estimated overall amenity loss of 2.83% of income, larger in

magnitude than the 2.24% from the homogenous preferences model. This difference is

primarily driven by the estimated sorting pattern in which households in the North are the
least averse to cold. This sorting implies that the forecasted reduction in cold days is spa-

tially negatively correlated with the MWTP to avoid those cold days, reducing the benefit

of warmer winters.

  The distribution of amenity impacts under specification I is given in panel A of Figure

8. Relative to the estimates that assumed preference heterogeneity (Figure 7, panel A), the

estimated amenity losses increase primarily in the North. Overall, preference heterogenei-

ty reinforces the possibility that the amenity impact of climate change may be felt more

in the North than the South.

                                             30
  The remaining columns of Table 5 present estimates from alternative empirical specifi-

cations. As with the homogenous case, using the linear spline in column II yields an
amenity loss that is larger and less precise than that of column I. The distributional im-

pact obtained under this specification is shown in panel B of Figure 8; as with panel B in

Figure 7, welfare losses tend to be greatest in the South. Omitting the demographic con-

trols in columns III and IV does not dramatically change the point estimates but does

decrease precision. Finally, including state FE in columns V and VI decreases the magni-

tude of the welfare impacts, as was the case with homogenous preferences.



                                               C. Migration
  The welfare impacts we have estimated thus far do not account for household migration

in response to climate change. If climate change is only marginal, then these welfare ef-

fects provide accurate first-order approximations, robust to migration via the envelope

theorem. However, if climate changes are sufficiently large, the second-order effect of

migration may materially mitigate welfare damages.

  We assess the importance of migration using a parsimonious model based on homoge-

nous preferences.39 Intuitively, households will leave areas with worsening climates and
migrate towards areas with improving climates. We model the case in which mobility re-

sponses are proportional to changes in QOL, ∆𝑄̂ , and households remain within the
                                                                                    ̂,
United States. Thus, changes in the logarithm of population density of location j, ∆𝑁

depend on changes in QOL at j relative to the average QOL change in the United States,

∆𝑄̂       , per the formula


(12)                                    ̂ =
                                       ∆𝑁         ,   ( ∆𝑄̂ − ∆𝑄̂     )


  39
       Modeling migration with preference heterogeneity is beyond the scope of this paper.
                                                       31
where     ,   is the long-run elasticity of population with respect to changes in quality of

life. Although direct empirical evidence on this elasticity is scant, a calibration from Al-

bouy and Stuart (2012) suggests a value of 8 over the very long run.40 In other words, a

one percent increase in QOL will lead to an eight percent increase in population density,

once housing and migration fully adjust.41

  Allowing for adaptive migration per equation (12) we estimate that for our baseline

specification I, the average absolute value of the population change across all PUMAs is

8.3%. This migration only modestly changes our estimated aggregate welfare impact

from -2.24% to -2.05%. Adaptive migration only slightly mitigates welfare losses be-

cause only a few areas actually improve, and migration to these areas eventually becomes

constrained by crowding.42



                               VI. Alternative measures of QOL
  In section I above, we emphasized the importance of correctly weighting wage and

housing-cost and wage differentials when calculating our QOL measure, while also mak-

ing a correction for commuting costs. In Table 6, we examine climate-preference and

welfare estimates based on alternative measures. First, in column II, we use wage differ-
entials by place of residence rather than place of work, without correcting for commuting.

  40
      This elasticity incorporates five different responses to a change in QOL: i) housing producer substitu-
tion away from land; i.e. housing supply elasticity ii) traded-good producers’ substitution away from land,
creating diminishing returns from fixed factors, iii) consumers’ substitution away from housing; i.e. crowd-
ing into the existing housing stock, iv) willingness of households to consume less overall (net of housing)
in high QOL areas; and v) endogenous agglomeration economies and crowding effects from changes in
population density.
   41
      Saiz (2010) has estimated local housing supply elasticities for 95 metropolitan areas in the U.S. The
median estimated elasticity is 1.61 and the maximum is 5.45. In addition, in a medium run climate change
scenario, worsening areas may only depopulate slowly as the supply of housing diminishes slowly over
time due to depreciation, consistent with a small downside supply elasticity (Glaeser and Gyourko 2005). It
is therefore likely that our use of a supply elasticity of 8 results in an overestimate of migration.
   42
      The ability of migration to mitigate welfare losses would be further constrained by adjustment costs,
including the cost of physically moving.
                                                    32
This change slightly attenuates the WTP estimates, leading to smaller inferred damages.

Intuitively, the wage and commuting correction to QOL does not substantially impact the

WTP estimates because these factors operate on a small geographic scale that is likely or-

thogonal to climate variation. We next consider the separate roles that wages and housing

costs play in determining QOL. In column III, we measure QOL using only the additive

inverse of wages (so that low wages denote higher QOL). Without state FE, this change

causes extreme temperatures to be valued positively; with fixed effects, the specification

finds a positive (though statistically insignificant) WTP for heat, recalling the results of

Hoch and Drake (1974) and Moore (1998).43 Conversely, hen only housing costs are used

to measure QOL in column IV, the estimates exaggerate households’ aversion to extreme

temperatures and damages to climate change. Column V uses a QOL measure similar to

Roback (1982), Nordhaus (1996), and Sinha and Cropper (2013) that, relative to our

measure, puts 2.7 times more weight on wages relative to housing costs (by not account-

ing for taxation and non-housing local costs). Not surprisingly, these results resemble

those based only on wages, albeit less extremely. The dramatic difference in results be-

tween the specifications with and without fixed effects also evokes the lack of robustness

that Nordhaus (1996) finds using his QOL measure.

  Columns VI and VII of Table 6 return to our baseline QOL measures but alternatively

use wage levels for workers with a college degree or with only a high school degree, to

test whether these two groups value amenities differently. Our findings suggest that more

educated workers may have a lower aversion to heat and cold, perhaps because their




  43
     In the column III state FE specification, the estimated welfare impact is similar to that obtained with
the reference case QOL measure despite the very different MWTPs at 40ºF and 80ºF. This result occurs on-
ly because the estimated MWTP is very large and positive over extreme cold <30ºF. The estimates in
column V with state FE behave similarly.
                                                    33
higher incomes allow them to better protect themselves or because they are less likely to

work outdoors.

  As discussed in section I, a potential concern regarding our baseline QOL measures is

that our estimates of the PUMA-level wage differentials 𝑤
                                                        ̂ are not robust to sorting

based on unobserved skills or a spatial match component of wages. We address this con-

cern in several ways. First, column VIII of table 6 presents results from a specification in

which we adopt the procedure used in Dahl (2002) to adjust the 𝑤
                                                               ̂ for selective migra-

tion. In our wage equation, we include a flexible control function for each individual’s

probability of moving from his or her state of birth to the current state, as well as the

probability of staying in the state of birth, based on the individual’s observed demograph-

ic characteristics. 44 This adjustment will decrease the estimated 𝑤
                                                                   ̂ (and therefore

increase the estimated 𝑄̂ ) for PUMAs with a relatively high rate of in-migration to the

extent that in-migrants earn relatively high wages. As shown in column VIII, this adjust-

ment to our QOL estimates has only a minor effect on our preference and welfare

estimates, slightly decreasing the magnitudes of the estimated average MWTP for cold

and heat as well as the magnitude of the estimated welfare loss. This reduction results

from the fact that areas with relatively extreme temperatures (particularly extreme heat)

are growing more quickly than areas with relatively moderate temperatures.

  As an alternative and closely related approach for addressing selective migration, we

have also adjusted our baseline QOL estimates for each PUMA by adding a correction

equal to the PUMA’s rate of net in-migration between 1990 and 2000 (in percent) multi-


  44
      Per Dahl (2002), we estimate these probabilities by category according to various demographic charac-
teristics. We use the exact same categories as Dahl (2002) for movers (20 for each state) and stayers (70).
We also add a separate mover category / "birth-state" for those born outside the U.S. As Dahl only used
male, white, and ages 25-34, we create twelve times the number of original categories to account for fe-
male, non-white, and age categories 35-44 and 45-55. To identify the wage intercepts across states, we
constrain the coefficients in the control function to be the same across states, unlike in Dahl (2002).

plied by a mobility cost estimate from Notowidigdo (2012).45 This adjustment explicitly

increases the estimated QOL for locations that are growing relatively quickly. The results

of doing so are similar to that obtained from the Dahl (2002) adjustment: the estimated

average MWTPs for avoiding heat and cold are reduced, as is the estimated welfare im-

pact from climate change (by 0.3 percent of income). Finally, we have estimated a speci-

specification that insulates our estimates from selective migration to “superstar cities” by

dropping superstar metropolitan areas (as defined in Gyourko, Mayer, and Sinai (2013))

from the sample (we drop 442 of the 2,057 PUMAs in the sample). We find that doing so

also modestly decreases the estimated MWTPs and welfare impact, without qualitatively

affecting our conclusions (see Appendix Table A1.1, column R15).



                                          VII. Conclusions
  This paper illustrates the ability of the Rosen-Roback hedonic framework, when

properly calibrated, to recover willingness to pay for non-market goods such as climate.

By using a quality of life measure that is carefully constructed from local wage and hous-

ing price differentials in the contiguous U.S. and by adopting a flexible model of climate

based on local temperature distributions, we obtain estimates of households’ valuation of

climate amenities that both accord with intuition and are generally robust to a wide range

of empirical specifications. We find that households: (1) place the most value on tempera-

tures near 65°F, (2) tend to dislike marginal increases in heat more than marginal


  45
      Notowidigdo (2012) allows for heterogeneity in mobility costs and estimates a mobility cost elasticity,
which dictates how the mobility cost of the marginal migrant increases with the number of migrants. This
elasticity is appropriate for adjusting our QOL estimates because it is the marginal migrant that determines
market prices and wages. Our calculations use a weighted average of Notowidigdo’s (2012) estimated elas-
ticities for high-skill and low-skill workers (0.066 and 0.065 respectively, see Table 7 in his paper). These
estimates are identified from plausibly exogenous Bartik (1991) labor demand shocks and correspond to
migration over a ten-year period, thereby aligning with our 1990 to 2000 migration rates. We also use No-
towidigdo’s (2012) curvature parameters (betas) in specifying the mobility cost function.
                                                    35
increases in cold, and (3) care less about marginal changes in outdoor temperature once

the temperature is sufficiently uncomfortable that they are unlikely to go outside. Finally,
we find evidence of heterogeneity in these preferences, with households that are most

averse to cold living in the South, consistent with models of both sorting and adaptation.

  When we apply our estimates to value the amenity impacts of climate change, we esti-

mate an average U.S. welfare loss between one and three percent of income per year by

2090–2099 under “business as usual”. Most areas in the United States are forecast to ex-

perience losses, as many pleasantly warm days will be ruined while uncomfortably cold

days will only be moderately reduced. These estimates are similar in magnitude to the

percentage losses in GDP (market goods) forecasted by Nordhaus (2007) and the Stern

report (2007) for 2100 under business as usual, suggesting that nonmarket amenity bene-

fits alone may justify the mitigation costs discussed in their studies.46

  The greatest limitation to our empirical method is that we have little statistical power to

make inferences regarding households’ willingness to pay (WTP) to avoid temperatures

beyond the limits of the current temperature distribution. The data provide only limited

guidance as to how WTP should be extrapolated over extremely hot temperatures that

have yet to be realized. Should the WTP to avoid heat actually increase non-linearly over

the extremes, our damage estimates will be too conservative, particularly in the southern

U.S.




  46
   The Nordhaus and Stern market damage estimates of 3% and 2.9% apply to worldwide GDP, not U.S.
GDP.

Notes : Parenthetical values indicate standard errors wild cluster bootstrapped on state using 200 draws. Welfare impacts
shown assume that households' utility functions are linear in characteristics. Allowing for concavity in the utility function, as
discussed at the end of section IV.A and in appendix 3, increases the estimated welfare losses under A2 by 0.59%, 0.67%,
0.89%, 2.50%, 0.68%, and 0.54% in columns I-VI, respectively.

Notes : The unit of observation is a PUMA. All regressions are weighted by population in each PUMA. All specifications use a 7th degree restricted
cubic spline with a constant MWTP restriction for the lower and upper 1% of the population-weighted U.S. average temperature distribution. All
regressions include geographic, other weather, and demographic controls. MWTPs shown for a day at 40F or 80F are relative to 65F, expressed as a
fraction of income, and are income-weighted averages across all PUMAs. Welfare impacts shown assume that households' utility functions are linear in
characteristics. Column V uses wages by residence. Column VIII adjusts QOL for selective migration per Dahl (2002), as discussed in sections IB and
VI. Parenthetical values indicate standard errors wild cluster bootstrapped on state using 200 draws.

Notes: MWTPs are expressed as a fraction of income, scaled up by 365, and normalized to zero
at 65ºF. Each plotted point denotes a PUMA-specific estimate of MWTP. Panels A and C use the
restricted 7th degree cubic spline model, and panels B and D use the four-piece linear spline.
Models used in all panels include the geographic, “other weather”, and demographic controls.
Each observation (PUMA) is weighted by its population in the regressions.

 Notes: All panels use a 7th degree cubic spline WTP model, restricted to be constant over the
 extreme 1% of the temperature distribution, and include all geographic, “other weather”, and
 demographic controls. MWTPs are expressed as a fraction of income and normalized to zero at
 65ºF. Each observation (PUMA) is weighted by its population in the regressions. Standard
 errors are clustered on state. “Present” temperature distribution denotes 1970-1999, and
 “future” denotes 2090-2099.

Notes : The unit of observation is a PUMA, except for R13, where the unit of observation is a MSA. MWTPs shown for a day at 40F or 80F are relative to 65F, expressed as a fraction of income, and are income-weighted averages across all
observations. Except for R11, all regressions are weighted by population. Parenthetical values indicate standard errors cluster bootstrapped on state using 200 draws (except for the first two rows, which are not bootstrapped). Welfare impacts
shown assume that households' utility functions are linear in characteristics.
Dew point is highly collinear with temperature, so that in specifications R3, R5, and R7 the MWTPs for temperature decrease as this MWTP is loaded onto the dew point coefficient instead. The welfare predictions do not change substantially
because the forecasted increase in dew point is similar to the forecasted increase in temperature.

Notes : The unit of observation is a PUMA, except for R13, where the unit of observation is a MSA. MWTPs shown for a day at 40F or 80F are relative to 65F, expressed as a fraction of income, and are
income-weighted averages across all observations. Except for R11, all regressions are weighted by population. Parenthetical values indicate standard errors cluster bootstrapped on state using 200 draws (except
for the first two rows, which are not bootstrapped). Welfare impacts shown assume that households' utility functions are linear in characteristics.
** The temparature bins are defined in the ranges (-inf, 35], (35,45], (45,55], …, (75,85], and (85,+inf).
*** Superstar msas are those listed in Gyourko, Mayer, and Sinai (2013), table A3, for the year 2000. These msas account for 442 of the 2,057 PUMAs in the overall sample.

                                      Appendix 2: Data Construction

1 Overview
         Here we document the construction of the dataset used to estimate the models in the paper.
Specifically, we collect the following data for each PUMA:
     historical temperature
     other historical weather variables
     climate model data
     demographic controls
     natural controls
     quality of life measure
     MSA assignment
       We detail the data assembly process in each of the categories listed above in the following
sections.

2 Historical temperature
         Our source of historical temperature data is the Schlenker-Roberts daily weather data for
the contiguous United States,1 available from 1950–2005. They construct these data by combining
high resolution monthly average PRISM temperature data (discussed more in detail in section 3)
with daily temperature data obtained from weather stations, which are at a much lower spatial
resolution. They regress the monthly average PRISM temperature data on monthly average
weather station data, and then interpolate the daily temperature records at each weather station to
obtain daily records at each PRISM grid point. For more details regarding the construction of these
data, see their article “Nonlinear Effects of Weather on Corn Yields”.2
        The data are set on the same fine grid as the PRISM data: 2.5 arcmin × 2.5 arcmin (roughly
4 km × 4 km) grid.

2.1 Binning temperature
        Starting with the daily temperature data, we calculate, for each gridpoint-year, the number
of days with an average temperature (mean of minimum and maximum temperature) falling in
each of 222 temperature bins. The number of days in each bin is calculated as follows:
                                                   365

                                                    1{avgTemp
                                                  day=1
                                                                        day   range(bin )}

We define 220 bins ranging from –50 °C to 60 °C, with two more bins for days below –50 °C or
above 60 °C, for a total of 222 bins; see table A2.1 for more detail.

                                Table A2.1: Temperature ranges covered by each bin.



        Because there are no days with temperatures lower than –50 °C or higher than 60 °C, we
can simply convert daily average temperature to its corresponding bin using:
                                   bin = floor (2  avgTemp)  102
The raw bins add up to slightly over 365 per year due to leap years, so we rescale the bins to add up
to exactly 365 over a year. We perform this gridpoint-year binning for each year between 1970 and
1999, inclusive. As temperature and other weather indicators are generally averaged over 30-year
“normals" (more specifically, the PRISM data we use follows the 1970–1999 normals), we
generate normals of our binned data by averaging over these same 30 years.

2.2 Mapping binned temperature to PUMAs
         We map the binned daily temperature data to PUMAs using one of the following two
methods, depending on the size of the PUMA.
        We use PUMA boundaries available in shapefile format from IPUMS USA.3 For each
PUMA that has at least one PRISM grid point within its boundary, we match the PUMA to the
binned temperature data for their gridpoints and average across the PUMA, weighting all grid
points equally.
        For those few (33) very small PUMAs with that contain no grid points, we match the
PUMA to the binned temperature data for the four (or fewer) gridpoints surrounding the PUMA
centroid, and take the inverse-distance-squared weighted average, using great-circle distances.
PUMA centroids are calculated using ArcMap from PUMA boundaries.
        Most PUMAs are matched to four grid points. However, for some coastal PUMAs, the
corresponding over-water grid points do not have data, so they are matched to three or fewer
gridpoints. The following two tables summarize the mapping from PRISM grid points to PUMAs:

3 Other historical weather data
         We assemble data on dew point, relative humidity, precipitation, and sunshine at the
PUMA level.
        Dew point, relative humidity, and precipitation come directly from, or are derived from,
PRISM data. PRISM, or the Parameter-elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model
climate mapping system is a “unique knowledge-based system that uses point measurements of
precipitation, temperature, and other climatic factors to produce continuous, digital grid estimates
of monthly, yearly, and event-based climatic parameters.”4 We used PRISM monthly average
temperature, precipitation, and dew point data from the years 1970–1999. The data are available
on a high-resolution grid of 2.5 arcmin × 2.5 arcmin (roughly 4 km × 4 km).

3.1 Dew point
        The PRISM data give average dew point in each month for each PRISM grid point. We
average over all 30 years to obtain the average dew point, for each grid point, in each calendar
month, 1970–1999, and map these gridded data to PUMAs as described in section 2.2.

3.2 Relative humidity
         We calculate relative humidity from PRISM temperature and dew point data, following
conversions given by the equations below. We first convert temperature t and dew point d to
degrees Celsius. Actual vapor pressure e and saturated vapor pressure es are calculated as
follows:
                                                     17.67d 
                                    e = 6.112  exp            
                                                     d  243.5 

                                                                      17.67t 
                                                   e s = 6.112  exp            
                                                                      t  243.5 
Then relative humidity is given by:
                                                       e
                                                              rh = 100
                                                      es
One problem is that the equations defining relative humidity as a function of temperature and dew
point are nonlinear, so true average relative humidity is likely not exactly the same as relative
humidity calculated from average temperature and average dew point. Because dew point and

temperature are not extremely variable within a given month at a given location, this is unlikely to
significantly change the relative humidity calculation.
        These gridded relative humidity data are then mapped to PUMAs as described in section
2.2.

3.3 Precipitation
       We import gridded precipitation data from PRISM, which give average precipitation in
each month over the periods 1970–1999, for each PRISM grid point. We average to obtain the
mean precipitation for each grid point, in each calendar month, 1970–1999. These gridded data are
then mapped to PUMAs as described in section 2.2.

3.4 Sunshine
          Because high resolution gridded sunshine or cloud cover data are not available from
PRISM or other sources, we use weather station data from the National Climactic Data Center.5
This data set contains data on the amount of time the sun is not obscured by clouds, as a percent of
possible daylight hours, by month-of-year, for 174 weather stations across the United States; this
includes some stations in Alaska, Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and other US territories that we do not use.
We use only the 156 stations in the contiguous United States, mapped in figure A2.1. The data set
also lists the total number of years of sunshine observations for each station, which ranges from
only a few years to over 100. These data do not give the longitude or latitude of each weather
station, but rather give us a unique identifier for each station. We look up each station in the North
American Master Station Database6 to obtain the longitude and latitude.




                   Figure A2.1: Weather stations used for construction of sunshine dataset.

        We then use inverse distance squared weighting to interpolate the weather station data to
the PUMA level. The closest four weather stations, appropriately weighted, are used for the
interpolation to each PUMA centroid. We use the great circle distances because the distances

between PUMA centroid and nearest four weather stations can be potentially large. Interpolated
values of sunshine are not sensitive to the number of surrounding weather stations used in the
interpolation. These data are mapped in figure A2.2.

4 Climate model data
         All climate change scenario data are from the third release of the Community Climate
System Model (CCSM 3.0), available from the Earth System Grid Gateway at the National Center
for Atmospheric Research.7 These data were also used for the 2007 Fourth Assessment Report of
the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.
        We use average daily and monthly data from five runs (a–e) of the Climate of the 20th
Century experiment from the years 1970–1999, five runs (a–e) of the A2 scenario from 2000–
2099, and the only available run (a) of the A1FI scenario from 2000–2099. The data are available
on a 1.4 degree × 1.4 degree resolution grid.

4.1 Daily data
          The climate model provides daily data for all variables; we use only daily average
surface temperature data (CCSM field name TS) to construct binned temperature, similarly to the
construction of binned data from the Schlenker-Roberts daily weather data described in section 2.
For each decade, we calculate the average number of days that fall in each bin as described in
section 2.1.

4.2 Monthly data
         We use monthly average surface temperature, relative humidity, surface pressure,
convective precipitation rate, and large-scale (stable) precipitation rate (field names TS, RELHUM,
PS, PRECC, and PRECL, respectively), calculating decadal averages of each variable in each
calendar month. Convective and large-scale precipitation rates are added together to obtain total

precipitation.

4.3 Mapping to PUMAs
         These monthly average and binned daily average data are then mapped to PUMAs.
Because the CCSM grids are significantly bigger than the PRISM grids described in 2, there are
many PUMAs that do not have even one CCSM grid point falling within its boundary. Thus, all
PUMAs are assigned the inverse-distance-squared weighted value of the four grid points
surrounding the centroid of the PUMA, as for the 33 PUMAs interpolated using the alternate
method in section 2.2. We use the true great-circle distances, as the distances between PUMA
centroid and surrounding grid point can be large, up to 100 km.
        We calculate PUMA-level changes in the temperature distribution as the bin-by-bin
difference between 1990–1999 20CE climate model data and the A2 or A1FI climate model data.
However, this yields a strange result for some PUMAs: if the climate model does not predict the
actual temperature distribution correctly, it is possible that the projected decrease in the number of
days in some bin will be larger than the number of days that we actually observe in that bin
originally. This yields a predicted future temperature distribution with a few bins that have a
negative number of days.
        Fortunately, these errors are small. We calculate the number of bins with a negative value
for 2090–2099 predicted temperatures under the A2 scenario; across all PUMAs, this has a mean
of 9.13 bins and a median of 5.05 bins. As a percentage of binned days, the number of negative
predicted binned days is likewise small, with a mean of 2.5% and a median of 1.4%. Earlier
decades have even fewer bins displaying such errors.

5 Demographic controls
         We collect various demographic variables, including population, population change,
schooling, age, percent married, percent veteran, percent in each minority group, and other
variables. we calculate PUMA-level statistics for various variables over all individuals in each
PUMA (not just workers). We use data from IPUMS.
        Also, we calculate a population-weighted version of population density at the PUMA level,
and impute population change from 1990–2000, as described in the following sections.

5.1 Population density data
        We construct a population density measure that more accurately reflects the actual
population density experienced by the population, relative to a simple population/area (that is,
area-weighted) measure over an entire county PUMA. We acquire population and (land) area data
by census tract from the 2000 Census.8 Census tracts are subdivided much more finely than
PUMAs; there are generally only between 2000–8000 people in each tract.

Figure A2.3: Comparison of unweighted and weighted population density by PUMA, in persons
                                     per square mile.

         Our new population density data on PUMA level are computed by first calculating simple
population density ( population/area ) at the census tract level. Because census tracts do not cross
county lines, computing this average would be simple for counties. However, census tracts do
sometimes cross PUMA boundaries; thus, we use MABLE/Geocorr2K correspondence files to
assign the correct areas and populations of the census tracts to each PUMA. Thus, for each PUMA
 p , the population weighted density is computed as follows:

                                            density  population  fract (t  p)

                                                               t


where, for each tract t and each PUMA p , MABLE/Geocorr2K gives the allocation factor:

                                                                                              A2.7

                                         total population in t
The weighted and unweighted PUMA densities are mapped in figure A2.3.

5.2 Population change data
         We are interested in the PUMA-level population change between the 1990 census and
2000 census. However, because PUMA definitions change every census, we cannot directly use
the 1990 PUMA population data, as the PUMAs do not line up. So, we impute 1990 population in
our 2000 PUMAs using 1990 census tract level data, as follows.
        In ArcMap, we intersect the 1990 tract shapefile with the 2000 PUMA shapefile; this splits
each tract into one or more pieces, each one lying inside a different PUMA. Then, for each tract
slice, we calculate the area, and compute the fraction of the whole tract area lying inside each
PUMA. Then, we attribute that same fraction of the 1990 tract population to that PUMA, and add
up over tracts to get the whole PUMA population.
        The true 1990 population, not including AK and HI, is 247,051,601, while the total
population we calculate using this method is 246,956,773. The discrepancy comes from a few
hundred tracts that are not included in the PUMA shapefiles, and thus were not attributable to any
PUMAs. These are tracts ending .99, which according to the US Census Bureau9 is reserved for
tracts consisting only of “crews-of-vessels populations.” We are unfortunately unable to assign
this small sub-population properly to PUMAs, resulting in a missing population on the order of
0.038%.
        For a consistency check, we repeat the above procedure to impute 2000 PUMA
populations from 2000 census tracts. For the 2000 census, the crews-of-vessels populations are
part of the related census tracts, so we do not have the same problem as above; the true 48-state
population is 279,583,437, which is exactly the total population we calculated. However, the
population we assigned to each PUMA is not exactly correct, and thus will not match the true
PUMA populations, as it is imputed using this imperfect area-weighting method.
        We approximate population change by taking the difference between imputed PUMA
population in 2000 and imputed PUMA population in 1990.

6 Natural controls
        We construct data on distance to coasts and mountainousness at the PUMA level from raw
elevation data and lake and ocean shapefiles, as detailed in the following sections. Specifically, we
construct
     average elevation (in meters)
     average slope (in percent)
     distance to ocean (in miles)
     indicator for whether PUMA is on the ocean
     distance to a great lake (in miles)
     indicator for whether PUMA is on a great lake

6.1 Elevation data
              We use high-resolution elevation data from the Global 30 Arc Second Elevation Data

(GTOPO30) digital elevation model (DEM) available from the the United States Geological
Survey.10 These data are set on a high resolution grid of 30 arcsec × 30 arcsec, or roughly 1 km ×
1 km. We map the gridded elevation data to PUMAs by averaging the value of all grid points
falling within the boundary of each PUMA. Due to the high resolution of the data, every PUMA
has at least one grid falling within its boundary. Elevation data are mapped in figure A2.4.

6.2 Land slope data
        We construct a land slope dataset using the DEMs described in section 6.1. We calculate
slope using the average maximum technique, where the slope at each grid point is the maximum
rate of change of elevation from that grid point to its eight neighbors.11 12 Consider a 3×3
neighborhood of cells, where each cell is identified as follows:

                                                                 a     b     c
                                                                 d     e     f

            Then the slope at gridpoint e, in radians, is given by:

                                                                                 2            2

6.3 Coast data
         For each geographic level, we construct the following variables:
            1. Distance from centroid to oceanic coast
            2. Indicator variable: 1{onOceanCoast}
            3. Distance from centroid to Great Lakes coast
            4. Indicator variable: 1{onGreatLakesCoast}
        To obtain the distance variables (1) and (3), we first export the set of points defining the
oceanic and Great Lakes from shapefiles available from Esri, creator of ArcMap and the ArcGIS
suite. We then calculate the minimum distance from each PUMA centroid to any oceanic or Great
Lakes coast point.
        Indicator variables for a PUMA being on an oceanic or Great Lakes coast were calculated
similarly, with the difference that each PUMA is first assigned the minimum distance between any
point defining its border and any point on a coast. If this minimum distance is zero (or nearly so,
allowing for some small errors in the shapefiles), the coastal indicators are assigned a value of one,
and otherwise, a value of zero.

7 Quality of life data
      Quality of life data at PUMA level come from Albouy and Lue (2011). We use both
commuting-adjusted and non-adjusted QOL, data on average QOL and QOL by education level

                                                                                               A2.10
(high school or college), and price and wage differentials. Construction of these data are detailed in
the Albouy and Lue paper.13

8 MSA assignment
         We use MABLE/Geocorr2K14 to map each PUMA to its corresponding consolidated
metropolitan statistical area (CMSA). Each PUMA is matched to a single CMSA, but CMSAs
contain more than one PUMA; the fraction of the CMSA population contained within each PUMA
is also given by MABLE/Geocorr2K.

                          Appendix 3: Concavity of the utility function

        The specifications allowing for unobserved preference heterogeneity use households’

first order condition to identify their MWTP for climate amenities at their location, following the

approach of Bajari and Benkard (2005) under an assumption that the choice set is continuous.

This approach cannot identify, however, the shape of households’ utility functions as one moves

away from the characteristics associated with their location. Because climate change is non-

marginal, this shape affects the estimates of amenity loss associated with climate change. To be

conservative, all results presented in the main text of the paper assume that households’ utility

functions are linear rather than concave in local characteristics.

        The linearity assumption may be problematic, however, because it can lead to violations

of households’ utility maximization should the second order condition not hold. If the hedonic

price function is not convex, then households satisfying the first order condition with linear

utility functions will be locally minimizing rather than maximizing their utility at any location

where the price function is locally concave. Further, even if a particular household is locally

maximizing utility at a location where the price function is locally convex, concavities elsewhere

in the price function may imply that the household would realize a higher utility at a different

location.

        In our application, we do find some concavities in the estimated price function,

suggesting that violations of utility maximization may be a problem. To assess the empirical

importance of this issue, we calculate the amount of utility function concavity necessary, at each

location, to satisfy utility maximization. To do so, we use a utility function parameterized per

equation (A3.1) below to denote the utility that a household located at i would obtain from

residing at location j:
                                                                  2

The quadratic term in (A3.1) allows the MWTP for each characteristic k to decrease as the

difference between the amount of k provided at locations i and j increases.1 All characteristics are

scaled by  k , their standard deviation over all locations, so that their magnitudes are

comparable.2

         The household’s first order condition yields estimates of the β per the local linear

regressions discussed in the main text. These regressions also yield estimates of the  j . Given

these estimates, for each location i we loop through all other locations j and find the smallest

positive value of  i such that uii  u ij j . The resulting estimates of  i denote the minimum

concavity necessary so that all households are maximizing their utility by residing at their

present location.

         In our baseline specification (restricted 7th degree cubic spline with full controls, and no

fixed effects), the mean value of  i obtained via this procedure is 0.0017. When calculating

losses from climate change, allowing for this degree of concavity yields an additional welfare

loss of 0.59% of income.

For all models presented in the main text, these characteristics are those corresponding to the basis functions for the
linear or cubic splines over the temperature bins.
2
  In a more general specification, the αi coefficients on the quadratic term could vary across characteristics. For
example, in a model with both HDD and CDD, utility maximization could be achieved with: (i) high concavity on
HDD but none on CDD; (ii) high concavity on CDD but none on HDD; or (iii) moderate concavity on both HDD
and CDD. For simplicity, we assume that the each household’s concavity coefficient αi is the same for all
characteristics in the model.

                           Appendix 4: Set identification of preferences

         The estimated heterogenous preferences presented in the text (and the climate change

welfare impacts derived from them) assume point identification, following Bajari and Kahn

(2005). That is, at each location i, the estimates assume that households’ MWTP for a given

characteristic k is given by the gradient of the price function at i,  ki , per households’ first order

condition. Point identification, however, requires that the set of available locations is complete in
                                                       K
characteristics space (itself a subset of                  ), a condition that cannot hold in a finite choice set

such as our sample of PUMAs. Thus, in reality, preferences are only set identified. However, if

the number of choices (in our data, the 2,057 PUMAs) is sufficiently large, the identified sets

may be small enough that estimates assuming point identification are close approximations to the

identified set. In particular, the distribution of point identified preferences across PUMAs may

closely match the distribution of set identified preferences. This appendix examines the extent to

which this approximation holds in this setting.

         At each location i, finding the identified set of preferences requires finding the set of βi’s

such that uii  u ij j . We use a utility function that is concave in characteristics and given by

equation (A4.1) below (copied from equation (A3.1) in appendix 3):

                                                                            2

         An allowance for concavity is required to ensure that the identified set is not null. Given

values for the characteristics Z and quality of life “prices” q, and given estimates of the

unobservables  j and concavity parameters  i from the local linear regressions and the

procedure discussed in appendix 3, respectively, equation (A4.1) can be used to find the

identified set of  i at each location.1 To do so, we use apply the Bayesian estimation procedure


1
  As discussed in appendix 3, the αi are set to ensure that utility maximization holds exactly at each location, given
point identified estimates of the βi. As evidenced by the fact that the set identified preferences are not singletons,
these αi do not imply that other values of βi are inconsistent with utility maximization. Increases in αi do imply


                                                                                                                A4.1
discussed in Bajari and Benkard (2005) and described in detail in Benkard and Bajari (2004).2

This procedure assumes that the distribution of preferences, within and across locations, is point

identified and uses Gibbs sampling to obtain this distribution (an analytical characterization of

these sets is very difficult because they are high-dimensional).

         The Gibbs sampler requires a prior on the preference distribution. Following Benkard and

Bajari (2004), we assume that preferences are distributed uniformly over a rectangular region                            .

We must place bounds on this region so that, at locations with extreme characteristics,

preferences are not unbounded (for example, at the hottest PUMA in the data, residents could in

theory have an unbounded taste for heat). For each characteristic k over which preferences may

be heterogeneous, we bound the set                in the k’th dimension by taking the support of  k from

the point identified estimates and doubling its width. Thus, for example, if the point identified

MWTPs for characteristic k range from -0.1% to -0.2% of income, our prior for the Gibbs

sampler is that preferences for k are uniformly distributed from -0.05% to -0.25% of income.

         Given our prior, the Gibbs algorithm proceeds one location i at a time. A summary of the

algorithm’s steps in each iteration is given below. For details, see Benkard and Bajari (2004).

    1. At a given iteration s, start with characteristic k = 1. Find the upper and lower bounds of

          ki such that uii  u ij j , given the  i k from iteration s-1 (use the point-identified  i k if
         s = 0). Denote these bounds by  ki and  ki . If location i has the minimum or maximum

         value of X k in the choice set, then the lower or upper bound, respectively, will be given

         by the relevant bound of          .

    2. The posterior distribution of  ki for iteration s is uniform on   ki ,  ki  . Randomly draw a

          ki from this distribution.



increases in the size of the identified set of βi; however, this sensitivity is not strong. Doubling the values of αi from
those calculated in appendix 3 yields only a minor change in the kernel density plots discussed below.

    3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 for each characteristic k  2,..., K ' ( K ' denotes the number of

        characteristics over which preferences are permitted to be heterogeneous). When finding

        the bounds  ki and  ki , use  li from iteration s rather than s-1 if l<k.

        We use 1,500 draws in our algorithm and discard the first 500 as a “burn in” period. The

remaining 1,000 draws at each location i then give a numerical estimate of the distribution of

preferences at i. Aggregating the draws over all locations yields a numerical estimate of the

distribution of preferences over the population. Figures A4.1 and A4.2 below show kernel

density plots of the MWTPs for a 40 degree day and an 80 degree day (both relative to 65°F) for

the 7th degree cubic spline specification that includes demographic controls. The primary

difference between the point and set identified MWTP estimates is that set identification yields

long, thin tails of extreme preferences that are driven by locations at or near the extremes of the

characteristics space.3 Otherwise, these two figures show strong agreement between the

preference distributions implied by point identification and set identification, validating the use

of the point identified estimates in the main text.

        As noted in the text, we only allow for preference heterogeneity over the characteristics

associated with temperatures and enforce preference homogeneity for the controls. We do so

because the close agreement between the set and point identified preference distributions breaks
down when we allow for heterogeneous preferences for the control characteristics. Figures A4.3

and A4.4 illustrate kernel density MWTP plots when preferences for the geographic and “other

weather” controls are permitted to be heterogeneous. When preferences for this many

characteristics are permitted to vary, the identified sets become too large to allow precise

inference.

  Note that, even though the space     has bounds given by a doubling of the support of the set of point identified
preferences, the set identified MWTPs for a given temperature can have bounds given by more than a doubling of
the support of point identified MWTPs. This outcome is due to the fact that the MWTP for a given temperature is
given by a linear combination of multiple characteristics (seven of them in the cubic spline models).
