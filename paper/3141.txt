     MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS AND PRODUCTIVITY CONVERGENCE IN MEXICO


                                    ARSTPACT
     This   paper examines the impact of the operations of foreign-owned multi-

national firms on the productivity growth of Mexican manufacturing industries.

1965-1984. It investigates both the extent to which the penetration of a sector

by foreign—owned firms affects the productivity of local firms in that sector

and whether there is any evidence of convergence between that industry's pro-

ductivity level and that of the United States. The main results can be sum-

marized as follows: First, productivity levels of locally-owned firms in

Mexico have converged to those of foreign-owned firms. Second, both the rate

of productivity growth of local firms and their rate of catch-up to the multi-

nationals are positively related to the degree of foreign ownership of an

industry. Third, the productivity gap between Mexico and U.S. manufacturing

has diminished between the mid-1960s and the mid-1980s. Fourth, the rate of

productivity growth of Mexican industries and its rate of convergence to the

United States are higher in industries with a greater presence of multina-

tionals. We conclude that multinational firms have contributed to a

geographical diffusion of technology and acted as a bridge between advanced

and less advanced countries.

I.   Introduction

     An important strand of literature on economic development is the so-called

convergence school, based on Gerschenkron's (1952) advantages of backwardness

thesis, which has gained currency in recent years.   It is argued that a

country's potentiality for productivity growth is affected by the relative

backwardness of the country vis—á—vis the advanced industrial nations. The

more backward the country, the higher the rate of productivity growth

achievable by acquiring the technology of the advanced nations. At least

among industrialized countries, a strong inverse relation between the rate of

productivity growth and the country's initial relative productivity level is

indicated from Baumol (1985), Baumol and Wolff (1988), and Wolff (1968) on the

aggregate level, and evidence from Collar, Wolff, and Baumol (1987) and Collar

and Wolff (1988) suggests that these relations also hold on the individual

industry level, at least in manufacturing.

     With regard to developing countries, there has been almost no work on con-

vergence. tndeed, results from Baumol and Wolff (1988) indicate that as a

group, less developed countries (LOCs) have been diverging from the developed

countries in terms of productivity over the postwar period. However, the per-

formance among the LDCs has been far from uniform. This indicates that the

realization of the potentiality for productivity catch-up simply because of

backwardness depends strongly on another set of causes, some of which are

internal, others external to the countries themselves (see Abramovitz, 1966).
                                    —2—


     Among the external factors that may influence a country's productivity,

the multinational corporation (MNC) deserves special attention. !n recent

times the FINC has become one of the most important agents in the production

of technology and it plays a major role in the international diffusion of

new technology. However, despite the enormous amount of controversy over

the transfer of technology by multinationals, both in their home and host

countries, there are no studies dealing with the role of these firms in

productivity convergence among countries.

     In this paper we examine the impact of the operations of foreign owned

multinational firms on the productivity growth of Mexican manufacturing

industries. We investigate both the extent to which the penetration of a

sector by foreign-owned firms affects the productivity of local firms in that

sector and whether there is any evidence of convergence between that

industry's productivity level and that of the United States. Thus, we con-

centrate on intra-industry influences and focus primarily on external effects

or "spillovers of foreign direct investment.

     A few earlier studies have tried to test for the existence of such tech-

nology spillovers (e.g. Blomstrbm, 1989, Caves, 1974, and Globerman, 1979),

and they all found some support for the spillover benefit hypothesis.

However, because of great methodological difficulties in investigating

these effects, and a relative paucity of data, none of these studies was able

to analyze the nature of spillover efficiency in any depth. Furthermore, none

of them tried to evaluate the importance of such spillovers for productivity

growth in the host country.

     The remainder of the paper has two major sections: the first focuses on
                                         —3—


the productivity spillovers between domestic and foreign firms in Mexico and

the second on Mexico's international catch—up. There is also a brief summary

section at the end.


Ix.                                              rms in Mexico
      A.   Multinationals,   Technology Transfer, and Convergence

      The convergence hypothesis asserts that when the productivity level of one

(or several) country(ies) is substantially superior to that of a number of

other economies, largely as a result of differences in their productive tech-

niques. then those laggard countries that are not too far behind the leaders

wilt be in a position to embark upon a catch—up process. This catch-up pro-

cess will continue so long as the economies that are approaching the leader's

performance continue to have the possibility of learning from the leader.

However, as the distance between the two groups narrows, the stock of

knowledge unabsorbed by the laggards will grow smaller and approach

exhaustion. The catch-up process will then tend to terminate unless some

supplementary and unrelated influence fortuitously comes to play. Meanwhile.

those countries that are so far behind the leaders that it is impractical for

them to profit substantially from the leaders' knowledge will generally not be

able to participate in the convergence process at all, and many such economies

will find themselves falling even further behind.

      The most important influence underlying this hypothesis is the transfer of

technology that constantly takes place among economies. Technology may be

transferred from one place to another through a variety of channels, but in

the postwar period, the multinational corporations have become the most
                                    —4—


powerful institution for the spread of new technology. Multinational firms

not only establish subsidiaries abroad, but they also transfer technology

through a number of other arrangements, including licensing, franchising,

management contracts, marketing contracts, and technical service contracts.

   Subsidiary production, or what we might call foreign direct investment, is

still the dominant mode in which multinational firms exploit their intangible

assets in foreign markets, and there are several ways in which such investment

may facilitate diffusion of technology from advanced to developing countries.

One is simply that the multinationals set up operations in developing

countries that are beyond the technological capabilities of host country

firms. Even if there is no leakage of the technology to local firms, there

would still be a geographical diffusion of technology, but without any change

in its ownership.

   Technology transfer through foreign direct investment can also result in

indirect productivity gains for host developing countries through the realiza-

tion of external economies. Generally these benefits are referred to as

"spillovers", which indicates the importance of the way in which the influence

is transmitted. There are several ways in which these spillovers may occur.

Presumably the most important channel is via competition (see Blomstrbm,

1986). Existing inefficient local firms may be forced by the competition of

foreigners to make themselves more productive by investing in physical or

human capital or importing new technology.

   Another source of gain to the host economy is the training of labor and

management provided by the multinationals, which may then become available

to the economy in general. Since such resources are in a short supply in
                                    -5—


developing coyntries, this type of spillover efficiency is expected to be more

important there.

    A third potential source of spillover efficiency benefits is through

the impact made by the foreign subsidiaries in the host economy on their

local suppliers, by insisting that they meet standards of quality control,

delivery dates, prices, etc. This aspect should be particularly important

in countries like Mexico, where legislation requires domestic content.

    While all these influences would cause positive long run effects on

host country productivity there are, to be sure, also several offsetting

forces at work. First, technology transfer within multinationals is far

from free (see Teece, 1976). It involves a substantial commitment of real

resources and a sequence of overlapping stages of activities. This will

slow down the technology transfer process and make multinationals unwilling

to share information. Second, the technology that is used by the MNC may

be inappropriate for local firms in developing countries, because of the

relative factor proportions that they face. Both of these positions would

suggest little technology spillover between the MNC and the local firms in

the country. Third, Lall (1980) argues that imports of technology through

foreign investment may work as an important first injection to local

technological development, but that too much reliance on foreign technology

may retard the basic design and development activity in the host country,

causing negative long run effects on productivity.

    To determine whether the presence of MNCs acts as a catalyst or a

hindrance to the productivity growth in Mexico we begin by investigating

productivity convergence among foreign and local firms in Mexican manufac-
                                     —6—



turing   industries. For that purpose we use unpublished data from the Mexican

Census of Manufactures 1970 and 1975 (see Appendix). These are the only two

years for which data by ownership are available. Though the period is unfor-

tunately short, the results are nonetheless quite strong. We first investi-

gate trends within 20 broad manufacturing industries, and then perform a

regression analysis.1


    B. Lregate Trends

    It is clear from Table I that, in 1970, foreign firms displayed higher

labor productivity than Mexican firms. The productivity of foreign firms,

measured both in value—added and gross output, was more than 2 times that of

local firms on average. Among Mexican firms, labor productivity was signifi-

cantly higher in state-owned than in privately—owned firms, although the state

companies were not as efficient as the affiliates of the multinationals.

    To a large extent, the differences in labor productivity can be

explained by differences in the firmst capital intensity. This can be seen

in Table 2, which shows the firms capital—labor ratio as a fraction of the

overall capital labor-ratio of the industry. The capital intensity was 2.5

times higher in foreign firms than in the privately-owned Mexican, but,

interestingly, about the same as in the state—owned firms. However, the

greater efficiency of multinationals relative to both state—owned and

privately-owned firms in Mexico still holds for total factor productivity

(TFP). As Table 3 indicates, the foreign firms' TFP measured in gross output

was 34 per cent higher than that of local firms on average, with the dif-

ference being highest in tobacco (150 per cent higher), petroleum (138 per
cent), rubber (89 cent), and transport equipment (lB per cent). In lumber and

wood products, chemicals, and miscellaneous manufacturing, local firms' TFP

exceeded that of the multinationals.

    However, the data in Table 4 indicate that Mexican firms caught up with the

multinationals over time. Between 1910 and 1975, the multinationals' produc-

tivity lead in terms of labor productivity diminished in the manufacturing sec-

tor as a whole, as well as in three—fourths of the individual manufacturing

industries. There was also a tendency towards convergence in total factor pro-

ductivity over the same period, but these figures should be interpreted with

great caution, since the capital stock figures for 1970 and 1975 are not

directly comparable (see the Appendix).

    In sum, we find rather large productivity differences between foreign and

local firms in Mexico, but that the foreign firm's lead has been diminishing.

To examine whether this productivity catch—up is related to the presence of

multinationals and the existence of spillovers between foreign and local firms,

we will now relate the latter productivity growth to the presence of foreign

firms in various industries.


    C. Regession Analysis
    Two regression forms are used. The dependent variable, in the first, is the

rate of productivity growth of local firms within an industry, and, in the

second, it is the rate of convergence in labor productivity levels between local

and foreign firms within a sector. These variables are related to the degree of

foreign ownership of the industry and the gap in labor productivity between

local and foreign-owned firms in 1970, as well as two other explanatory
                                    -8-

variables.

    As Table 5 shows, the results are consistent in the two regression forms.

Both productivity growth in local firms and productivity convergence between

local and foreign firms are faster in industries with a greater share of

employment accounted for by multinationals.2 Mexican firms' productivity

growth and the rate of catch-up to the MNCs are also higher in sectors where

the initial disparity in productivity levels between local and foreign firms

is greater, a result which accords well with the advantages of backwardness

thesis. Furthermore, in sectors with higher capital-labor ratios, the produc-

tivity growth of locally-owned firms and the rate of catch-up are lower. This

suggests that spillover gains from the new technology of multinationals are

easier to incorporate when the investment requirements are small. Finally,

convergence seems to be faster in industries with slower output growth, but

output growth does not affect the rate of productivity growth of local firms.

This suggests that the competitive pressures from the presence of multina-

tionals in an industry is greater in relatively stagnant industries, In

rapidly—growing sectors, inefficient local firms can continue to survive

without improving their productivity, but in slow-growing industries, the

inefficient local firms could be driven out by the multinationals.3

    The results so far suggest that there exist technology spillovers from

foreign direct investment, with a resulting convergence in productivity bet-

ween foreign and local firms in Mexico, but are these spillover benefits large

enough to generate an international catch—up? We now turn to this question by

looking at the extent to which there has been a convergence of labor produc-

tivity levels between Mexico and the United States.
                                    -9-


III. International catch-up?

   A. Aggregte Trends

   We begin by comparing the productivity levels of foreign and domestic

firms in Mexico with those of the United States in j97Q,4 As Table 6

shows, foreign firms were very close to the U.S.. both in terms of labor

productivity and TFP, while local firms in Mexico were far behind. The

MNCs' labor productivity and TFP both averaged 93 per cent that of the

United States, and in several industries they even exceeded the U.S.

levels. Labor productivity in Mexican firms, on the other hand, averaged

only 39 per cent of the United States. However, the technology gap, as

measured by TPP, was smaller, at 60 percent, which reflects the

considerably higher capital intensity of U.S. production. The productivity

levels for foreign and local firms taken together correspond rather well

with those reported in Maddison and van Ark (1989).

    The finding that the foreign affiliates were so close to the United States

in terms of productivity while local firms were lagging behind, certainly

suggests that multinational firms have contributed to a geographical diffusion

of technology and acted as a bridge between advanced and less advanced

countries. But is this international diffusion of technology enough for an

international catch—up? Table 7 presents the convergence in productivity bet-

ween Mexico and the United States 1970—1975. Overall, there seems to be no

catch—up going on over the 5-year period, but it varies a lot among

industries. In seven industries the U.S. productivity lead diminished, wnile

it increased in 13 industries. Results on convergence are similar for the

2-digit industry sample which includes only 4-digit Mexican industries with
                                     — 10   —




MNCs present. though, as expected, the Mexican productivity figures are

higher. This is suggestive. Since foreign participation varies among

industries it may very well be that foreign investment is related to inter-

national catch-up in one way or another. We will come back to this question

below in our regression analysis.5

   With data from the United Nations we were able to examine the convergence

of labor productivity between Mexico and the United States between 1965 and

198 (Table 5)6 During this longer period there was a clear convergence of

productivity levels in all industries for which data are available. The

biggest catch—up took place during the second half of the 1960s, but slowed

down thereafter. Between 1910 and 1975 there was very little convergence,

just as the census data in Table 7 suggested.


B. ReessionAnjysis
   Since the main purpose of this study is to analyze the role of rINGs

in productivity convergence among countries, we will, finally, by regression

analysis, try to go deeper into that question by relating a sectors' produc-

tivity catch-up to the degree of foreign ownership. As mentioned above, there

are both direct and indirect effects on total industry productivity of foreign

direct investment. The direct effect is that an increase in the share of

multinationals in an industry will increase the productivity level of the

whole industry, simply because MNCs have higher productivity than local firms.

The indirect effect, on the other hand, is the technological spillover between

the multinationals and the local firms. Because of data availability for the

pre-1970 and the post—1975 period, these two effects cannot be separated in
                                     — 11 —



the   regression.

      As before, two regression forms are used. The dependent variable, in the

first, is the rate of productivity growth of Mexican industries (local plus

foreign firms), and, in the second, it is the rate of Convergence in labor

productivity levels between Mexican and U.S. industries. These variables are

related to the degree of foreign ownership of an industry in Mexico and the

initial Mexican-U.S. productivity gap. Both foreign ownership and the initial

productivity gap are significantly related to productivity growth within the

Mexican industry and its speed of catch-up to the corresponding U.S. produc-

tivity level (see Table 9). This holds for both the longer 1965-77 and

1965-84 period, as well as the shorter 1970—75 period.7 The capital—labor

ratio is again significant and negative for productivity growth in Mexico,

suggesting that catch—up with the United States is faster when the investment

requirements are lower. Finally, output growth is here statistically insigni-

ficant.


IV. Conclusion

      Four principal findings emerge from this study. First, productivity

levels of locally-owned firms in Mexico have converged on those of foreign-

owned firms. Second, both the rate of productivity growth of local firms and

their rate of catch—up to the multinationals are positively related to the

degree of foreign ownership of an industry. Third, the productivity gap bet-

ween Mexico and U.S. manufacturing has diminished between the mid-1950s and

the mid—1980s. Fourth, the rate of productivity growth of Mexican industries

and its rate of convergence to the United States are higher in industries with
                                    — 12 —



a greater presence of multinationals. The results support the advantages of

backwardness thesis in two senses: first, between more advanced and more

backward countries and, second, between more modern and more backward segments

of an industry.

     The results also suggest that local firms in Mexico have gained produc-

tivity "spillovers' from the presence of multinational firms in the Mexican

economy. However, there is another possibility, namely, that competitive

pressure from multinationals forces out the inefficient local firms. This is

consistent with the finding that convergence between local and foreign firms

is faster when output growth is lower, though this finding might also be due

to greater efficiency gains of local firms during periods of slack demand.

With the data at hand, we cannot distinguish between these two possibilities.

     There is strong evidence that the presence of multinational firms acts

as a catalyst to the productivity growth in Mexico and that foreign direct

investment speeds up the convergence process between Mexico and the United

States. However, the available data do not allow us to say whether this is

due to productivity 'spillovers" or simply to the fact that MNCs are more

productive than Mexican firms. Although we could not reject the spillover

benefit hypothesis, the productivity convergence between Mexico and the

United States might also be due, wholly or in part, to the direct effect of

foreign investment. This possibility is strengthened by the finding that

the productivity levels of the foreign affiliates in Mexico were very close

to those in the United States, while the Mexican firms were lagging far

behind. Thus, an increase in the share of multinationals within an

industry will increase the level of productivity within the total Mexican
                                     - 13   —




industry,   without any productivity growth among local firms. Furthermore,

the importance of this direct effect is strengthen by the fact that the

largest catch-up effect was registered between 1965 and 1970, a time when

Mexico received a large injection of foreign investment.8

     In general, ne conclude that multinational firms have contributed to a

geographical diffusion of technology and acted as a bridge between advanced

and less advanced countries.

                                     Footnotes


        'Data on the proportion of output and employment accounted for by foreign

firms in Mexican manufacturing industries are provided in Blomstróm (1989).

        2Results are similar for the share of industry output accounted for by

MNCs.


        3This "excise effect" will be explored more fully in a later paper.

Regressions were also performed on the 4-digit industry level. The results

were similar, but less robust, probably because of the greater noise in the

data at the more disaggregated level.

        4As indicated in the footnote of Table 6, the exchange rate was used to

convert Mexican pesos to U.S. dollars. See Maddison and van Ark (1989) for a

discussion.

        51t should be noted that this period is atypical, since 1975 was a

recession year in Mexico, but not in the United States.

        6compared to the data used earlier, the UN data are based on samples of

firms. Most likely, large firms are over-represented in the sample data,

since they show higher labor productivity than do the Census data (compare

figures in Tables 7 and 8). An interesting question for future research is,

therefore, .hether only parts of the Mexican industry (the "modern" part) is

converging, while others (the 'traditional' sector) are not. Such a pattern

was suggested in Blomström (1986), and should be examined further.

        7The fact that the results are slightly weaker for the 1965—84 period

than for the 1965-77 period is likely due to the effects of the debt crisis on

Mexican productivity performance after 1982.

     8We   know that the United States dominates the foreign investment activi-

ties in Mexico. For instance, the U.S. Department of Commerce reports that in

1917, U.S. multinationals employed 302,000 people in Mexican manufacturing

industries. The closest year for which Mexican data are available is 1975,

and then all foreign firms in manufacturing employed 312,549 people. Between

1966 and 1977, the employment in U.S. majority-owned affiliates in Mexico

increased from 102.000 to 171,000 (there are no data on minority-owned aff i-

Hates   for 1966).

a. Basic data are from worksheets provided by la Direccion de Estadistica de
la Secretaria de Industria y Comraercio in Mexico. The TFP figures are based
on gross output in each year, but for 1970 the capital stock figures are based
on capital invertido, while for 1975, they are based on activos fibs brutos,
Since the two concepts differ, comparisons based on the TFP figures in columns
four and five of the table should be interpreted with caution. See the
Appendix for details.

b.  Industries are classified by U.S. SIC code. The results in the first five
columns are based on all four-digit SICs in each industry. The results in the
last two columns are based on only the four-digit SICS in which ZINCs are
present in either 1970 or 1975. See the Appendix for detailed Mexican
industry codes included in each U.S. SIC code.

a. Basic data are from worksheets provided by la Direccion de Estadistica de
la Secretaria de Industria y Commercio in Mexico. The U.S. data for CDP by
Industry in current dollars and full-time and part-time employees are from
NIPA tables. 1970 Mexican value added was converted to 1975 pesos on the
basis of the Mexican CDP deflator and then to 1975 Us dollars on the basis of
the 1975 exchange rate. The 1970 U.S. value added was converted from 1982$ to
1975$ using the U.S. GDP deflator. The TFP index is based on value added.
The Mexican 1970 capital stock figures are based on capital invertido; the
U.S. capital stock figures are from: Musgrave, John C.," Fixed Reproducible
Tangible Wealth in the United States: Revised Estimates," Survey of Current
Business, Vol. 66, No. 1. January, 1986, 51-75. Since the two concepts
differ, the last three columns should be interpreted with caution. The
productivity ratios are relative to the productivity levels of the whole U.S.
industry.

in each industry. See the Appendix for detailed Mexican industry codes
included in each U.S. SIC code.

a. Data for Mexican value added and average number of employees are from:
United Nations, Industrial Statistics Yearbook, various years. The U.S. data
for CDP by Industry in current dollars and full-time and part-time empLoyees
are from NIPA tables. Before 1977. Mexico value added is net of non-
industrial services purchased from others. For Mexico, current pesos were
first converted into 1975 pesos using the Mexican CDP deflator and then
converted to 1975 dollars using the actual 1975 exchange. rate. For U.S., 01W
in current dollars was converted into 1975 dollars using the 15.5. GDP
deflator. Because of a discontinuity in the Mexican value added series
between 1976 and 1976, Mexican value added after 1977 was adjusted as:
     VA*t — VA(VA76.(C077/C0,6)/VA77)
where VA is value added and CO is gross output. See Appendix for Mexican
industries included in each U.S. SIC Code.

                        Appendix:   Data Sources and Methods

I.   Documentation   for Mexican Data on Multinationals and Domestic Firns.

A.. Sources: The data on foreign and Mexican firms were provided by Ia
Direccion de Estadistica de la Secretaria de Industria y Commercio in Mexico,
and are from the Mexican Census of Manufactures, 1970 and 1975. The data are
gathered at the plant level and cover the entire manufacturing industry, which
is divided into 230 4-digit manufacturing industries. Because of missing
information, 15 industries had to be discarded. In the regression analysis of
productivity growth, on the 4-digit level, another 70 industries had to be
discarded because of a change in the classification system between 1970 and
1975.  tn particular, all 4-digit industries in 1970 that were divided into
two or more industry classed in 1975 were excluded.

     Ownership is divided into three categories in the 1970 data: foreign,
state-owned, and privately-owned. In 1975, it is divided into two categories:
foreign and Mexican. Companies whose share are at least 15 percent foreign
owned are classified as "foreign." If the Mexican state owns more than 49 per
cent of a plant, it is defined as state-owned, even if foreigners own 15 per
cent or more of its outstanding shares.

     There are no capital stock figures that are comparable between 1970 and
1975.  For 1970, we use cavital invertido, which is the book value of net
property, plant and equipment plus intangible capital. For 1975. we use
activos fibs brutos, which is the gross value of property, plant, and
equipment. Mexican deflators for CDP and gross fixed capital formation were
derived from tables in United Nations, National Accounts Statistics: Main
Aggregates and Detailed Tables, 1983.
