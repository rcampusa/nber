                                              ABSTRACT

The catchword ‘green skills’ has been common parlance in policy circles for a while, yet there is little
systematic empirical research to guide public intervention for meeting the demand for skills that will
be needed to operate and develop green technology. The present paper proposes a data-driven methodology
to identify green skills and to gauge the ways in which the demand for these competences responds
to environmental regulation. Accordingly, we find that green skills are high-level analytical and technical
know-how related to the design, production, management and monitoring of technology. The empirical
analysis reveals that environmental regulation triggers technological and organizational changes that
increase the demand for hard technical, engineering and scientific skills. Our analysis suggests also
that this is not just a compositional change in skill demand due to job losses in sectors highly exposed
to trade and regulation.

1 Introduction


The catchword ‘green skills’ has been common parlance in policy circles for a while, even more since

the Obama stimulus package committed substantial resources, as much as $90 billion, to training

programs for ‘green jobs’. Yet in spite of a raging debate on the effectiveness of these actions, there is

little systematic empirical research to guide public intervention for meeting the demand for skills that

will be needed to operate and develop green technology. 2 We argue that understanding the extent to

which greening the economy can induce significant changes in the demand for certain skills and, most

cogently, which skills these might be, is crucial to inform policy. More to the point, the benefits of

tailoring training policy to the actual skill needs of the workforce holds the promise of mitigating the

negative employment effects that are traditionally associated to environmental regulation (e.g. Becker

and Henderson, 2000; Greenstone, 2002). This, however, requires prior identification of the skills that

are complementary to green technology and organizational practices.

The present paper addresses this issue by elaborating a two-step data-driven methodology. First, using

the occupation-specific information of the Occupational Information Network (O*NET), we identify a

set of skills that are used more intensively in green occupations relative to non-green ones. Our data-

driven measures build upon prior work on changes in the demand for skills due to structural shocks

such as technology (Goldin and Katz, 1998; Autor, Levy and Murnarne, 2003) and trade (Lu and Ng,

2013). Second, we use these Green Skills constructs to assess the effect of environmental regulation

(ER henceforth), proxied by emission levels, on the demand for skills. In particular, we use variations

in employment shares across states, sectors and occupations to construct aggregate skill measures for

each sector-state pair. In so doing, we identify the impact of ER on green skills using environmental

enforcement activities as instrument to address potential endogeneity of regulation under the

assumption that enforcement decisions affect the demand for green skills only through emission

reductions (Carrion-Flores and Innes, 2010).

This study contributes to the literature in three ways. First, it complements quantitative assessments of

the effect of ER on employment (e.g. Greenstone, 2002; Walker, 2013) by highlighting qualitative

aspects of the composition of workforce skills. Secondly, it extends the remit of literature on the effect

of structural shocks, such as trade and technology (e.g., Autor and Dorn, 2013), on skill demand by

focusing on the transition to a sustainable economy. At the same time, since structural shocks are likely

to undermine the relevance of existing know-how and create the need for new specific competences, it

is important to use suitable measures. Thus, third, our data-driven methodology allows the

identification of skills that are important for green occupations and that are amenable to comparison

with the standard skill measures of Autor et al. (2003).

The main findings of this paper are two. First, our profiling exercise identifies green skills as a set of

competences related to the design, production, management and monitoring of technology. Second, we

find that environmental regulation triggers technological and organizational changes that increase the

demand of high-level analytical and technical skills. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that this is not

just a compositional change in skill demand due to job losses in sectors highly exposed to trade and

regulation.

The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides the conceptual framework on

the relation between environmental regulation and green skills. Section 3 presents the methodology for

the construction of green skills measures. Section 4 outlines the structure of the data and the empirical

strategy, while section 5 presents the main results. Section 6 concludes.

2 Conceptual Framework


The analysis of the relation between environmental regulation and the demand for skills is still at an

exploratory stage. By and large previous works focus mostly on the net employment effects of ER, and

in the absence of suitable points of reference in the literature we draw insights from two areas of

research on structural changes in employment that provide a simple conceptual framework to guide our

analysis of the impact of ER on workforce skills. 3

The composition of employment has undergone significant structural changes over the last three

decades, and one of the most widely recognized marks of this transformation is increasing job

polarization, that is, higher demand for occupations at the top and at the bottom of the skill distribution

relative to middle-skill occupations (e.g. Acemoglu and Autor, 2011). Answers to the question of what

drives this phenomenon point to two, not mutually exclusive (Bloom et al. 2014), main determinants:

technology and international trade. The seminal work of Autor, Levy and Murnarne (2003) (ALM

henceforth) first proposed a heuristic occupational classification based on prior identification of salient

task dimensions: ‘cognitive’ versus ‘manual’ jobs, and ‘routine’ versus ‘non-routine’ jobs. This

interpretative framework offers a persuasive explanation of the changes observed in the structure of

employment during the 1990s in the US and, in particular, of the role of ICTs diffusion in triggering

capital-labour substitution among occupations that consisted mostly of routine, viz. rule-based, tasks.

3
  Empirical evidence on the labour market effects of environmental regulation contemplates a variety of outcomes. Some
studies predict job losses driven by redistribution of workers among industries rather than net job loss economy-wide
(Arrow et al, 1996; Henderson, 1996; Greenstone, 2002), while others find negligible outcomes (e.g. Berman and Bui,
2001; Morgenstern et al, 2002; Cole and Elliott, 2007). Other studies on the US distinguish plant-level effects depending on
the extent to which employment changes consist in higher layoff rates (job destruction) or decreasing hiring rates (job
attrition). Walker (2011) finds that a significant portion of employment adjustments are due to increases in job destruction,
and that this effect is stronger among newly regulated plants. Greenstone (2004) gauges the effects of the 1977
Amendments to the Clean Air Act (CAA) on industrial activity by drawing a comparison of within plant effects under the
attainment and nonattainment regulation regimes and finds that the latter has a modest negative impact on employment. A
more recent paper by Walker (2013) uses worker-level data from the US to estimate the costs associated to reallocation over
time and across jobs due to the 1990 Amendments of the CAA. Again, the impact of environmental regulation is negative
and the estimated loss of earnings per worker depends on the strength of the local labour market. Consistent with these
findings, Mulatu et al. (2010) for European countries and Kahn and Mansur (2013) for US states find that Energy-intensive
and polluting industries relocate in response to ER.

                                                             4
Following the same logic, the complementarity between ICTs and non-routine analytical and

interactive tasks was identified as a key driver of increased demand for high-skilled professionals

(Goldin and Katz, 1998). More recently international trade has been pinpointed as another key driver of

changes in the demand for skills. Ng and Lu (2013) find that import competition is a significant driver

of worker displacement in US manufacturing and, in particular, that higher exposure to foreign

competitors has induced a composition effect in favour of non-routine (cognitive and interactive) skills

to the detriment of routine skills. Evidence by Autor et al (2013) indicates that international trade had

negative employment effects among workers in routine jobs relative to other occupational categories.

On the whole, the contraction of industries more exposed to trade has induced compositional changes

and, thus, an overall improvement in the quality of the workforce. By analogy, since the most reliable

estimates points to a negative employment effect of ER (Greenstone, 2002; Walker, 2011) we expect

that environmental regulation triggers a re-composition in favour of high-level skills.

It should be clear that the main advantage of the task-based model is that it accounts particularly well

for changes in workforce skills induced by new technology, in particular the emergence of new work

tasks and transformations in the task requirement of occupations. Such a framework is attractive for the

goal of the present paper, namely identifying categories of competences that match the emerging green

technology paradigm and analysing the effects of an inducement factor like ER. It is worth recalling

that innovations tend to originate in specific contexts and, accordingly, to draw on particular bodies of

know-how that carry unique peculiarities of the problem-solving process that guides the identification

of critical problems and the search for novel solutions (Rosenberg, 1976). For instance, ICTs belong to

the well-known family of General-Purpose Technologies (GPTs), that is, a uniquely identified blend of

machinery and know-how that can be employed across a wide variety of contexts (Bresnahan and

Trajtenberg, 1995). Having said this, even if technology is a crucial driver of emission reductions

(Levinson, 2014), comparisons with other large-scale transitions should be made with caution for there

                                                     5
is no obvious equivalent to a GPT in the remit of environmental sustainability. A look at well-

established taxonomies of environmentally sound technologies, such as the selection of environment-

related IPC patent classes done in the WIPO Green Inventory 4 or the ENV-Tech Indicator 5 of the

OECD for example, confirms significant heterogeneity across technologies that are closely tailored to

the specific needs of the user industries. At the moment ‘green technology’ is a broad-encompassing

label for a variety of sector-specific responses rather than a standardized technology like ICTs in the

context of computerization. This calls for caution also in uncritically adopting skill measures that were

devised for the study of ICTs and trade, and indeed Section 3 will illustrate a data-driven methodology

to identify the skills that are most relevant to environmental issues. With this caveat in mind, we think

that prior experiences of large-scale transitions can still offer useful insights to guide our expectations

for the empirical analysis.

Recent work shows that the demand for high-level skills due to ICT adoption has decelerated over the

last decade possibly because the technology has entered a mature stage of the life-cycle (e.g. Beaudry

et al., 2013). This is consistent with theoretical literature showing that at the onset of a new wave of

technological change the demand for new skills initially surges and subsequently dissipates inasmuch

as codification and standardization facilitate the diffusion of new best practices and of the attendant

skills (Aghion et al, 2002; Vona and Consoli, 2014). By analogy since green technology is still at early

stages we expect that their adoption will be associated with an increase in the demand of highly skilled

workers. Descriptive plant-level evidence by Becker and Shadbegian (2009) shows that for a given

level of output and factor usage, plants producing green goods and services employ a lower share of

production workers, which lends support to the working hypothesis that green technologies are skill-

biased. Another broad similarity with recent large-scale transitions concerns the prominence of

organizational changes that enabled significantly the adoption of both information (Bresnahan,

                                                            6
Brynjolfsson and Hitt, 2002) and environmental technology (Gillingham and Palmer, 2014). With

regards to the latter, a wealth of empirical studies highlights positive effects due to adoption of

managerial practices and adaptation of organizational structures aimed at improving both

environmental and economic performance. 6 On the other hand some works pinpoint organizational and

human capital factors acting as significant barriers that prevent the adoption of profitable energy-saving

investments (De Canio, 1998; Sorrell et al, 2011). More in general, the literature on skill-biased

organizational change finds a strong complementarity between certain organizational practices and

workforce skills (Caroli and van Reenen, 2001). These considerations suggest that technology adoption

may not be the sole inducement channel through which firms respond to ER (see Jaffe et al, 2002). To

identify a suitable empirical indicator that captures the effects of both technological and organizational

change in this context, in section 4 we consider environmental regulation rather than a direct measure

of green technology adoption since this is expected to proxy all changes affecting both firm’s

environmental performance and the demand for skills.

Summing up, the scarcity of literature on the relation between environmental regulation and the skill

content of occupations limits the formulation of hypotheses. It is however possible to draw useful

insights from other strands of research. The literatures outlined above suggest that since ER induces

adoption of green technology and organizational practices and, since these technologies are still in an

early phase of the life-cycle, regulation is expected to have stronger effects for high-skilled workers.

This should be reinforced by compositional changes following ER. Clearly, insights drawn from

laterally relevant literature can shape our expectations only to a limited extent, and a more precise

delineation of the framework elaborated here requires an empirical investigation of the main

hypotheses and concepts at hand. Let us begin with the identification of green skills.

 Martin et al (2012) find that energy managers have a positive impact on climate friendly innovation. Similarly, Hottenrott
and Rexshouser (2013) report productivity improvements due to complementarity between the implementation of
organizational practices and environmental technology adoption. Also Boyd and Curtis (2014) show that policies aimed at
improving generic management practice trigger positive spillovers on firms’ productivity.

3 Identification and Measurement of Green Skills


This section is organized in three parts. The first offers a critical review of previous and current work

on green occupations and green skills. The second subsection details a novel data-driven methodology

for identifying the core green skills within the US workforce. In the last part we propose a conceptual

and empirical validation of our findings.

3.1 Green Jobs vs. Green Skills

In spite of much interest on green skills there is, to the best of our knowledge, no standard definition

for such a concept. Policy reports and an admittedly scant literature often conflate green skills with

‘green jobs’, namely the workforce of industries that produce environmentally friendly products and

services (see e.g. US Department of Commerce, 2010; Deitche, 2010). A look at ongoing work by

national statistical agencies corroborates this view. In 2010 the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)

launched the Green Jobs Initiative, a scheme aimed at gathering information on the scale, the trends as

well as the industrial, occupational, and geographic distributions of green jobs. Drawing on multiple

sources, the BLS circulates a mail survey, the Green Goods and Services, among a sample of

establishments identified as potentially producing such products and services on the basis on their

NAICS classification. Under this approach, the criteria for capturing green jobs are two, namely the

output approach (“jobs in businesses that produce goods or provide services that benefit the

environment or conserve natural resources”) or the process approach (“jobs in which workers’ duties

involve making their establishment's production processes more environmentally friendly or use fewer

natural resources”). 7 Although this evidence indicates that green employment in 2011 was just 2.4% of

the total US workforce (Deschenes, 2013), several projections forecast significant growth in green

employment over the next two decades (UNEP, 2008; UNEP, 2012). 8 Arguably, however, these

estimates are rather sensitive to where the boundaries of the green economy lie and to what assumption

are made regarding its expansion (Deschenes, 2013). In addition, such an approach ignores the

heterogeneous nature of know-how and the ways in which it feeds into human labour that were

elucidated by task-based model (e.g. ALM).

Another suitable resource is the ‘Green Economy’ program developed by the Occupational Information

Network (O*NET) under the auspices of the US Department of Labor. The core of O*NET is a rich

database containing occupation-specific information on skill occupational requirements and tasks

performed on the job since the early 2000. Therein data encompass multiple aspects of human labour,

namely information on tasks performed on the job, on minimal education and experience requirements

for each occupation and on characteristics of the attending work context. These categories are

organized in detailed descriptors to which expert evaluators and job incumbents assign quantitative

ratings on the basis of questionnaire data on a representative sample of US firms. The Green Economy

program of O*NET is of interest for the present paper because it facilitates the identification of the skill

content of green jobs. These are classified in three groups: (i) existing occupations that are expected to

be highly in demand due to the greening of the economy; (ii) occupations that are expected to undergo

significant changes in task content due to the greening of the economy (green-enhanced, henceforth

GE); and (iii) new occupations in the green economy (new & emerging, henceforth NE) (see Dierdoff

et al, 2009; 2011). Arguably, the involvement with environmental activities is more clearly identifiable

in the last two groups compared to the first one, which can be considered at best indirectly ‘green’. At

the same time while acknowledging the intrinsic value of green job classification of O*NET, we find

that this classification may be too coarse and misleading even for the greener occupations within the


8
 A recent study on the US by Elliot and Lindley (2014) finds that the within industry correlation between productivity
growth and intensity of green employment is negative and, also, that fast-growing industries featured overall lower intensity
of production of green goods and services.

                                                             9
NE and GE groups. Indeed the descriptions of some items within the O*NET catalogue of green

occupations raises questions concerning the use of the ‘full green’ attribute for, among others,

Chemical Engineers, Electric Engineers, Financial Analysis, Rail-track Operators or Metal Sheet

Workers. Rather than the entire skill set of these and other GE and NE occupations being ‘green’, we

observe that only a fraction can be realistically thought of as attuned to environmental purposes.

3.2 A methodology for the identification of Green Skills

Fortunately O*NET allows for a finer distinction between green and non-green tasks, at least for a sub-

set of tasks that are occupation-specific. Thereby, consistent with standard human capital theory

(Becker, 1975), O*NET provides information on ‘general’ tasks, which are common to all occupations,

and tasks that are instead specific to each occupation. Different from general tasks, whose importance

for any given occupation is defined on a continuous scale, specific tasks are a binary characteristic. The

Green Task Development Project of O*NET enriches this distinction for ‘New & Emerging’ and

‘Green-Enhanced’ occupations by partitioning the set of specific tasks into green and non-green. By

way of example, Metal Sheet Workers perform both green tasks, such as constructing ducts for high

efficiency heating systems or components for wind turbines, and non-green tasks, such as developing

patterns using computerized metalworking equipment. Similarly, electrical engineers can plan layout of

electric power generating plants or distribution lines and, at the same time, can design electrical

components that minimize energy requirements.

Using the distinction between green and non-green specific tasks, a first intuitive measure of skill

Greenness is the ratio between the number of green specific tasks and the total number of specific tasks

performed by an occupation k:




                                                      #𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔𝑔 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘
                             𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑠𝑠𝑘𝑘 =                                               .   (1)
                                                      #𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡 𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠𝑠 𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑡𝑘𝑘

                                                                 10
Bearing in mind that the share of green specific tasks over the total number of specific tasks varies

considerably within both GE and NE occupations, this indicator can be interpreted as a proxy of the

time spent by an occupation in a particular class of job tasks related, more or less directly, with

environmental sustainability. The Greenness ratio allows an arguably finer distinction between types of

green job compared to the O*NET definition. Indeed, the indicator represents pretty well the greenness

of an occupation as shown by examples in Table 1. 9 As expected, occupations like Environmental

Engineers, Solar Photovoltaic Installers or Biomass Plant Technicians have the highest Greenness

score by virtue of the specificities of their job content to environmental activities. Occupations that

exhibit complementarity with environmental activities but, also, with an ample spectrum of non-green

tasks have an intermediate score, for example Electrical Engineers, Metal Sheet Workers or Roofers.

At the bottom end of the greenness scale are occupations whose main activity occasionally involves the

execution of environmental tasks but that cannot be considered full-fledged green jobs, such as

traditional Engineering occupations, Marketing Managers or Construction Workers.




                                              [Table 1 and Table 2 about here]




At the same time we acknowledge that using the Greenness indicator as a pure measure of skills carries

limitations to the effect of formulating policy recommendations. First, rather than giving information

on the exact types of skills associated with green jobs, the indicator provides no more than a synthetic

measure of the importance of green task within an occupation. Second, an indicator based on specific

tasks is by definition not suitable to compare the skill profiles of green and non-green occupations and,


9
    The full list of green occupations and their greenness is reported in Table 2.

                                                                 11
thus, to understand which non-green skills can be successfully transferred to green activities and which

green skills should be targeted by educational programs. But such a comparison is essential to estimate

the cost of training programs considering that workers’ relocation from brown to green jobs depends on

the extent to which skills are portable and can be reused in expanding jobs (e.g. Poletaev and Robinson,

2008). To overcome these limitations and broaden the policy relevance of our study, we use the

greenness indicator as a search criterion to create a Green General Skills index (GGS). The

identification is based on measures of general tasks retrieved from the release 17.0 (July 2012) of the

O*NET database. Importance scores for 108 general skills and tasks are reported for 912 SOC 8-digit

occupations. 10 In particular, we propose a two-step procedure. First, we regress the importance score 11

of each general task (or skill) l in occupation k on our greenness indicator plus a set of four-digit

occupational dummies:




                                                                                           𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆_3𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
                                𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇𝑇_𝐼𝐼𝐼𝐼𝑝𝑝𝑘𝑘𝑙𝑙 = 𝛼𝛼 + 𝛽𝛽𝑙𝑙 × 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑠𝑠𝑘𝑘 + 𝐷𝐷𝑘𝑘                   + 𝜀𝜀𝑘𝑘 ,   (2)




where these regressions are weighted by the employment of the occupation. Occupational dummies

     𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆𝑆_3𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑𝑑
(𝐷𝐷𝑘𝑘                     ) are included to allow the comparability of the skill profiles of similar occupations. In

addition, we use only three digit SOC occupations containing at least one item with positive greenness,

thus eliminating occupations that bear no relevance on sustainability, such as Personal Care and




10
   We focus on ‘Knowledge’ (32 items), ‘Work activities’ (41 items) and ‘Skills’ (35 items), while we exclude ‘Work
context’ (57 items) because the items in it contained concern the characteristics of the workplace rather than actual know-
how applied in the workplace. O*NET data have been matched with BLS data using the 2010 SOC code. Details are
available in the Appendix B.
11
   Importance scores in O*NET vary between 1 (low importance) and 5 (high importance). We have rescaled the score to
vary between 0 (low importance) and 1 (high importance).

                                                                             12
Service (see Table 3). 12 Here, a positive (negative) and significant 𝛽𝛽𝑙𝑙 denotes that task l is used more

(less) intensively in greener occupations. Subsequently we assign the green label to the general task

item l when the estimated 𝛽𝛽̂𝑙𝑙 is statistically significant at 99%. To illustrate, a coefficient of 0.2 implies

a 20% difference in importance of task l in occupation k that has greenness equal to 1 as opposed to

similar occupations with greenness equal to zero. The second step is grouping these items into coherent

macro-groups using principal component analysis (PCA) and keeping only the selected green general

tasks that load into principal components with eigenvalue greater than 1. 13 We use PCA only to cluster

items into coherent macro-groups and build our final General Green Skill (GGSk) skill index for each

occupation k by taking the simple average of the importance scores of each O*NET item belonging to a

given macro-group. For instance, for the macro-group Science, the GGSk index is computed as the

simple average between the importance score of ‘Biology’ and the importance score of ‘Physics’ (see

Table 4).

As shown in Table 3, occupations with positive Greenness tend to be concentrated in macro-

occupational groups (2-digit SOC) that are intensive in abstract skills e.g. Management, Business and

Financial Operations, Architects and Engineers and Life, Physical, and Social Scientists. The

polarization of green occupations in these high-level occupational groups explains in part the

prevalence of high skills in our selection of GGS. This finding is consistent with previous research

showing that new occupations such as several green ones are relatively more complex and exposed to

new technologies than existing occupations (Lin, 2011). Thereby our strategy yields four macro-groups




12
   The Greenness of an occupation is positive for ‘Green-Enhanced’ and ‘New & Emerging’ green occupations. The
polarization of green occupations in ‘high-skill’ macro occupational groups partly explains the prevalence of high skills in
our selection of green skills.
13
   In fact, we chose a slightly lower cut-off of 0.98 to include the GSS Science. Science appear together with engineering a
core GGS when using more demanding selection criteria. In Appendix A we present further robustness exercises with
different approaches to select our set of green general skills.

                                                             13
of Green General Skills that are high skilled, and are summarized in the first panel of Table 4. 14 In the

next sub-section we will describe and validate these constructs in detail.




                                           [Table 3 and Table 4 about here]




3.3 Preliminary validation

This section is devoted to commenting on and assessing the empirical constructs outlined in Table 4.

For the goal of grounding our GGSk index within the existing literature, in the absence of suitable

scholarly work specifically focussed on green skills, we take as our main conceptual reference the

wealth of empirical evidence elaborated in the context of policy reports produced by various

international organizations. At the same time, we find it useful to explore commonalities with standard

skill measures developed by the literature on routinization.

The first Green General Skills group, Engineering & Technical Skills, emerges consistently from

several policy reports on Green jobs, especially for green building construction and wind turbine

installations (Ecorys, 2008; UKCES, 2010). These hard skills encompass competences involved with

the design, construction and assessment of technology usually mastered by engineers and technicians.

Engineering skills are also an essential input for energy-saving R&D projects and programs aimed at

reducing the environmental impacts of production activities.

The second item, Science skills, is directly related to the first since it also encompasses competences

stemming from bodies of knowledge broad in scope and essential to innovation activities, for example

Physics and Biology. According to a Cedefop (2009) study, this category of skills is especially in high

14
  The fifth group would only include Geography. We therefore excluded it from the main analysis due to the too narrow
definition of this last component. Baseline results for Geography (and for all single items) are reported in Table 23 in the
Appendix D.

                                                              14
demand at early stages of the value chains and in the utility sector. Although scientific and engineering

knowledge can be highly transferable across domains of use, not all occupations that score high in

these skills have high specific knowledge applicable to environmental issues. For instance, the

occupations with high importance scores in this Green General Skill group are Environmental

Scientists, Materials Scientists and Hydrologists, all having clear direct applications to environmental

problems, as well as Biochemists, Biophysicists and Biologist, which instead are more general-purpose

occupations (Rosenberg, 1998). Similar examples can be made for engineering professions, e.g.

environmental engineers vs. civil engineers.

The third GGS set, Operation Management skills, includes know-how related to change in

organizational structure required to support green activities and an integrated view of the firm through

life-cycle management, lean production and cooperation with external actors, including customers.

These skills have been observed to be relevant in two domains of influence (UNEP, 2007; Cedefop,

2009). The first involves the capacity to use and disclose information on products’ and processes’

characteristics that are relevant for the environment, such as energy-saving and emission accounting.

Examples of professions intensive in these skills are related to the integration of green knowledge into

organizational practices, i.e., sales engineers, climate change analysts and sustainability specialists. The

second relates to adaptive management, that is, the capacity to identify environmental needs and to stir

the dialogue across different stakeholders’ groups, as is the case for Chief Sustainability Officers,

supply chain managers and Chief sustainability officers Transportation Planners.

The fourth macro group, Monitoring skills, concerns technical and legal aspects of business activities

that are fundamentally different way from the remit of Engineering or of Science. Rather than being

directly involved in the design of new products and production methods, these skills are employed

when assessing the observance of technical criteria and legal standards, i.e. regulatory requirements.

The key occupations in this remit are Environmental Compliance Inspectors, Nuclear Monitoring

                                                    15
Technicians, Government Property Inspectors, Emergency Management Directors and Legal

Assistants. The prominence of technical monitoring competences is documented in several policy

reports, while the capacity of understanding the new environmental laws and regulations is key for

firms operating in polluting sectors (UNEP, 2008; OECD/Cedefop, 2014).

A comparison of our green skills constructs with Autor and Dorn’s (2013) Routine Task Intensity (RTI

henceforth) index is useful to assess the extent to which work tasks can be replaced by computer

capital. Such an index is computed as the difference between routine task scores –manual (RM) and

cognitive (RC) – and non-routine task scores –interactive (NRI) and abstract (NRA), see Table 4. 15 The

index increases together with the importance of routine tasks in each occupation, and declines the

higher the importance of interactive and abstract tasks.




                                                 [Table 5 about here]




Against the backdrop of the conceptual validation outlined above, Table 5 presents some descriptive

evidence of our GGSk constructs. First, we observe that the employment share of green occupations is

11% in aggregate. Therein occupations with a low Greenness score (between 0 and 0.25) hold the lion

share (8%) followed by Medium- and High-Greenness intensity with similar shares (1.5% and 1.8%,

respectively). Interestingly the share of green employment weighted by the time spent in green

activities (i.e. the greenness indicator) is 2.8%, which is rather close to the estimate reported by

Deschens (2013) using the abovementioned approach based on the Green Good and Service survey.

Further, as expected the scores of our GGSk constructs among Green occupations are systematically

15
  The index is defined as 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 = log(𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅 + 𝑅𝑅𝑅𝑅) − log(𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁 + 𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁𝑁), with the single components (RM, RC, NRA and
NRI) initially normalized to range between zero and five. We use the O*NET items proposed by Acemoglu and Autor
(2011) to build these task constructs. Differently from previous works, we do not include non-routine manual task construct
in the index because it displays a very high correlation with our routine manual task construct.

                                                            16
higher than for Non-Green occupations (middle part of Table 5). Looking at individual constructs, the

gap is higher for Engineering skills across all occupations (more than 100%) and for Science and

Operation Management among Medium- and High-Greenness occupations. Monitoring is the exception

in that the gap with non-green occupations is rather homogeneous across occupations with varying

degree of Greenness. Thus, the gap between Green and Non-Green occupations emerges as more

pronounced for high-level skills.

Descriptive evidence in Table 5 corroborates our earlier remark that Green Occupations are less routine

intensive than non-green ones, particularly so Medium-Green and High-Green. Lastly, when grafted

onto a standard measure of human capital such as the required years of on-the-job training (O*NET),

the bottom part of Table 5 suggests that only Medium-Green occupations have a significantly higher

score than both Non-Green and High-Green occupations.




                                           [Table 6 about here]




Table 6 indicates higher correlation of the greenness index with Engineering and Science skills

compared to Monitoring and Operation Management skills. This is consistent with the robustness

analysis showing that these hard skills are the true core green skills (see Appendix B). The coefficients

reveal the highest correlations between Operation Management-Monitoring skills followed by Science-

Engineering skills. While the latter reflects the mutual relevance of high-level scientific and technical

skills, the former suggests strong complementarity between technical, organizational and legal

competences involved in strategies to deal with environmental issues. The second part of Table 6

shows the correlations between our green skills measures and the routinization measures. Operation

Management skills exhibit a marked non-routine character because they entail dealing with work


                                                    17
environments that demand situational adaptability and communication, general and problem solving

skills required by ICT technologies. Engineering and Science exhibit as expected a high positive

correlation with NRA since they are all complex cognitive competences to allow the identification of

problems and the design of problem-solving strategies. However, it is worth noting that the correlations

of NRA with Science and Engineering are significantly lower than the one with Operation

Management, and that engineering and technical has a higher correlation with routine manual takss

than NRA tasks. 16

Summing up, this section 3 has proposed a data-driven methodology for the identification of green

skills based on occupation-specific data on the US workforce. The four core competences that emerge

from this exercise are for the most part high-level analytical and technical skills markedly related to the

design, production, management and monitoring of technology. In the next section these constructs will

be put to assess the effects of environmental regulation on the demand for green skills.


4 Testing the relationship between Environmental Regulation and Green Skills


This section describes the data and the methodology used to validate our green skills measures. We

propose a simple empirical strategy to disentangle the impact of a more stringent environmental

regulation on the demand of Green Skills.

4.1 Data

Our analysis of the effect of ER on workforce skills is at the sector-by-state level. This level of regional

aggregation is the most appropriate to preserve fine-grained information of the workforce skills at 4-

digit NAICS industry level. Since the scale of green jobs and skills is still relatively small in US

employment, preserving the maximum level of sectoral and occupation details is necessary for a correct
16
  The low correlation between NRA and Engineering & Technical and Science skills may be due to the fact that NRA is
particularly important for Computer and Mathematical occupations (SOC code 15) for which no green occupation is
observed.

                                                         18
measure of our variables of interest. This comes at the cost of not being able to exploit the time

dimension in the data because detailed information on the distribution of the workforce by occupation,

industry and state is only available for the years 2012 and 2013.

Our primary dependent variables are the four measures of GGSk plus the greenness indicator built by

weighting occupational skill measures by employment using the 2012 BLS ‘Occupational Employment

Statistics (OES) Research Estimates by State and Industry’. These data provide information on the

number of employees by occupation (SOC 2010 6-digit), industry (4-digit NAICS) and state. We limit

our analysis to industries effectively exposed to environmental regulation: utilities, manufacturing and

construction. 17 We aggregate these average values of green skills for each 6-digit occupation, k, to

compute the following index by industry i and state j as follows:



                                                                       𝐿𝐿𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘
                                         𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = ∑𝑘𝑘 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑘𝑘 ×              .                            (3)
                                                                        𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖




Here 𝐿𝐿𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘 represents the employment in occupation k, industry j and state i, while 𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is the

employment in sector j and state i. Recall that GGSk measures are normalized to vary between 0 and 1.

Note that differences in our measures across industries and states depend exclusively on differences in

the composition of the labour force (share of employees in occupation k in industry i and state j)

whereas the green skills content of occupations (GGSk) is defined at the occupational level and so it is

not state-specific. Likewise, we can use equation (3) to construct sector-state skill measures based on

the Greenness indicator, the routine intensity index or standard human capital measures such as

training. When using the share of green specific skills as proxy of green skills, the effect should be

taken with caution because this variable was constructed under the assumptions concerning the

17
  Taken together these three sectors account for more than 90% of air emissions from point sources for all the pollutants
that we consider in our empirical analysis.

                                                             19
distribution of employment within 8-digit SOC category. Further details on the database construction

are contained in the data Appendix B.

Our main explanatory variable is stringency of environmental regulation at the state-by-sector level

proxied by air emission intensity of toxic substances and pollutants covered by the Clean Air Act

(CAA), the most important federal piece of legislation aimed at reducing air pollution concentrations in

the US. 18 Accordingly, our favourite regulatory measures are emissions of the six criteria pollutants

identified by the EPA and subject to the CAA. 19 First introduced in the 1963, the CAA has been

amended several times, the last major amendment dating back to 1990. The legislation sets county-

specific attainment standards on concentration of pollutants and hazardous substances (NAAQS and

NESHAPS, respectively). 20 Counties that fail to meet concentration levels for one or more substances

(toxic substances or one or more of the six criteria pollutants) are designated as nonattainment areas,

and the corresponding states are required to put in place implementation plans to meet federal

concentration standards within 5 years. 21 Emissions of Criteria Pollutants by plant are collected once

every three years into the National Emission Inventory (NEI) developed by the EPA, which contains

detailed geographical and sectoral information to assign emission to 4-digit NAICS industry in each

state. However, since obligation to report for point sources depends on a series of minimum emission

thresholds for each specific pollutant, several sector-state pairs are characterized by zero emissions

(36.4% of the total state-industry pairs that account for 31.5% of employment in 2012).


18
   Brunel and Levinson (2015) review various approaches to proxy the stringency of environmental regulation and conclude
that when the sectoral breakdown is sufficiently narrow emissions are the best proxies of environmental regulatory
stringency because they reflect, by means of a continuous measure, the actual enforcement of regulation rather than purely
legislative acts.
19
   Ozone-formation (sum of nitrogen oxides – NOx – and volatile organic compounds – VOC), particulate matter (PM)
smaller than 2.5 micron, carbon monoxide, nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulphur dioxide (SO2) and lead. In the appendix, we
show also results for the emissions of toxic substances retrieved from the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI) developed by the
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a proxy of regulation used by related study of Carrion-Flores and Innes (2010).
20
   National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) set maximum levels of concentration for the six criteria pollutants and
National Emissions Standards for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAP) set maximum levels of concentration of hazardous
air pollutants.
21
   States may use a variety of policy tools to comply with concentration standards, such as creating a system of pollution
permits or mandating the adoption of specific technologies.

                                                           20
The main advantage of using emissions as a proxy for ER is that they capture particularly well within-

sector changes affecting the workforce composition particularly well. Indeed, a recent paper by

Levinson (2015) shows that around 90% of emission abatement is due to technical improvement within

the sector, which in turn can stem from the direct adoption of emission abatement technologies and

environmentally-friendly organizational practices.




                                           [Table 7 about here]




shows basic descriptive evidence for the skill and regulatory measures by 3-digit NAICS industry.

Briefly notice that the sectors where the share of engineering and science skills is highest are

construction (NAICS 23) and Utilities (NAICS 22) respectively. These two sectors are exactly those

indicated by the policy reports discussed in Section 3. In turn, Operation Management skills are higher

in Oil and Gas extraction (NAICS 211), Utilities (NAICS 22) and Petroleum and Coal Products

Manufacturing (NAICS 324) while Monitoring skills are most important in Utilities (NAICS 22) and

Petroleum and Coal Products Manufacturing (NAICS 324). The Utilities sector, which includes the

power generation sector, exhibits the greatest concentration of all categories of green skills as well as

the highest level of emission intensity. This is closely followed by the Petroleum and Coal Products

Manufacturing (NAICS 324), which is also a large employer of green skills intensive occupations. As

expected, GGS are particularly important in few very emission intensive sectors.

4.2 Estimating equation

To explore the relationship between environmental regulation and green skills, we estimate the

following equation for each of our four GGSij indices:




                                                     21
                                 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 + 𝜸𝜸𝐗𝐗 ij + 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 + 𝑑𝑑𝑗𝑗 + εij .                      (4)




where i indexes sector and j indexes states; 𝑑𝑑𝑗𝑗 are state effects absorbing unobservable factors that

affect both skill demand and ER, such as the demand for sustainable products; 𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑖 are three-digit

NAICS industry dummies that intend to capture unobservable sectorial characteristics potentially

affecting the demand of skills, i.e. technology; 𝐗𝐗 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a set of controls varying at the sector-by-state

level; 𝜀𝜀𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 is a conventional error term. Since our dependent variables adjust slowly to structural shocks,

all explanatory variables are lagged by one or more years. In particular, environmental regulation

(𝐸𝐸𝐸𝐸𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 ) is measured as: log�1 + 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖;2002−2011 � − log�1 + 𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑒𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖;2011 �. 22 We compute

weighted average of emissions over the years 2002, 2005, 2008 and 2011 (see Appendix B), giving

more weights to more recent years o account, at least in part, for regulatory stringency in the recent

past. In addition, we use the logarithm to mitigate the influence of outliers in emissions, while

expressing ER in per-employee terms to depurate the effect of sector size within the state. 23 For

comparison, we also estimate versions of equation (4) that use other common measures of skills used in

the literature, including the importance of routine and non-routine tasks and the years of training

required. Further details on the data sources and the measurement of the variables included in the

econometric analysis are given in the Appendix B.

The set of state-by-industry controls is included to separate the estimated effect of ER on workforce

skills from structural factors likely to affect both variables. First, we include the log of the average

plant size in year 2011 (employees per establishment, BLS), which is likely to be positively correlated


22
   Due to the absence of data on value added by 4-digit NAICS and state, we cannot follow the approach proposed by
Brunel and Levinson (2013) based on scaling emissions by the economic value created by the sector. Our imperfect proxy
of value is therefore total employment.
23
   It is worth remarking that these assumptions have no qualitative effects on our results, which remain qualitatively
unchanged if, for instance, we allow the log in the number of employees to have an autonomous effect on the skill
composition.

                                                                 22
with both environmental regulation (Becker and Henderson, 2000; Becker et al, 2013) and the

employment share of high skilled workers such as engineers or scientists (Doms et al, 1997; Berman

and Bui, 2001). Second, we include the 10-years log change in the level of employment to make sure

that the observed relationship between environmental regulation and workforce composition is not

driven by compositional effects. For example, workforce skills may be higher simply because under-

performing firms relocate in countries or states with milder regulations and thus overall employment

declines. Third, we include the log of the number of monitored facilities to control for the extent to

which industrial and other mobile sources not included in the National Emission Inventory contribute

to local emissions and consequently to the local concentration of toxic substances. States and industries

with larger point sources are more easily targeted by emissions standards as opposed to those with

more diffuse emission sources.




                                           [Table 8 about here]




Table 8 shows that industry-by-state controls tend to be highly correlated with our measures of ER and

hence should be included. In line with previous evidence (Becker and Henderson, 2000; Becker et al.,

2013), the average size of a plant is significantly larger in sectors with higher emissions, while

emissions per employee tend to be higher where more plants are subject to monitoring. Quite

surprisingly, the sign of the correlation between different types of emissions and the past 10-years

change in employment is negative but close to zero. Finally, polluting sectors tend to be slightly more

exposed to import penetration. Since import penetration is a significant driver of changes in workforce

skills, the interaction of ER and import shocks will be investigated in greater detail in what follows.

Two final remarks are in order. First, using state-level data may appear a limitation compared to recent

studies using exogenous change in county level attainment status in terms of ER as research design
                                                    23
(Walker, 2011; 2013). However, county-level data do not contain the fine-grained occupational and

sector details essential to distil all the possible information on a relatively small phenomenon such as

green employment. Second, the effect of ER is identified within 3-digit sectors, thus it may be driven

by sectoral differences across 4-digit sectors in each three digit block. We opted for the 3-digit sector

specification with dummies to capture the effect of import penetration and of its interaction with ER.

At the same time, as shown in Section 5, results are unaffected in a specification with 4-digit sector

dummies.

4.3 Endogeneity

A causal interpretation of the estimated coefficient of ER in Equation 3 should rest on the assumption

that, conditional to the set of controls, the correlation between ER and the error term is zero. 24 This

assumption is likely to be violated in our empirical framework for at least two reasons. First, even in

the favourite specification with three-digit industry dummies, sectors with a higher share of green

workforce may be better equipped to reduce emission irrespective of the level of ER. Second,

emissions are just a proxy of ER, which is likely to be affected by measurement errors. In particular,

we cannot directly observe state policies in sector i, but only the effect of these policies on emissions.

To comply with federal standards, which are based on local air concentrations of pollutants and toxic

substances, states intervene by regulating point sources and other sources. 25 Moreover, air

concentrations depend on other factors such as geographical features of the area and winds. However,

the National Emission Inventory provides detailed information on industry and location of emissions

only for point sources. The exclusion of non-point sources and the failure to account for other factors


24
   Controlling for the average plant size and the number of establishments monitored under the NEI, as we do, is clearly not
enough to solve endogeneity problems because non-point sources and other local features affecting concentration of
pollutants and hazardous substances can display huge variations within and between states.
25
   As observed by Shapiro and Walker (2015), the intervention of states and local authorities to reduce emissions are not
limited to non-attainment counties, that are forced to reduce their pollution concentration, but also on attainment counties
that need to keep their emissions low in order to avoid the risk of passing the pollution concentration thresholds and become
non-attainment counties.

                                                             24
affecting emission concentrations create a gap between latent environmental regulatory stringency and

actual emission intensities of point sources that may generate measurement errors in our proxies. The

latent level of environmental regulatory stringency enacted by states depends on the presence of

nonattainment areas within the state and on the risk that attainment areas may switch to the status of

nonattainment areas.

Taken together these two sources of endogeneity make it difficult to predict the direction of gap

between OLS and IV estimates. OLS are likely to underestimate the effect of ER in presence of

measurement error but the direction of the omitted variable bias crucially depends on initial conditions

which are hard to capture with cross sectional data. On the one hand, if green skills are essential to

abate pollution, sectors that are initially better equipped with these skills have a comparative advantage

in reducing emissions. On the other hand, stringent ER should disproportionally hit sectors that

underperform in terms of emissions and lag behind in terms of technological competences required to

reduce emissions, including green skills. Overall, endogeneity should be addressed to correctly identify

the effect of ER on green skills, but it is difficult to make a reliable guess on the direction of the bias

without resorting to panel data.

To address these concerns, we use the instrument of Carrion-Flores and Innes (2010) to address

endogeneity in the effect of ER. Recall that Carrion-Flores and Innes (2010) estimate the effect of ER,

measured using emission levels, on adoption of green technologies at the sector level. 26 The analogy

with the present paper is that both technology and skills are complements in a hypothetical production,

and thus emission, function. Thereby a successful empirical strategy should identify an instrument that

is highly correlated with regulation but uncorrelated with skill or technology measures. Environmental

enforcement activity is a valid candidate. On the one hand the instrument is likely to be a strong

predictor of regulatory stringency given the support of a vast empirical literature showing that

26
     In their setting, the main source of endogeneity is reverse causality going from innovation to environmental regulation.

                                                                25
enforcement activities are a stimulus to abate emissions (Gray and Deily, 1996; Magat and Viscusi,

1990; Decker and Pope, 2006; Gray and Shimshack, 2011). On the other hand the instrument is likely

to be uncorrelated with our skill measure other than through their effect on regulation. For the case of

patents, Carrion-Flores and Innes (2010) claim that with the exception of effects due to “effective”

environmental standards (i.e. emission levels) enforcement activity does not affect the adoption of

environmental technologies. A similar argument applies to green skills since, different from

environmental patents, GGS are sets of competences of a general character and are not exclusively

employed to improve environmental performance and abate emissions.

Following on the above we account for endogeneity by instrumenting ER with the number of

inspections and violations at sector-state level over the period 2000-2009 (Enforcement and

Compliance History Online – ECHO, managed by the EPA, see Appendix B). Just as for the measure

of ER, the instruments are expressed in per-employee terms (the Appendix C shows that the first-stage

results corroborate our choice). We report in the regressions Tables that the excluded instruments

display a partial F statistics well above the usual cut-off of 10 (Staiger and Stock, 1997). This result is

not surprisingly and confirms the one obtained by Carrion-Flores and Innes (2010) exploiting the time

variation of the data rather than the state variation. The next section illustrates the main results and

presents a series of robustness checks.


5 Estimation Results


This section provides evidence on the positive effect of stringent ER on the demand for green skills.

Recall that a higher emission level implies a weaker regulation, thus we expect a negative coefficient of

ER on green skills. The main results are reported in Table 9. The top panel presents results for our

measures of green skills, including the overall greenness indicator of an industry (column 1), or four

green general skill importance scores (columns 2-5), and an average count of green specific tasks

                                                     26
(column 6). For comparison, the bottom panel of Table 9 includes regression results using several

standard measures of skills proposed by previous literature.

We focus on Instrumental Variable results only since endogeneity affects the reliability of OLS

estimates of the effect of ER on workforce skills. As seen in the notes to Table 9, our instruments are

strong, with a partial F-statistic for the excluded instruments of 112. Full first stages are reported in

Table 24 the Appendix C. For the sake of space and since estimation results appear very similar across

the six criteria pollutants, we report results for SO2 only and leave to Appendix C (Table 19 and Table

20) the results for other pollutants, including those in the complementary pollution data contained in

Toxic Release Inventory. We focus on SO2 emissions since they are the criteria pollutant experiencing

the greatest reduction over the period 2002-2011, and because a revision of the NAAQS for SO2

occurred in 2010. 27




                                           [Table 9 and Table 10 about here]




Our most important finding is that a lower level of SO2 emissions per capita (and hence stricter

environmental regulation) increases demand for each of our general green skills. 28 To quantify the

effect of environmental regulation on green skills, note that SO2 emissions decreased by more 50%

between 2005 and 2011. In the absence of a clear target for criteria pollutant, we use this amount as a

reasonable point of reference for the assessment of a long-term emissions reduction scenario. While the

resulting magnitude appears quite small, since halving emissions would just increase the industry

greenness by 0.002, note from Table 10 that the effective range of variation of our skill indicators is
27
   SO2 emissions shrunk by about 54 percent over the period 2002-2011, the reduction for CO emissions was 9 percent, for
NOx emissions was 46 percent, for ozone emissions was 41 percent and for PM2.5 emissions was 34 percent. As already
discussed, no information about emissions of lead was available in the NEI before 2011.
28
   It is also worth noting that the effect of ER is conditional to the average plant size and to the share of monitored plants.
As expected and shown in the Tables, the latter variable has a positive and statistically significant effect on GGS. Results
for these control variables are shown in Appendix C.

                                                              27
significantly smaller than the theoretical one (i.e. 0-1). 29 The inter-quartile range (IQR) between the

25th and 75th percentile of our various green skills indicators ranges from 0.05 for the greenness

indicator to 0.133 for engineering skills. Since our dependent variable is essentially the mean of a

qualitative index, we use inter-quartile changes to gauge the effective magnitude of the influence of

environmental regulation on green skills and find that a 50% decrease in emissions increase industry

greenness by 4.2% of a full inter-quartile range. It is worth noting that this result is fully driven by a

positive and large effect of ER on green specific tasks, which see an increase equivalent to 8.2% of the

inter-quartile range, rather than on the average count of non-green specific tasks (see columns 6 in the

top Panel and 1 in the bottom Panel). Interestingly, environmental regulation increases demand for both

hard technical skills and organization management skills. The largest increase in demand for green

general skills occurs for operations management and science. A 50 percent reduction in emissions

increases the importance of operations management by 12.6 percent of the inter-quartile range, and the

importance of science skills by 9.5 percent of the inter-quartile range. Operations management skills

are important for coordinating different aspects of the production processes to achieve sustainability

goals, such as technical information, strategic problem-solving and marketing strategies.

Our results also indicate that the complexity of work increases with more stringent environmental

regulation. The bottom Panel of Table 9 shows that more stringent ER increases demand for non-

routine skills relative to routine skills as illustrated by the effect on the Autor and Dorn’s (2013)

Routine Task Intensity. This effect is the result of a positive effect of ER on the demand of non-routine

(NR) skills and a negative one on the demand of routine manual (RM) skills. A 50 percent reduction in

emissions increases the importance of NR skills, such as “thinking creatively”, by almost 7.1% of the

29
   Throughout this section, we refer to a per-employee reduction in emissions, as used in the regressions. For ease of
exposition, we omit the reference to per-employee in most cases. To calculate the emissions reductions, we compute the
weighted average of emissions and employment for each sector/state observation, weighted by employment in 2012. We
then calculate the change in our green skills indices from a given emissions abatement target e� are calculated as:
                           𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎+1           (1−𝑒𝑒̅ )𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎𝑎+1
 ∆𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = 𝛽𝛽̂ × log �                  � − log �                          �.

                                                           28
inter-quartile range. In contrast, a 50 percent reduction in emissions reduces the importance of routine

manual (RM) skills by 10.7 percent of the inter-quartile range. Notably, a more stringent ER does

increase the demand of Routine Cognitive tasks, a category highly affected by the diffusion of

information technologies and that experienced a considerable decline during the 1980s and the 1990s

particularly in clerical occupations of the service industry (e.g., Acemoglu and Autor, 2011). This

result is explained by the relatively high importance of RC skills for technical occupations, especially

in the nuclear power sector (i.e. Nuclear Equipment Operation Technicians), and thus tends to

disappear when we consider manufacturing sectors only. 30 Finally, the importance of training also

increases as emissions fall, but the magnitude is small, with an elasticity of just -0.05, i.e. only one and

half week in response to a 50 percent emission reduction.

In combination, these results support the conceptual framework outlined in Section 2, which suggests

that, in the wake of a structural shock, firms rely on high-level competences to navigate the impending

technological uncertainty. They are also consistent with previous literature on the effects of ICT

technology on the task content of occupations, since skills associated with abstract reasoning and

problem-solving are strong candidates for the successful implementation of technological and

organizational changes necessary to deal with the opportunities and the challenges of emission

abatement.




                                                   [Table 11 about here]




Table 11 shows that our results are generally robust to including 4-digit, rather than 3-digit, sector

dummies with the exception of engineering skills and routine cognitive tasks. As expected, the

magnitudes of the effects of ER on green general skills declines slightly when including 4-digit sector

30
     Table 21 in the Appendix C shows results of our baseline specification when considering manufacturing sectors only.

                                                              29
dummies. One exception is the effect of ER on engineering and technical skills, which is no longer

statistically significant. However, the effect remains significant when considering only manufacturing,

as seen in Table 21 and Table 22 in Appendix C.




5.1 Environmental Regulation and the Decline in Manufacturing Employment

To further explore the consequences of environmental regulation on the composition of employment, in

this section we consider two additional specifications that allow us to frame our results in the broader

picture of considerable decline in US manufacturing employment over the last two decades, which

coincidences with the massive increase of China’s presence in international trade (Pierce and Schott,

2012; Acemoglu at al., 2014). This contraction in employment has recently been touted as a possible

source of improvement in workforce quality. The argument is that, as unskilled-intensive processes are

relocated to labour-abundant countries such as China, the remaining US firms offset price competition

by increasing output quality which, in turn, requires high-level skills. 31 By analogy, more stringent ER

likely adds to the ongoing trade effect and induces further shrinking of high-emission sectors.

However, it is a matter of debate whether the combination of high exposure to trade and regulatory

shocks amplify the compositional effects found for trade by previous studies (e.g., Ng and Li, 2013).




                                                     [Table 12 about here]




First, we re-run our regressions while splitting our sample into expanding and contracting sectors in

Table 12. If the bulk of the ER effect is concentrated in contracting sectors, the technical effect of

needing new labour skills to reduce emissions would be fully dominated by the compositional effect of


31
     See in particular Bloom et al (2014) on this.

                                                              30
high polluting tasks moving to countries with weaker regulation and thus green technologies and

management practices are not the true drivers of the observed shift in skill demand. Although as

expected the effects of ER on our various green skills indicators are stronger in sectors where

employment has decreased over the last 10-years, this effect remains positive and, with the exception

of the overall Greenness index, statistically significant also in expanding sectors. Similarly, the bottom

Panel of Table 12 shows that compositional effects influence the RTI index and the demand of NR

tasks, but still do not completely cancel out the technical effect.

Our second additional specification adds import penetration, a standard measure of exposure to

international competition, to our main specification in equation (4). 32 Import penetration is available

only at the 4-digit NAICS sectors, thus trade effects are identified exploiting variation within 3-digit

NAICS sectors. We use only manufacturing sectors in Table 13, since trade exposure is absent in

utilities and construction. These results are presented in the odd columns of Table 13.

In the even columns of Table 13, we also include an interaction term between ER and import

penetration. This interaction allows us to test whether the effect of ER on demand for skills is stronger

in sectors facing greater import competition. This would be the case if, for example, greater import

competition makes it easier for dirty industries to relocate to countries with weaker environmental

standards. Finally, note that import penetration can also be endogenous to workforce skills. Sectors

with high levels of productivity employ a larger share of high skilled workers and, at the same time, are

able to escape international competition. Thus, we instrument import penetration using its lagged

values (Autor and Dorn, 2013).




                                              [Table 13 about here]

32
  We use data on bilateral trade by NAICS industry (Schott, 2008) combined with the NBER-CES Manufacturing Industry
Database. Import penetration by NAICS industry is measured as the ratio between the value of import and the value of
output consumed domestically (value of shipment plus import minus export), calculated using data from 2009.

                                                         31
The most important result, presented in odd Columns of Table 13, is that the qualitative effect of ER is

not affected by the inclusion of import penetration. The one exception is years of training, which

becomes insignificant. In line with previous research (Ng and Li, 2013), import penetration tends to

increase the demand of high skilled workers, but the effect is significant only for the Greenness

indicator and NR skills, including both RTI and the closely related GGS Operation Management. In the

even Columns of Table 13, we present results for the interaction between import penetration and ER.

Since stricter ER results in lower emissions, a negative sign indicates that ER has a stronger effect

when import penetration is higher. As expected, the joint compositional effects of ER and import

penetration reinforce each other for two GGS, Monitoring and Operation Management, as well as for

more general non-routine tasks. Interestingly, the effect of ER on Monitoring skills is observed only in

sectors with high exposure also to import competition. Conversely, high exposure to both regulatory

and trade shocks decrease the demand of Engineering and Science skills relative to sectors with lower

levels of exposure to import competition. However, the cut-off point at which the positive effect of

reducing emissions becomes insignificant is reached occurs at the 75th percentile of import penetration.

Overall, these results indicate that the compositional changes brought about by trade and ER reinforce

each other for classical non-routine skills, but at the same time being over-exposed to trade and

regulatory shocks may put an excessive burden on the firm and slightly reduce its capacity to attract

scientific talents. These conclusions are admittedly preliminary and indicate a promising avenue for

future research.


6 Conclusions


This paper takes a first step in filling a gap in our understanding of the incidence of environmental

regulation in the labour market. To this end it has, first, identified a set of skills that define more

                                                      32
closely green occupations and, secondly, has gauged the effect of environmental regulation on the

demand for these skills. The contribution to the extant literature is twofold.

First, our empirically-driven selection of green skills allows the detection of skill gaps which can be

used to compute measures of skill transferability from brown to green occupations, or to specify in

even greater details the types of general skills in high demand in specific sectors or sub-groups of green

jobs (e.g. those related to renewable energy). Of the four competences that emerge from this exercise

all have a strong analytic and technical content, but only Operation Management has considerable

overlap with the Non-routine skills that complement ICTs. In turn, the other green skills are more

related to specific applications of Science and Engineering disciplines that require heavy investments in

formal education.

Second, our findings concerning quantitative effects bear relevance for the design of policy. If a target

of a 50% emission reduction entails a 9.5% increase of demand for scientists and a 4.5% of demand of

engineering professions, education emerges as a critical ingredient in the policy mix to promote

sustainable economic growth. Note that an increase in the supply of these skills would pin down the

wages of engineers and scientists thus reducing the cost of adopting clean production methods and thus

the harmful economic consequences of regulation.

Finally, our analysis suggests that compositional changes due to employment contraction among

sectors that are highly exposed to trade and regulation drive only partially the positive effect of

environmental regulation. The positive effect observed for expanding sectors can be more safely

attributed to technological and organizational changes affecting the demand of skills. The interplay of

compositional effects and pure technological effects requires, however, further investigations using

panel data that allow decomposing the relative magnitude of the two effects.

Appendix A: Green Skills

This appendix discusses in detail the results of the selection of GGS. Table 14 reports the estimated β
of equation 2 for all general skills and tasks for which the beta was significant at the 99 percent level or
more. Recall that results are based on 921 occupations observed at the 8-digit SOC level for the year
2012 and regressions include 4-digit SOC dummies. Out of 108 general skills and tasks, 16 have been
selected as particularly relevant for green occupations.


                                   [Table 14 and Table 15 about here]


As anticipated in section 3.2, we perform a principal component analysis (PCA) on these 20 general
skills and tasks to generate more aggregate measures of GGS. As discussed in section 3.2, we retain
five components with respective Eigenvalues (unrotated components) of 5.58, 3.93, 1.34, 0.99 and
0.92, and a cumulative explained variance of 79.72 percent. Table 15 shows the factor loadings of the 5
rotated components (orthogonal VARIMAX rotation) that exceeded a 0.2 threshold. The first
component groups together what we define Engineering & Technical Skills. The second component,
that we label Operation Management Skills, is composed by a group of skills relevant to coordinate
management practices with new technical devices. In the third component we observe three general
skills that we label Monitoring Skills. In this component we observe, however, that two of the general
skills (Law and Government and Evaluating Information to Determine Compliance with Standards)
load much more than the third one (Operating Vehicles, Mechanized Devices, or Equipment) which, in
turns, loads negatively on the second component. Moreover, from careful reading of the description of
these skills, we noted that while the first two clearly define different aspects of Monitoring Skills, the
third one does not relate directly to monitoring skills. We thus decided to exclude this variable from the
monitoring skills construct. The fourth component clearly refers to Science Skills. Finally, the fifth
components is characterized by a big factor loading from Geography (0.84) and a smaller loading from
Law and Government (that was, however, already assigned to component 3). Geographic skills pertain
to urban planning and analysis of emission dynamics (several profession intensive of Geography skills
are green, such as Environmental Restoration Planners, Landscape Architects and Atmospheric and
Space Scientist). Due to the specificity of this last component, that only refer to one general skill, we
do not include it in the main analysis. Results on the impact of ER for this GGS and for each single



                                                    34
general skill selected here (including “Operating Vehicles, Mechanized Devices, or Equipment” and
“Geography”, that were excluded from the GGS constructs) are discussed in the Appendix D.
We tried several alternative ways of selecting GGS to assess the robustness of our selection procedure
and to identify the GGS that are selected irrespective of the procedure. We present here two of these
additional exercises. First, we estimate equation 2 by weighting each occupation for its number of
employees in year 2012 33. Note that this is not our favourite selection method because it assigns
excessive importance to occupations that are highly present in the service sector and thus are not
directly affected by the sustainability issues. Results are reported in Table 16. This second method only
retain general skills that enter two of our Engineering & Technical and Science skills constructs, with
the addition of Chemistry that was not selected in our preferred approach. Engineering & Technical
and Science skills appear to be the set of core technical and scientific skills that are required in green
occupations. Second, we decompose the indicator of Greenness into its two components, that is the
count of green specific tasks and the count of total specific tasks. In this specification we allow both
component of the Greenness indicator to have an independent effect on general skills. Results for the
coefficients associated with green specific tasks and total specific tasks are reported in Table 17. We
observe a positive and significant (at the 99 percent level) relationship between the number of green
specific tasks for 13 general skills. Out of these 13 skills, just one (Systems Evaluation) also shows a
positive and significant correlation with the total number of specific tasks. These 13 general skills
represent a subset of our initial selection of 16 general skills. This second criterion excludes two
general skills that entered the Operation Management GGS (System Analysis and Updating and Using
Relevant Knowledge) and one Science skills (Biology).

Appendix B: Data

O*NET and BLS data

Our set of skill measures is built using occupation-industry-state employment levels from BLS to
weight O*NET data of occupational skills. We use the release 17.0 (July 2012) of O*NET and
employment figures for the year 2012. Note that occupation-industry-state cells with less than 30
employees are not reported. Out of 18,942,800 employees in NAICS industries 21, 22, 31, 32 and 33 in


33
  Weights at the 6-digit SOC level for year 2012 are based on the Occupational Employment Statistics prepared by the
Bureau of Labor Statistics. It collects, among other things, aggregate employment measures by detailed occupation. No
information is available at the 8-digit SOC level. As discussed in Appendix B about state-industry measures, we decide to
weight equally each 8-digit occupation within its corresponding 6-digit macro-occupation.

                                                            35
year 2012 (Occupational Employment Statistics, BLS), detailed information (6-digit SOC occupation 34
by 4-digit NAICS industry) by state is available for 14,882,610 employees, that is 78.6 percent of the
total.
It is also worth recalling that the mismatch between the aggregation of the O*NET database and the
Occupational Employment Statistics has been addressed by assuming that employees are uniformly
distributed across 8-digit SOC occupations within each 6-digit SOC occupation. 8-digit and 6-digit
occupations coincide for 678 occupations. For the remaining 97 6-digit occupations the average
number of 8-digit occupation is 3 and the median is 2, with a maximum of 12. The task constructs at 6-
digit SOC are built as the simple mean of the task constructs at 8-digit SOC. This is clearly a limitation
of the combination of O*NET with the BLS Occupational Employment Statistics Database but, in
absence of detailed information on employment at the 8-digit SOC level, the aggregation of
information of O*NET by means of simple mean remains the only viable option.

Construction of the skill measures
                                                                                                          𝐿𝐿𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘𝑘
Skill measures at the industry-state level are built using equation 3, i.e. 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑆𝑆𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 = ∑𝑘𝑘 𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝐺𝑘𝑘 ×              .
                                                                                                           𝐿𝐿𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖

Importance scores range from 1 (not important) to 5 (very important) and measure how important is the
general task for the occupation. Before computing GGSk, we rescale scores to range, potentially,
between 0 and 1 (we subtract 1 and divide by 4 each item that enters GGSk). Some of the items that are
needed for the construction of the RC indicators suggested by Acemoglu and Autor (2010) are ‘Work
context’ (labelled as ‘cx’ in Table 4). Scores for ‘Work context’ items refer, depending on the specific
item, on the importance, frequency or other dimensions of the work context analysed. Scores, that
range from 1 to 5, have been rescaled to vary between 0 and 1 in the same way as importance scores.

Emissions

We retrieve information on the six criteria pollutants regulated by the Clean Air Act (SO2, NOx, VOC,
lead, ozone and PM 2.5) and on the hazardous substances subject to the National Emissions Standards
for Hazardous Air Pollutants (NESHAPS). Emissions for criteria pollutants from point sources are
collected by the EPA every third year and published in the National Emission Inventory (NEI) database
at the facility level while releases of hazardous substances from point sources are collected every year
by the EPA and published in the Toxic Release Inventory (TRI). For both NEI and TRI, the obligation
to report emissions concerns facilities above certain size and emission thresholds. While the thresholds

34
     Both O*NET and BLS use the 2010 version of the Standard Occupational Classification.

                                                            36
for TRI are set at the federal level 35, thresholds for the NEI are set at the state level. For what concerns
hazardous substances in the TRI, from the initial list of chemical substances we selected 148 subject to
concentration standards under the 1990 CAA Amendments for which we have information on the
toxicity potential and weight toxic emissions accordingly. 36
For both criteria pollutants and emissions of hazardous substances, we assigned emissions to the main
4-digit NAICS industry and state in which the polluting facility operates. We employ weighted average
of emissions in the years 2002, 2005, 2008 and 2011. The weights are such that emissions at t are
weighted half as much as emissions at t+3. The weights for 2002, 2005, 2008 and 2011 are,
respectively, 0.0667, 0.1333, 0.2667 and 0.5333. Lead emissions are available for 2011 only. Results
remain unaffected when choosing different weighting. Trends in total emissions of criteria pollutants
for point sources in the US are reported in Table 18. We divide emissions by the number or employees
by industry and state in year 2011 (Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages, BLS).


                                                 [Table 18 about here]



Instrumental variables

We instrument our proxy of regulatory stringency, that is emissions per employee, with the number of
violations and the number of (full) inspections by industry (main NAICS 4-digit code of the facility)
and state. Information on violations and inspections is retrieved from the Enforcement and Compliance
History Online (ECHO) database maintained by the EPA. We count full inspections 37 and violations 38
per employee (2009) registered in the period 2000-2009.




35
   The obligation to submit a TRI report concerns facilities employing 10 or more full-time equivalent employees and
manufacturing, processing or using TRI-listed chemicals above certain thresholds. More specifically, facilities should
manufacture or process more than 25,000 lbs. of a TRI-listed chemical or use more than 10,000 lbs. of a listed chemical in a
given year.

   We use average toxicity weights for inhalation unit risk and oral slope factors from the EPA’s Risk-Screening
Environmental Indicators (RSEI) (EPA, 2013).
37
   As suggested in the guidelines of ECHO (http://echo.epa.gov/files/echodownloads/AFS_Data_Download.pdf), full
inspections correspond to the following codes of the field ‘NATIONAL_ACTION_TYPE’: FF (STATE CONDUCTED
FCE/OFF-SITE), FS (STATE CONDUCTED FCE/ON-SITE), FE (EPA FCE/ON-SITE - FCE = Full Compliance
Evaluation), FZ (EPA CONDUCTED FCE/OFF-SITE), 1A (EPA INSPECTION - LEVEL 2 OR GREATER), and 5C
(STATE INSPECTION - LEVEL 2 OR GREATER).
38
   We record violations of any of the pollutants regulated by the EPO.

Appendix C: Additional information and robustness checks for results discussed in
   Section 5

                                 [Table 19, Table 20 Table 23 about here]

Appendix D: Results for single items of skills

In this appendix we briefly discuss results of our baseline specification when using each single general
skill that results to be a ‘green skill’ according to our selection procedure (see Appendix). We have a
total of 16 green general skills that have been selected as described in Section 3.2 and Appendix A.
Results for our baseline specification (see Section 4.2) for these general skills are reported in Table 27.
                                           [Table 27 about here]


First, we observe a positive and significant relationship between environmental regulatory stringency
and the demand for skills (negative sign for our proxy of regulatory stringency), both with 3-digit and 4
digit NAICS dummies, for 8 out of 16 general skill measures while for other 3 general skill measures
the relationship holds only for one of the two specifications while it is not statistically significant for
the other. For the remaining 5 measures (including Geography), a positive sign is observed for
Operating Vehicles, Mechanized Devices, or Equipment (that did not enter any GGS measure), no
significant relationship is found for Building and Construction, Estimating the Quantifiable
Characteristics of Products, Events, or Information and Evaluating Information to Determine
Compliance with Standards while we observe a change in the sign, from negative to positive when
moving from 3-digit NAICS dummies to 4-digit NAICS dummies, for Mechanical skills. All in all,
results for our GGS measures are confirmed for most of the items that enter the GGS construct
themselves.
