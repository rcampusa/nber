Adjustment to Small, Large, and Sunspot Shocks in Open Economies With Stock Collateral
Constraints

                                          ABSTRACT

This paper characterizes analytically the adjustment of an open economy with a stock collateral
constraint to fundamental and nonfundamental shocks. In the model, external borrowing is
limited by the value of physical capital. Three results are established: (1) Adjustment to external
shocks is nonlinear. In response to small negative output shocks, the economy adjusts as
prescribed by the intertemporal approach to the current account, with increases in debt, deficits in
the trade and current account balances, and no significant movement in the price of collateral. By
contrast, in response to large negative output shocks the economy experiences a sudden stop with
debt deleveraging, trade and current account reversals, and a Fisherian deflation of asset prices.
(2) Generically, weak fundamentals (low output and high external debt) give rise to multiple
equilibria. (3) In this case, the economy is prone to self-fulfilling sudden stops driven by
downward revisions of expectations about the value of collateral.

1     Introduction
This paper characterizes analytically the adjustment of an open economy with a stock collat-
eral constraint to small and large fundamental shocks and to nonfundamental (or sunspot)
shocks. In a model driven by productivity shocks, we derive a threshold for the magnitude
of negative shocks. For negative realizations of the shocks that are smaller than this thresh-
old, the presence of the collateral constraint does not affect the adjustment. In particular,
in response to a negative productivity shock, the economy adjusts as prescribed by the in-
tertemporal approach to the current account. That is, it borrows internationally to smooth
consumption, which causes a deterioration of the trade balance and a deterioration of the
current account. Along this adjustment, the equilibrium price of collateral is unaffected.
By contrast, if the size of the negative productivity shock is larger than the aforementioned
threshold, then the presence of the constraint amplifies the adjustment. Instead of borrowing
from abroad to smooth consumption, the economy is forced to deleverage. As a consequence
the current account and the trade balance display surpluses, and consumption contracts by
more than the decline in output. In addition, the deleveraging induces a massive desire to
sell capital, resulting in a Fisherian deflation of Tobin’s q and fire sales.
    These results complement existing ones derived numerically in the context of calibrated
models. For example, in a model calibrated to Mexico Mendoza (2010) finds that the un-
conditional standard deviation of output is about the same in versions of his model with
and without the stock collateral constraint—a finding he interprets as indicating that the
presence of collateral constraints does not amplify regular business cycles. At the same time,
Mendoza finds that aggregate dynamics are amplified in periods in which negative shocks
are so large that the collateral constraint binds.
    Open economies with collateral constraints are vulnerable not just to fundamental sources
of uncertainty, but also to nonfundamental ones. A problem that plagues this type of
economies is that under plausible parameterizations, the equilibrium may fail to be unique.
The possibility of equilibrium multiplicity in open-economy models with collateral constraints
has been suggested by Mendoza (2005) and by Jeanne and Korinek (2010). The former study
considers a model with a flow collateral constraint in which external borrowing is limited
by the value of output and the latter considers a model with a stock collateral constraint,
like the one studied in the present analysis. Both papers present a heuristic analysis of the
problem and are focused on providing conditions for uniqueness. In this regard, the contri-
bution of the present paper is to prove the existence of multiple equilibria formally and to
characterize the associated equilibrium dynamics.
    Essentially, the problem that arises is that if an unconstrained equilibrium exists, often


                                              1
a second equilibrium exists in which the collateral constraint is binding. This situation is
more likely to occur when economic fundamentals are weak, that is, when the country is
highly indebted and output is depressed. In the equilibrium with the binding collateral
constraint, negative beliefs bring the price of capital down, causing a tightening of the
collateral constraint. In turn, the decline in the value of collateral forces agents to deleverage
leading to a fire sale of capital. Because the stock of capital is fixed in the short run, the
fire sale depresses asset prices, validating the negative beliefs. The resulting self-fulfilling
crisis carries all the characteristics of a sudden stop, namely, reversals in the trade and
current-account balances and a contraction in aggregate demand. In addition, we show
that these confidence crises are welfare decreasing, as they force households to deviate from
consumption smoothing. In this sense, the deleveraging that occurs in a self-fulfilling crisis
can be interpreted as underborrowing.
    The remainder of the paper is organized in six sections. Section 2 presents an open
economy model with a stock collateral constraint. Section 3 characterizes the steady-state
equilibrium. Section 4 characterizes the equilibrium adjustment to regular-sized shocks.
Section 5 characterizes the equilibrium adjustment to large shocks. Section 6 proves the
existence of multiple equilibria and characterizes the dynamics of self-fulfilling financial crises.
Section 7 concludes.


2     The Model
Consider a perfect-foresight small open economy populated by a large number of households
with preferences given by the utility function
                                            ∞
                                            X
                                                  β t ln ct,
                                            t=0


where ct denotes consumption and β ∈ (0, 1) denotes the subjective discount factor. The
sequential budget constraint of the household is assumed to be of the form

                                                                dt+1
                              ct + dt + qt(kt+1 − kt ) = yt +        ,                          (1)
                                                                1+r

where dt denotes debt acquired in period t − 1 and due in period t, kt denotes the stock of
physical capital in period t, qt denotes the price of one unit of capital in terms of consumption
in period t, yt denotes output in period t, and r > 0 denotes a constant interest rate on debt.
For simplicity, we assume a zero depreciation rate of physical capital. Output is produced



                                                   2
with the technology
                                                               yt = Atktα ,                                        (2)

where At is an exogenous and deterministic productivity factor, and α ∈ (0, 1) is a parameter.
   Assume that borrowing is limited by a constant fraction κ > 0 of the value of physical
capital. Formally,
                                                             dt+1 ≤ κqt kt+1 .                                     (3)

The parameter κ can be interpreted as the fraction of assets that lenders could seize from the
borrower in the event of a default. Under this interpretation, the above borrowing constraint
is an incentive compatibility restriction, which ensures that the borrower never walks away
from his external debt obligations.1
   The above collateral constraint pertains to the class of stock collateral constraints, be-
cause the pledgeable object, physical capital, is a stock. Because the price of capital, qt , is
taken as given by the individual household, but is endogenously determined in equilibrium,
the collateral constraint introduces a pecuniary externality. An increase in the aggregate de-
mand for capital drives up qt, allowing the individual household to borrow more. Similarly,
a fall in the aggregate demand for capital drives qt down, which may force households to
deleverage. Individual households understand this mechanism, but fail to internalize it, be-
cause, due to their atomistic nature they correctly realize that their own demand for capital
is too small to affect its price. This externality and its implications for prudential policy was
first stressed in the context of an open economy model by Auernheimer and Garcı́a-Saltos
(2000). It has been extensively studied by subsequent authors in the context of both stock
and flow collateral constraint models.2
       The household chooses sequences ct > 0, dt+1 , and kt+1 ≥ 0 to maximize its lifetime
utility subject to the sequential budget constraint (1), the production technology (2), and
the collateral constraint (3), taking as given the sequence of prices qt and the initial conditions
d0 and k0 . The Lagrangian associated with this optimization problem is

     Alternatively, one could assume that borrowing is limited by the expected value of capital at the time

                                                                     α−1
                                                                        

Optimality condition (5) equates the marginal costs and benefits of increasing dt+1 . The
marginal benefit is 1/(1 + r) units of consumption in t, which is equivalent to λt /(1 + r)
units of utility. In normal times, i.e., when the collateral constraint is not binding, the
marginal cost of increasing dt+1 by one unit is the sacrifice of one unit of consumption in
t + 1, which is equivalent to βλt+1 units of utility. When the collateral constraint is binding,
the marginal cost of an additional unit of debt increases by µt units of goods or λt µt units
of utility, reflecting a shadow punishment for trying to increase debt when the household
is up against the limit. Similarly, optimality condition (6) equates the marginal cost and
benefit of purchasing an additional unit of capital. The marginal cost of capital is its price,
qt. During normal times, the marginal benefit of an additional unit of capital purchased in t
                                                                                            α−1
is the additional output it generates in t + 1, or the marginal product of capital αAt+1 kt+1   ,
plus the price at which this additional unit of capital can be sold in period t + 1, qt+1. When
the collateral constraint binds, the benefit of an additional unit of capital increases by κµt qt,
reflecting its contribution to relaxing the borrowing constraint.
    The optimality conditions associated with the household’s optimization problem also
include the Kuhn-Tucker non-negativity and slackness conditions

                                                      µt ≥ 0,                                                 (7)

and
                                          µt (κqt kt+1 − dt+1 ) = 0.                                          (8)

Because preferences display no satiation, the optimality conditions include the terminal
condition3
                                              dt+1             qt kt+1
                                      lim           t
                                                      = κ lim          .                                      (9)

     In the appendix we show that if a set of sequences {ct , dt+1, kt+1 } satisfies all optimality conditions but
(9), then there exists a welfare-dominating set of feasible sequences, that is, sequences satisfying (1)-(3) that
generate higher utility.



                                                         4
   To facilitate the characterization of equilibrium, assume that the aggregate supply of
capital is fixed and equal to k > 0. Therefore, in equilibrium we have

                                             kt = k,                                      (10)

for all t. The price of capital must be nonnegative, that is, qt ≥ 0. In addition, we restrict
attention to equilibria in which the price of capital does not display a bubble, that is,
equilibria in which qt grows at a rate strictly less than r. Formally, we impose

                                      lim (1 + r)−t qt = 0.                               (11)
                                      t→∞


Conditions (9)-(11) imply that the present discounted value of debt must converge to zero,
that is,
                                      lim (1 + r)−t dt = 0.                               (12)
                                     t→∞

In turn, this condition together with the sequential budget constraint (1) and the market
                                             yt −ct
clearing condition (10) implies d0 = ∞
                                     P
                                        t=0 (1+r)t , which states that the present discounted
value of future expected trade balances must cover the country’s initial net external debt
position. Finally, we assume that the subjective and market discount factors are equal,

                                         β(1 + r) = 1.

   A (bubble-free) competitive equilibrium is then a set of sequences ct > 0, dt+1 , µt ≥ 0,
and qt ≥ 0 satisfying

given d0 and the exogenous sequences At and yt ≡ At k α. Equation (15) together with the


                                                 5
requirement that ct > 0 implies that µt < 1/(1 + r) < 1.


3     The Steady-State Equilibrium
Suppose that the productivity factor At is constant over time and equal to A for all t ≥ 0,
where A is a positive parameter. Then the path of output is also constant and equal to
yt = y ≡ Ak α. In this section we show that under these conditions, there exists a steady-
state equilibrium, that is, an equilibrium in which all variables are constant over time.
    A steady-state equilibrium is a set of constant sequences ct = c∗ > 0, dt+1 = d∗ , µt =
µ∗ ≥ 0, and qt = q ∗ ≥ 0 that satisfy equilibrium conditions (13)-(19) given d0 . What does
the steady state look like? Because consumption is constant over time, equation (15) implies
that µ∗ = 0. This means that in the steady state the economy is not borrowing constrained.
Then, equation (16) becomes qt = βqt+1 + βαy/k. Since β ∈ (0, 1), the unique stationary
solution to this expression is
                                           αy/k
                                      q∗ =       > 0,                                  (20)
                                             r
which intuitively says that the steady-state price of capital equals the present discounted
value of current and future marginal products of capital.
    Evaluating the sequential budget constraint (14) in any period t > 0 implies that the
steady-state level of consumption is given by

                                                     r ∗
                                     c∗ = y −           d.
                                                    1+r

This is a familiar characteristic of open economy models in the steady state. It says that
households consume their permanent income, given by the sum of nonfinancial income, y,
and interest income, −rd∗ /(1 + r). Using the above expression to eliminate c0 from the
sequential budget constraint in period 0 yields

                                          d∗ = d0 .

Thus, the steady-state level of debt depends on (is actually equal to) the level of debt
inherited from the past in period 0. Because the net debt position is constant in the steady
state, we have that the steady-state current account, denoted ca∗ , is nil,

                                          ca∗ = 0.




                                                6
The steady-state trade balance, tb∗ ≡ y − c∗, equals the interest obligations on external debt,

                                                    r ∗
                                           tb∗ =       d.
                                                   1+r

Finally, it is natural to ask what levels of debt are sustainable in the steady state. Taken
together, the above expression for steady-state consumption and the requirement that con-
sumption be positive impose the following upper bound on external debt

                                                   1+r
                                            d0 <       y,                                    (21)
                                                    r

which is a natural debt limit, above which servicing the debt would cause households to
starve. The collateral constraint introduces a second upper bound on debt, given by

                                                          αy
                                         d0 ≤ κq ∗k = κ      .                               (22)
                                                           r

Comparing the debt bounds (21) and (22) we have that as long as κ < 1, the latter will be
the more restrictive bound. Throughout the paper, we assume, as in much of the related
literature, that
                                               κ < 1.

This restriction says that leverage cannot exceed one hundred percent. It then follows that
the maximum value of debt sustainable in the steady state is given by condition (22). Any
level of debt satisfying this condition can be supported as a steady-state equilibrium.


4     Frictionless Adjustment To Regular Shocks
An important theme of the collateral-constraint literature is that this type of financial friction
affects the adjustment of economies to large, unusual shocks, but not to regular-sized shocks.
We illustrate this principle by characterizing the equilibrium dynamics implied by the present
model in response to regular and large negative productivity shocks. The analysis will make
clear what constitutes a regular and a large shock in the present environment.
   Suppose that the economy was in a steady state until period -1. Suppose also that in
period 0 the productivity factor At unexpectedly falls from A to AL < A, and returns to
A permanently starting in period 1. This sequence of productivity shocks gives rise to the
following path for output
                                     (
                                         y L ≡ AL k α   for t = 0
                              yt =              α     L
                                                                  .
                                         y ≡ Ak > y for t > 0

                                                   7
   The question we wish to answer here is under what conditions the adjustment to the
negative productivity shock will be frictionless. By a frictionless adjustment we mean one
that would occur if the collateral constraint was not in place. The equilibrium conditions of
the frictionless economy are (13)-(16) and (19), with µt = 0 for all t.
   Let cnc
         t denote the equilibrium level of consumption in period t in the economy without
the collateral constraint (nc for no collateral constraint). Then, equation (15) implies that

                                            cnc   nc
                                             t = c ,


for all t ≥ 0, where cnc is a constant. So equilibrium consumption is perfectly smooth in
the economy without the collateral constraint. This is a consequence of the assumption that
β(1 + r) = 1. Evaluating the intertemporal resource constraint (13) at ct = cnc for all t ≥ 0
implies that cnc is given by

                                             r
                               cnc = c∗ −       (y − y L) < c∗ ,
                                            1+r

for all t ≥ 0, where, as before, c∗ = y − r/(1 + r)d0 denotes the level of consumption that
would have occurred in the absence of the negative productivity shock in period 0. Now using
the sequential resource constraint (14), we obtain a constant equilibrium path of external
debt given by
                                dnc
                                 t = d
                                      nc
                                         ≡ d0 + y − y L > d0 ,

for all t ≥ 1. In period 0, both the current account and the trade balance deteriorate,

                                                y − yL
                                    canc
                                      0 =−             < 0,
                                                 1+r

and
                                            y − yL
                                  tbnc
                                    0= tb − ∗
                                                   < tb∗.
                                             1+r
Because the productivity shock is temporary, the household borrows an amount close to
the output shock (y − y L ) to smooth consumption. More precisely, the household borrows
(y − y L )/(1 + r). This increases debt in period 1 by exactly y − y L. The household finds
it optimal to pay the interest on the additional debt every period, but not the principal, so
consumption falls slightly by the increased interest service, r(y − y L )/(1 + r).
   Finally, because, by definition, in the economy without the collateral constraint µt = 0,
equation (16) implies that the price of capital is unchanged by the productivity shock,

                                         qtnc = q nc ≡ q ∗


                                                8
for all t.
    Under what conditions does the equilibrium in the economy without the collateral con-
straint coincide with the equilibrium in the economy with the collateral constraint? For this
to be the case, it is necessary that the collateral constraint (18) be satisfied when evaluated
at dnc and q nc , that is, it is necessary that

                                            dnc ≤ κkq ∗ .

Using the solution for dnc obtained above yields the condition

                                       y − y L ≤ κq ∗ k − d0 .                                   (23)

The right-hand side of this expression is the slack in the collateral constraint prior to period
0. The left-hand side is the output contraction in period 0. Thus, an output contraction
in period 0 induces a frictionless adjustment if it is smaller than the slack in the collateral
constraint prior to the shock. It follows that the adjustment to an output contraction is
more likely to be frictionless the smaller is the contraction itself, the smaller is the level of
debt prior to the contraction, d0 , and the less severe is the financial friction, i.e., the larger is
κ. In the context of this model, we will refer to contractions that satisfy (23) as regular-sized
contractions.


5     Adjustment To Large Shocks
Continue to assume that the economy was in a steady state until period -1. But now assume
that the contraction of output in period 0, y − y L, is so large that condition (23) is not
satisfied, so that
                                       y − y L > κq ∗k − d0 .                                    (24)

In the context of the present model, we define a large contraction as one that satisfies the
above inequality.
  What does the equilibrium look like when the economy is hit by a large negative shock?
We wish to show that a large negative output shock causes a Fisherian deflation, that is, a
fall in the price of capital, qt, and deleveraging, that is, a reduction in net external debt, dt .
The first thing to note is that the collateral constraint must bind in at least one period, that
is, µt must be strictly positive and condition (3) must hold with equality for some t ≥ 0. To
see this, suppose, on the contrary that µt = 0 for all t. Then, by the debt Euler equation (15),
ct is constant over time, which implies, by the intertemporal resource constraint (13), that


                                                  9
ct = cnc . The sequential budget constraint (14) then yields dt+1 = dnc , and the capital Euler
equation (16) yields qt = q ∗ for all t ≥ 0. But, by condition (24), this allocation violates the
collateral constraint in period 0. This establishes that in response to a large negative output
shock µt must be positive in at least one period.
   Consider now the equilibrium value of capital, qt , in the period in which µt is strictly
positive. To this end, rewrite the capital Euler equation (16) as

                                      qt+1 = β̃t−1 qt − rq ∗,                               (25)

where β̃t is given by
                                               1 − (1 + r)µt
                                     β̃t ≡ β                 .                              (26)
                                                  1 − κµt
Note that 0 < β̃t ≤ β, that β̃t = β when µt = 0, and that β̃t < β when µt > 0 (recall that we
are assuming that κ < 1 and that r > 0). According to this expression, in determining their
demand for assets (in this case physical capital), households behave as if they became more
impatient in periods in which the collateral constraint binds. Figure 1 displays the phase
diagram of the price of capital in the space (qt , qt+1). The heavy solid line corresponds to the
case β̃t = β, and the broken line to the case β̃t < β. When β̃t = β, the stationary state of qt
is given by q ∗. It is clear from the phase diagram that, regardless of the value of β̃t, a value
of qt larger than q ∗ would trigger an explosive path. In principle, a growing path of qt could
be consistent with equilibrium if it does not violate the no-bubble constraint (19). It turns
out, however, that this constraint is violated for any initial condition q0 > q ∗. To see this,
note that since 1/β̃t ≥ 1 + r, it suffices to show that any path of qt with initial condition
q0 > q ∗ violates the no-bubble constraint for β̃t = β. Now evaluate (25) at β̃t = β, divide
both sides by (1 + r)t+1 , and sum for T − 1 periods to get

                             T −1                        T −1
                             X                      rq ∗ X      1
                                 (q̃t+1 − q̃t) = −                    ,
                             t=0
                                                   1 + r t=0 (1 + r)t

where q̃t ≡ qt /(1 + r)t is the present discounted value of the price of capital. This object
must converge to zero in order for the no-bubble constraint to be satisfied. We can write the
above expression as
                                                   T −1
                                              rq ∗ X      1
                                q̃T − q0 = −                    .
                                             1 + r t=0 (1 + r)t

Letting T → ∞ in the above expression, we obtain

                                            qT
                                    lim           = q0 − q ∗ .
                                    T →∞ (1 + r)T

It follows that the no-bubble constraint is violated for any initial condition q0 > q ∗. As we
will see shortly, however, q0 < q ∗ does not necessarily lead to a violation of the no-bubble
constraint or of the nonnegativity constraint on qt, because in that case, changes in β̃t can
prevent qt from imploding.
   So far, we have established that in equilibrium qt ≤ q ∗, for all t ≥ 0 and that a large
negative output shock in period 0 causes the collateral constraint to bind in at least one
period. It remains to show that when the collateral constraint binds, qt and dt+1 fall.
    Let T ≥ 0 denote the first period in which µt is strictly positive. This means that
β̃T−1> β −1 > 1. It then follows from equation (25), that if qT were to equal q ∗, then qT +1
would be strictly greater than q ∗, which, by the arguments given above, would be inconsistent
with equilibrium. It follows that qT must be strictly less than q ∗. From periods 0 to T − 1,
β̃t = β. Therefore, in period T − 1, equation (25) becomes

                                             1        r ∗
                                  qT −1 =       qT +     q ,
                                            1+r      1+r

which says that qT −1 is a weighted average of qT and q ∗ . Since qT < q ∗ , it follows that
qT −1 < q ∗. By induction we have that

                                             q0 < q ∗ .

This establishes an important prediction of the present model, namely, that a large contrac-
tion in output is necessarily accompanied by a Fisherian deflation.
    Furthermore, both debt and consumption fall in period 0 relative to the values they would
have taken in the absence of the collateral constraint. To see this, note that the debt Euler
equation (15) and the fact that µt ≥ 0 for all t, imply that in any equilibrium consumption is
nondecreasing from period 0 on. The debt Euler equation and the fact that µT > 0, also imply
that consumption must increase in period T +1, that is, cT +1 > cT . Since µt = 0 for all t < T ,
we have, again by the debt Euler equation, that consumption is constant over this period,
ct = cT for t ≤ T . Now, by the intertemporal resource constraint (13), the present discounted
value of consumption must be the same in the economy with the collateral constraint and in
the economy without that constraint. So we have two paths of consumption with the same
present discounted value, one of which is flat (the one associated with the economy without
the collateral constraint) and the other is nondecreasing and strictly increasing in at least
one period (the one associated with the economy with the collateral constraint). It must
therefore be the case that the initial value of the latter consumption path is strictly lower
than the initial value of the former path. That is, c0 must be strictly smaller than cnc
                                                                                      0 . The
sequential budget constraint (14) evaluated at t = 0 then directly implies that d1 must be

                                                12
strictly less than dnc
                    1 . This establishes that a large negative output shock in period 0 causes
deleveraging in that period. It also follows that the economy with a collateral constraint
experiences smaller deteriorations of the trade balance and current account relative to the
economy without the collateral constraint, ca0 > canc            nc
                                                   0 and tb0 > tb0 .
    In summary, we have shown that the presence of a collateral constraint causes a Fisherian
deflation, debt deleveraging, and an amplification of the contraction in aggregate demand
in response to a large negative output shock. The intuition behind this central result is as
follows. In response to a temporary negative output shock, households would like to borrow
in order to smooth consumption. If the shock is large enough, the desired level of debt
will exceed the borrowing limit κq ∗ k. From an individual point of view, the household has
an incentive to sell capital, because, one unit of capital sells for q ∗ units of consumption
goods. However, the household cannot increase consumption by quite this amount, because
reducing capital by one unit tightens the collateral constraint by κq ∗ units, so the household
must use this amount to reduce debt, leaving (1 − κ)q ∗ units for additional consumption.
Now, every household wants to sell capital. This situation is known as a fire sale. But this
is impossible in equilibrium because the stock of capital is fixed. For the capital market to
clear, the price of capital, qt, must fall, that is, a Fisherian debt deflation must occur. If the
collateral constraint was binding or close to binding before the shock (i.e., d0 close to κq ∗k),
then the fall in q0 would force households to reduce their net debt positions, d1 < d0 , that is
to say, it would force households to deleverage. This is exactly the opposite of what happens
in the absence of a collateral constraint. In that case, a large negative output shock induces
an increase in household indebtedness.
    Once the output shock is over (period 1), the economy can reach an equilibrium in which
qt returns to its steady-state value q ∗ and debt is forever equal to d1 . To see that this is
the case, notice that in such an equilibrium the collateral constraint would not bind after
period 0, because dt = d1 = κq0k < κq ∗k, for all t ≥ 1. This means that µt = 0, for
t ≥ 1, which by the Euler equation (15) implies that consumption is also constant. Notice
that the country emerges from the financial crisis stronger than it entered, because, after
period 0, consumption is permanently higher, debt is permanently lower, and the collateral
constraint may be more relaxed. However, this strength comes at a cost, because the fall in
consumption in period 0 reduces lifetime welfare.


6     Self-Fulfilling Financial Crises
Thus far, we have focused attention on the aggregate effects of fundamental shocks. In
this section, we study the vulnerability of open economies with collateral constraints to

                                               13
nonfundamental (or sunspot) shocks. A key result of this section is the demonstration that
generally weak economic fundamentals give rise to multiple equilibria. We then characterize
the dynamics triggered by self-fulfilling financial crises.
   To isolate the role of nonfundamental shocks, we eliminate fundamental sources of aggre-
gate fluctuations by assuming that productivity is constant over time. Thus, we set yt = y
for all t ≥ 0, where y > 0 is a constant. Suppose also that

                                           d0 < κq ∗ k,

where q ∗ is the steady-state price of capital given in equation (20). This restriction guarantees
that the initial level of debt does not violate the collateral constraint when q0 = q ∗. Then, the
analysis presented in section 3 implies that there exists an equilibrium in which the economy
is at a steady state starting in period 0. In this equilibrium, ct = c∗ ≡ y−d0 r/(1+r) > 0, dt =
d0 , qt = q ∗, and µt = 0 for all t ≥ 0. Along this equilibrium path, the collateral constraint
never binds. We therefore refer to this equilibrium as the unconstrained equilibrium. We wish
to show that in general there exists a second equilibrium in which the collateral constraint
binds in period 0. In this second equilibrium, the economy suffers a Fisherian deflation and
debt deleveraging in the initial period. In addition, the real allocation is welfare inferior to
the one associated with the unconstrained equilibrium. We refer to this second equilibrium
as the constrained equilibrium.
   In the constrained equilibrium we consider here, the economy reaches a steady state in
period 1. To see that a steady state equilibrium starting in period 1 exists, recall from
section 3, that the only requirement for the existence of a steady-state equilibrium starting
in period 1 is that the collateral constraint be satisfied. This is indeed the case because
dt+1 = d1 = κq0k ≤ κq ∗ k = κqt k for all t ≥ 1. The first equality follows from the assumption
that the economy is in a steady state starting in period 1, the second follows from our
assumption that the collateral constraint is binding in period 0, the weak inequality follows
from the upper bound qt ≤ q ∗ derived earlier, and the last equality from the fact that in a
steady-state equilibrium qt = q ∗ for all t.
    Taking into account that the economy reaches a steady state in period 1, the complete
set of equilibrium conditions, equations (13) to (19), collapses to the following system of five
equations in the five unknowns, c0 > 0, c1 > 0, d1 , q0 ≥ 0, and µ0 ≥ 0,

Now solve (27)-(30) for q0 as a function of d1 to obtain

Figure 2 displays with a thick solid line the graph of κq0k as a function of d1 implied by this
equation. The locus CC is the collection of pairs (d1 , κq0k) that guarantee that equilibrium
conditions (27)-(30) are satisfied. Recalling that 1 + r > 1 > κ, it can readily be shown
that CC is upward sloping. Also, CC crosses the point (d0 , κq ∗k), which is labeled A in the
figure. Note that point A lies above the 45◦ line, reflecting the assumption that d0 ≤ κq ∗k.
We have already shown that d1 = d0 represents a steady state equilibrium. To see that there
may exist a second equilibrium, begin by noting that all points of CC that lie on or above
the 45◦ line satisfy the collateral constraint (32). Consider now the value of d1 at which the
locus CC crosses the horizontal axes. This value of d1 is denoted d in the figure. Suppose
that, as shown in the figure, d is positive. (We will discuss shortly conditions for this to be
the case.) Then, CC must necessarily cross the 45◦ line at some level of debt in the open
interval (d, d0 ). This value of d1 is denoted dc and the intersection point is marked with
the letter B in the figure. Because B is on CC and on the 45◦ line, it satisfies equilibrium
conditions (27) to (30) and the collateral constraint (32). Moreover, at B the collateral
constraint holds with equality, which means that the slackness condition (31) is satisfied. To
establish that point B represents an equilibrium, it remains to show that d1 = dc implies
c0 > 0, c1 > 0 and µ0 ≥ 0. To this end, note that the numerator of the expression within
brackets in equation (33) is (1 + r)c0 . At d1 = d, the numerator is nil, so (1 + r)c0 = 0.
At d1 = d0 , (1 + r)c0 = (1 + r)c∗ . Since by (27) and (28), c0 is increasing in d1 , it follows
that at d1 = dc , (1 + r)c0 must be strictly positive and less than (1 + r)c∗ . It follows that
d1 = dc implies 0 < c0 < c∗ . Also, the fact that dc < d0 implies, by the sequential resource
constraint (28), that c1 > c∗. So we have that d1 = dc implies 0 < c0 < c∗ < c1 . The debt
Euler equation (29) then implies that µ0 is positive.
   This establishes the existence of a second equilibrium in which q0 < q ∗ and d1 < d0 , that
is, an equilibrium with a Fisherian deflation and debt deleveraging that coexists with the

unconstrained equilibrium. We have shown that a sufficient condition for the constrained
equilibrium to coexist with the unconstrained equilibrium is that d be positive. Since d =
(1 + r)(d0 − y), this condition is satisfied provided that d0 /y > 1. This is not an unrealistic
requirement. Suppose that the time unit is one quarter. Then the sufficient condition for the
existence of a self-fulfilling financial crisis is satisfied as long as net foreign debt is greater than
25 percent of annual output. This result shows that, in the present model, higher external
debt makes economies more vulnerable to financial crises driven by nonfundamental revisions
in expectations. More generally, in this economy, bad fundamentals make the economy more
prone to nonfundamental crises. Finally, the fact that the path of consumption in the self-
fulfilling crisis is not flat implies that it is welfare inferior to the flat path associated with
the unconstrained equilibrium. Thus, a benevolent social planner would always prefer the
unconstrained equilibrium to the constrained one. In this sense, we can say that in the
constrained equilibrium the economy underborrows.


7     Conclusion
In this paper, we have established that collateral constraints have consequences for the
transmission of fundamental shocks and also open the door for nonfundamental sources of
uncertainty to have real aggregate effects.
   In particular, we have shown analytically that in response to regular-sized shocks the
economy adjusts as if it was not constrained by collateral requirements. By contrast, in
response to large negative shocks a binding collateral constraint unleashes a financial cri-
sis that amplifies the real effects. These results complement similar findings obtained via
simulation in the context of calibrated quantitative models.
    Furthermore, we have shown that collateral constraints contribute to aggregate instabil-
ity by rendering the competitive equilibrium indeterminate. An unconstrained equilibrium
typically coexists with one in which the collateral constraint is binding. The latter equi-
librium features a self-fulfilling financial crisis driven by pessimistic views about the value
of collateral. The dynamics triggered by this type of financial crisis resemble sudden stops
as the economy experiences deleveraging, a reversal of the current account, and depressed
levels of aggregate demand.
    Finally, we have derived precise conditions for the existence of multiple equilibria. We
have demonstrated that the possibility of self-fulfilling financial crisis depends on the state
of economic fundamentals. In particular, we show that they are more likely the larger is
external debt and the more depressed is aggregate output. Interestingly, the possibility of a
self-fulfilling crisis depends on the frequency at which the collateral constraint is imposed.

For example, if lenders check the adequacy of collateral at a quarterly frequency, then mul-
tiple equilibria exist for debt to annual output ratios greater than 25 percent. However, if
lenders impose the collateral constraint at an annual frequency, then a sufficient condition
for multiplicity is that the debt to annual output ratio be greater than 100 percent. Thus,
self-fulfilling crises appear more likely the higher the frequency at which the verification of
leverage ratios is performed. One caveat of this conclusion is that in the present frame-
work we cannot disentangle the frequency at which consumption and borrowing decisions
are made from the frequency at which lenders check the satisfaction of leverage ratios. It
would therefore be of interest to extend the present study to allow for these two frequencies
to be different.

Appendix
This appendix proves that if a set of sequences {ct , dt+1 , kt+1 } does not satisfy (9), then there
exists a welfare-dominating set of feasible sequences, that is, sequences satisfying (1)-(3) that
generate higher utility.
      Let
                                              κqtkt+1 − dt+1
                                       Zt ≡                  .
                                                 (1 + r)t
Assume that (9) does not hold. In particular, assume that

                                         lim Zt = Z > 0.
                                         t→∞


Then for every  > 0, there exists a T such that

                                         − < Zt − Z < 

for all t ≥ T .
      Pick  > 0 such that 0 <  < Z. Then we have that

                                       κqt kt+1 − dt+1
                                Zt =                   >Z−>0
                                           (1 + r)t

for all t ≥ T . It follows that the collateral constraint holds with a strict inequality for all
t ≥ T , that is, µt = 0 for all t ≥ T .
      Now consider the following alternative consumption and debt paths whereby we increase
consumption in period T leaving it unchanged in all other periods. We finance this increase
in consumption in period T by issuing debt and then rolling over this additional debt forever.
And we leave the path for kt+1 unchanged. We want to know if this alternative path for
dt+1 is feasible, that is, satisfies (1)-(3). Let the change in dT +1 be equal to z > 0, that is,
d˜T +1 = dT +1 + z. Then consumption increases in period T by z/(1 + r) > 0. This strategy
           

is feasible in period T , that is, it does not violate the collateral constraint (3), as long as,

                                       z < (1 + r)T (Z − ).

We need to show that this new path of debt also does not violate the collateral constraint
for any t > T . The new level of debt in any period t > T , denoted d˜t+1 , can be found by
subtracting the sequential budget constraint, equation (1), for any period T + j under the
original plan and the alternative plan. Note that for t > T , ct and kt are the same under



                                                 19
the original and alternative plans. This yields:

                                 d˜t+1 − dt+1 = (1 + r)(d˜t − dt )

or
                         d̃T +j+1 − dT +j+1 = (1 + r)j (d̃T +1 − dT +1 ).

Now recall from above that for any t ≥ T

                        κqt kt+1 − dt+1 > (1 + r)t (Z − )
       κqtkt+1 − d˜t+1 + (d̃t+1 − dt+1 ) > (1 + r)t (Z − )
                        κqt kt+1 − d̃t+1 > (1 + r)t (Z − ) − (d˜t+1 − dt+1 )
                                          = (1 + r)t [Z −  − (1 + r)−T (d̃T+1 − dT +1 )]
                                          > 0.

The last inequality follows from the assumption that (1+r)−T (d˜T +1 −dT +1 ) = (1+r)−T z <
Z − . It follows that (1)-(3) are satisfied under the alternative sequence d̃t+1 and it is hence
feasible. Clearly it is associated with higher welfare because consumption in period T is
higher. Therefore, the original sequence could not have been a solution to the household’s
maximization problem.
