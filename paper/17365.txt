The WTO Government Procurement Agreement and Its Impacts on Trade

                                           ABSTRACT

This paper assesses the impacts of the WTO Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) on trade
in both goods and services among members using a gravity model applied to a panel dataset covering
20 OECD countries over the period 1996-2008 for trade in goods and 1999-2008 for trade in services.
The agreement dates from 1996 and covers 41 (mainly OECD) countries (/areas). China is now negotiating
possible membership. Little has been written on the GPA which is a plurilateral agreement covering
both goods and services. It mutually extends commitments only to signatories, but has commitments
going beyond those in the earlier GATT procurement code. Government service markets are large,
and trade in these also has spillover effects on trade in services and goods.

Results suggest that GPA membership has a positive impact on trade in both goods and services between
parties as well as on outward foreign affiliate service sales. The number of GPA parties has a small
marginal negative effect on trade in goods. Service exports also increase slightly with more parties
participating in the GPA. The growth of government procurement contracts above the threshold under
the GPA also fosters service imports, exports and outward foreign affiliate sales.

                 The WTO Government Procurement Agreement
                                 and Its impacts on Trade
                                       1. INTRODUCTION

  Governments at central and sub-central levels as well as other public entities play an important

role in world trade. But it was not until the Tokyo Round that efforts began to bring government

procurement under international trade rules. The belief was that discriminatory government

procurement practices were a significant non-tariff barrier and retarded the growth of world trade.

Under the GATT Government Procurement Agreement signed in 1979 (GATT GPA 1979),

government procurement entities were obliged to follow core multilateral trade rules, i.e.

non-discrimination and transparency rules. But since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round in

1994, ongoing negotiated procurement liberalization has been focused on the WTO Government

Procurement Agreement (WTO GPA 1994). It is not a condition of WTO membership that

countries join the GPA, since the GPA superseded the 1994 single undertaking when the WTO

evolved from the GATT. The agreement is a plurilateral agreement only involving signatories and

embodies deeper commitments than the GATT GPA 1979 both in terms of itemized coverage and

thresholds for competitive bidding. It began in 1996 as an arrangement to which 21 countries

initially committed themselves, including US, Japan and the EU; Other countries have

subsequentially joined, and currently around 41 countries are parties to the agreement. As with

other trade agreements, with non-discriminatory and transparency among parties as key rules,

parties are entitled to impartial (thus enhanced) access rights to foreign member markets, but

simultaneously agree to grant those rights to other member countries.




                                                 3
  Despite its potential significance for world trade, there are few papers which empirically

evaluate its impacts on trade flows, and especially on trade in services. We evaluate its impacts in

ways which take advantage of the sequential addition of countries to GPA membership. We first

outline the evolution of the GPA and also highlight the gap between its nominal and real coverage.

We use data on notifications to the WTO GPA committee of procurement contract awards under

the GPA over time to assess the government procurement market size for the main GPA parties.

We then use a gravity model to estimate the GPA’s impacts on trade flows using the panel data for

20 OECD countries from 1996 to 2008.

  Our results show that the WTO GPA has had a positive influence on inter-OECD trade in goods

and services as well as on outward foreign affiliate service sales. Simple data analysis of contracts

awarded under the GPA overestimates the extent of trade and impacts of the GPA since not all

GPA covered international transactions would not have occurred without the GPA. Hence our use

of a gravity model.   Additional, restrictions in GPA articles and regulations also imply that

enhanced market access by foreign suppliers will not be automatically achieved through

membership of the GPA.

             2. The Origins of the WTO Government Procurement Agreement

  2.1 The GPA from 1979 to 2010

  Buy national policies in government purchasing (government procurement) were omitted from

the original GATT in Article III “National Treatment on Internal Taxation and Regulation” and

Article XVII “State Trading Enterprises” in 1947. The first GATT Agreement on Government

Procurement (GATT GPA) was signed only in 1979 and entered into force in 1981. It contained

obligations of non-discrimination (national treatment and most-favored-nation treatment (MFN))

and transparency rules for procurement of goods by central government entities of its signatories,

and a purchasing contract threshold set at SDR 150,000.

  In 1987, the GATT GPA 1979 was amended by adding a limited number of services (such as

construction services), reducing the threshold for contracts involving goods for central

government entities to SDR 130,000 and setting the threshold for construction contracts at a

higher level of SDR 5,000,000. The amended GATT GPA entered into force in 1988.

  But during the Uruguay Round, parties to the Agreement also held negotiations trying to extend

the scope and coverage of the Agreement to sub-central government and quasi-governmental

bodies, and also to services and construction services as well as incorporating a bid-challenge

system. As a result, a new GPA (WTO GPA) was signed at the end of the Uruguay Round in 1994,

and entered into force on 1 January 1996. A new revised text was agreed in December2006 and

updated in December 2010.

  Table 1 summarizes the evolution of these Agreements. This history embodies two major

milestones. One was the introduction of GATT GPA in 1979 which brought government

procurement under GATT. The other was the WTO GPA of 1994 which broadened the coverage of


                                                 5
the GPA under WTO.

    2.2 GPA Parties and Observers

    As a plurilateral agreement, the WTO GPA (hereafter GPA) only regulates government

procurement practices on a voluntary basis of those WTO members who choose to bind in the

GPA. The GPA itself has no enforcement mechanism for commitments going beyond WTO

obligations.      So far, the membership of GPA is still limited.                Most of the 41 parties1 are

developed countries (areas) and NICs2, while the majority of developing countries have not joined.

There are also 27 observers3 in the GPA Committee who approve accession to the GPA. 9

  Current GPA members (with effect from 1 January 2010) include Canada, European Communities (including its 27 member
States: Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary,
Ireland, Italy, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxemburg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovak Republic, Slovenia, Spain,
Sweden, and United Kingdom), Hong Kong China, Iceland, Israel, Japan, Korea, Liechtenstein, Netherlands with respect to Aruba,
Norway, Singapore, Switzerland, Chinese Taipei, United States.

  Korea, Singapore, Hong Kong and Israel participated in the Uruguay Round as developing countries, however, they are so called
new industrialized countries not typical developing countries.

  Current GPA observers(with effect from 1 July 2010) include 23 countries and 4 international intergovernmental organizations,
among which Albania, Armenia, China, Georgia, Jordan, Kyrgyz Republic, Moldova, Oman, Panama are undergoing acceding
negotiation.
                                                                 6
countries are currently in ongoing negotiation for accession.

   The smaller number of GPA members than of the WTO reflects the reluctance of most

developing countries to join the GPA. Current GPA members have frequently tried to persuade

countries seeking to join the WTO (especially those with a large state sector) to commit to joining

the GPA upon WTO accession, although GPA membership is not a prerequisite for WTO

accession (Wang, 2007).

   Table 2 lists the entry date of GPA parties and observers. EU members make up more than half

of the parties, and the rest are in North America and Asia. All 27 observers are developing

countries in Asia, South America and Africa, except Australia and New Zealand, which are OECD

members in Oceania. Among observers who have started negotiating accession, China is the

prime concern of the current GPA parties; not only because of its high growth rate and large size

of its economy, but also due to the historically dominant role and large size of different level of

governments.

   2.3 The difference between the GPA’s nominal and real coverage

   The impact of GPA membership on its members’ trade is qualified in various ways since the

effective coverage of commitment to the GPA is ambiguous due to a four step procedure of

accession negotiations covering membership, entity coverage, product coverage and threshold.

Countries have to first choose whether to join the GPA when they become WTO members. After

the accession procedure to the GPA starts, observers can then determine which entities are bound

under their GPA commitments. Under the Annex 1 to3 of Appendix Ⅰ of the GPA, each party

notifies lists of central level government, sub-central government and other public entities covered.

Only those entities in the list undertake GPA commitments. For example, many parties exclude

the department of defense from their central government list.

   Product coverage is also typically selective for GPA members. As a general rule, all goods are

covered by the GPA, while Annexes 4 and 5 to Appendix I specify each Party's covered services



                                                 8
and construction services4. Services deemed sensitive, for instance dredging, transportation, R&D,

and printing services, are often excluded from GPA parties’ Annex 4. Finally, the threshold value

above which the public procurement contract is obliged to follow GPA rules can provide a fourth

element of weakened coverage. For each party of the GPA, there are 9 (3 times 3) thresholds to be

determined for three categories of products (goods, services and construction services) and

entities (central government, sub-central government and other entities); though generally there

are ranges set for thresholds.

     Table 3 reports the GPA threshold commitments of the EU, Japan and USA. These thresholds

differ among the three categories, with a much higher threshold for construction services. Due to

different financial regimes across countries, the thresholds for three types of entities vary among

members, while sub-central government and other social entities apply higher thresholds than

central government entities.

   The newly provisionally agreed revised GPA text 2010 differ from preceding version in one way that one new Annex is added to

Appendix Ⅰ, with Annex 1 to 3 for entity list, Annex 4 to 6 for product list, and Annex 7 as General Notes.

  The GPA text (article XV in the GPA 1994, article III and XIII in the GPA 2006 and 2010) also

provides exceptions to its general nondiscriminatory rules and open or selective tendering

procedures which can also potentially provide extra coverage for own country preferential

government procurement activities. Although negotiations on government procurement in the

Tokyo and Uruguay Round achieved substantial expansion of coverage by extending rules to the

procurement of goods and services (including construction services) by national and sub-central

level government as well as public entities, the selection of membership, entity coverage, product

coverage and threshold along with the exception option for nondiscriminatory and transparency

rules once again make the GPA’s real coverage unclear.

                 3. The government procurement market under the GPA

  3.1 The government procurement market for main GPA parties

  3.1.1 Market size

  A critical element in assessing the impact of the GPA on inter-party trade flows is the size of the

GPA covered procurement market. There are two different methods for calculating the size of the

government procurement market for GPA countries, reflecting two different sources of available

data. One uses the SNA (System of National Accounts) to estimate the size of the government

procurement market based on government receipts and payments. This method yields an upper

based in estimate of the possible scale of government procurement since not all government

expenditure other than compensation of employees and defense can be treated as government

procurement. EC(1997,1998), Francois et al.(1996) , Trionfetti (2000) and OECD (2001) use this

method using the 1968 version of the SNA to yield consistent data across countries.

   The other method uses a bottom-up approach based directly on data on procurement

expenditure by national entities responsible for procurement decisions and forming their WTO

notifications. This approach yields a direct estimate of the size of government procurement market

since government procurement values are based on a contract by contract basis. It is however not

ideal because of a lack of consistency across countries subject in notification requirements. The

data source for this bottom-up method is annual data submit by the GPA parties to the WTO on

their procurement covered by the GPA; and periodic surveys of the Tenders Electronic Daily

(TED) and notices published in the Official Journal of European Union (OJEU) with respect to

the requirement of the EU members (through EU Directives) to publish procurement tender and

contract award notices


                                                 11
   Table 4 reports literature estimates of the size of procurement markets using both SNA-based

and bottom-up approaches. The estimates for the ratio of public procurement to GDP lie in a wide

range between 0.42% to 19.96%, illustrating the disparity among studies. Using a bottom-up

approach, our estimates on a aggregate basis are similar to those of EC (2000), while the estimate

on an above threshold basis is significantly higher than that of Hoekman (1997) which only takes

procurement of goods by central governments into consideration. This difference is, to some

extent, a reflection of the evolution of the GPA from the Tokyo Round to the Uruguay Round.

   Figure 1 displays EU government procurement to GDP as a proportion of GDP, as an example

of a large region situation, with added detail among above threshold and aggregate (above and

below threshold). In the figure the ratio of the government procurement to GDP is roughly

constant over time, and government procurement above threshold is only one-tenth to one-fifth of

aggregate procurement, suggesting space and opportunity for the GPA to play a role in the future.

There is a trend of growth in the absolute value of government procurement on either basis of

above threshold or aggregate.

  US notifications to the WTO on government procurement under the GPA are not as detailed as

those for the EU, and data on government procurement below threshold are available only at

federal government level. Table 5 reports estimates of the size of government procurement

markets in the US and the ratio to GDP. The proportion of the US federal government

procurement above threshold is high, amounting to more than 90% of total procurement for

Annex 1 commitments. Also, the absolute value of government procurement in the US increases

nearly three times from 1996 to 2008, while the ratio to GDP ranges from 5-9%.

    3.2 The composition of government procurement markets under the GPA for the main GPA

parties

    3.2.1 By entity

    The central, sub-central government and other entities are the three categories covered by the

GPA, and their relative importance in the government procurement market varies between

different countries. However, with thresholds set for most parties of the GPA, the threshold for

Annex 3 (other entities) is generally higher than that for Annex 1, and also sometimes Annex 2.

The entity composition for EU and US government procurement markets reflect threshold levels

for different entities (See Figure 2 and Figure 3). In the EU government procurement market

under the GPA5, other entities with the highest threshold are the smallest portion. These relative

share account for about 10-15%, while the sub-central government is the largest with a 50% share.

The share for the central government is nearly 30-35%.

  3.2.2 By product

  Products covered by the GPA are divided into two categories, goods and services. When we

analyze the product composition of the government procurement market under the GPA, we

include construction services in the services category. Within the two major categories, services

occupy the dominate position, with 60-65% of government procurement above threshold. This is

the case for the EU, US and Japan. According to the WTO Universal List of Services in WTO

document code of MTN.GNS/W/120, construction services belong to the services category. In the

GPA, the threshold for construction service is individually listed. This is because construction

services purchased by governments and other entities (especially state-owned enterprises) are

often connected to other infrastructure construction with large contracts.

  3.2.3 By origin of suppliers

                                                      16
     Under GPA Article Ⅲ, the principles of non-discrimination apply to both foreign affiliates and

ownership (Article Ⅲ:2(a)) and country of origin (Article Ⅲ:2(b))6. This means that foreign

suppliers can compete against domestic suppliers and meet procurement bids either through

cross-border supply or foreign affiliation sales. Based on the notifications of GPA parties,

government procurement markets seem far from being internationally integrated. Figure 4 shows

the relative shares of Japan’s government procurement above threshold for goods and services by

domestic suppliers and foreign suppliers. Even compared with the low share of procurement for

goods by non-Japan suppliers, the situation of market access is even lower in the service sector,

which suggests a strong home bias in government procurement markets.

                 4. Assess the impact of the GPA using a gravity model

  The gravity model has been widely applied in empirical trade analysis, following Tinbergen

(1962) and Pöyhönen(1963). More recent developments (e.g. Anderson,1979; Helpman and

Krugman, 1985; Deardorff ,1995; Feenstra et al., 2001; Eaton and Kortum, 2002; Anderson and

Wincoop, 2003) also support the use of gravity models from a trade theoretic view point. Gravity

models have previously been used to analyze the impact of barriers to services trade by comparing

predicted and actual levels of services trade flows (see Francois,2001; Park, 2002; Grunfeld and

Moxnes, 2003;etc ) and to compare differences in determinants of trade in services and goods (see

Kimura and Lee, 2006; Lennon, 2006). Here we use a standard gravity model augmented with

GPA variables to assess the GPA’s impact on bilateral trade flows in both goods and services

among GPA parties.

  Academic research on the impact of government procurement on international trade flows

started in the 1970s. Baldwin (1970) argued that discriminatory procurement policy may have

inconsequential impacts on trade flows under assumptions of perfect substitution between

domestic and foreign products, a relative small size of government procurement and unique

market price for private and public demand. His proposition was further examined by Mattoo

(1996). McAfee & McMillan (1989), Trionfetti (2000), Evenett & Hoekman (2004, 2005) analyze

the welfare effect of different discriminatory form of government procurement practices.

Empirical studies including Baldwin and Richardson (1972) and Trionfetti (2001) show that the

discriminatory government procurement exists and has a negative impact on import.

  4.1 Empirical specifications and data

  A standard gravity model takes the following form:


                                                18
                                                                                         (1)

  where T      bilateral trade flows (exports or /and imports) between country i and country j,

GDP =economic mass of country i, GDP = economic mass of country j, DISTij = geographical

distance between the capitals of country i and country j, E =error term.

  In order to capture the impacts of the GPA on bilateral trade in goods and services, we

introduce three additional variables on the right side. One is a dummy variable GPA, which takes

the value 1 if the two countries i and j are both members of the GPA. A positive effect on bilateral

trade is expected from the dummy variable GPA. The second is NGPA, an interactive variable

obtained by multiplying the dummy variable GPA by the total number of GPA parties in year t

( represented as “gpan” ). We use this interactive variable to capture the effect of the number of

GPA partiess on bilateral trade in goods and services. The expected effect of the NGPA on

bilateral trade is negative since bilateral trade may be switched to new or other members of the

GPA. The third variable is CLNGVI (CLNGVJ), also an interactive variable, obtained by

multiplying the dummy variable GPA by the log of an index of government procurement values

above threshold (with the government procurement value under GPA in year 2000 equaling 1 in

the base period) for country i or country j (represented as “gvii” or “gvij”). The government

procurement value above threshold under the GPA by different members is provided in different

local currency units, hence, we use this indexing method to control for this influence. This

interactive variable captures variation in government procurement values on bilateral trade in

goods and services.

  A final dummy variables RTA is included to reflect the impact of trading bloc membership. As a

plurilateral agreement only applicable to signatories, the GPA is similar to a RTA. We use dummy


                                                 19
variable RTA to control for the influence of other trade-related arrangements. RTA takes the value

1 if the two countries i and j signed a free trade agreement with each other.

  In existing gravity model literature, there is no consensus on whether the dependent variable

should be exports, imports or total trade flows (i.e. the sum of export and import). We use both

exports and imports as dependent variables, since home biased government purchasing will

reduce imports while GPA membership will potentially yield enhanced access rights to foreign

member markets. Since members simultaneously agree to grant rights to other member countries

both exports and imports should increase.

  Our estimation equations are



                                                                                                (2)


                                                                                             (3)

  where NGPA =GPA*gpan and gpan =the number of GPA parties in year t; CLNGVI =

 GPA*Lngvii and Lngvii = log of index of government procurement value above threshold in

 country i (with the year 2000 as the base period); CLNGVJ=GPA*Lngvij and Lngvij= log of

 index of government procurement value above threshold in country j (with the year 2000 as the

 base period).

  Equations (2) and (3) are similar to each other, except that when the dependent variable is

imports of country i from country j, only procurement values above threshold for country i matter,

while procurement values above threshold of country j affect the opposite trade flow, i.e. export of

country i to country j.

  4. 2.3 Data and methodology


                                                 20
        The data we use is from OECD statistics on international trade in services, and is available

for both service exports and imports, broken down by partner country, and for 20 OECD member

countries from the years 1999 to 2008. Data are on a balance-of-payments basis, and mainly

reflect GATS supply mode 1 (cross-border supply) and mode 2 (consumption abroad) of trade in

services. Supply mode 3(commercial presence) of trade in services is of special importance in

competing for government procurement contract for foreign suppliers.

    Service imports and exports via foreign affiliates are likely the most affected when countries

enter the GPA. Data on bilateral trade in service for foreign affiliate trade in services among

OECD members is not directly available. We use inward and outward foreign affiliate turnover

data with industry sector division specified within services on the UN international standard

industrial classification basis code (ISIC Rev.3) as proxies of service exports and imports via

mode 3. To check the robustness of results, we compare results when service exports and imports

are on a BOP basis (SE/SI) and service exports and imports are on a FATS basis (FAE/FAI) as

dependent variables. For trade in goods, we also compare the impact of the GPA on exports (GE)

and imports (GI).

     Our data covers 20 OECD members7. For trade in goods, the period starts from 1996 and ends

in 2008, since the GPA came into effect under the WTO in 1996. For trade in services, the period

is 1999 to 2008, since the earliest available data on bilateral services trade released by the OECD

starts from 1999.

    Bilateral exports and imports data on trade in goods are obtained from the UN COMTRADE

database. Bilateral exports and imports data on trade in services (BOP and Foreign Affiliate Sales)

kilometers between capitals are from COW database Version 2.0. RTA data are from RTA database

of WTO. GPA, NGPAN, CLNGVI/CLNGVJ data are calculated by the authors based on WTO

notifications.

  We first use an ordinary least squares regression with pooled data, and then use fixed country

and time effect regressions using panel data following the arguments of Egger(2000) and

Feenstra(2003) that the proper specification of the gravity model in most applications would be

one of fixed country and time effects, which reflect both the time-invariant export- and

import-country effects and the common business cycle or globalization process over the sample

period. The Hausman test also supports using fixed effect rather than random effects models.

  4.3 Results

  Table 7 presents the summary statistics for the variable used in the estimations. Definitions are

provided in the text and S.D., Min., Max. and N denote standard deviation, minimum, maximum

and number of observation, respectively. The mean of NGPA, Lngvii and Lngvij are used to

calculate the net effect of the dummy variable GPA on bilateral trade flow. In a similar way, the

mean of dummy variable GPA is used to calculate the net impact of number of the GPA parties

and government procurement valued bounded to the GPA of each member on bilateral trade flow.

Note: a: applicable to LnDIST for trade in services. The only difference between this explanatory for trade in
         goods and trade in services is the length of time period, which has no effect for the time-invariant
         variable of bilateral distance.
      b:applicable to LnGDPj for trade in services. The summary statistics for LnGDPi and LnGDPj for trade in

     Table 8 reports pooled regression results for these specifications, with six dependent variables

( Log of GI, GE, SI, SE, FAI and FAE) corresponding to columns (1)-(6) respectively. Focusing

on the explanatory variables related to the GPA, the coefficients                           for the dummy variable GPA

are positive and significant at 1 percent level in columns (1) to (4), which indicate a positive

impact for the GPA on bilateral trade in goods and bilateral trade in services via cross-border

supply mode.

     For trade in services via the commercial presence mode, the dummy variable GPA is not

significant for inward foreign affiliates sales. It is dropped in the regression for outward foreign

affiliates sales8. The interactive variable NGPA has a minor negative coefficient                                   as expected

and is significant in most equations.                 The coefficients           for NGPA in column (1) and (2) are

larger than those in column (3) and (4). This suggests that GPA bilateral trade in goods may be

switched more easily between suppliers than bilateral trade in services. The intangibility of

services makes the switching costs higher for buyers and bilateral trade in services tends to repeat

between current partners.

    The possible reason lies in the correlation between the dummy variable GPA and the other two interactive variables.
                                                                23
  The interactive variable CLNGVI/CLNGVJ has a positive and significant coefficient                  in

column (3) to (6), but we find no significant coefficient for this explanatory variable for trade in

goods. Meanwhile within the two different supply modes for trade in services, exports and

imports via foreign affiliate sales are more affected than trade flows involving cross-border supply.

We attribute the difference in the impact of this explanatory variable on trade in goods and in

services, as well as the different effects between the two supply modes of trade in services to the

high share of services in product composition and high preference for local presence of suppliers

by procuring entities in the government procurement market.

  All the traditional gravity control variables, such as the log of GDP of importers and exporters

and the log of distance are of the right sign and statistically significant, except that distance and

RTA are not significant in column (6) for FAE. Generally, the magnitudes of the coefficients are

also in line with previous literature. Distance has more negative effects on trade in goods than on

trade in services regardless of the different supply modes of services, while RTAs are more

important for trade in services than trade in goods. This indicates the relative importance of

transportation cost for trade in goods and institutional cost for trade in services.

  Table 9 presents results from the regressions for country and time fixed effects models using

panel data, with six dependent variables ( Log of GI, GE, SI, SE, FAI and FAE) corresponding to

columns (1)-(6). The coefficients of log of GDP of exporter and importer also have correct signs

and are statistically significant, consistent with the previous pooled regression results. The log of

geographical distance are dropped in the country and time fixed effect regressions since they are

time-invariant. Based on statistical significance, the dummy variable RTA only shows a positive

impact on service export via cross-border supply and inward foreign affiliate sales.

  Focusing on the three explanatory variables used to reflect the impact of the GPA on bilateral

trade, the coefficient      for dummy variable GPA is positive and significant at 1 percent level in

column (1) to (4), similar to the pooled regression results. These indicate a positive impact of the

GPA on bilateral trade in goods and bilateral trade in services via cross-border supply mode. For

trade in service via commercial presence mode,          is not significant for inward foreign affiliates

sales and is dropped in the regression for outward foreign affiliates sales partly because there are

too many empty cells to use fixed effects defined over the sample unit as the choice set. However,

the higher      in column (3) and (4) suggests that bilateral trade in services is affected more than

for bilateral trade in goods by GPA membership.

   The interactive variable NGPA has a negative coefficient      , and is highly significant in

column (1) and (2), while when the dependent variables involves trade in services, regression

estimates suggest that the GPA has only a small marginal positive effect on service exports via

cross-border supply. We attribute the difference in the sign of the coefficient for NGPA in goods

and services to the characteristics of services. This suggests the adverse switching effect on

bilateral trade in goods can be ignored when assessing GPA impacts on bilateral trade in services.

   The sign and the statistical significance of the coefficient          , for interactive variable

CLNGVI /CLNGVJ in Table 9 are almost the same as in the pooled regression, except that the

magnitude of coefficients in fixed effects regressions becomes smaller. We find no significant

coefficients for this explanatory variable in trade in goods and inward foreign affiliate sales. The

positive coefficients in column (3),(4) and(6) indicate that with government procurement values

above threshold under the GPA, bilateral trade in services and outward foreign affiliate service

sales increase. Due to the high proportion of services possess in the government procurement

market, any increase in government procurement value above threshold will be largely attributed

to services and in turn stimulate bilateral trade in services.

   The net effects of GPA membership, number of the GPA members and the growth rate of

 government procurement values above bound thresholds for the GPA on bilateral trade flow are

 reported in Table 10. Except for service imports via foreign affiliate sales, GPA membership is

 positive factor for bilateral trade between the included OECD countries during the sample period.

 The coefficients on service imports and exports via cross-border supply mode are higher than for

 goods imports and exports. This indicates that GPA membership plays more important role in

 promoting bilateral trade in services than for trade in goods. A possible reason may be that

 service suppliers gain more potential business opportunities in the government procurement

 market with non-discriminatory and transparent policies than manufacturing suppliers since

 services account for the majority of the government procurement market for most GPA parties.

 Results also suggest that exports are influenced more by GPA membership than is the case for


                                                      27
 imports. The value of the coefficient for exports (both trade in goods and services) is almost

 three times of that of imports.

   The number of GPA parties has small marginal negative effects on trade in goods. For service

 exports it has the opposite sign. Service transactions tend to be repeated and based on reciprocal

 trust and satisfaction attained in previous deals. Switching costs for either service consumer or

 service producer are typically higher than for tangible goods consumer and producer. With more

 members participating in the GPA, bilateral trade in goods between pairs of countries may thus

 decrease slightly due to switching effects, while existing service trade partners tend to intensify.

 The log of index of government procurement values for importers or exporters is a positive

 determinant of bilateral trade in service, but has no effect on bilateral trade in goods, resulting

 from the high service share in the growth of government procurement value above threshold

 under the GPA.

    From our results we suggest following policy implications. First, trade in services is likely to
                                                  28
be fostered by joining the GPA. Country with competitiveness in services will gain from being

the GPA party and enlargement of service trade, and may have strong incentive to increase the

number of GPA parties and the degree of openness in government procurement market. Second,

the high level threshold for the GPA makes foreign affiliate sales the most important supply

mode in government service procurement market. Procuring entities will prefer suppliers with

local commercial presence to lower supervision costs when open bidding for large procurement

contract occurs. This preference for foreign affiliate sales will also deter developing countries

from entering the GPA since their suppliers are not bidding with large amounts compared to

rivals from developed countries.

 Some caveats apply to these results . First the share of government procurement above

threshold from foreign suppliers for each GPA party is not included in the explanatory variables

due to the unavailability of data in WTO notifications. We use the dummy variable GPA, the

interactive variables NGPA and CLNGVI/CLNGVJ to measure the possible impacts the GPA

may have on bilateral trade. These proxies need not reflect the real changes in market access in

government procurement market. Second, the effective enforcement of non-discriminatory and

transparency rules under the GPA is a precondition for the enhanced market access and degree of

competition in government procurement market, which generates a two-way interaction between

the GPA and bilateral trade in goods and services. On one hand, only when the enhanced market

access is achieved will the GPA promote bilateral trade between the GPA parities. On the other

hand, market access for the government procurement market is determined by both bilateral and

multilateral trade arrangements concerning goods, services and investment.

                                      5. Concluding remarks

 In this paper we both discuss the operation of the GPA and the size of markets it covers, and

also assess the potential impacts of the GPA on trade among contracting parties using a gravity

model. We extend the simple gravity model by adding three explanatory variables relevant to the

GPA. These are the GPA membership, the number of the GPA parties and the government

procurement value above threshold under the GPA. Our panel data covers 20 OECD countries

among which 17 are GPA members and 3 are non-members. The sample period is 1996-2008 for

bilateral trade in goods, and 1999-2008 for bilateral trade in services.

 Our results suggest that for most parties the GPA has a positive impact on bilateral trade in

goods and services, though the magnitude of the impact may varies between trade in goods and

services ( with different supply modes) . An implication would seem to be that improvements for

the GPA should focus on the market access rights for foreign suppliers and should consider the

characteristics of services from goods in order to promote international trade. The WTO could

also require GPA members to fulfill their obligation in submiting detailed data on government

procurement above threshold by origins so as to provide a clear cognition of the openness of the

government procurement market under the GPA.
