Smoking is an expensive habit. Smoking households spend, on average, more than $1000 annually

on cigarettes. For households in which some members smoke, smoking expenditures crowd-out other

purchases, which may affect other household members, as well as the smoker. We empirically
analyze how expenditures on tobacco crowd out consumption of other goods, estimating the patterns

of substitution between tobacco products and other expenditures. We use the Consumer Expenditure

Survey (1995 to 2001), which we complement with regional price data, and state cigarette prices.

We estimate a consumer demand system of expenditures on cigarettes, food, alcohol, housing,

apparel, transportation, medical care and controls for socio-economic variables and other sources

of observable heterogeneity. Descriptive data indicate that, compared to non-smokers, smokers spend

less on housing. Results from the demand system indicate that as the price of cigarettes rises,

households increase the quantity of food purchased, and, in some samples, reduce the quantity of

apparel and housing purchased

Introduction

       Smoking is an expensive habit. When a family member quits, in addition to the former

smokers’ improved long term health, families benefit because savings from reduced cigarette

expenditures can be allocated to other goods (CBO, 1990). For households in which some

members continue to smoke, indirect effects of smoking include the crowd-out of other

purchases, which may affect other household members, as well as the smoker. Information on

the adverse health effects of smoking, regulations that increase the cost of smoking (e.g. smoking

bans), and rising cigarette taxes have all reduced the percentage of smokers in the US. As more

individuals quit smoking or never begin, the benefits in terms of increased consumption of other

goods may be substantial, particularly for low income families. In this paper, we explore this

often ignored benefit of quitting that accrues to both smokers and their family.

       Our concern about forgone consumption relates to the much larger line of literature on

cigarette taxes (Chaloupka and Warner, 2000). Cigarette taxation is considered one of the most

powerful policy instruments in reducing smoking rates. Extensive resources have been allocated

to understanding the direct effect of taxes on reducing tobacco use. Yet, almost no empirical

research has attended to the indirect effects of increased taxes on other purchases.

       A substantial body of previous research has found that as taxes increase, tobacco

consumption declines (Chaloupka and Warner, 2000). Research indicates that this decline comes

about equally from prevalence effects (quits or non-initiation) and consumption effects (Farrelly

and Evans, 1998). For those who quit or cut back significantly, additional other goods and

services may be purchased. These additional goods (e.g., better housing in a lower crime

neighborhood, insurance coverage) may have benefits that accrue in addition to the direct effect

of smoking cessation on the smoker'
                                  s health. For those who continue to smoke at a similar rate,




                                                                                                   3
more may be spent on tobacco than before the tax increase. The latter effect furthers concern

about the regressivity of cigarette taxes (Remler, 2004), although research indicates that lower

income, minority and younger populations are more likely than others to quit smoking in

response to price increases (Farrelly and Bray, 1998). Thus it is important to understand how

higher cigarette prices, and thus higher expenditure on tobacco for some, impact expenditure

patterns. These expenditure changes will be especially critical for those low-income households

whose members continue to smoke.

       We provide a framework to document this indirect cost of smoking by analyzing the

spending patterns of US families. Specifically, we are interested in which goods households

forgo in order to smoke, and thus could potentially gain from quitting. We use the United States

Bureau of Labor Statistics’ (BLS’) Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) from 1995 to 2001, to

document cigarette and other expenditures for US households. These data have been used before

to study the impact of tax credits and tax refunds on spending allocation (Barrow, 1999;

Souleles, 1999). Complementing the CES with regional BLS price data and state cigarette

prices, we estimate a consumer demand system that includes several main expenditure categories

(i.e., cigarettes, food, alcohol, housing, apparel, transportation, medical care) and controls for

socio-economic variables and state fixed effects. Our approach uses the Almost Ideal Demand

System (AIDS; Deaton, 1980a; Deaton and Muellbauer, 1980b) which provides a method to

quantify these effects and has been used in other health applications (Hunt, 1994). Jones (1989)

has previously used aggregate expenditure data to estimate the cross price elasticity of four

categories of alcoholic drinks and tobacco. We estimate own and cross price elasticities for

cigarettes and the other budget categories using individual household data. In some analyses, we

focus on low income households or households in which at least one person smokes. By focusing




                                                                                                     4
on smokers, we can glean some additional information about those who continue to smoke

following increases in price.

        The empirical analyses presented in this paper concern the United States. During the

time period considered here there were significant increases in U.S. cigarette prices, and these

varied in amount and time of implementation across states. This variation is critical to

estimating the effect of changing cigarette prices. Although we focus on the US, expenditures on

tobacco may have greater negative crowd out impact in other countries (Wang, 2004). While

tobacco consumption is falling in the US, it is rising rapidly in low and middle income countries

(WHO, 2004; MacKay and Erickson, 2002) The approach used in this paper can be applied to

other countries in which the impact of smoking on household budgets may be even more critical

due to lower income, higher prevalence rates, and heavier smoking.

        We find that comparing smoking with non-smoking households, cigarette expenditures

appear to crowd-out housing expenditures. Examining cigarette price changes, our estimates of

Marshallian (uncompensated) own and cross price elasticity are consistent with the literature,

although our own tobacco price elasticity estimates are larger than consensus estimates ( = - .74

to - .98). We also find that food and tobacco are substitutes. In all samples, as cigarette prices

increase, food expenditures increase. This is suggestive of the documented association between

smoking cessation and weight gain. Finally, we find that, in some samples, as the price of

cigarettes rises, households reduce the quantity of housing and apparel purchased.



Methods

Data:




                                                                                                     5
       The Consumer Expenditure Survey (CES) is a survey of households collected by the

Bureau of Labor Statistics yearly since 1980 (US DOL, 1999). We consider the years 1995

through 2001. The CES interviews selected households a total of 4 times, at 3-month intervals.

At each of these interviews, the household is asked detailed questions regarding expenditures

during the past 3 months. Each year about 7,000 households are surveyed. Although

respondents are not asked about their smoking status, information on tobacco expenditures is

collected. Because the CES includes state identifiers, state level variables can be merged to

complement these data.

       Variables collected in the CES include detailed information at the household level on

income, expenditures, composition of household, demographics (e.g., gender, age, education and

race), and whether the head of household owns the home. Through both a diary and interview

survey, very detailed information on all expenditures in the household is collected. This includes

detailed information about housing, food, transportation, health care, entertainment, personal

care products, reading, and education.

Analysis:

       Data on tobacco expenditures is collected in two categories: 1) cigarettes and 2) cigars,

pipe tobacco and other tobacco products. Thus, households can be categorized as smoking or

non-smoking based on whether the household reported expenditures on any smoking supplies.

Our preliminary research indicates that according to this algorithm, in the year 2000, 27.6

percent of CES households were classified as smoking households. The CDC’s Behavioral Risk

Factor Surveillance System indicates that, in 2000, 23.2 percent of Americans smoke (CDC,

2000). Given that there are two or more adults in many households, these numbers are

consistent. Our analysis indicates that in 2000, 29.1 percent of poor households smoked. That




                                                                                                   6
more low-income households are classified as smoking is also consistent with other research

(BRFSS, 2000).

         We eliminate all observations for which complete income information is not reported, for

which information on the state is not available and those for which there is more than one

consumer unit in the household. The BLS suppresses state identifiers in some states for

confidentiality purposes. We also only consider households where the household head is between

the ages of 18 and 64. Our final sample has 91,486 observations. Demographic characteristics of

the sample are noted in Table 1.

                                   << Insert Table 1 about here>>



         We calculate average expenditures for each of the eight expenditure categories

considered for all households, and then separately by household smoking status.1 Because we

are interested in the burden of tobacco spending on low income households, we also separately

consider these households.2 To better understand allocation of resources across goods and

because the total expenditures are slightly different within the smoking and non-smoking

samples, we also calculate the budget share. Because total expenditures differ among

households, the sum of all expenditure categories for all households divided by the sum of all

spending for all households does not equal the average of individual households expenditure

share.

  Representative items in expenditure categories include food: food at home, food away from
home; housing: rent, mortgage interest, property taxes, maintenance and repairs, utilities,
household operations, house furnishings; apparel: mens, boys, womens, girls apparel, footwear,
other apparel services; transportation: vehicle purchases (both new and used), gas, motor oil,
vehicle finance charges, insurance, repairs, vehicle rentals; health care: health insurance, medical
supplies, medical services, prescription drugs. For further specific classifications, see US DOL,
2002.

  Low income is defined as less than 200 percent of the US federal poverty line.


                                                                                                   7
       We supplement the CES data with price data. For most expenditure categories, price data

come from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Price indexes are created by BLS by commodity,

category and region. For example, a separate monthly housing price index is created for the

Northeast, Midwest, South and West regions of the United States. Data on cigarette prices are

available at the state level for each year of our analysis. In many states, there have been large

changes in cigarette prices over the time period we consider. The heterogeneity of the dates and

magnitude of these price changes across states is critical to the identification strategy.

       To study the substitution and complementation patterns between smoking items and other

expenditure categories, we estimate household demand using the Almost Ideal Demand System.

The AIDS (Deaton and Muellbauer, 1980) gives an arbitrary first-order approximation to any

demand system that is consistent with the notion of scarcity (by which individuals are forced to

make choices) and satisfies the axioms of individual choice. Using data on expenditures and

prices we estimate a consumer demand system that includes several main expenditure categories

(cigarettes, food, apparel, transportation, medical care and alcohol). This system of demand

equations relates the budget shares of various commodities (e.g, cigarettes, housing, food) to real

total expenditures and relative prices. Thus, using this strategy, one can estimate the own price

elasticity, the income elasticity, and all cross-price elasticities of all commodities included in the

model. Because the CES data include demographic information, we are able to control for socio-

economic variables and other sources of observable heterogeneity. We estimate this system for

all households, all low-income households, and all smoking households.

       We estimate the following equation for the budget share of each i-th expense category of

household l:

                    n
                                               C
        w = αi +           γ      ln p j + β ln l + δ i Z il + λstatel + φquarterl + ε il   (1)

where i is the expenditure category, l is the household, wil is the share of household l’s total

expenditure spent on i, j indexes the expenditure categories such that pj is the price of category j,

Cl/Pl is the total real expenditure on all goods in the consumer'
                                                                s budget; Zil is a set of exogenous

variables describing the household- l characteristics; and state and quarter represent state and

quarter fixed effects.

             The above equation is estimated for all N categories of goods considered. The demand

system involves seemingly unrelated regressions (SUR), but since the regressors are the same for

all product categories, the generalized least square estimator for the unrestricted model reduces

to the application of OLS to each equation separately.3 Once the parameters are estimated, the

own and cross price elasticities between the expenditure categories chosen can be calculated as

follows4:

Results

             The descriptive data indicate that expenditures on cigarettes are not trivial (Table 2). For

smoking households, average expenditures on tobacco products were nearly 4 percent of total

expenditures, and over $1000 annually. For those in low income households, cigarette spending

was roughly similar to that spent on out of pocket health care expenditures ($1056) or apparel

($1138). Also interesting, in the all income and low income sample, smokers spent roughly the

same annual amount on smoking ($1036 versus $1018), which is in contrast with the fact that

most other expenditure categories increase with income.




                            << Insert Table 2 and Table 3 about here>>



       Examining unadjusted expenditure shares, we find that the greatest difference in

expenditure patterns between smoking and nonsmoking households is housing expenditures,

with non-smoking households spending more on housing. In the all income sample, nonsmoking

families spend an 8 percent greater budget share on housing. This difference is even greater (12

percent) in the low income sample. As expected, smoking households spend more on alcohol

than non-smoking households. In terms of expenditure shares, smokers devote almost two times

greater budget share to alcohol compared with nonsmokers (1.4 % versus 0.74 %). For the low-

income group, smokers devote more than two times greater budget share to alcohol (1.2 %

versus 0.5 %) than the nonsmokers.

AIDS estimates

       We next estimate the AIDS model using the CES (1995-2001) data. We specifically

consider three samples: all households, smoking households, and all low-income households.

Table 4 contains the uncompensated own price and cross price elasticities for the seven

expenditure categories considered, with the diagonals indicating the own price elasticities.

Standard errors are in parentheses and elasticities that are statistically significant (p<.10) are

bold. Considering the full sample (Table 4), in most cases own price elasticities are negative and

statistically significant. We estimate tobacco own price elasticity to be -0.986. This estimate




                                                                                                     10
does not change much in the low income sample (-.946). In the smoking sample it appears less

elastic (-.782). Due to a large number of zero responses for alcohol and tobacco consumption,

we also estimated the model with a selection bias correction term in the tobacco and alcohol

equations. These results were quite similar to the original model, so we don’t present them

here.5

                                  << Insert Table 4 about here>>



         The demand system allows us to estimate not only the own-price, but also the cross-price

elasticities; the effect that changes in the price of one category has on purchases of other

categories. A positive cross-price elasticity indicates that an increase (decrease) in the price of

good i will cause the quantity demanded of good j to increase (decrease), that is, the goods are

substitutes. The tobacco cross-price elasticities (located in the tobacco column in Tables 4-6),

indicate the effect on the quantity consumed of good j when cigarette prices change. In both the

all income sample and the low income sample, we find that food is a substitute to tobacco. This

suggests that when cigarette prices increase, individuals reduce tobacco consumption, and

consume more food. Our estimate from the full sample suggests that when tobacco prices

increase by 1 percent, the quantity of food demanded increases by 0.14 percent. In the smoking

sample, there appears to be no impact of tobacco prices on food consumption.

         Somewhat puzzling, in the all income sample, we find that tobacco and apparel are

complements (εij = -.295). When cigarette prices increase, individuals reduce both their tobacco

consumption and their apparel consumption. For the low income sample, this estimate is


5
 For example, when we estimated the model including the selection bias correction terms, the
own price elasticity of tobacco in the full sample was -.977, compared with -.986 when we did
not include them.

                                                                                                      11
positive, much smaller and not significant (εij =.133), and for the smoking sample it is almost

zero (εij = -.008). In the low income sample, we find that housing is a complement to tobacco.

As the price of tobacco increases, low income households spend less on housing (εij =-.136).

This estimate is close to zero in both the all income sample (εij = -.039) and the smoking sample

(εij = +.028).

        We also find that the price of goods other than tobacco may impact tobacco purchases.

To examine the effect on quantity of cigarettes purchased in response to other good price

changes, we consider the estimates in the tobacco rows in Table 4. Our estimates indicate that

when the price of health care increases, the quantity of tobacco consumed declines. This

estimate is significant in the full sample (εij =-.524), the low income sample (εij =-1.191) and the

smoking sample (εij =-1.163).

        We find that when the price of housing increases, the quantity of tobacco declines. This

effect is significant in the full sample (εij =-828) and the smoking sample (εij =-1.256). In the low

income sample it is not significant, but the estimate is suggestive of an effect (εij =-1.419, t-

statistic=1.62). Since we report uncompensated elasticities, we cannot distinguish whether this is

an income or substitution effect. Because housing represents a large budget share, we may be

capturing an income effect.



Discussion

        We present a unique look at smoking households using expenditure data from a U.S.

national survey of households from 1995-2001. The descriptive data explicitly compare

smoking households to non-smoking households, suggesting the average differences in

expenditure patterns between the two groups. In contrast, the Almost Ideal Demand System


                                                                                                    12
analysis is a marginal analysis estimating changes in expenditures due to small changes in price

across multiple categories of consumer goods. It is important to note that these effects are likely

to be different except in the relatively few cases where an individual quits smoking in response

to a small price change. In an effort to better understand which goods families forgo for smokers

to maintain their smoking habit, we estimate the cross and own price elasticities for tobacco with

respect to other expense categories. We estimate a demand functional form, the Almost Ideal

System, that has the advantage of being a flexible form easy to estimate, a good first order

approximation to any demand system and it guarantees that the estimated coefficients are in

accordance to the basic principles of consumer theory.

        In the descriptive results, our finding that, regardless of income level, smoking

households always spend more on alcohol than non-smoking households is consistent with the

literature, which indicates smoking and drinking are positively correlated (Bien and Burge,

1990). In both the full and low-income sample, nonsmoking households spend considerably

more (33.5% versus 30.9% budget share) than smoking households on housing. A simple

conclusion drawn from this relationship would be that smoking is in part maintained through

lowered housing consumption.



Demand model estimates—own price elasticity

        While the own price elasticity estimate for tobacco of -.986 is outside of consensus range

(-.3 to -.5), it is still well within the wider reported range in the literature (-0.14 to -1.23)

(Chaloupka and Warner, 2000). The estimate for the full sample includes both participation

effects (decisions to quit/initiate smoking) and consumption effects (decisions among smokers to

reduce quantity smoked). Thus, we expect the price elasticity estimates to be lower in the




                                                                                                    13
smoking sample, which only includes consumption effects. The conditional elasticity estimates

for the smoking group are smaller but remain quite high at -.78. Due to limitations of these data,

these results should be interpreted with caution. Because we lack information regarding the

quantity smoked, to the extent that expenditure data do not reveal within category substitutions,

the elasticity estimates will be biased. For instance, if changes in expenditure patterns are due in

part to moves toward less expensive or longer cigarettes, this will likely overstate the estimated

elasticity effects (Evans and Farrelly, 1998)

       That the estimates presented here are larger than consensus estimates is puzzling. Yet,

the estimates of the tobacco price elasticity presented here deviate from the literature in several

important ways. Recent tax increases on cigarettes in many states in the U.S. have been

considerable. Given that most of the previous estimates were from lower price points, it is

entirely plausible (and perhaps to be expected) that elasticity estimates at different points on the

demand curve would differ. Interestingly, behavioral economics research suggests that as the

price of cigarettes increases, the price elasticity of demand rises (DeGrandpre and Bickel, 1995).

Another possibility is that not all earlier estimates have controlled for tobacco control policy and

variation across states in public sentiment about tobacco, particularly studies that rely solely on

cross-sectional variation. Our inclusion of state fixed effects mitigates this factor and could

partially explain our finding as somewhat counterintuitively, Ohsfeldt et al. (1999) found that

elasticity demand estimates were larger after controlling for these other factors. A final

discrepancy is our elimination of households with multiple consumer units. If these households

are those least likely to change behavior in response to price changes, our elasticity estimates

will be biased upwards (in absolute value).

Demand model estimates—cross price elasticity




                                                                                                   14
       For the full sample we find that two cross-price elasticity estimates with respect to

tobacco are significant. In the full sample, tobacco and food are substitutes, although the lack of

a finding for the smoking sample suggests that the effect predominantly operates through a

participation effect. In other words, those who quit smoking following an increase in the price of

cigarettes are most likely to increase their food consumption. Research has shown that smokers

put on an average of 6.4 pounds after quitting smoking (Klesges, Meyers et al. 1989). This

substitution pattern between food and cigarettes accords with increased weight gain post

cessation.

       According to the full sample estimates, we also find that smoking and apparel are

complements. This indicates that as cigarette prices increase, consumption of apparel declines.

However, this finding is not robust across samples. In general, it is also difficult to understand

this effect as with such broad expenditure categories, we cannot say which type of apparel is

affected.

       The cross price elasticity estimates between tobacco and alcohol deserve special

consideration. The effect of cigarette taxation on alcohol consumption may be of particular

interest to policy makers attempting to affect positive behavioral change. Somewhat surprising,

our estimates of the relationship between tobacco prices and alcohol consumption are not

significant although alcohol price does affect significantly tobacco consumption.

       That the quantity of tobacco consumed declines as the price of health care increases also

deserves further attention. It is important to remember that in these data the health care

expenditures include only out-of-pocket expenditures (not premiums paid by employers or health

care costs paid by insurers). Yet, because most health insurance policies include copayments,

particularly for prescription drugs, Americans are not fully insulated from the costs of care.




                                                                                                     15
Perhaps as households see the price of their health care share increasing, they associate smoking

with higher future health care needs, and respond by reducing their smoking consumption. This

finding makes some intuitive sense, as smokers could internalize even higher potential medical

costs associated with continued smoking.



Limitations

       There are potential limitations with the methods used here that limit the ability to

interpret results in a way that is useful from a policy perspective. In particular, the broad range

of the expenditure categories could allow a great deal of substitution within categories to be

masked. Concerning the data, we have not corrected for intrastate difference in cigarette prices.

Self-reported expenditure data may be biased, particularly with respect to purchases by youth

living with their parents. Nevertheless, we emphasize the ability of this model to explicitly

document the opportunity costs of smoking. That is, that households must necessarily forego

some goods to maintain their smoking habit.

       Our primary interest was to identify how households alter consumption behavior

following changes in the price of cigarettes. This research is particularly important now. Many

states in the U.S. have greatly increased cigarette taxes in recent years. In response, cigarette

manufacturers and some commentators have argued that the resulting high cigarette prices put an

undue burden on low income families. A better understanding of precisely how families are

affected will shed light on this claim. Our estimates indicate that the increase in expenditure on

cigarettes resulting from a price increase is not as large as expected due to the large negative own

price elasticity. Therefore, the crowd-out of other goods might not be as substantial as originally

anticipated. Nevertheless, we do find that increases in cigarette prices do affect negatively




                                                                                                    16
consumption of food and housing for low income families and we believe that these effects are

worth taking into account when making policy. Note that the elasticities we report are

uncompensated, therefore, we cannot distinguish to which extent these effects are driven by the

income effect or the pure substitution effect caused by increased cigarette prices. A priori, one

would expect that the negative effect on housing expenditure is due mostly to the income effect

and the negative effect on food consumption to the substitution, but this is speculative and only

compensated elasticities can inform us about this issue in view of designing ‘compensating’

policies.

        In any case, we believe that a better understanding by the public of the level of spending

necessary to maintain a tobacco addiction might influence some individuals never to start

smoking. And, a better understanding of the goods foregone due to the purchase of tobacco may

motivate some smokers to quit or motivate family members to encourage smokers to quit and

might even be woven into existing treatments. This information may also be important for

developing new treatments.

        There are several future extensions of this project. The idea was to prevent a framework

for understanding some opportunity costs of smoking. In that spirit, only broad categories of

expenditure categories were included. It would be interesting to use these preliminary estimates

to study more distinct classification of expenditures. For example, one might consider insurance

premiums separately from other health care spending, food at home separately from food away

from home, or children’s clothing separately from clothing for adults. Specific family types may

be important to study for policy reasons. Ultimately it will also be interesting to investigate the

role that other tobacco control policies play in these relationships.
