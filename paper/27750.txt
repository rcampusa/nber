                                          ABSTRACT

We examine the origins, persistence, and economic consequences of institutional structures of
agricultural production. We compare farms in the Argentine Pampas and US Midwest, regions of
similar potential input and output mixes. The focus is on 1910-1914, during the international
grain trade boom and when census data are available. The Midwest was characterized by small
farms and family labor. Land was a commercial asset and traded routinely. The Pampas was
characterized by large landholdings and use of external labor. Land was a source of status and
held across generations. Status attributes could not be easily monetized for trade, reducing market
exchange, limiting entry, and hindering farm restructuring. Differing land property rights
followed from English and Spanish colonial and post-independence policies. Geo-climatic factors
cannot explain dissimilarities in farm sizes, tenancy, and output mixes, suggesting institutional
constraints. Midwest farmers also were more responsive to exogenous signals. There is evidence
of moral hazard on Pampas farms. Conjectures on long-term development are provided.

1. Introduction

         We examine the origins, persistence, and consequences of institutional structures of
agricultural production in two regions of potentially similar input and output mixes, the Argentine
Pampas and portions of the US Midwest. The sample areas are flat, have comparable climates,
and rich soil. They competed for European immigrant labor, and historically produced for the same
international markets. Owing to different English and Spanish colonial and post-independence
property rights policies, small farms dominated in the Midwest, whereas large estates were
prevalent in the Pampas.
         Small farm owners relied upon family labor and share tenancy contracts that could
eventually lead to purchase. Large estate owners relied upon external labor, non-renewable, cash-
rent tenancy. In the Midwest, land was a commercial asset and traded routinely, whereas in the
Pampas, land was both a commercial asset and a source of political and social status, and held
across generations. These differences in the role of land ownership raised the costs of land
exchange in the Pampas relative to the Midwest. While standard, productive attributes could be
monetized for trade, non-standard, status attributes could not so easily be, providing a barrier to
market-based adjustments. Fewer land transactions hindered entry, farm restructuring, and
responses to exogenous profit signals.
         We analyze economic outcomes with implications for long-term economic growth and
welfare. The empirical focus is on 1910-1914 during the international grain trade boom in which
both regions competed and when census data are available. We use linear regressions of farm size
and other outcomes in the Pampas and the Midwest, while controlling for local (county-level) geo-
climatic variables, as well as crop-specific measures of potential yields. 2 We examine two
coefficients: the overall country fixed effects and differential responses to geo-climatic variables
or yields in the two areas. The comparisons assume that farm sizes, organization, and output mixes
in each country would be similar if property rights and market activity were the same.




2
  The Midwestern states in our comparison region (Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, and Missouri) are chosen
based on geo-climatic similarities with the Argentina Pampas due to our interest in isolating the role of differences in
property rights allocations and market exchange. This U.S. region is essentially the "Lower Midwest," though only
Kansas and Missouri are included in the Midwest region as defined by the U.S. Census. We obtain the same qualitative
results with an extended sample that also includes Louisiana, Nebraska, Iowa, and Illinois (the latter three also part of
the Midwest as defined by the US Census).

                                                           2
         All else equal, in 1910-1914 average farm size in the Argentina Pampas was almost 50%
larger than in the Midwest sample (1,076 vs 724 acres); specialization in ranching was much higher
(cattle per acre or per capita); and lands productively suited for grains were often devoted to
livestock. Further, tenant patterns were different, with non-renewable cash tenancy in the Pampas
versus renewable share tenancy in the Midwest. These generated different incentives for long-term
productivity. Additionally, farm sizes and output mixes were significantly less sensitive to changes
in key geo-climatic factors, such as precipitation, in the Pampas than in the Midwest. 3 The results
imply that productivity gains would have been possible had land market adjustments been more
feasible. There are additional indications of moral hazard losses and reduced incentives to invest
in rural physical and human capital.
         By 1910-1914 both regions had been in settlement and economic activity for approximately
200 years and land rights policies in place for even longer, enough time for organizational and
production convergence via market exchange. We do not see this. The results suggest that once
property rights are assigned, they can be very difficult to change with long-term organization and
production consequences if markets are not active (Libecap 2007, 286).
         When property rights are well defined and transaction costs are low, then the institutional
structure of production, input mixes, and output patterns can be modified whenever there are profit
opportunities from doing so. Markets depend upon and invite entry; incorporate new information;
and encourage asset owners to make organizational and production adjustments, either directly or
through sale to parties who will do so. If, however, market activity is constrained, then new
information on shifting profit opportunities is less easily incorporated in resource decision making,
and incentives for asset reallocation and reorganization are reduced (Demsetz 1964, 16-17; 1968,
50).
         In agrarian societies like the US Midwest and the Argentine Pampas in the early 20 th
century, land is the most important productive asset; farms are a key organizational unit; and
property rights to land are a crucial economic institution in production, investment, and market
performance. Our analysis contributes to law and economics, as well as to economic history and
development (North and Thomas 1973; North 1981; Sokoloff and Engerman 2000; La Porta et al.
2008; Acemoglu et al. 2005). The paper is organized as follows. Section 2 presents a conceptual

 For instance, as precipitation changes across localities, creating different profit opportunities by farm size and
output mix, these outcomes would respond similarly in sign and magnitude in both countries.

colonial times in the Argentina Pampas and US Midwest. Section 4 presents the empirical analysis.
Section 5 discusses implications for long-run development. Section 6 concludes.

2. Institutional Structures of Agricultural Production in Comparative Perspective

       The literature developed by Coase (1937, 1960); Demsetz (1964, 1968, 1988); Alchian and
Demsetz (1972); Cheung (1988); Williamson (1985); Barzel (1989); Hart and More (1990);
Becker and Murphy (1992); and others describe the institutional structure of production and
exchange. These insights are applied to agriculture by Cheung (1968, 1969a, b), Roumasset and
Uy (1987), and Allen and Lueck (1998).
       A key argument is that large land holdings have lower productivity at early stages of
development if scale economies are absent, monitoring costs are increasing in farm size, and land
trade is limited (Eastwood et al. 2010; Feder 1985; Eswaran and Kotwal 1986; Foster and
Rosenzweig 2017; Rada and Fugile 2019). Small farm owners, who rely upon family labor and
who can observe effort and outcomes, have fewer information and moral hazard problems (Allen
and Lueck 1998, 355). By contrast, owners of larger farms, who rely on external labor across
extensive operations have more limited or asymmetric information for assessing input allocations
and performance and implementing corrections. Further, misaligned incentives lead to shirking
and holdup during critical production stages (Klein, Crawford, and Alchian 1978; Williamson
1985; Demsetz 1988, 151).
        If information and moral hazard costs are sufficiently high, such that organizational, input,
and output adjustments are required, changes can be promoted through market exchange. As
Demsetz (1967, 350) argued, new productive arrangements emerge in response to "[t]he desires
of the interacting persons for adjustment to new benefit-cost possibilities."
       Such adjustments, however, can be impeded if untypical and difficult-to-measure values
are linked to land ownership. In developing societies, possession of large farms often conveys
additional status benefits beyond production. The attributes of privilege tied to land include social
esteem, political influence and office, marriage opportunities, elite education, and membership in
exclusive organizations. Status is assigned at birth to family members and signaled and carried
across generations by inheritable ownership of large estates. So long as the privileged family is
linked to its demonstrable land holdings, the loss of a key member at a particular instance does not

                                                 4
end the intergenerational flow of value to others in the family. Larger estates indicate greater
esteem, reducing incentives to parcel parts of them, even if there were production benefits from
doing so.
         These status benefits pose problems for market negotiators to value and agree upon (Barzel
2004). Because such benefits commonly are not traded, they lack external valuation and validation.
For land exchange to occur in the presence of bundled social and commercial qualities, the
incumbent owner must state an ask price covering the expected value of all attributes. Similarly, a
buyer must state a bid price premium above commercial returns covering status values.
Accordingly, finding a clearing price in light of these requirements is a significant barrier to trade
and potential farm size and other organizational adjustments.4
         In the US Midwest farm sizes were small and in the Argentine Pampas they were large
despite very similar resource characteristics. These differences arose from contrasting colonial
property rights policies. Coase (1960, 15) and Demsetz (1967, 349) argued that the initial
allocation of property rights would not matter for the organization of production if transaction
costs were low: "[t]he output mix that results when the exchange of property rights is allowed is
efficient and the mix is independent of who is assigned ownership." Colonial property rights and
the values they assigned, however, affected transaction costs across the two regions and made
differences in organization and production persistent.


3. The Colonial Origins of Property Rights to Land

3.1. The Legacy of English Colonial Property Rights Policies
         In English North American colonies as well as in Spanish colonies, land allocation, market
objectives, and political and social patterns replicated conditions and aspirations existing in the
home country. Initially in feudal England, as in Spain, property in land demonstrated wealth and
legitimate privilege. It was part of the social, economic, and political hierarchy that stemmed from

4
  There are other related sources of transaction costs that impeded land exchange in the Pampas. These are linked to
the distribution of large properties. Agricultural credit markets were relatively underdeveloped, and biased against
tenants and smallholders (Adelman 1990). Creditor protection was much weaker in the Spanish legal tradition than in
the British one (La Porta el al. 2008), which may have limited the use of land as collateral, and thus hampered the
joint development of land and credit markets. Given the political influence of large land owners in Argentina, had it
been in their interest to improve credit markets and promote land trade, it would seem plausible that they would have
organized to do so (Acemoglu 2003). In a similar context, Rajan and Ramcharan (2011) describe the resistance of
large land owners in the US South to promote banking development.


                                                         5
the sovereign to the nobility. There were different classes of landed gentry, often signaled by the
size of the estate, that assigned rank-ordered honors and opportunities to pass down those benefits
to heirs. Those who worked the land as serfs or diverse types of tenants were at the hierarchy
bottom with no property claim. As such, feudalism granted a disproportionate share of social
status and political power to a comparatively small group of people in the country.
         Even as feudalism waned in England between the 15th and 18th centuries, there was a strong
desire among landed elites to hold on to their estates and the status benefits they provided (Beckett
1989, 545-549). Edmund Burke, the 18th century British statesman and philosopher, commented:
"Landed interest was `a partnership not only between those who are living, but between those who
are living, those who are dead, and those who are to be born" (quoted in Beckett 1989, 549).
         As English feudalism declined, land become more transferable as a commodity or asset,
rather than primarily a source of political position (Campbell 1942, 67, 156). Land markets
gradually became more active after the advent of the agricultural and industrial revolutions that
weakened the position of traditional landed gentry relative to new industrial and merchant classes,
and provided new sources of wealth from the reorganization and sale of land. Estates gradually
were broken up and sold in smaller parcels (Johnson 1909, 11). Small holders, often previously
tenants, along with those of a rising merchant and industrial class, bought land and invested in new
food production, selective livestock breeding, and actively participated in land markets (Linklater
2013, 5, 12, 30-8, 58). Ordinary individuals began to own land and enjoy the benefits of using,
investing, and trading it (Johnson 1909, 20, 117).5
         While land ownership remained relatively tightly held, contributing to wealth
concentration in England through the 19th century (Lindert 1987), maintenance of heredity status
based on land became increasingly costly. The added value of redeployed property progressively
offset historical stature benefits. The premiums necessary to shift land to commercial uses
gradually declined. To promote market transactions historical legal constraints were relaxed (Bean
1991; Holdsworth 1927).6

  The prominent English jurist, William Blackstone in 1766 stated: "There is nothing which so generally strikes the
imagination, and engages the affections of mankind, as the right of property..." (quoted in Ellickson 1993, 1317).
In a history of the rise of small farmers in England Campbell (1942, 64) noted that: "The story of the English
yeoman is essentially a story of the land. ...The fact that the lands were their own, or directly under their control,
bred in them a sense of pride and personal interest and responsibility...".
6
  Historically, parts of estates might be devoted to leaseholds, but not sold as freeholds. Restrictions on the breakup
and sale of manors were enforced across generations through a variety of social norms and legal mechanisms, such
as entail that restricted inheritance so that ownership remained within the family (Bean, 1991). Later, rules against

                                                           6
        English colonization and migration to North America reflected these dynamics. It was
driven by the desire of all migrants, elites and ordinary individuals, to secure and own a portion of
the seemingly endless abundance of frontier land (Ely 2008, 13). Land sales were seen by the
Crown, proprietors, shareholders, and large-estate owners as a major source of revenue. There was
a need to attract immigrants to North America, who would demand land, create small farms in
temperate regions, and form stable new communities. British colonial policies sought to make land
a marketable commodity and a liquid asset that could be transferred and used to obtain credit. As
required, colonial legislatures modified English property law to encourage the easy access to and
trade in land (Priest forthcoming, Chapter 1).7 The extensive availability of fertile land to small
holders, who could secure and cultivate freeholds, generated a comparatively egalitarian society
(Lindert and Williamson 2013).
        As frontier migrants moved in large numbers beyond the eastern seaboard after
independence, land policies continued to promote access to small land plots by gradually lowering
the cost of securing property rights, demarcation, and exchange. The Federal Land Ordinance of
1785 created the Public Lands Survey System (PLSS) of grids of square townships for the
distribution and sale of land in definable parcels as a commodity (Libecap and Lueck 2011). Land
was conveyed through direct sales from the federal government, from the issuance of military
warrants, redeemable for small parcels, to compensate Revolutionary War soldiers (Ford 1910,
359-411), the Preemption Acts (Kanazawa 1996) and after 1862, the Homestead Act (Gates 1968.
799-805 for data on transfers).
        There were influential constituencies, among them Presidents, members of Congress, and
land claimants for low-cost, rapid transfers of federal lands in small plots. Thomas Jefferson saw
a nation of numerous, freeholders not only as good economics, but good politics (Katz 1976, 480).




perpetuities to promote land alienability and exchange were based on new court rulings and acts of Parliament.
Entail, for example, eventually was abolished by the Law of Property Act of 1925 (Holdsworth 1927, 2013; 217-
227, 545).
7
  In some colonies, a headright of 50 acres or more was given by colonial legislatures to those who would cover
immigrant transport costs. Immigrants served as indentured servants to repay and then were offered access to land.
Competition to secure migrants was intense, and indenture contracts were supplemented by redemption, whereby
migrants were released from their indenture commitments early upon paying off the loan (Ford 1910, 416; Grubb
1986; Abramitsky and Braggion 2006). The headright/indentured servant system may have accounted for 50% to 66%
of white male immigration to the North American colonies between 1630 and 1776, or 300,000 to 400,000 people
(Priest forthcoming, Chapter 1, 17). Perhaps as many as 35% of indentured servants were female, creating a basis for
family formation and internal market development (Elliott 2006, 55).

                                                         7
Benjamin Franklin saw land ownership as the way for ordinary persons and their children to
improve their positions in life (Franklin, 1751, quoted in McCulloch, 1845, 254). 8
        There is an extensive literature using manuscript census and probate records on the wealth
generated from migration to the frontier and associated capital gains from land sales, from
Midwestern states (Kearl et al. 1980; Steckel 1989; Galenson and Pope 1989; Ferrie 1993; Gregson
1996; Stewart 2009). These land rents created a relatively dense middle class and associated
internal market.
        Hartnett's (1991) valuable study demonstrates the extensive and fluid nature of land
markets in the Midwest. The study also reveals the close ties with nascent capital market
development. He examines 4,397 deed transfers between 1839 and 1889 in Turtle and La Prairie
townships of southern Wisconsin. Across the 72 sections of the two townships over the 50 years
in the study, in some areas there was one transfer every 4 days or in others a transfer every 10
months. Some 280,758 acres of land were conveyed (10 times the size of a single section) for an
average of 63.85 acres per transfer. This acreage amounted to the turnover of 12% of the land each
year, or about 80 acres in every square-mile section. Cash raised from past transactions typically
was used in these and other purchases transactions. Hartnett (1991, 47) points to similar 19 th
century land markets in Wisconsin, Iowa, and Nebraska as indication that his findings were
representative of the region.
        As available frontier land declined and Midwestern land prices rose in the late 19 th, share
tenancy became an option for new farmers to acquire land through purchase at the end of the
contract. The ultimate aim of tenancy was ownership as part of the agricultural ladder (Spillman
1919; Winters 1982, 137-143; Alston and Ferrie 2005).9 Share tenant contracts aligned the
incentives of owners and tenants through sharing inputs, risk, and joint claims on output (Cheung
1969a, b).


8
  Alexis de Tocqueville (1835) observed that owning small plots of land changed the way in which Americans
thought of themselves, as well as economic and political opportunity (de Tocqueville 1835, quoted in Goldhammer
2004, 273).
9
  By the end of century, a consensus at the time was that US land policy in the Midwest was a success. The US
Public Lands Commission looked back over the small-farm, homestead principle and concluded: "The maxim that
He who tills the soil should own the soil is accepted as a fundamental principle of political economy... Small
holdings distributed severally among the tillers of the soil is believed to be a fundamental condition for the
prosperity and happiness of an agricultural population" (US Public Lands Commission, 1880, xxii). Frederick
Jackson Turner in 1893 in his famous thesis, "The Significance of the Frontier in American History," claimed that
America ultimately was shaped by small-farm allocations as the underpinnings for economic growth and wellbeing
(Turner 1893, 203).

3.2 The Legacy of Spanish Colonial Property Rights Policies.
        In contrast to England in the colonial period, Spain and much of southern Europe
experienced no dramatic dilution of feudal structures and obligations (Van Bath, 1963). In Spain,
there was no appreciable small-land owner class as was developing in England. Hennessy (1978,
28-30, 161) describes the pastoral, grazing economy in Spain and its associated hierarchy of the
crown, church, landed nobility, and peasants. All land was the property of the crown, and
concessions to hereditary nobility or to non-hereditary office holders were made at the sovereign's
discretion.
        The most significant development in property rights to land in Spain in the feudal period
was the establishment of the Mesta and the reaffirming of the importance of the livestock-raising
landed gentry, relative to emergence of smaller-scale agricultural units and a small-holder farming
class as occurring in England.10 The Mesta, a union of sheep raisers, was set up in the late 13th
century to maintain rights-of-way for migration and grazing across the Iberian Peninsula. The
Spanish crown granted the Mesta these privileges in exchange for tribute payments and loyalty.
The hierarchical structure maintained comparatively immobile land ownership, political
institutions, and large-scale agricultural production patterns. 11
        The Spanish crown maintained tight control over colonial policies and sought to replicate
conditions in its colonies. There were no relatively independent colony proprietorships and
competing colonial charters as existed in English North America to generate diverse land
assignments and competition for immigrants. The distribution of land rights along with political
and social structures mimicked positions held by the Spanish landed gentry (Elliott, 2006). Land
was granted in large tracts and redistribution via sale or inheritance was limited (Elliott 2006, 40-
55; Linklater 2013, 77).
        In the Pampas, allocations, estancias, were directed to a select few as estancieros. Many
estancias were extremely large, in some cases tens of thousands of acres, and unlike in the US


10
   Grazing and agricultural production potentials differed between the two countries, but Mesta restrictions
prevented negotiated exchanges between small farmers and large-scale grazers to accommodate livestock and crops.
11
   Partially as a result of their different property rights regimes, Spain had much higher wealth inequality than
England, a thinner land market, and lower investments in agricultural human capital by the landed gentry (Oto-
Peralias and Romero-Avila 2016). In the 17th century Spanish agricultural output per capita was significantly below
that of England, and convergence did not take place until well into the 20 th century (Alvarez-Nogal and Prados De
La Escosura 2013).

                                                         9
they were not broken up for subsequent resale to small holders (Scobie 1964, 45; Adelman 1994,
63-68; Engerman and Sokoloff 1994, 19; Amaral 1998, 24, 25; Hora 2001, 2). Hennessy (1978,
18) describes the result: "the latifundio, not the homestead, became the typical rural institution."
         Agricultural production was organized within the estancia that was both an economic
institution and a basis for social and political position. It was an enduring hierarchical structure
designed to persist generation after generation (Elliott 2006, 38). After independence there were
no general provisions for ordinary immigrants, who did not own land in Spain (or later in Italy),
to secure small farmsteads the Pampas (Adelman 1994, 58). Initially, estancias were devoted to
livestock raising, but the international cereals boom of the late 19 th and early 20th centuries brought
a shift to cereals production on parts of estates. Between 1895 and 1914 real international wheat
prices rose by about 50%, whereas cattle prices generally were static with a slight decline (Jacks
2019).
         Absent the economies of scale found in livestock production, estancia owners might have
broken their properties into smaller plots for grains and sold them or leased them via long-term,
renewable, tenant share contracts, but they did not do so. Profit opportunities from exploiting land
in smaller units were addressed by subletting parts of their land as minifundios under tenant labor
agreements or arrendamientos. Arrendamientos typically were short-term, 2-3 year, labor
contracts that were not renewed (Scobie 1964, 52, 72-88; Adelman 1994, 77, 133-135, 202-149;
Scarzanella 1989, 3, 5). These tenant arrangements differed from those used in the US Midwest
(Winters 1982, 128, 140-142).
         Reliance upon cash tenant labor contracts, rather than sale or tenant share land contracts,
allowed large land owners to maintain social and political status; avoided the rise of a small-farm
owning middle class that could compete with them for political and social position; and allowed
for production or lease adjustments at the end of the arrangement (Solberg 1971, 21, fn. 7;
Scarzanella 1989, 5).
         Because newly-arrived immigrants were to be laborers, they lacked collateral to access
land and credit markets (Scarzanella 1989, 4, 8, 11; Adelman 1990; 1994, 114). Tenants could not
acquire land because access to credit required collateral, but without credit they did not have
property as collateral. Moreover, notary fees required for acquiring a plot of land were high and




                                                  10
similar for small or large tracts (Yuln 2012). Unlike the Midwest, rural land and capital markets
were scarce until late in the 19th century (Cortés Conde 1979). 12
        The difficulty of acquiring small freeholds affected rural migration patterns. Overall, there
were relatively fewer permanent rural immigrants to the Argentine Pampas, compared to the US
Midwest, and a higher ratio of male-to-female immigrants (Wilcox 1929, 395-396; 539-540;
Solberg 1971, 48; Adelman 1994, 8, 63-88, 104-131, 147-67). With mobile individual tenants
moving from property to property, there was reduced incentive among land owners to invest in
more permanent housing and related infrastructure. This contributed to low population densities
and a limited internal market for Buenos Aires relative to Chicago (Scarzanella 1989, 14;
Campante and Glaeser 2009, 3).
        There were efforts by Argentine Presidents Domingo Faustino Sarmiento (1868-1874) and
Nicolás Avellaneda (1874-1880) to replicate US Homestead Laws and systematic, rectangular plot
surveys to promote small-scale land ownership on remaining government lands in the Pampas
(Solberg 1971, 36). An 1876 law provided a survey system of 100,000-acre sections and individual
plots of 250 acres (Scobie 1964, 118, 121-126). The law forbade the purchase of large land blocks
by a single person. Estancia owners opposed the law that would restrict their access to remaining
land and undermine existing labor contracts (Adelman 1994, 81, 68-77, 89). An 1878 statute
redefined the grid to include 400,000 acres (1,000,000 hectares) and much expanded minimum
farm sizes of 4,000 acres (10,000 hectares). These were much larger than US sections of 640 acres,
where homestead distributions typically were in quarter sections. Limited government
colonization schemes also were implemented in the late 19 th century to attract Italian immigrants
with an offer of small parcels for purchase, particularly in Santa Fé province in the Pampas
(Scarzanella 1989, 3).

4. Empirical Analysis
        Our discussion of the legacies of colonial property rights policies suggests that relative to
the US Midwest, the Pampas would be expected to have: (a) larger farm sizes, due to initial land
allocations and limited reliance upon markets for adjustment; (b) stronger specialization in cattle
relative to wheat, given the extensive nature of grazing and the intensive nature of farming; (c)


12
   A number of recent case studies indicate that land markets did exist, (e.g., Banzato 2013), but the breadth of
evidence suggests that they were far less active than in the US.

                                                       11
higher prevalence of tenancy as the preferred arrangement for growing cereals; (d) higher
prevalence of cash tenancy relative to share tenancy, since short cash-tenancy contracts allowed
estancia owners to limit potential ownership claims by tenants.
         In this section, we use Census data from the US in 1910 and Argentina in 1914 to
empirically document that agricultural organization in the Pampas was in fact characterized by
large farm sizes, specialization in cattle, and cash tenancy. While our interpretation suggests that
these differences reflect differing colonial origins and property right regimes, geo-climatic
differences could be driving results.13 Our empirical analysis, however, shows that geo-climatic
conditions cannot fully explain the differences in farm sizes, tenancy arrangements, and output
mix between the Argentine Pampas and the US Midwest. Moreover, we show that agricultural
organization by owners in Argentina was less responsive to geo-climatic factors, suggesting
rigidity in adjustments to the organization of agricultural production.


4.1 Data

         To compare farm organization in the US Midwest and Argentine Pampas, we use newly
digitized-data from the 1914 Argentine national census, 1914 Argentine census data digitized by
Droller and Fiszbein (2020), and data from the 1910 United States Census of Agriculture digitized
by Haines (2010). US data are provided at the county level, which is roughly equivalent to the
Argentine data, which are provided for a departamento (department), the subdivision of a province.
We collect data on number and size of farms; acres in wheat; number of farms operated by owners,
renters, and rental agreement types; and number of cattle.
         In Argentina, we focus on four key Pampas provinces, Buenos Aires, Cordoba, Santa Fe,
and Entre Rios, which represented over 91 percent of total cropland from the country's first
agricultural census in 1908.14 These provinces lie primarily between 30- and 40-degrees latitude


13
   For instance, Engerman and Sokoloff (2002) argue that soil and climate influenced agricultural specialization
patterns in the Americas in ways that favored land concentration in particular places. Droller and Fiszbein (2020)
show that variation in ranching specialization across localities in the Argentine Pampas is partly explained by geo-
climatic conditions.
14
   In Argentina, we exclude the small departments in the province of Buenos Aires located around the city of Buenos
Aires because (i) they represent little agricultural production and (ii) due to their small size, the ability to match
historic boundaries is challenging. The excluded area includes what are today the 26 smallest departments in the
four-province region as well as San Fernando, currently the 38th smallest. At the time this area consisted of 13
departments, all among the 23 smallest: Capital Federal, San Miguel, Berazategui, Ituzaingo, Lanus Tres De
Febrero, Presidente Peron, Jose C. Paz, Ezeiza, Escobar, Hurlingham, Vicente Lopez.

                                                         12
south of the equator. We chose a set of US Midwest comparison states based on geo-climatic
similarities. Contemporaneous accounts of Argentina suggested that "[t]he Pampa of Argentina is
a region similar to portions of the Great Plains country west of the Mississippi, especially portions
of Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas (Eastabrook 1926)."
       Our main comparison group consists of five states: Texas, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas,
and Missouri, which we label as the "US Baseline" sample. These states also lie primarily between
30- and 40-degrees latitude, but north of the equator. We also compare the Pampas provinces to a
nine-state sample including these five states plus Louisiana, Nebraska, Iowa, and Illinois--the "US
Extended" sample. We have limited the four additional states to the extended sample because,
relative to the Pampas, Nebraska, Illinois, and Iowa are farther from the equator, more than 40-
degrees north, and Louisiana receives significantly more precipitation. Sample areas are shown in
Figure 1, as are comparisons of the climatic and elevation characteristics of the two regions. Table
1 shows summary statistics for the Argentine provinces as well as baseline, extended, and eastern
US samples. The US states from the eastern US excluded from our two samples are generally more
rugged and colder than the Argentine Pampas.

Maps are drawn by the authors.


           To construct geo-climatic descriptions of the historic counties and departments, we extract
the area-weighted mean of yearly temperature, precipitation, elevation, and terrain (spatial
standard deviation of elevation) using geographical information system software. US 1910 county
shapefiles come from the National Historic Geographic Information System produced by the
Minnesota Population Center. Argentine department shapefiles are constructed by the authors by
modifying a shape file of the current boundaries using Argentina department maps corresponding
to 1914 boundaries as provided in Cacopardo (1967).15
           We extract average normalized attainable yields for wheat and pasture from FAO's Global
Agro-Ecological Zones project v3.0 (IIASA/FAO, 2012). These estimates employ climatic data,
including precipitation, temperature, wind speed, sunshine hours, together with crop-specific
factors, thermal suitability, water requirements, growth and development parameters. Combining
these data, the GAEZ model determines the maximum attainable yield (measured in tons per
hectare per year) for each crop in each grid cell of 0.083x0.083 degrees. We use FAO's measure
of agro-climatic yields based solely on climate, not on soil conditions, to eliminate potential
endogeneity in soil productivity investments. We consider attainable yields under rain-fed
conditions using yields for intermediate levels of inputs/technology.

Notes: Baseline sample includes all counties in Kansas, Arkansas, Oklahoma, Missouri, and Texas. Extended
sample includes in addition all counties in Louisiana, Nebraska, Iowa, and Illinois. Eastern sample includes all
counties east of the 100th Meridian. Standard deviations are in parentheses. Suitability measures are in tons per
hectare of potential yield. Roughness is the spatial standard deviation of elevation over the county area. Cropland
acres and cropland acres per farm are measured slightly differently in Argentina and the United States, as discussed
in the text.


         From the US census, the number of farms and area in farms are comprehensive counts
which include all ownership types and farming activities as well as ranching. These measures
correspond most closely to the Argentine Pampas data on number of explotaciones agropecuarias,
which includes both farms and ranches, and the area measure corresponding to all these
establishments. Due to differing definitions and translation issues, we label as "farms" the US
farm/ranch total and total Argentine explotaciones agropecuarias.
         In both censuses, the unit of analysis is an individual farm/ranch run by a single operator,
and so includes rented farms by tenants as individual observations. The censuses differ slightly in
how they report cropland, with the US census reporting improved acres and the Argentine census
reporting number and acres in explotaciones agrarias or agriculture. We label both these variables
as cropland, but note there may be some systematic differences in what is reported under each
measure.

                                                         15
       We also collect data from both countries on the number of rented farms. In Argentina,
rented farms are further divided into cash-rent and share-rent for establishments in cropland, but
only number of renters is provided for ranches--we assume this is because share rent is not a
common form of contract for ranch operations. We construct a cumulative number of rentals
measure for the Pampas by adding the number of rented farms and ranches. In addition, we
construct the proportion share of establishments in cash-rent and share-rent.
       In the US, four categories of rent are provided in the census that cover ranches and farms
cumulatively. The additional two categories are cash-share rent and unknown rent. To present a
consistent comparison, we categorize cash-share rentals as share rentals and unknown rentals as

       We calculate the average farm size for each county/department as the total area in farms
divided by the total number of farms. While area in tenant farms is not available in Argentina, it is
for the US, and we use this approach to construct an average tenant farm size measure. Both
censuses provide area cultivated in wheat and the number of cattle.

4.2 Approach
       Our empirical approach uses a cross-country comparison of farm organization decisions
between the US Midwest baseline sample and the Argentine Pampas provinces, relying on cross-
sectional, county-level data. We show that the differences in agricultural organization between the
two regions cannot be explained by geo-climatic factors, consistent with our emphasis on differing
colonial origins of property rights. Moreover, we show that agricultural organization in Argentina
was less responsive to geo-climatic factors.
       One key challenge to identification is that other differences between the two areas, for
instance differences in land productivity characteristics, could be driving results we attribute to
underlying property rights differences. Our choice of the Argentine and US county samples to be
similar in geo-climatic characteristics is a broad attempt to compare similar areas. Maps of four
farm organization outcomes are provided in Figure 2 to show the variation we seek to explain
using geo-climatic dependent variables.
       To further control for geo-climatic factors we run a linear regression of a farm organization
attribute on an indicator of country, while controlling within each country for geo-climatic
variables or measures of potential yield. In these regressions we can examine two types of


                                                 16
coefficients: the overall fixed effect of the Argentine Pampas relative to the US Midwest and the
differential response to climatic or yield variables between the two regions.
         The comparative analysis assumes that the geo-climatic controls sufficiently control for
non-institutional factors that might affect outcomes. The differential response comparisons assume
that absent institutional differences, farm characteristics in each country would respond similarly
in sign and magnitude to factors including precipitation, temperature, roughness, elevation, and
productivity suitability. Accordingly, the empirical approach is designed to test the extent to which
there are unexplained differences in the organization of farm production that are not related to
these geo-climatic factors. This strategy by design cannot directly attribute unexplained differences
to a particular cause, but would be consistent with the colonial origins hypothesis.

4.3 Farm Size
         Over time, Argentine farms have been large, to the point of being a worldwide outlier even
today (Eastwood et al. 2010; Federico 2008). In 1914, the average of county-level mean farm size
in the Pampas as shown in Table 1 was 1,076 acres. This made those farms large relative to the US
samples at the time. For the eastern US as a whole, the average of county-mean farm size was just

                                                          17
143 aces. However, the baseline (724 acres) and extended (533 acres) sample farm sizes suggest
that Pampas farms were likely large, in part, due to drier geo-climatic conditions. The US baseline
sample states are typically drier than are those included in the extended sample and farm sizes
grow larger as the climatic and terrain conditions change. They better match those in the Pampas.
       Nevertheless, Pampas farms are larger than the baseline sample of Midwest farms. Figure
3 provides histograms comparing the distribution of county/department mean farm sizes in the
Pampas and both Midwest samples. Mean farm sizes are smaller for the both the baseline (top-
left) and extended (top-right) Midwest samples, with the mean and mass of the distribution well
to the left of the Pampas on log scale. While the subset of Midwestern farms operated by owners
are larger than those operated by tenants (bottom-left), they are still smaller than Pampas farms.
Interestingly, when we look at the number of acres in agricultural production per establishment
(bottom-right), the distributions of the two regions become more similar, suggesting that the
efficient scale for growing crops was of similar size in both regions, motivating the subletting of
portions of estancias for grain production in the Pampas.

Figure 3: Farm Size Comparison




Notes: Table shows histograms of the overall distribution of average farm sizes (logged) in Argentina and the US. The
top figures are of the distribution of overall farm size including all types of farms and all land uses (farming and
ranching). In the bottom left panel, the US sample is baseline to owner-only farms. The bottom right panel shows the
distribution of the average size of cropland acres per establishment. The Argentine sample includes departments in
Cordoba, Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, and Entre Rios. The US sample on the top-right is the extended sample includes the
baseline sample as well as Nebraska, Illinois, Louisiana, and Iowa. The remaining three figures show the baseline US
sample which include counties from Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, and Missouri.



         We regress farm size (in logs) on climatic and productivity factors jointly for both regions,
using the baseline Midwest sample with results shown in Table 2. Because departments/counties
vary in size and agricultural intensity, here and for the remaining statistical analysis, we provide
three specifications using differing importance weights--none, county acres, and farm acres--to
provide a robust set of coefficients. Specifications (1) - (3) pool Argentine departments and US
counties, with farm sizes decreasing in wheat suitability and precipitation, but increasing in pasture
suitability. Specification (4) - (6) control for a country-specific fixed-effect, showing Argentine
farms are significantly larger than their US counterparts, even when controlling for geo-climatic


                                                         19
characteristics. For instance, the coefficient on ARG in (4) suggests Argentine farms are 61% larger
than US farms after controlling for geo-climatic and productivity factors.

           In Table 3, we show differential responses to geo-climatic covariates. 16 In specifications
(1) - (3) the coefficient on ARG, which is the overall farm size differential, is consistent with the
Pampas having larger farms than in the baseline Midwest sample, even after controlling for
different geo-climatic responses. Coefficients on precipitation for both countries suggest a negative
relationship between farm size and precipitation, which is consistent with literature suggesting
drier areas require larger viable farm sizes (Libecap 1993, 60; Allen and Lueck 1998, 376; Edwards
2016). Midwest farms also appears to respond to heat, rough terrain, and elevation by having larger

  An alternative regression table with farm size in levels is shown in appendix Table A3-1, and Table 3 is replicated
using the extended sample in A3-2.

farms, while Pampas farms do not appear as sensitive to these variables, suggesting rigidity in farm
size adjustments.
           In specifications (4) - (6), we focus only on the land within each county used as cropland.
These results do not show a similar size differential between the two regions, although in the
baseline Midwest sample cropland size still appears much more responsive to climate as indicated
by the statistically significant coefficients on the geo-climatic variables. Thus, while overall farm
units in the Pampas were quite large, the amount of cropland per establishment was considerably
smaller and not different from the baseline Midwest sample. These findings are consistent with the
notion that grain production in the Pampas was undertaken on rented plots carved out of larger
estates.

size of Midwest farms.

        In Figure 5, we plot the residuals from the same regression to explore state and province
specific predictions. Three results from this plot are of interest. First, the large positive residuals
in the Midwest baseline sample are exclusively in Texas, the US state in our sample with the most
influence from Spanish institutions. Second, Buenos Aires has notably high residuals and is the
province with the strongest influence of Spanish colonial property institutions. Third, Cordoba is
notable for its lack of high-residual predictions, attributable to its relative aridity (which made
larger farms more suitable for the climate) and its later settlement that may have farm size
adjustments easier.

4.4 Production Decisions
         The results from the previous section suggest that farm owners in the Pampas provinces
may have been responding to a different set of constraints, beyond geo-climatic ones, relative to
their Midwestern counterparts. To support this hypothesis, we can test directly how production
responded to climatic conditions. Figure 6 shows indicative relationships in the raw data on climate
and production that suggest Pampas farm production was similarly less responsive to on-the-
ground conditions. In the left panel, Midwestern baseline sample counties show a positive
relationship between acres in wheat and wheat suitability. In the Pampas, however, areas with
better suitability for growing wheat have fewer acres in wheat, as demonstrated by the negative
linear trend line. Similar opposite trends are observed for cattle production, where Midwest
ranchers tend to run more cattle where there is less precipitation and thus, less potential for crop
production. By contrast, farms in the Pampas, in addition to having more cattle generally, appear
to have had more cattle in wetter areas. While wetter areas can produce more forage and thus,
support more cattle, this distribution would likely crowd out other crop production, a trend we do
not observe in the Midwest. Overall, Midwest farmers appear to plant more wheat and raise fewer
cattle in wetter areas, whereas Pampas farmers comparatively raise more cattle and grew less
wheat.

Figure 6: Production Decision Scatterplots




         To examine the results statistically, we regress acres in wheat and number of cattle on geo-
climatic characteristics as well as potential yields--wheat suitability pasture suitability (in logs). 17
Specifications (1) - (3) show that while farmers in the baseline Midwest counties plant more wheat
acres as wheat suitability improves, farmers in the Pampas plant less. After controlling for geo-
climatic characteristics, Argentine farms tend to run more cattle as pasture suitability increases.
These results suggest that Argentine farms tended to specialize in ranching when suitable, even
potentially forgoing productive wheat growing regions to do so.

4.5 Tenancy
         The organization of tenant arrangements sheds more light on why farms in Argentina
remained large. Table 5 shows the results of a regression of percentage of farms rented on geo-
climatic characteristics and wheat suitability. 18 After controlling for geo-climatic characteristics,
the Pampas have a higher proportion of renters than in the baseline Midwest sample, as seen in
specifications (1) - (3). This result is consistent with the idea that tenancy was the preferred method
for large landowners to engage in cereal production in the Pampas. However, while the number of
farms rented responds positively to wheat suitability in the Midwest, the relationship is negative
for the Pampas.
         This relationship allows for a more nuanced explanation of the production regression
results, shown in Table 4. Pampas landholdings in the best wheat-growing regions are larger than
their Midwest counterparts, but the efficient scale for grain production is on smaller plots. Rather
than rent out many small plots and thereby encounter potential moral hazard and other monitoring
problems, these large landowners chose to specialize in cattle production, leading to fewer tenants
in these areas.

   An alternative regression table with total numbers of tenants (logged) is shown in appendix table A5-1, and table
5 is replicated using the extended sample in A5-2.

                                                          25
        Looking within renters, specifications (4) - (6) show the percentage of renters on a share-
based contract. The Pampas had a significantly higher proportion of cash renters. Share contracts
allow owners to create smaller farm sizes, while reducing capital constraints and sharing the risk
with tenants. In the Midwest, the relative number of share renters remains constant as wheat
suitability increases; there is no statistically different coefficient on wheat productivity than in
specifications (1) - (3) and point estimates are an order of magnitude lower. However, in the
Pampas, where overall rental levels fall as wheat suitability increases, specifications (4) - (6)
indicate that share rentals fall even more than overall rentals as wheat suitability increases.
        Accordingly, Pampas landowners underutilized share rental agreements in high-yield
wheat-growing areas relative to the Midwest. Share tenants in the US were part of the agricultural
ladder, saving earnings to eventually purchase the land they worked and aligning incentives for
improved profitability (Winters 1982, 137-143; Cheung 1969a, b). The contractual arrangement
leading to property ownership increased demand for share contracts, and share contracts are
especially appealing in areas with high yields (Alston and Kauffman 1997). In the Pampas, land
sales were more limited and tenants did not have a prospect of becoming landowners, reducing
interest in share tenancy arrangements. Further, landowners in the best growing regions would
have been the most reluctant to engage in the types of rental agreements that provided tenants with
a property interest, given that their landholdings were key to political and social status; the rental
plots were not intended for sale.

the baseline sample and includes counties from Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, and Missouri. Crane and

         All told, the empirical results are consistent with the hypotheses drawn from the qualitative
discussion in Sections (1) ­ (3) regarding the impact of different property rights allocations on the
institutional structure of agricultural production; the impact on market exchange if land ownership
conveys bundled commercial and status attributes; and the colonial origins of varying property
rights to land between the English US and Spanish Argentina.
         We find that farm sizes are larger in the Pampas, all else equal. Pampas estate owners and
their tenants are less responsive to shifting geo-climatic variables, particularly critical
precipitation. More land in the Pampas specialized in cattle raising and less in grain production
than productivity measures would suggest. Cash tenancy rather than share tenancy is more
prevalent in the Pampas.


5. Discussion: Implications for Long-run Development
         Insofar as there is an inverse relationship between farm size and productivity in the absence
of economies of scale, then large landholdings in Argentina imply productivity losses. Misaligned
incentives associated with short-term cash rent contracts contribute to moral hazard. Monitoring
costs make moral hazard feasible. One source of cost is in under investment in physical capital.
By the late 19th century, the Argentine frontier generally was closed and where land was traded,
prices were rising, motivating investment in soil. Instead, historians indicate that soil exhaustion
was occurring on tenant plots (Scobie 1964, 72-88; Scarzanella 1989, 21; Adelman 1994, 77, 133-
135, 202). Adelman references a 1900 Minister of Agriculture report on the problem of over
                                                         27
cultivation by tenants whose intensive farming was undermining long-term soil productivity
(Adelman 1994 241-249).
       As an indication of concern, owners stipulated yearly field crop rotations for wheat and
flax across the 2-3 years of a typical tenancy. Flax was a common rotation and export crop used to
diversify output, reduce weeds, and lower fertilizer and tillage. Additionally, alfalfa was to be
sowed during the last contract year to improve subsequent pasture and to reduce over-cultivation
in wheat by tenants at the end of the contract (Cortez Conde 1966; Slutzky 1968; Scarzanella 1989,
3, 5, 13; Palacio 2002).
       Contracts also included a layout of the portion of a leasehold that was to be put in crops
for the owner and in pasture, gardens, and other uses by the tenant; hours of work; when grains
should be harvested; and seed types to be planted. Owners wanted to avoid tenants harvesting too
soon when grains were still relatively green (Scarzanella 1989, 21). Equipment and buildings
belonging to the owner were to be returned in original condition at the end of the tenancy
(Scarzanella 1989, 6-7). These stipulations defined tenant responsibilities to reduce rent dissipation
for owners and they required costly monitoring and enforcement to be effective.
       Another potential cost is reduced investment in new technologies. While land owners were
aware of new seeds, planting and harvest technologies, and cattle breeds developed in Europe and
North America, the literature suggests that owners and tenants did not generally invest in them,
relying on the inherent richness of Pampa soils (Hennessy 1978, 18, 24, 83; Scobie 1964, 91-97;
Campante and Glaeser 2009, 3). Adelman (1994, 198-217; 251-255) argues that under investment
in new agricultural technology depressed long-term productivity. Crop yields were claimed to be
lower than in the US and Canada (Solberg 1971, 46). Tenants had neither incentive with short
contracts nor collateral to purchase new equipment, seeds, and other capital (Scarzanella 1989,
11). Overall, investment in technological innovation for agriculture appears to have been less
despite the role of farm exports in the country's GDP (Solberg 1987, 109-110).
       Unlike the US, there was minimal formal agricultural education and less attention to new
opportunities and agricultural prizes and competitions (Scobie 1964, 148-152; Solberg 1971, 33;
Scarzanella 1989, 21). In 1920 there were 9 agricultural experiment stations in Argentina and a
budget that had declined 69% since 1912. The US had at least one experiment station in each state
and nearly 4,000 experiment station employees, teachers, and assistants (US Department of



                                                 28
Agriculture 1922, 87). These were part of the land-grant college system designed to promote
research in agricultural innovation.
           A third area is in investment in human capital. Small farm owners in the Midwest supported
schooling for their children. The pedagogical focus was practical, pragmatic in emphasis, and
egalitarian, aimed at understanding and using new technologies. Educated farmers and their
children were better equipped to adopt new technologies, cropping changes, and shifts in market
opportunities. The Northwest Ordinance of 1785 19 created the Public Lands Survey System to
promote survey, classification and sale of government lands, also set aside section 16 of each
township for public schools (Libecap and Lueck 2011). School governance was decentralized as
a local effort with 125,000 independent school districts in America by the 1920s (Goldin 1998,
347, 351; 2001, 279; Goldin and Katz 2010; Go and Lindert 2010, 3-16). Between 1910 and 1960
enrolment and graduation rates were among the highest in Midwestern states with their
homogenous populations and wealth distributions. Using census data across states 1900 to 1940
Galor et al. (2009, 145, 172) find a significant positive relationship between the a more equal
distribution of land ownership and provision of education.
           In the Pampas landed elites were little motivated to advance education among the rural,
non-land owning labor force that could increase mobility, raising labor costs and lowering
dependence upon patrons. Moreover, mobile tenants had few incentives to invest in local schools
or school districts (Scarzanella 1989, 16, 18; Campante and Glaeser 2009, 14). Solberg (1971, 22)
claims that in the early part of the 20th century, the bulk of rural children had not attended any
school and could not read or write. Even as late as the 1940s, Taylor (1948, 316) claims that 10-
20% of rural children between the ages of 6 and 13 in the Pampas had no education. Tenants were
often illiterate, and the lack of education contributed to rural labor force with limited human capital
(Scobie 1964, 63; Scarzanella 1989, 7). Campante and Glaeser (2009, 2, 3, 10, 15, 30-33) contend
that the rural labor that migrated to Buenos Aires from the Pampas in the late 19 th and early 20th
centuries had far less education than did those who migrated to Chicago from the Midwest.
           A fourth area of potential loss is in agricultural strikes. These can be viewed as holdup by
cash tenants during key production stages in order to extract contractual changes from owners
(Klein, Crawford, and Alchian 1978). Solberg (1971, 24-30, 36) and Scarzanella (1989, 2, 12)
describe strikes by tenants in the Argentine grain belt during critical sowing and harvest periods

     Journal of Continental Congress, 28: 375, May 20, 1785.

in 1912 and 1913, 1917, 1919, and 1930. About 70,000 farm workers, two-thirds of whom held 2
to 3-year tenant contracts on plots of 150-200 hectares were involved, halting farm work and in
some cases, destroying crops (Solberg 1971, 24-26). Their efforts were coordinated by the
formation of a tenant cooperative, Federación Agraria Argentina (FAA). They withheld labor,
demanding lower rents and crop shares, longer contract tenures with a minimum of 4 years, and
later overall land ownership reform (Solberg 1971, 40-52; Scarzanella 1989, 12). There is nothing
comparable to these strikes in the US Midwest among small farmers or tenants where incentives
were more aligned. In the Pampas, cash tenants had labor contracts and as such were not residual
profit claimants.
          We lack data to assess the aggregate magnitude of the effects on overall economic growth
and welfare in Argentina over time. Together, however, this more qualitative evidence along with
the empirical results suggest potential drags on economic performance and welfare. With its rich
resource base, in 1913 Argentina was among the 10 richest countries in the world. It later stagnated
and lost its relative position.20 The 1913 measure is a mean value and the distribution of wealth in
the Pampas was far more skewed than in the Midwest United States. How much richer might
Argentina have been with a different property rights to land regime, different institutional
structures of production, and different land acquisition options and labor contracts? Our
examination indicates that the costs may have been large. These losses may have been camouflaged
by the general prosperity of the country and the desire of landed elites, who bore only a portion of
the aggregate costs, to maintain their political and social status.


6. Concluding Remarks
          We examine two similar agricultural-producing regions in terms of terrain, soil quality and
climate that produced for the same international commodity markets, the Midwestern US and the
Pampas of Argentina at the turn of the 20th century. Despite these similarities, the productive units
were very different, with small-scale farms in the Midwest relying upon family labor and share
tenants, and large estates in the Pampas relying upon short-term, cash tenant labor contracts. The
institutional structures of production were due to the exogenous colonial policies of England and
Spain that determined the allocation of property rights to land. These practices continued after
independence.

       A low transaction-cost setting would have allowed for differential property rights to be
moderated over time so that productive units would have become more similar under competitive
conditions. In the Midwest property ownership primarily brought commercial benefits, and land
markets were active. This region provides a baseline for market activity, suggested by Demsetz
(1967, 350) for comparison with the Pampas.
       In the Pampas ownership conveyed both commercial and status benefits that were difficult
to value and exchange, raising transaction costs. Available evidence indicates that large land
owners sought to maintain their social positions based on land ownership and did not generally
participate in land markets. Any price premiums offered for land apparently were not sufficiently
high to compensate for lost political and social status that could be transferred with the land across
generations. The incentive to maintain large holdings in the Pampas also influenced the selection
of cash tenancy over share tenancy, despite potential greater moral hazard.
       Agriculture has been a critical component of the Argentine economy and is fundamental in
most developing societies. The broader issue of overall lagging economic outcomes in Spanish
versus English colonial areas has long attracted the attention of historians, economic historians
and development economists (Engerman and Sokoloff; Sokoloff and Engerman; Acemoglu et al.;
Keefer and Vlaicu 2007; Campante and Glaeser; North et al. 2009; Acemoglu and Robinson 2012).
       This literature emphasizes endogenous factors affecting Latin America more broadly:
factor endowments that encouraged large-scale, extractive production; local disease environments
that limited European immigration; and dense native populations that supported use of coerced
indigenous labor. Argentina, however, was not characterized by any of these factors. It did share,
however, exogenous property rights allocations to large owners as the basis the hierarchical
assignment of political, social, and economic status across generations. This bundling of land
values inhibited the development land and capital markets and the productivity and general welfare
gains they can provide.

departments in Cordoba, Buenos Aires, Santa Fe, and Entre Rios. US sample is the extended sample and includes
counties from Iowa, Illinois, Nebraska, Louisiana, Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, Arkansas, and Missouri. Crane and
Loving counties in the US state of Texas report no tenancy in the 1910 census and therefore 764 of the 766 possible
