                  Monopoly Wealth and International Debt



                                ABSTRACT



     When rents generated by government policies are perceived as
permanent, the rights to earn them may be capitalized as assets
that form a component of nonhuman wealth. The existence of such

assets raises international indebtedness, while shifts in policy
that increase or reduce the importance of such rents can generate
movements in the current account that are correlated with the
real exchange rate. Because the elimination of policies that
generate rents imposes a capital loss that is born entirely by
generations currently alive, while the benefit of the removal of
a distortion is shared between those alive and unborn

generations, a possibility is that such a reform can reduce the
expected lifetime welfare of everyone alive. If monopoly exists
in the provision of nontraded goods then there may be several
steady states that can be Pareto ranked.

       The effects of rents created by government policies have
been a major concern of the theory of political economy in the
last decade. This work follows from Tullock's (1967) and
Krueger's (1974) seminal concept of rent seeking as a
resource—using activity that provides access to rents in the

economy. Because this activity in itself absorbs productive
resources, the consequences of rent—creating policies can go far
beyond their direct allocative and redistributional effects.1
       The analysis of this paper takes as its point of departure
the observation that entitlements to rents created by government
policy can be capitalized in asset values. The presence of these
assets as a form of nonhuman wealth can therefore have
significant implications for the dynamic behavior of the economy.
In particular, by displacing other forms of wealth in national

portfolios, the existence of monopoly can increase international

indebtedness.

    Bhagwati and Srinavasan (1980) and Bhagwata (1982) have
introduced the related notions of revenue seeking and
directly-unproductive—profit (DUP) seeking and examine their
implictions for a number of issues in the theory of commercial
policy. Other important contributions to the literature are by
Brock and Magee (1978,1980), Buchanan, Tullock and Tollison
(1980), Findlay and Wellisz (1982), and Hillman and Riley (1987).
Tollison (1982) and Bhagwati, Brecher, and Srinivasan (1984)
provide overviews of work in the area. This literature, to my
knowledge, has not considered the implications of rents for
capital accumulation.

     The portfolio implications of monopoly rents have received
little attention. An important exception is Laitner's (1982)
analysis of the effect of monopoly on the capital stock in an

overlapping generations economy. Laitner shows, in a closed
economy, that the presence of capitalized monopoly rents reduces

welfare in steady state by displacing capital in individualst
portfolios, and that this effect may quantitatively overwhelm the
cost arising from static resource misallocation.2
     The analysis here concerns the implications of domestic
monopoly for the current account and for foreign indebtedness. A
particular reason for this focus is to illustrate the effect on
foreign debt of policies that affect the size of rents generated
in the economy. Governments in a number of the large debtor
countries have pursued policies that appear to create significant
rents domestically.

     Indonesia provides an example. A common practice has been
to grant monopolies to importers as well as to domestic producers
of a number of industrial commodities. In 1985, for example, of

5229 coomodity classification numbered items, importation of 1484
were restricted to holders of government licenses.   (Only 296




2Mitchell (1987) has recently analyzed the implications of the
capitalization of rents created by an import quota for trade and
production patterns.

        A second and
                       closely related C0flC1US1O is that
   liberalization of
                       monopoly will cause a current account
                                                               surplus.
    The extent to Which the surplus
                                     precedes rather than follows the
   liberalization depends
                            upon how long it is anticipated
         This result provides an explanation
                                               for the negative
   correlation between the
                             real exchange rate and the current
  account that has been observed for
                                         example, by Sachs (1981). An
  increase in
                monopolization of domestic
                                            supply raises the domestic
  prIce level relative to that elsewhere.
                                              This IS reflected in an
 appreciation of the real
                             exchange rate. At the same time,

 Outflow.

      A third conclusion is that the
                                     capitalization of monopoly
 rents can create
                  a constituency in favor of
                                             monopoly that, in the
 extreme consists of all of those alive.
                                             Hence majoritari
 decision_making can introduce or Sustain
                                            monopoly despite the
 distortion it creates
                          The reason is that
                                              the capital loss
 associated with
                 liberalization is born
                                         solely by the living while
 the benefit of
                removing the distortion is
                                             shared between the
living and the unborn.
                         Monopoly acts in part as an unfunded
social security system. This result
                                       Illustrates the extent to
which the capitalization of
                             monopoly rents can augment Opposition
to reform.

    As mentioned, the results stated so far
                                            apply to an economy

                                  preferences toward commodities
correspond to that posited by Dixit and Stiglitz
                                                  (1977), which
has been which has been used
                             extensively in modelling
international trade under
                          conditions of imperfect competition7

 at size one.

      While alive, individuals earn a constant wage w. Individual
 nonhuman wealth takes the form of claims on firms, or direct
 claims on capita]. or land. The value of a firm is in turn

 determined by the value of land and capital that it owns and the

 present discounted value of the current and anticipated future
 rents to which it has claim. Since there is no uncertainty, with

 perfect foresight portfolio arbitrage will ensure that each asset
 pays a return r*. As in Yaari's and Blanchard's
                                                   analysis, a
perfectly competitive annuities market is assumed to exist. An
individual can consequently earn a return r*+A by promising to

transfer his nonhuman assets to an insurer at his death.

     The problem S formulated in continuous time.    I first focus
on the stationary case in which world commodity prices, the world
interest rate, the endowments of land and labor, and inonoooly
prices and profits are constant. In period t, an individual s
with nonhuman wealth W chooses an expenditure level c to
maximize:

       Since any individual's consumption is proportional to his
  total (nonhuman PIUS human) wealth, aggregate consumption
                                                                            is
  proportional to total national wealth.            Since nonhuman wealth
 earns a social return r*, the equation of motion for national
 nonhuman wealth    is given by:



               dW = r*W    + w -
                                   C.
                                         =
                                             (r*_4)w   +   (1-—).
         In steady state aggregate wealth is constant so that
 dwt =   0.   Nonhuman wealth      in steady state is consequently:


                          —N
                          w —          r*_o
                                (r*+A)(6_r*+cAJ W

while    aggregate expenditure      is:


                 —   ______________ —
                     (o+r*+)(r*±AT           (6_r*+GA)(r*÷AT W.


     Note that, since factor prices are
                                        independent of the
presence of monopoly, both         and        are independent of p or 27:
The presence of monopoly in domestic supply does not

steady—sa level of expenditure or of national wealth as
jeasure in world prices.

     Domestic monopoly causes the domestic price level to exceed
the world price level, however.          Consequently, in terms of
consumers prices, the steady—state levels of consumption and
                                                                        16

  III. Liherpljzptipn and the Current Account


       Consider now the consequences of a permanent

 in the form of the removal of domestic

 period o. For

                                                        but at
 this time it becomes a certainty.

      Liberalization does not affect factor prices or the level

                           are unity from then on. The value of

 nonhuman wealth to consumers alive in period 0, denoted, J(W0,O)

  is the solutiOn to the dynamic programming problem:
                                                         19

               J(W010) = max   [f




 subject to:



                     dwt = (r*+A    )W + w
                                             -

 and the initial endowment of nonhuman
                                       wealth W0. This problem
 has as its Solution:



                  J(W010)


where 4 is defined as above.
                                Optimal behavior in period t is to
consume a proportion 4 of
                            (Wt+H).
     Since the reform has no implications for steady—state
national wealth, if the reform is completely unanticipated (T=O)
and the economy is initially in steady state, then reform does
not change national wealth transitionally, either. When it

occurs it simply eliminates that part of foreign indebtedness

corresponding to foreign ownership of domestic monopolies.
     If reform is expected, however, then the anticipated change

in relative prices will affect domestic saving. The value of

wealth in period t, denoted J'(Wt,t), tE[T,O), is the Solution to
the problem:
                                                        20

which is solved by:



            c = 4[g(p)(     fl/Oe4t   (le4t)]l(Wt+H).

  reform is implemented a deficit
                                  reduces wealth back to its

      The ambiguity in the response derives from the
                                                     conflicting
 income and substitution effects of the relative price

 The reform raises the real value of expected lifetime
                                                       income for
 the typical individual. This income effect favors
                                                    increased
 consumption during the period prior to the reform. The reform
 also raises the real value of a given level of
                                                expenditure at
 world prices in the post—reform period relative to the pre—reform
 period. This substitution effect favors Postponing
                                                    consumption
 until after the reform. The
                             relative strengths of the two
 effects depend on whether

B.   j'he Wealth Effect



     Consider now the implications of reform for national wealth
when monopolies are wholly nationally_owned. To treat
                                                        this
effect in isolation from the relative—price effect just
discussed, it is convenient to set a=1. For concreteness

consider the case in which, before the reform, all industrial
commodities are monopolisticajly supplied and n-..

     From an initial steady state with monopoly, the
                                                     announcement
of a reform reduces the value of shares in monopolies from
                                                               22

                                              +
                     dwt =     {r*_(ã+A)]Wt

      The value of nonhuman wealth
                                                 for this
 of the reform, T' provides an initial conditOfl
 differential equation. The solution is:


                       =
                           (WT
                                   -   err)              ÷




 where
                               — =-     (5_r*)W



 which is the steady—state velue of nonhuman wealth.
         The value of nonhuman wealth immediately following
  announcement of the reform, T' is given by:
                                                                         23



                 —
          WT =       - q—   +                  0
                                                         (r*+A)(T_t)
                                      )(a+fT (Wt-f)e                   dt,


 the value of nonhuman wealth
                              in steady state, less the initial
 steady—state value of monopoly
                                profits, plus the value of
 monopoly profits until the reform.

      Substituting the solution for W. into this expression
 implies that:



                                           qe (r*+A )T
                 T
                                —     (r*+A)       (l_e(ö+2A)T)
                                    (+H) (5+2A)


      If reform is totally
                                    unanticipated (T=0) then the drop in
wealth upon announcement is simply .                As the length of the
period of anticipation
                                approaches infinity (T-.oo) the effect on
wealth goes to zero.

     The announcement of reform causes an immediate decline in
nonhi.unan wealth that is followed by a current account surplus

that gradually restores wealth to its initial
                                              steady—state level.
At the time that reform
                        actually takes place, the deviation of
wealth from its steady state level is a fraction e (6+A -r*) T
                                                                              of
the initial wealth loss.
                                    Hence the longer the reform is
anticipated, the less effect it has Ofl national wealth or on the
current account in any period.
    The effect of increasing
                                       monopoly restrictions is, of

        The discussion up to this point has
                                                posited that the number
  of Commodities freely traded
                                internationally is sufficient for
  international commodity prices to determine
                                                factor rewards
  independently of domestic market Cofiditions
                                                  Introducing
  nontraded goods can break this independence,
                                                 thereby introducing
  the Possibility of multiple equilibrj,
                                           some of which strictly
 dominate others in terms of Pareto
                                      efficiency.
       To illustrate this
                          PossibIlIty, consider flow a situation in
 which legal prohibitions or natural barriers
                                                prevent trade in
 industrial commodities, but the agricultur

traded. For
             concreteness continue to assume that all industrial
commodities are
                monopolistically supplied and that the number of
such commodities is large.
       In the absence of
                        international arbitrage opportunities for
 industrial commodities, the cost of production
                                                will typically
differ from the world
                       price of unity. Denote the unit cost of
production as a           of factor rewards as a(w,r*,p).
Monopolistic suppliers who take their rivals'
                                               output prices and
factor costs as given will establish a
                                        price:


                           p =    a(w,r*,p)/9

                           industrial commodities are nontraded,
     Since, by assumptions
                                                  domestic demand

 loss on land by

 monopoly rents. With such a transfer scheme in effect a movement
 from the low to the high—wage equilibrium constitutes

 is greater or less in the
                           high—wage steady state relative to the
 low—wage one. At the higher wage national wealth is greater, but

 SO, typically, is the value of domestic
                                            wealth. (The amount of
 capital and the value of
                             monopoly rents are higher, but land is
worth less.)




VI. Extensions


     To focus attention on
                           several basic points I have made a
number of specific assumptions about the nature of the

environment under consideration
     First, I have ignored potential
                                        credit rationing and default
on international debt. For one thing, introducing these
considerations would break the independence between domestic
monopoly and the level of domestic
                                     investment even in the absence
of nontraded goods.
                      Capitalized monopoly rents would displace

domestic savings as a source of investment. ConseqUefltlY
                                               capital stock and
presence of domestic monopolY would reduce the

mitigates the cost of monopoly.
     Second, there has been no discussion here of the
                                                       about

      Finally, and perhaps of greatest potential

monopoly across the Population. The discussion

Popularity of liberalization
                              pointed to this distribution as
affecting whether voters would favor or
                                         oppose liberalization.
The distribution of assets in the
                                  economy is consequently not
neutral even though, when a given
                                  policy is in place, all assets
earn the same rate of return.

       Combining these cOnditions with the budget constraint


                     p1c+ (m-1)cM + (n—m)cF =   cxC




 provides   an expression for c given by:



             -
             —                      aC/p.

 Substituting this expression into the expression for retailer l's
 profit above gives:



                               aC(p. —1)/p.




     Combining the first-order Condition for a maximum with the
condition that, in a symmetric equilibri, all monopolistic

retailers charge the same price (so that p1 =
                                               M) implies that
the price charged by a monopolistic retailer is determined
                                                           by the
expression:



 (n_m)(pM)O/(9) +m = (pM 1)[9/(l 9)][(          MO/(l_O)     +   rn-i].

     The two special cases reported in the text are obtained
                                                             by
