                      EXPLAINING THE VARIANCE OF PRICE DIVIDEND RATIOS


                                               ABSTRACI
      This paper presents a bound on the variance of the price-dividend ratio
and   a   decomposition     of   the   variance    of     the   price-dividend      ratio    into
components     that   reflect variation     in    expected      future   discount    rates    and
variation in expected        future    dividend    growth.      Unobserved discount         rates
needed    to   make   the   variance   bound     and    variance   decomposition      hold    are
characterized, and the variance bound and variance decomposition are tested
for several discount rate models, including the consumption based model, and
models based on interest rates plus a constant risk premium.
