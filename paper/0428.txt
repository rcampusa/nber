                           Savings and Taxation


                                ABSTRACT


        The way in which taxes affect savings behavior has attracted much

recent attention.     It is highly relevant to the debate over reform of the

personal tax system and the merits of an expenditure tax.     In this paper,

the efficiency arguments for and against an expenditure tax are examined and

the "optimal" tax rates calculated.    Not only are these tax rates very sen-

sitive to parameter values, but the interest elasticity of savings appears to

be of only marginal significance in determining the most efficient tax struc-

ture.    Within the framework of the simple model analysed in the paper, the

strongest arguments for an expenditure tax are the failure to index the income

tax base for inflation and the existence of unfunded pension schemes.

          The way in which taxes affect savings behaviour has

attracted much recent attention both theoretically and

empirically.      Developments in the theory of optimal

taxation and econometric studies of the role of interest rates

in the consumption function have stimulated thinking in this

area, and both are highly relevant to issues currently at

the centre of policy debate about tax reform.       'In 1978 the

Meade Committee published a lengthy and detailed Report

analysing the failures of the British tax system, and

recommended that it be converted gradually into a personal
expenditure tax.    (Meade Committee 1978).

          One of the most instructive features of the Report was

that it did not rely on the traditional arguments for an

expenditure tax (that expenditure is a more just tax base than

income, and that an expenditure tax avoids the efficiency

losses associated with the double taxation of savings implied

by an income tax), but instead based its case on more practical

grounds.     The present tax system is neither an    income tax nor

an expenditure tax, and its problems stem from this hybrid

nature.     The real case for an expenditure tax, so the argument

runR, is that an expenditure tax would be much simpler to

operate than a pure income tax, and indeed that the latter would
                                                                  -2-




be almost infeasible(for a detailed examination of these

arguments the reader is referred to Meade Committee (1978)

and Kay and King(1978)).,    Similar propositions have been put

forward in the US by the report of the US Treasury (1977) and

in Sweden by Lodin (1978).

       Although the Meade Committee's Report does not contain

an evaluation of the efficiency arguments, it does not reject

these as potentially insignificant; rather, the compelling

arguments for a change lie elsewhere.      Nevertheless, it is

clearly important to assess the efficiency gains or losses

which might be involved in any major reform.      In this paper we

shall try to explore, in the context of a very simple model,

the efficiency arguments for and against an expenditure tax,

and to assess some recent claims that the welfare gains from

abolishing capital income taxes would be very large.

       In section 1 we examine the optimal taxation of capital

and labour incomes in a simple growth model and derive formulae

for the optimal tax rates.     These are used in section 2 to

evaluate claims that abolishing capital income taxes would

lead to large welfare gains.      Inflation is introduced in

section 3, and alternative approaches to modelling savings

behaviour are discussed in Section 4.     Finally, we look briefly

at some of the empirical evidence on the effects of taxes on

savings.

       Our analysis will be highly simplified.      We shall ignore

many of the issues stressed by the Meade Committee, such as the

complex interaction between personal and corporate taxation, the
                                                              -3-




sheer diversity of tax rates currently imposed on different

forms of saving, and the portfolio aspects of personal saving.

The relationship between expenditure on durab1es and saving

and the effect of social security on consumption will also be

left to one side.   We shall say little about the production

side of the economy, and for surveys of the effects of taxes

on investment the reader is referred to He11iwe11 (1976),

King (1977), and von Furstenberg and Ma1kie1 (1977).

Despite these omissions the model captures the essential

features necessary to an evaluation of the efficiency arguments.

1.   The Optimal Taxation of Savings



       The optimum taxation of savings, or equivalently,

capital income, has long been the subject of debate by

economists in terms of the choice of the tax base.      Both a

comprehensive income tax, in which capital income is taxed

at the same rate as labour income, and an    expenditur~   tax,

in which capital income is not taxed at all, have fervent

supporters and even more fervent opponents.     With the

development of the theory of optimal indirect taxation, i t

is natural to apply the results of these theoretical

investigations to the problem of intertemporal choice.

       Ramsey's (1927) classic paper on optimal commodity

taxes did discuss this question, and he concluded that capital

income should be taxed at lower rates than labour income but

should not be exempt from tax altogether.      But only very

recently have economists tackled this question in more detail

and at this early stage it is perhaps not surprising that

"the subject remains clouded in confusion"    (Feldstein, 1978 a)

Before examining a formal model we may relate the question to

two traditional arguments often deployed in favour of an

expenditure tax as opposed to an income tax.

      A frequent argument in favour of an expenditure tax is

that it is more "just" to tax someone on the value of what he

takes out of society in terms of the goods and services he
                                                               -5-


consumes, than on the value of what he contributes to society,

whether in the form of wage income in return for labour

services or capital income in return for the supply of capital

services.      It is common to cite the quotation of Hobbes

popularised by Kaldor,

         "What reason is there, that he which laboureth much

and sparing the fruit of his labour, consumeth little, should

be more charged, than he that liveth idly, getteth little,

and spendeth all he gets: seeing the one hath no more

protection from the commonwealth than the other?" (Hobbes,

1651)

         Unfortunately this quotation from Hobbes seems to

have been misunderstood by many.      First, there is simply

no obvious reason for believing that a tax on actual

consumption is more just than a tax on potential consumption.

Is it just to treat a disabled beggar and a wealthy miser in

the same way?      Secondly, Hobbes' example is misleading.

The reason for the unfairness is that one individual enjoys

a good deal of leisure ('liveth idly" while his neighbour

"laboureth much") and this is not reflected in his tax pay-

ments.      But this has nothing to do with the distinction

between income and consumption.      Under an expenditure tax,

the man who had worked hard, saved, and wanted to spend his

money at some point in the future would face a heavy tax

liability.      Both an income tax and an expenditure tax fail

to tax leisure and so provide a disincentive to work effort.

Unless we believe that lump-sum taxes are feasible there is
                                                              -6-



 nothing we can do about this.    In assessing the economic

 effect of alternative systems of taxing capital income we

 must not overlook the efficiency loss involved in the

 distortion of the work-leisure choice.

       Another traditional argument often used to advance the

 cause of an expenditure tax is that an income tax is

 inefficient because it gives rise to the "double taxation of

 savings".    With an expenditure tax the rate of tax on

 consumption is (for a given rate schedule) the same regard-

 less of the year in which the individual chooses to consume.

 An income tax, on the other hand, reduces the rate of return

 on personal savings below the market rate of interest.      This

 produces an efficiency loss because, so the argument runs,

 the market rate of interest is equal to the rate of return on

 investment and hence the income tax places a wedge between

 the intertemporal rates of substitution in consumption and

 transformation in production.

       But the market rate of interest may not be equal to the

 rate of return on investment, and one of the principal causes

 of a divergence here is the corporate tax system.   The

 effects of the corporate tax system on the cost of capital

 are important to an evaluation of the efficiency loss

 resulting from an income tax, and it is possible to design

 a corporate tax system which largely offsets the effects of

 income tax (fora detailed discussion of this, see King (1977)

chapter 8).   In this paper, however, we shall assume that the

pre-tax rate of interest equals the marginal product of capital.



                ;
                                                                 -7-



       Even if an income tax did produce substantial

intertemporal inefficiency, standard "second-best" arguments

suggest that this is not an overwhelming argument for an

expenditure tax.     The "optimal" tax on income from savings

will take into account both intertemporal inefficiency and

also the static welfare loss arising from the distortion of

the work-leisure choice by both income and expenditure taxes

which was discussed above.

       To explore this issue formally we shall begin by

considering a simple two-period model similar to that

analysed by Samuelson (1958), Diamond (1965), and, in the

context of taxes, by Atkinson and Sandmo (1979) ,and Auerbach (1978) (1)   We

shall make the following assumptions

1)   Each individual lives for two periods.      They work in

     period 1, supplying L units of labour (the length of the

     period is normalised to unity), and retire in period 2.

     They consume in both periods and all individuals within

     a generation are identical (thus we ignore the problem

     of distribution within a generation).      Preferences are

     described by the direct utility function.



                                                                 (1)

     where C. is per capita consumption in the i         period of

     life.

2)   There are no bequests and saving in period 1        is solely

     to provide consumption in period 2.      The taxation of
                                                                      -8-



     bequests is discussed further in the paper by Atkinson

     in this volume.

3)   In any given period two overlapping          ge~ations   are alive.

     There is a constant growth rate of population n and so

     the younger generation is larger than the elder by a

     fraction I + n.            There is no technical progress, and

     there is steady-state growth at the rate n.

4)   Output is given by the following constant returns to

     scale production function, and for convenience we

     assume that capital does not depreciate.



       Y   =L   N f       (k)                                               (2 )




     where k is capital per man-hour, N is the number of

     workers, and Y is total output p

       As far as the tax system is concerned, we shall assume

that lump-sum taxes are infeasible and that the government

imposes' 'pr'o'p'ortional taxes on labour and capital incomes at

at the rates t
                  w and t r respectively.       Of course, some lump-

sum taxation is feasible but we shall suppose that there is

a limit to the amount which can be raised by this means,

and the government's revenue requirement may therefore be

regarded in what follows as net of lump-sum taxes.              To

simplify the analysis we shall also ignore non linear tax

schedules,

       If we denote the pre-tax values of the wage rate by

wand the interest rate by r, we may write the individual,'s

                                                                 )             (3)




where the price of second-period consumption is defined by


                      1
                                                                               (4 )
          1    + (1 - t r ) r

The term on the right-hand side of (3) is exogenous income,

sometimes known as "full" income.

      The first-order conditions for an individual maximising

(1) subject to (3) are (where U. denotes the partial
                                          J.

derivative of U with respect to argument i)




         = h                                                                   (5 )

      The solution to equations (3),             (5) and (6) describes

individual behaviour as a function of factor prices and the

tax rates imposed by government.

      The steady-state level of capital per head is given

by the equilibrium condition that planned investment equals

planned savings.              Net investment equals the savings of

the generation at work minus the dissavings of the retired

(which equals the existing capital stock because the retired

leave no bequests).                Hence



      n k L     =       (1 - t w )w L                kL                             (7)


therefore from (3)


      (l   +   n)       k L    =                                                    (8)



      We shall assume that the government wishes to raise a

fixed amount of revenue each period equal to an amount g

per worker.             The government's budget constraint is given by



      g    =    t
                    w
                        wL +                                                        (9 )



      The government chooses values of the two tax rates to

maximise its objective function subject to the constraints

implied by (3),           (5),     (6),   (8) and (9).      There are two

aspects to this decision.                  The first 'is that relative tax

burdens imposed on wage and interest income will reflect the

need to balance the distortions in individual work-leisure and

present-future consumption choices.                      Equations (5) and (6)

show how the tax rates introduce a wedge between factor

prices and rates of substitution.                   This is the standard

efficiency argument underlying the theory of optimal taxation.

But there is a second aspect to the government's decision

problem which arises from the dynamic nature of the model,

and which has profound implications for the analysis of the

welfare effects of capital income taxation.                      From equation
                                                                      -11-




(8) we can see that one of the effects of taxation is to

influence the equilibrium level of capital per man-hour.

This determines the path of consumption over time.

Individuals in          our model are concerned only with their own

consumption, and ignore future generations.             In contrast,

we shall assume         that the government takes a view about

intergenerationalequity.             As yet we have not specified the

government's objective function, and the precise form we

adopt will determine the optimal path of consumption over

time.        A natural specification in a steady-state framework

is that the government maximises the steady-state level of

utility.        The level of capital intensity which maximises

this objective function is given by the well-known "golden

rule" condition that the marginal product of capital equals

the growth rate.



        f'    (k)   =   n                                                    (10)



        If the government has no policy instruments other than

the two tax rates then in general' it will be unable to

achieve the golden rule condition, and the optimal tax rates

will reflect the trade-off between not only the conventional

efficiency losses but also between these and the losses

reSUlting from the failure to achieve the dynamic optimality

condition (10).             We shall see below that the optimal tax

rate on capital income is very sensitive to this second factor.

This is rather disturbing because it alerts us to the



                    /
                                                                     -12-




pO$sibility that our conclusions are sensitive to the

assumptions we make about poliqy instruments which are

excluded from the model.        ~or   example, if the government

could use debt policy to determine the rate of interest in

the economy, it could attain the golden rule and the. optimal

tax rates would be independent of dynamic considerations.

Clearly, the welfare implications of particular tax

changes (such as the replacement of the income tax by a

consumption    ~ax)   depend upon the constraints which are, or

are not, assumed to restrict the use of other policy

instruments.      Although this is a standard "second-best"

argument, it is very important to note that one of the

principal sources of disagreement over the potential

welfare gains from tax reform is not differing assumptions

about the behavioural responses to taxes, but the assumptions

(often implicit) made about other policy instruments.           We

shall see examples of this below.

     It will obviously be interesting to solve the general

problem in which the only policy instruments available to

government are the two tax rates, and in which tax-induced

changes in capital intensity are taken into account.           But

we shall begin by tackling the much simpler problem in

which the level of capital per man-hour is taken as a

parameter (perhaps because the government can manipulate its

level by other policies) and fixed exogenously at k        =   k.

This determines the levels of the wage and interest rates which,

in a perfectly .competitive economy, are



                 ;
                                                                    -13-




      w    =      f(k) - k f' (k)                                         (11)



      r   =   f' (k)                                                      (12)



      The government will choose the 'values of the two tax

rates to maximise the steady-state of utility subject to (a)

individual optimising behaviour, and (b) its own budget

constraint, taking the values of w, rand k as parameters

of the problem.             One reason for exploring this problem first

is that we may exploit the properties of its solution to

solve the more complicated problem in a rather simple manner.

Partly for this purpose, and partly for reasons of elegance,

we shall find it easier to work with the indirect utility

function which corresponds to (1), and which we may denote

by (normalising such that the price of first-period

      This equation explains the relative tax burdens imposed on

wage and interest income.                        The absolute value of the tax

rates will depend also on the size of the government's

revenue requirement.

      In the special case when the government can use policies

such as debt finance to attain the golden rule with r                        =    n,

the optimal "second-best" tax rates are given by




                                                                                        (21)



      In this case, dynamic considerations disappear and the

optimal tax rates reflect only the compensated demand

elasticities of leisure and future consumption.                          If we

restrict ourselves for the moment to an examinati.on of (21),

is there any presumption for an expenditure tax rather than

an income tax on efficiency grounds?                       An expenditure tax

(which corresponds to t
                                    r

                                                              (22)



This result was first proved, in a different context, by

Corlett and Hague (1953).

    It is possible to show (after some manipulation of

equations (AI) to (AB»    that for   (22) to hold then more

generally



                                                              (23)



    This equation says that the necessary condition for an

expenditure tax to be optimal is that a compensated change

in the wage rate leads to equal proportionate changes in

first-period consumption, in second-period consumption, and

in labour supply.   This requires that the ratio of

consumption in the two periods is independent of the wage

rate.   Although this may appear a not implausible

specification of preferences, there is no a priori reason

for adopting it and little empirical evidence to enable us

to test the hypothesis.     Indeed, equation (22) should warn us

that if we are to· use empirical evidence to assess the

optimality of an expenditure tax, we must be very careful not

to assume (implicitly) the truth of (22) but to allow the

data to choose whether or not to reject the hypothesis that
the utility function satisfies (22).      Unfortunately, many

common specifications of the individual utility function

imply (22) and so cannot be used to provide independent

evidence about the value of the relevant elasticities.

    Consider for example, the Cobb-Douglas indirect utility

function

                   a               a
                       l               2
               h               x
    V    =                                                                           (24)
                       Y

where x       = w(l                - t
                                           w
                                               )

    The Cobb-Douglas form lies behind much empirical work

on the life cycle hypothesis and the aggregate consumption

function because it implies that current consumption is a

constant fraction of lifetime income.

    From (3),                      (14) and (15) the demand functions are



    C = (1
     l                     -       a
                                       l

                                                   2
                                                                                     (25)


              ~y
    C     =                                                                          (26)

                                                                                     (27)



    It is clear from these equatiohs that the Cobb-Douglas

specification implies a number of special properties.                              First,

consumption in period 1 is a constant fraction of the value

of the consumer's endowment.                             Secondly, savings are a

constant fraction of the value of the consumer's endowment

(from (26)) and hence, in this model, are independent of the

interest rate.                             Finally, the assumption that the endowment

consists of potential labour supply"in the first period means
                                                                           -18-




that actual labour supply will be constant and independent of

factor prices.

    Inverting the equations (AI) to (A4), and solving for

the values of the compensated demand elasticities we have

(noting that in this model a change in x implies an equal

change in y)



           = a1 - I                                                        (28)



    a 2L   = a2                                                            (29)


               -a       a
                    1       2
    a L2   =                                                               (30)
               1    -   a
                            2

    aLL    = a2                                                            (31)



    In this case it is clear that an expenditure tax is

optimal.           It is equally clear that empirical investigations

into the value of the elasticities based upon the assumption

of a Cobb-Douglas utility function (or any other function

satisfying (22»                 would provide no evidence on the question.

We shall discuss the empirical evidence on savings and

taxation below, but we may note that the values of the optimal

tax rates depend upon the cross-elasticities of saving with

respect to the wage rate and labour supply with respect to the

interest rate.                   Typically, empirical studies ignore these

elasticities.                   Suppose the cross-elasticities are zero,

       Typical values of the own price-elasticities are

aLL    = 0.4,          0

                                    =    -1.2, and we may take the growth rate over

a generation to be unity.

Hence

       If the tax rate on labour income is one-third (to meet

the revenue requirements), the value of the tax on capital

income is also one-third, and a comprehensive income tax

is optimal.                        The choice between alternative tax bases is

very sensitive to estimates of the relevant elasticities,

and equally "plausible" values for the parameters have very

different implications for tax policy.

       It is not difficult to imagine econometric studies

producing point estimates which could be used to justify

either an expenditure tax or a comprehensive income tax.

A few more examples will illustrate the point.                                 Let us

retain the assumption that the cross-elasticities are

zero and that the tax rate on labour income is one-third.

If the value of                      0            is only -0.8 instead of -1.2 then the
                                         22
optimal capital income tax rate is 50 per cent.                                 But if

0
    22 remains at -1.2 and the estimate of aLL is revised
downwards to 0.2, the capital income tax rate is only one-




                               /
                                                                                 -20-




sixth, exactly one-half the tax rate on labour income.                           If

we now relax             the assumption that the cross-elasticities are

zero and take 0L2              =   -0.3, and 02L   =   0.25, and hold 0LL and

022 at their original values,the optimal tax rate on capital

income turns out to be 10 per cent.                     A value of 02L greater

than 0LL would imply that capital income should be subsidised.

All of which goes to show that to base policy recommendations

on econometric estimates of the elasticities one must be

confident that the standard errors of the estimates are small.

      Equation (21) gives the optimal                  ~elative   tax rates on

capital and labour income.                 Their absolute values depend

upon the revenue requirement.                 Suppose the share of capital

income in national income is c and that the government's

revenue requirement as a fraction of the national income is
g,   then



     c t
            r
                + (1 -    c)   t
                                   w = g                                         (34)



     The value of c will in general depend upon the tax rates

(except in the special case of a Cobb-Douglas production

function) and (32) and (34) are the two implicit equations

determining the values of the two tax rates.

      In this section we have concentrated on the distortions

caused by taxes to individual choices.                     But a very important

effect of capital taxes is their impact on the aggregate level

of savings and it is to this that we now turn.

2.   Taxation and Aggregate Savings



     In the previous section we examined the optimality of

the tax system in terms of its distortion of individual

choices between work and leisure and between present and

future consumption.     We saw that in the light of our present

knowledge about the values of the relevant elasticities this

analysis provides little by way of clear-cut recommendations

to' policy-makers.    But one of the arguments often employed

by proponents of an expenditure tax is that such a tax would

raise aggregate savings.    To explore this issue we must

analyse the optimal tax structure when the level of capital

per head is allowed to vary in the model.     In this section

we shall assume that k is' endogenous and that the government

does not have access to policy instruments, such as debt,

which would enable it to attain the golden rule growth path.

     At first sight it seems that the case in which k is

variable is considerably more complicated than the fixed-k

case of section 1.    But this is not so.    From (16) we see

that k enters into the constrained maximisation problem asa

parameter, and so by the envelope theorem the first-order

condition for the fixed-k case is also a first-order

condition for the variable-k case provided it is evaluated at

the optimal value of k.    Hence the optimal tax rates in the

general case are given by equation (20) where the value of r

is the optimal value and would be expected to exceed n because

of the failure of each generation to take into account the
                                                                                                         -22-




welfare of future generations.                                            By appealing to the envelope

theorem we may solve the general problem by tackling first the

more restricted case examined above. (6)

        In the case when the government can achieve the golden

rule path by the use of other policy instruments, we have

argued that there is no presumption for either an income tax

or an expenditure tax since seemingly plausible estimates of

the parameters could be used to defend either tax system.                                                 The

question at issue here is whether allowing for the response

of aggregate savings to taxes shifts the balance of the

argument in favour of an expenditure tax.                                                  This is equivalent

to asking if the optimal tax formula in the general case

(equation 20) is more favourable to an expenditure tax than

in the restricted golden-rule case (equation 21).                                                 Rearranging

these formulae and denoting the golden-rule regime by

superscript 1 and the variable-k case by superscript 2 we have

        These equations                            do not determine the tax rates because

the absolute values of the rates will depend also upon the

revenue requirement and the assumptions made about the

production side of the economy.                                                      But it can easily be seen

that if there is no presumption for low tax rates on capital

income in the golden rule case this is even more true of the

general case.                             The following verbal argument illustrates

this.               Suppose that the compensated demand                                       elastic~ties             (and

hence both               p    and e) are constants.                                     In regime 2 the output

per man hour is lower than in regime I                                                    (because r exceeds n)

and so to meet the fixed revenue requirement the average tax

rate must be higher than in the golden rule case.                                                            If the

second regime is to be characterised by a lower ratio of the

tax rate on capital income to the tax rate on labour income,
                                                                       2                                         I
then the absolute value of t                                                   must exceed that of t                 (because
                                                                   w                                         w

values of the capital income tax rate.                This suggests that

allowing for the endogeneity of aggregate savings does not

in itself provide a strong argument for an expenditure tax.

Of course, it must be stressed that none of these results

support high tax rates on capital income.                They merely

emphasize that the structure of the " optimal"tax system is

very sensitive indeed to the precise values of the relevant

elasticities.

        It would, however, be wrong to conclude from this

discussion that allowing for the response of aggregate savings

is quantitatively unimportant.                To demonstrate this

consider the case in which the individual utility function

satisfies (22),                in which case we know that along the

golden rule path the optimal tax rate on capital income is

zero.      In the general variable-k case the optimal tax rate is


                r- n
            =                                                              (38)




        A not implausible point estimate of the value of

(oL2 -    022) would be unity, in which case the optimal tax rate

on capital income is


                           n
            =   (1 -       r)                                              (39)



        Even though an expenditure tax would be optimal along

the golden rule path, a substantial tax on capital income

might well be optimal if the government has no independent


                       I
                                                                           -25-




policy instrument to influence the level of capital

intensity in the economy.        For example, a value of the rate

of profit equal to twice tpe growth rate would imply an

optimal tax rate of 50 per cent.            Clearly the relationship

between the profit and growth rates at the optimum has a major

bearing on the pattern of optimal tax rates.             The value of

r in equations (38) and (39) will be a function of t               , and
                                                               r
the form of the relationship will depend upon (a) the production

function relating the marginal product of capital to the level

of capital intensity, and (b) the function relating the

aggregate supply of savings to the net of tax rate of return.

The nature of the function relating r to t             is likely to be
                                                   r
complex and it is difficult to make general statements about

the value of t       which will prove    optimal, except to reiterate
                 r
the point made above that in a wide range of cases it will

probably exceed the value which would be optimal on the golden

rule growth path.

     The main conclusion to emerge from this discussion is

that the values of the optimal tax rates are very sensitive

to the precise values of the various elasticities involved,

and that they depend on two different aspects of savings

behaviour.     The first is the individual compensated demand

elasticity of second-period (or         "retirement~')   consumption

with respect to the interest rate.           The second is the

qeneral equilibrium response of aggregate    savings to changes in the

net rate of return.       The former effect concerns the efficiency

loss of distorting individual choice between present and
                                                                -26-




future consumption, and the latter concerns the ability of

changes in capital income taxes to drive the economy nearer

to the golden rule path of capital accumulation.      These two

aspects of savings behaviour are distinct,but both are important

for the design of the tax system.

      One of the virtues of a tax on capital income in the two-period

model is that it helps to raise aggregate saving and hence

pushes the economy nearer to the golden rule growth path.        At

first sight this may seem paradoxical, but the explanation

lies in the timing of tax payments.     Ignore for the moment

the substitution effects of taxes.     Replacing a tax on labour

income by a tax on capital income with the same present discounted

value would have no effect on the individual's bUdget

constraint, and this would not affect his chosen consumption

levels.   But the level of private saving would be affected

because the amount which would have been paid in labour income

taxes in period 1 will be saved to meet the tax bill on

capital income in period 2.      In this way capital income taxes

produce higher private saving.      If the government could vary

its own saving, by borrowing more, then these changes in

private saving would be of no consequence, and this is the case

on the golden rule path.      But where the government is unable

to change its borrowing policy and is constrained to operate

only on tax rates, any tax which raises revenue later in an

individual's life rather than earlier will seem attractive.

It is iikely that capital income taxes   wi~l   have a comparatlve

advantage from thiS point of view even ix the moael were

                                                                             -27-




extended to the more realistic case in which individuals

lived for many periods, although the magnitude of the

advantage would probably be less than in the rather extreme

two-period modeL

     To illustrate this point consider the example of Cobb

Douglas preferences.        On the golden-rule path we know that

the optimal tax rate on capital income is zero.                  But if the

tax system is to be used to encourage aggregate savings this

conclusion no longer holds.        In the Cobb-Douglas case aggregate

savings are (from (8) and (26»,



     s =                                                                     (40)




     The level of savings is independent of the rate of

interest and hence of the tax rate on capital income.                    A

change in t       can affect savings only via its effects on t
              r                                                          w
and the wage rate.        An increase in t       enables t       to be
                                             r               w
reduced for a given revenue requirement thus increasing

savings directly.        It can easily be checked that in the

Cobb-Douglas case a reduction in t         also results in a higher
                                       w
capital-labour ratio, implying a higher wage rate which in

turn increases savings.        The direct and indirect effects

reinforce each other.

     Although this argument for taxes on capital income may

seem somewhat artificial in that we might normally assume

that the government could off-set any change in the timing

of tax payments by changes in its own borrowing policy, it

does have one important implication.             This is that in the
                                                                -28-




context of our model a labour income tax is not equivalent

to an expenditure tax.       The incentive effects of the two

taxes are the same but the timing of the tax payments to

which they give rise is not.       On the golden rule path this

is irrelevant but away from that path the expenditure tax has

the advantage that tax payments occur later in life than under

the labour income tax.       This means that if we impose a tax on

consumption the associated optimal tax rate on capital income

will be less than if we had imposed a tax on labour income.

Consequently, the formulae derived above exaggerate the need

for a capital income tax away from the golden rule because

the tax on labour income could have been imposed instead as

a tax on consumption.       Although we argued above that the

value of   t~e   optimal capital income tax rate was very sensitive

to the discrepancy between rand n, we can now see that it is

sensitive also to the relative timing of tax payments under

an expenditure tax and a capital income tax.

     It is time, however, to question the assumption that

government debt policy cannot be used to compensate for

changes in the timing of tax payments.       Ignoring debt

policy can lead to absurd results.       In the two-period model

it would imply that the optimal tax was a lump-sum tax

collected on an individual's death bed, with his last

action being to sign a cheque for the Inland Revenue for

which he had spent most of his life saving up to pay.        This

unsavoury prospect can be disregarded once debt policy is

brought into the picture.      For the government may substitute
                                                               -29-




public saving for private saving by running a surplus and

investing the proceeds at the market interest rate.      The

government is now indifferent to the timing of tax payments

and is concerned only to extract a given present discounted

value of revenue from each generation.   This means that the

government's budget constraint becomes



                                                               (9' )



     The difference between (9) and (9') is that in the

former cash receipts determine the constraint whereas in

the latter the revenue requirement is perceived in present

discounted value terms.   The effect of this is that in all

subsequent equations (1 + n) is replaced by (1 + r).      It is
a simple matter to check that with this change the optimal

tax rates are given by equation (21) even when r   ~   nand

we are not following the golden-rule path.   The reason

is that the impact of taxes on aggregate saving can be offset

by an appropriate debt policy, and so moving from one tax

system to another does not move the economy near to the

golden-rule path.   Allowing for debt policy means, therefore

that the choice between income and expenditure taxes in

terms of efficiency depends on the values of the elasticities

which appear in (21), and the reader is referred to the

earlier discussion of this.

     Our conclusion is that it is difficult to argue strongly

for either an income or an expenditure tax on efficiency grounds
                                                                  -30-




seems to conflict with the views expressed recently by a

number of economists about the large welfare gains which

would result from the abolition of capital income taxes.          For

example, Boskin       (1978) has claimed that capital income

taxes in the US impose an annual welfare loss amounting

to an astounding 60 billion dollars (which is a present

value close to 1 trillion dollars) •      Summers (1978) finds

that the present value of the welfare gains from replacing

capital income taxes by an expenditure tax is at least the

equivalent of 5 years GNP, which in the US is about 2.5

trillion dollars.       On a more modest scale Feldstein (1978a)

obtains estimates of the annual gain from replacing capital

income taxes by higher labour income taxes equal to about 1

per cent of GNP, or 50 billion dollars in the     us.     Whatever

criterion one uses it is clear that these are large figures.

     Why is it, therefore, that these studies appear to

conflict   wi~h   the ambiguous nature of our theoretical results?

Interestingly enough it appears to be the assumptions,

explicit or implicit, which these studies make about labour

supply which provide the key to the differences.        Assumptions

about savings behaviour do not seem to be responsible for

themagni tude of the estimated welfare gains.       For example,

to calculate the welfare gain from abolishing capital income

taxes Boskiri implicitly uses an estimate of 022     =-   1.533

(see section 5 below), but the main reason for the size of

the gain is that he assumes that the taxes on capital income

are replaced by lump-sum taxes and not, as appears. more



                  /
                                                                   -31-




plausible, by higher taxes on labour income.      No weight is

given to the efficiency loss associated with alternative

sources of revenue.·

        The differential welfare gain from substituting taxes

on labour income or consumption for capital taxes is considered

by Feldstein and Summers.      In Summers' case he assumes that

labour supply is fixed and so again there is no efficiency loss

associated with labour income or expenditure taxation.        He

also places great emphasis on the timing of tax payments in

a complete life-cycle model which, as we have seen above,

is an issue that depends critically on the role afforded to

government debt policy.

        Feldstein presents a very careful analysis of the

net welfare gain from replacing capital income taxes by a

higher rate of tax on labour income in a two-period model

very similar to that discussed above.      The size of the

welfare gain depends on the values of the compensated demand

elasticities shown in equation (21).      Feldstein assumes

values of zero for the uncompensated elasticities of

savings with respect to the interest rate and of labour

supply with respect to both the wage rate and the interest

rate.     These are not taken as "estimates of the true values

but as simply illustrative values that are likely to under-

state the welfare cost of capital income taxation".

Unfortunately, the particular parameter estimates chosen by

Feldstein happen to imply that an expenditure tax is in fact

optimal as we shall now show.      The assumption that the
                                                                             -32-




uncompensated elasticity of labour supply with respect to

the wage rate is zero, implies (from (A.l) and (A.5»                  that



      0LL   =   -w(l - t
                            w)dL
                              dy
                                                                             ( 41)



      If the uncompensated elasticity of labour supply with

respect to the interest rate is zero then (from (A.3) and

the symmetry condition on substitution effects)



      SL2    =    -   S2L       =    C aL
                                      2dy
                                                                             (42 )



...   °2L    =    - w(l     -   t    )dL
                                    w dy
                                                                             (43 )



      Hence 0LL       =   02L and we know from our earlier analysis
that this is the condition that an expenditure tax be optimal.

The assumption of zero uncompensated elasticities is more

powerful than their description of "illustrative values"

might imply.          The welfare gain computed by Feldstein is

the gain which would result from adopting an expenditure tax

 if that tax were optimal.                  Again it is instructive to note

that the assumptions which are responsible for this result

concern not the response of savings but labour supply

behaviour.       One might be tempted to think that because the

optimal tax system is unlikely to be exactly equal to an

expenditure tax, Feldstein's estimates would provide an

upper bound on the welfare gains of moving from the present

system to an expenditure tax.                   Even this, however, is untrue.

It may well be that the optimal tax system requires a

subsidy to capital income and in such a case adopting an

expenditure tax might bring large welfare gains even though

it only moves us part of the way toward the optimum.

Nevertheless, it is not clear that Feldstein's estimates

"are likely to understate the welfare cost of capital income

taxation".   The correct conclusion would appear to be that

the size of the efficiency losses associated with the present

tax system is very uncertain, but the fact that, as Feldstein

has demonstrated, they may be substantial alerts us to the

need for a much greater understanding of the response of

savings and labour supply to taxation.

3.   Inflation and Capital Income Tax



     In our theoretical model we have assumed that capital

income taxes are imposed only on real interest income; in

essence we assumed either that there was no inflation or that

the tax system was ,fully           inde~.        But in practice capital income

taxes are levied on nominal capital income, and one of the

most forceful arguments for an expenditure tax is the practical

problems which would be entailed by complete indexation of

the tax system.         In this section, therefore, we shall examine

the optimal tax structure given the constraint that taxes on

capital income can be charged only on receipts of nominal

interest income.        Since tax authorities have been reluctant

to get embroiled with indexation the choice between expenditure

taxes and unindexed capital income taxes may represent the

realistic alternatives.

     The introduction of inflation implies two changes in the

basic model.       First, the price of second-period consumption

becomes


                        1 + TI
     h'   =                                                               (44)
              1 + (1 - t       ) (r + TI + TIr)
                           r


                                                      .
     where TI is the rate of inflation and r is again the real

rate of interest before tax.              Secondly, the government's

budget constraint changes and if we take the discounted value

form of the constraint (9') it is



                    ;
                                                                                                                  -35-




      g = t               wL         +   hi         c2    t r (r.       +    .'IT   +     'lTr)
                      w                                                                                           (45 )
                                                     (1     +    'IT)   (1          +   r)



      It can easily be verified that with these changes the

optimal tax rates are .given by a modified version of (21) in

which the real interest rate is replaced by the nominal

interest rate



      r   l
                  =   r +      'IT   + 'lTr                                                                       (46 )



      Intuitively it is clear why this is the case because the

base of the capital income tax is the nominal interest rate and

not the real rate of interest.                                                          If the government uses debt

policy to determine the real rate of interest, and hence the

optimal level of capital accumulation, the real rate of
                                                                                                  7 .
interest can be regarded as exogenous.

      With this assumption it is easy to show that the optimal

tax rate on nominal (unindexed) capital income is such as to

have no effect on real behaviour nor on the optimal tax rate on

labour income.                       For this to be so we would require

      rt                    r' t              I
                  r                       r
                      =                                                                                           (47)
      1 + r                 1 + r             l




      From (46) this gives



      t
          r
              '
                                         r (1
                                         +    'IT
                                                    +     'IT)

                                                     + 'lTr
                                                                 J                                                (48 )
                                                                 -36-




      This value of t       ' implies that individual behaviour is
                        r
unaltered because h   =     h' and it also satisfies the government's

budget constraint.      The introduction of inflation income into

the model means that the optimal tax rate on capital income is

multiplied by the factor shown in (48).         It is clear that the

tax rate should be lower in the presence of inflation.         For

example, if as above we take the real rate of interest over a

generation to be unity then with a rate of inflation equal to the

rate of interest the optimal tax rate is reduced to two-thirds

of its previous value.        The failure to index the taxation of

capital income makes a significant difference to the relative

claims of an income tax and an expenditure tax.         This brings

us back to one of the arguments deployed by the Meade Committee

in favour of an expenditure tax, namely that the practical

difficulties of indexing capital income taxation are as large ,

             ,
if not larger as the transitional problems involved in shifting

to an expenditure tax.        The theoretical arguments of this sec ion

certainly support the contention that the optimal tax rate on

capital income is very sensitive to the feasibility of indexation.

4.      Variations on the Basic Model



          In this section we discuss the effects of relaxing some of

the crucial assumptions of the simple two-period model analysed

above.     The most important of these is that labour is supplied

only in the first period which implies that an individual's

initial wealth is independent of interest rates.        In practice,

his endowment consists of a future stream of potential receipts

and the present value of this stream will depend upon the interest

rate.     For many people the most significant component of the

stream is future labour income.         Once we allow the value of

wealth, especially future earnings, to depend on the interest

rate, changes in interest rate have two effects on savings.          The

first is the direct effect analysed above and the second is an

indirect effect via changes in wealth.        An increase in the

interest rate will reduce the present value of wealth, thus

lowering present consumption and stimulating savings.         The

interest elasticity of savings with respect to the interest rate

may be much higher than is suggested by the two-period model.

This point was first made by Hall (1968) and later stressed

by Summers (1978) who, on the basis of numerical simulations,

concluded that the size of the interest elasticity of savings

was dominated by the wealth effect and that the elasticity of

substitution between present and future consumption was much

less important.

         It is possible to illustrate this phenomenon by

extending our model to include an endowment in period 2.        To

simplify matters we will assume that each individual receives
                                                                                  -38-




a fixed endowment in period 2 of value e,                          (this is sufficient

to make the point and avoids the complications of modelling

variable labour supply in period 2).                            The individual budget

constraint is now given by



                            =   w(l - t
                                             w
                                                  )L   + he                        (49 )



We may also write the budget constraint as



                        =       w (1 - t
                                             w
                                                  )L                               (50)



where S is the value of personal savings per worker.                           This

form of the constraint applies to both the original and

amended forms of the model.                            The government budget constraint

(in present discounted value terms) may also be written as


                                 r   t
                                         r
       g   =   t
                   w
                       wL +                  .S                                    (51)
                                 1 + r


       If we now maximise steady-state utility per capita

subject to this budget constraint expressed in terms of

savings rather than second-period consumption, then we obtain

suitably modified versions of the first-order conditions

(17) and (18).              Together with the appropriate Slutsky

equations, these conditions enable us to derive the optimal

tax rates in terms of compensated savings elasticities.                           It

is straightforward to .show that the relationship between the

optimal tax rates is given by



                        ;
                                                                  -39-

                                =      r    (a LS - aSS + 1)      (52)
                                    1 + r



where   a SL     =   compensated elasticity of savings w.r.t. the wage rate

        a LS     =   compensated elasticity of labour supply w.r.t. the

                     price of second-period consumption h

        aSS      =   compensated elasticity of savings w.r.t. the price

                     h

        This formula holds irrespective of the size of any

second-period endowment.

        In the case analysed in section 1 in which there was

no second-period endowment, savings were a constant multiple of

second-period consumption which implies that




                                                                  (53)




The own price elasticities are related as



        S    =   hC 2

        as          haC 2                                         (54)
        ah   = C2 + ah


Multiplying both sides by hiS we have



                                                                  (55)
                                                                                  -40-




          The elasticity of savings with respect to the price h

is equal to the elasticity of second-period consumption plus

unity.         This is because savings represent current expenditure

on future          consump~ion     (see Feldstein 1978 b).   It is easy to

see that substituting (53)               and (55) into (52) yields equation

(21), which is the condition we derived above for the case of

a zero second-period endowment.               But we may now extend the

model to allow for a positive endowment in period 2 equal to

e.      In this case we have, as before, that aLS            =   a
                                                                     L2
                                                                          , but

the savings elasticities are now changed.                From (49) and (50)



         S = h(C 2 - e)                                                           (56)

                    C       - e

Similarly, it can be shown that



                                                                                  (58)

                                                                          -41-




       In other words, allowing for a second-period endowment

(a very simple way of introducing more realistic life-cycle

considerations into the model) means that the elasticities of

second-period consumption which appear in the formula for the

optimal tax rates are multiplied by the factor a.                   The general

formula is




                                                                           (59)




       This reduces to (21) when a equals unity, but in general

a will exceed unity and could be large if, as one might expect

in a complete life-cycle model, most future consumption were

financed from future earnings.

       The significance of this extension may be illustrated by

looking again at two of the examples we examined in section 1.

Consider, first, the case where utility functions are Cobb-

Douglas.     In the basic model the assumption of Cobb-Douglas

utility functions implies that the optimal tax is an

expenditure tax with t           =   0       (see above)   Substituting from
                         r
(28)-(31) for the values of the compensated elasticities in

the Cobb-Douglas case, we see that in the extended model the

optimal tax rates are given by


               1 + r         t                 (a - 1)a (1 - a )
                           w                           2      2
                                                                                  (60)
                 r       1 - t                 [a a (a ~ 1) + a(l - a - a )]
                                         w       l  2                l   2
                                                                                                                           -42-




         It is clear from this expression that the optimal tax

on capital income is in fact a sUbSidy~                                                        As ex   -+-    1 the

optimal tax system tends to the expenditure tax, but in

general higher values of ex will imply a capital subsidy the

size of which will depend on parameter values.                                                               Suppose we

take the case where ex                            =       3 (the second-period endowment is

equal to two-thirds of desired second-period consumption),
                         1                   1                   1
r = 1, t w =             3'    a        =             a          4'          then t        = -.265.          The optimal
                                   l         3'           2 =                          r

                 1
      w = 2 the optimal subsidy to capital income is as
With t

high as 53 per cent.

         The second example to consider is that in which a

comprehensive income tax was optimal in the basic model.                                                                    In

that example the cross-elasticities were assumed to be zero,

and the remaining parameter values were 0LL                                                     =   0.4, 022          =   -1.2,

r = 1, t
             w
                 =~.                   When ex = 1                   t
                                                                         r
                                                                              =    i   and the optimal tax system

is a comprehensive income tax.                                                    Again, higher values of ex lead

to lower tax rates on capital income.                                                      With a value for ex of

3, the optimal tax rate on capital income is only 11 per cent.

         As a final illustration of the need to consider an

extended life-cycle model, consider the case when savings are

very small.                   As savings tend to zero in this model, the value

of ex tends to infinity.                                    In the limit the optimal tax rates

are given by


             t                              r t
                 w                                r             °22

manner one may be tempted to make simplifying assumptions about

individual utility functions, such as separability between

consumption and leisure or between consumption levels over

time.      Unfortunately, as we have seen, assumptions such as

these have very strong implications for the design of the

tax system.      Secondly, the presence of uncertainty has been

used by some as an argument for the provision of social

security (state pensions).         For example, Diamond (1977) in

an interesting (and non-technical) discussion of the rationale

for social security points to the absence of securities offering

riskless real rates of return and to the difficulty of

insuring in the market againathe effects of unemployment or

ill health on retirement.      These are offered as possible

justifications for a compulsory social security scheme .

. Leaving to one side the merits of the argument, we shall

simply draw attention to the implications of the existence of

social security for the tax system.         In the model explored

above we may interpret the second-period endowment e as an

untaxed pension with the payments financed out of general tax

revenues.      As shown above, the existence of the pension scheme

increases the individual elasticity of savings with respect to

the interest rate, and lowers the optimal tax rate on capital

income.      Unfunded pension schemes reinforce any case for an

expenditure tax and against an income tax.

          This leads us into the    remaini~g   set of questions,

which are those concerning the government.           It is clear that

one of the roles of a state pension scheme is redistribution

both within and between generations.         We have examined the
                                                               45-




inter-generational distribution when considering the impact

of taxation on the aggregate level of savings, but the

assumption of identical individuals ruled out any role for

intra-generational distribution.      The source of differences

in endowments in our model is two-fold.      First, potential

wages may vary among individuals because of differing "abilities";

in a model without savings this formulation is the optimal

income tax problem examined by Mirrlees(197l) and Wesson

(1972).     Secondly, the value of future labour earnings may

vary because of differences in the opportunity cost of capital

facing individuals.      Imperfections in the capital market,

such as constraints on borrowing or lending, will affect the

value of an individual's endowment.      In the absence of an

explicit model it is difficult to assess the extent to which

these considerations would influence the choice of the tax

base as opposed to the optimal rate structure.      Ordover and

Phelps (1979) have shown that allowing for differences in

abilities or wage rates does not alter the condition for

optimality of the expenditure tax, which remains that each

individual's utility function must satisfy (22).      Imper-

fections in the capital market are a more difficult matter,

and require further research.

          The final point is that in practice governments are

only too aware of the fact that tax reform must start from

the system we have today.     The transition from today's

initial position to the desired long-run state is important'

from both a theoretical and a practical point of view.      An

overnight switch from an income tax to an expenditure tax

                 ;
                                                            -46-




would result in a windfall loss for the generation which had

just retired.      Not only is this undesirable in principle,

but the incentives to conceal wealth held on the changeover

date make such a transition infeasible.      A gradual transition

is necessary on practical grounds (see the lengthy discussion

on transitional arrangements in the Meade Report), and would

be designed so as to avoid significant windfall gains and

losses.   To achieve this it would be necessary to keep

constant the present value of the tax liabilities of those

alive at the start of the transition.     This requires adjustments

in government borrowing to compensate for changes in the timing

of tax payments.      It would be a mistake not to use debt policy

as an instrument to aid a smooth transition.      And if debt

policy is an important part of the transition to a new state,

it seems misplaced to rule it out in the long-run also.     This

provides support for the view that the appropriate formulation

of the government's bUdget constraint is in terms of the present

discounted value of revenue received from each generation.
                                                                              -47-




5.      Empirical Evidence on Savings and Rates of Return



        Since a consumption function is an essential ingredient

of all large econometric models, we might expect to find

numerous empirical studies of the relationship between savings

and interest rates.                  In fact, there are remarkably few

econometric investigations of the effects of relative prices

on the intertemporal allocation of consumption, and even

fewer which have used the appropriate explanatory variables.

        The empirical study which is closest to the theoretical

model we have explored is that of Boskin and Lau (1978).

They estimate a two-period life cycle model in which

individuals choose consumption levels in the working and

retirement stages of life, and labour supply before retirement

which occurs at a fixed date.                     Individuals have identical

preferences represented by an indirect utility function

(equivalent to the function V used above) which is assumed to

be of the homogeneous trans log form.                      This gives the following

demand functions for the three goods, first-period consumption,

second-period consumption, and leisure.

                        by exogenous income

              Zl    =   vector of characteristics such as age, sex and life

                        expectancy of consumer.

      A good explanation of the derivation of this demand system

 (and other functional forms for the indirect utility function) is

contained in Berndt, Darrough and Diewert (1977).                  They show

that the demand system in (62) is linear in the parameters only

because of the assumption that preferences are homothetic.

This is a strong assumption because it implies that all income

elasticities are unity.              It also imposes the following

restrictions on the parameters


      3               3          3
      L a. =    1,    L z. = 0, L 8. J. = o   and 8 .. = 8 .. for each (63)

      Although the specification of (62) is derived from a

model of individual household behaviour, Boskin and Lau

estimate the model on aggregate time-series data for the US

over the period 1929-69.             For a discussion of aggregation in

models such as this the reader is referred to Berndt, Darrough

and Diewert (1977).          Boskin and Lau report estimates of the

uncompensated elasticities whereas our formulae for optimal tax

rates are derived in terms of compensated elasticities.                  But

in the special case of homothetic preferences it can be shown

from equation (19) and the Slutsky equations (Al)-(A4) that the

followinq    formula holds if we replace the compensated

elasticities cr by the corresponding uncompensated elasticities

n , and denote the average propensity to save by s.



                                                                         (64)

                                                                          -49-




     Using single-equation methods Boskin and Lau obtain the

following estimates for the elasticities (asymptotic t-

statistics in parentheses)

     nLL =          -0.08
                    (-15.64)

     n2L =           1.11
                     (39.46)

     nL2 =          -0.08
                     (-3.93)

     n22 =          -1. 49
                    (-15.71)

     These estimates have the striking implication that the

optimal tax system comprises a substantial subsidy to capital

income.       We have (taking s in the two-period case as 0.4)

     The length of the period is assumed by Boskin and Lau to

be 20 years.              If we assume a value for the
real rate of return of 3 per cent per annum, a revenue

requirement of             25              per cent of national income,

and that the share of capital income is 25%, the optimal tax

rates are

     The optimal tax system is a substantial subsidy to

capital income.            Moreover, the estimates (together with

the assumptions about the rate of return and share of

capital income) imply that the maximum revenue which the                  optimal
                                                                  -50-




tax system could generate is only 34%       of national income.

This occurs with a tax rate on labour income of 57.5%.

     Substituting (65) into (34) produces a non linear

relationship between the revenue raised as a proportion of

national income and the optimal tax rate on earned income.

This could be interpreted as an optimal tax version of the

so called "Laffer" curve relating tax revenue to the rate

of tax.   We have allowed explicitly for the optimal tax

structure in order to find the reduced form solution for

the relationship between revenue and tax rates.

     The virtue of the Boskin and Lau study is that it

shows clearly how crucial are the estimates of the cross-

elasticities which are usually ignored in studies that focus

on the dependence of labour supply       o~the   wage rate and of

savings on the interest rate.        An earlier study of the life

cycle model by Diewert (1974) employed an indirect utility

function defined over the prices of consumption, leisure,

and money for each of thirty periods.        The model was estimated

on aggregate annual US data over the period 1946-65.         In

order to limit the number of parameters to be estimated,

Diewert imposed some a priori restrictions, including the

assumption that the elasticity of future consumption with

respect to the wage rate (a        ) was zero.    Despite this
                              2L
restriction, his estimates also imply that a subsidy. to

capital income would be optimal.

     A major difficulty with these models is the measurement

of the price of future consumption, and this has emerged
                                                                -51-




 recently as a key issue in the estimation of conventional

 consumption functions incorporating interest rates.      There

 are two related issues here.      The first is that it is clear

 that the relevant interest rate is the real net of tax rate of

 return.      But of the few studies which have included interest

 rates, most have used nominal interest rates and ignored

 tax rates.     This procedure leads to downward bias in the

 estimated interest elasticity of savings (Feldstein 1970).

A careful treatment of tax rates by Wright (1969) led to

estimates of the interest elasticity of savings in the

range 0.18 to 0.27.      For empirical work it is necessary to

decide on which of a whole array of interest rates to use,

and to estimate the average marginal tax rates on income from

capital.      We shall simply mention these questions and pass

on.

      The second issue which arises in measuring the rate of

return is that it should be net of the expected rate of

inflation.      If the time horizon is of the order of twenty

years (between the first and second periods of the stylised

life cycle) then we need to specify a model for the formation

of expectations over a long period.       The appropriate way to

do this is at the heart of the debate over the size of the

interest elasticity of savings between Boskin (1978)      and

Howrey and Hyrnans (1978).

      Boskin's aim was to estimate the interest elasticity of

savings using a properly specified rneasure of the rate of

return, net of both taxes and expected inflation.      He used
                                                                                 -52-




aggregate annual US data for the period 1929-69 and

experimented with a variety of specifications and definitions

of the variables.               The preferred equation was estimated using

instrumental variables to allow for simultaneous equations

bias, and the sample period for this equation was 1929-66

excluding the war years 1941-6.                 This yielded the following

estimated equation (standard errors in parentheses)



     log C

                            (0.21)


     where    C
                  t
                      =     real per capita     consumption

              Y = real per capita               private disposable income

              W
               t

                      =     real post-tax interest rate

              7f t    =     expected rate of inflation


     This equation implies a significant interest elasticity

of savings of about 0.4 evaluated at the mean values of the

variables.        In fact the total elasticity of savings is higher

than this because the value of 0.4 is computed ignoring any

effect of interest rate changes on wealth.                      We shall not

discuss the rationale of the specification of a consumption

function of the type shown in (66) but concentrate on the

estimate of the interest rate coefficient.                      The interest

rate which Boskin uses is a post-tax nominal rate minus the

expected inflation rate.      This latter variable was "estimated

from an adaptive expectations model of price expectations,

~runcated
                                                                 .
            after 8 years, with varying speeds of adjustment (p.Sll).

It is clear that this is not the only possible specification, and

Howrey and Hymans (1978) have challenged Boskin's results by

claiming that the significance of the interest rate coefficient

is very sensitive to the particular measure of the expected

rate of inflation and to the sample period.       For example,

by omitting a single year (1934) they find that using Boskin's

original data the interest rate coefficient becomes insignificant.

     This is an important point, and suggests that there may

be insufficient information contained in annual observations to

enable us to identify at all precisely the size of the

savings elasticity.      Unfortunately, Howrey and Hymans' own

estimates are flawed by their. use of single-equation estimation

methods and a very narrow definition of savings.      They prefer

a concept of "loanable-funds" saving to the more conventional

national income accounting definition thus excluding saving

in pension funds, owner-occupied housing and other durables.

The resulting definition of saving covers only 14 per cent

of private saving amounting in 1975 to 36.0      billion dollars

out of a total figure for gross private saving of 259.4

billion dollars.      On this basis Howrey and Hymans find an

insignificant interest elasticity of savings.

    Leaving aside the econometric difficulties of estimating

the savings elasticity, we can see that Boskin is right to

emphasise that even small values   ~or   the interest elasticity

                 ;
                                                                                    -54-




of savings imply large values for the elasticity of

retirement consumption with respect to its own price.                           To

relate estimates obtained from annual data to the two-

period theoretical model we shall redefine the price of second-

period consumption to allow for continuous compounding

 of savings is zero or 0.4.

6.   Conclusions



     The main contention of the Meade RepJrt was    that there

was probably little to choose between an expenditure tax

and a comprehensive income tax on efficiency grounds, and

that the telling argument for an expenditure tax was that it

represented the only practicable alternative to the present

mess which has arisen, at least partly, from an unworkable

distinction between capital and income.       To bolster this

argument the Meade Committee drew attention to the enormous

range of effective tax rates on capital income according to

the type of asset and financial medium through which savings

are channelled.       This emphasis on the "portfolio" nature of

saving and its tax treatment contrasts with the simple model

of life-cycle saving which we have examined above.       In one

sense, our analysis confirms the Meade Reportis judgment

that on conventional efficiency grounds it is difficult to

argue strongly for an expenditure tax.      Yet, the analysis

shows also that the efficiency losses of the present system

may be large.     Perhaps the most striking result is that the

"optimal" tax system is very sensitive to the characterisation

of the life cycle in our model and much less so to the precise

value of the interest elasticity of savings.       The strongest

arguments for an expenditure tax, within the framework of our

model, are the failure to index the income tax base for

inflation and the existence of unfunded pension schemes.

Academic debate over the size of a single elasticity, the

interest elasticity of savings, is only a part, and a small

part at that of the set of considerations relevant to the

very important practical problem of tax reform.

1.   The model is based on Atkinson and Sandmo (1979), but
     the results and their derivation are somewhat different.


2.   Those who prefer to work with the direct utility function
     will find that the mathematics is only slightly more
     cumbersome.


3.   It can be shown that the second-order conditions for an
     optimum are satisfied    if the revenue from each tax is an
     increasing function of the tax rate.


4.   The "only if" follows provided all elasticities are finite.


5.   It should be noted that (23) is not equivalent to the
     condition that the utility function be weakly separable
     into labour supply and some function of the consumption
     levels in the two periods except when the function of
     consumption levels is homothetic; see Atkinson and Stiglitz
     (1976) and Auerbach (1979).


6.   This enables us to obtain a result and proof both of which
     appear to be much simpler than those in the literature.
     The envelope theorem is discussed in, for example, Dixit
     (1976).


7.   We are assuming here that the incentive to invest depends
     only on the real rate of interest which will not be true
     if the corporate tax system is unindexed.


8.   To be strictly accurate equation (60) shows that t w and
     t  have oppos i te signs. But from _( 34) it can be shown
      r
     that when the tax rates have opposite signs it is the
     tax on labour income which is positive provided that the
     share of capital income is less than b/(l+b) where b is the


                   /
ratio of the absolute magnitudes of t

equations into equation (20).                       Denoting y by income and Sij for

the substitution terms,we have the Slutsky equations

   We now substitute from (AI) to (A4) for the partial

derivatives in (19)

   The income effects cancel out, and we may replace the

substitution terms by the elasticities from (AS) to (AB)

using the symmetry condition that



             =                                               (A 10)




This gives

After re-arranging this becomes equation (20) of the text.
