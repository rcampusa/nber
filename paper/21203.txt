Household Debt and Defaults from 2000 to 2010: Facts from Credit Bureau Data

JEL No. E0,R3

                                              ABSTRACT

We use individual level credit bureau data to document which individuals saw the biggest rise in household
debt from 2000 to 2007 and the biggest rise in defaults from 2007 to 2010. Growth in household debt
from 2000 to 2007 was substantially larger for individuals with the lowest initial credit scores. However,
initial debt levels were lower for individuals in the lowest 20% of the initial credit score distribution.
As a result, the contribution to the total dollar rise in household debt was strongest among individuals
in the 20th to 60th percentile of the initial credit score distribution. Consistent with the importance
of home-equity based borrowing, the increase in debt is especially large among individuals in the lowest
60% of the credit score distribution living in high house price growth zip codes. In contrast, the borrowing
of individuals in the top 20% of the credit score distribution is completely unresponsive to higher house
price growth. In terms of defaults, the evidence is unambiguous: both default rates and the share of
total delinquent debt is largest among individuals with low initial credit scores. The bottom 40% of
the credit score distribution is responsible for 73% of the total amount of delinquent debt in 2007,
and 68% of the total in 2008. Individuals in the top 40% of the initial credit score distribution never
make up more than 15% of total delinquencies, even in 2009 at the height of the default crisis.

1    Introduction

From 2000 to 2007, the United States experienced the most dramatic boom and bust in household

debt since the Great Depression. Household debt increased at a steady pace through the 1990s,

and then jumped by $7 trillion from 2000 to 2007. The boom in debt ended badly: by 2009

the delinquency rate on debt had reached above 10%, much higher than seen since the Great

Depression. Figure 1 shows these patterns. Our previous research has argued that the boom and

bust in household debt is crucial for understanding the Great Recession of 2007 to 2009 (Mian and

Sufi (2010), Mian, Rao, and Sufi (2013), Mian and Sufi (2014)).

    Our goal in this study is largely descriptive. We want to answer the following question: which

individuals drove the aggregate patterns in debt and delinquencies from 2000 to 2010? To answer

this question, we utilize individual level credit bureau data that tracks a random sample of 300

thousand individuals from 1997 to 2010. We sort individuals into quintiles based on their credit

score at the beginning of the sample period, and then we track debt and defaults for each quintile

through the sample period.

    Using individual level credit bureau data has a number of advantages. First, credit bureau

data is accurate and aggregates to total household debt from the U.S. Flow of Funds. It therefore

provides the cleanest picture available to us to understand the dynamics of who drove the increase

in debt and defaults from 2000 to 2010. Second, individual level credit bureau data consolidates

all debts for an individual. Mortgage origination-based data sets such as LPS/McDash often miss

second mortgages or home equity-lines of credit, and completely miss auto and credit card debt.

For example, a debt to income ratio using an origination-based data set is only the debt to income

ratio of the mortgage being originated, which often excludes a substantial amount of debt for

the individual. Third, using data at the individual level data avoids concerns about changing

composition of individuals within a geographic unit such as a zip code or county.

    We find that the growth in household debt was strongest for the lowest credit score individuals

in the sample. Individuals in the lowest 20% of the 1997 credit score distribution see their debt

grow by 175% from 2000 to 2007. There is a monotonic decline in debt growth as credit scores

increase, with individuals in the highest 20% of the 1997 credit score distribution seeing debt grow

by only 40% from 2000 to 2007. This pattern is not driven by differences in age or initial debt levels:


                                                  1
even among individuals of similar age and similar initial debt levels, low credit score individuals

see the largest growth in household debt.

   The contribution of any group to the total dollar increase in debt from 2000 to 2007 is a function

of both debt growth and initial debt levels of the group. Individuals with low credit scores saw the

highest debt growth during the boom, but they also started with the lowest initial debt levels. As a

result, individuals in the 20th to 60th percentile of the initial credit score distribution contributed

most to the total dollar rise in household debt, having both high initial debt levels and relatively

strong growth in debt. More specifically, the 40% of households in the 20th to 60th percentile of

the initial credit score distribution accounts for just over 50% of the total dollar rise in household

debt from 2000 to 2007. The highest 20% of the initial credit score distribution accounts for only

10% of the total rise.

   Recent quantitative macroeconomic models have focused on the importance of loosened bor-

rowing and lending constraints in explaining housing market dynamics during the 2000s (Midrigan

and Philippon (2011), Favilukis, Ludvigson, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2013), Justiniano, Primiceri,

and Tambalotti (2014)). Debt to income and debt to value ratios are important empirical measures

in this literature. We match individuals to average income and home values of the zip codes they

live in to examine debt to income and debt to value ratios. We find that debt to income ratios

skyrocket by 0.8 during the 2000 to 2006 period among individuals in the bottom 60% of the credit

score distribution. For the lowest 20% of credit score distribution, this represents a doubling of the

debt to income ratio. The top 20% of the credit score distribution saw almost no increase in debt

to income ratios from 2000 to 2006.

   The evidence is more mixed using housing debt to home value ratios. Housing debt includes

both mortgage and home equity-related debt, and we examine the ratio of housing debt to home

value conditional on individuals that have some housing debt outstanding. From 2002 to 2005, the

debt to value ratio actually declines for all but the bottom 20% of the credit score distribution,

where it is constant. This reflects the fact that aggressive borrowing by households happened

concurrently with strong house price growth. From 2005 to 2007, there is a sharp rise in debt to

value ratios, as household borrowing continues to increase while house price growth stagnates.

   Given the importance of home-equity driven borrowing during this period, we do a double sort

of individuals by credit score and by house price growth of the zip code in which the individual

                                                  2
resides. All of the patterns on growth and the share of debt across the credit score distribution are

amplified in zip codes with strong house price growth. Debt growth is strongest among low credit

score individuals living in high house price growth zip codes. The contribution to the total dollar

rise in household debt is largest for individuals in the 20th to 60th percentile of the credit score

distribution living in high house price growth zip codes.

    In terms of delinquencies during the bust, the evidence is unambiguous: the mortgage default

crisis was driven by low credit score individuals. Default rates for the lowest 20% of the initial

credit score distribution reached a stunning 25% by 2009. Default rates for the top 40% of the

initial credit score distribution were below 5%. The share of total dollar amounts in delinquency

was also largest for the lowest part of the credit score distribution. In 2007, the lowest 20% of the

initial credit score distribution accounted for 40% of the dollars in delinquency. The bottom 40%

of the initial credit score distribution accounted for almost 70% of the total dollars in delinquency

in 2008. Even at the peak of the mortgage default crisis when defaults had spread throughout

the country, the top 40% of the credit score distribution never made up more than 15% of total

delinquent dollars. Both default rates and the share of delinquent dollars were highest for low

credit score individuals.

    In the next section, we present data and summary statistics. Sections 3 and 4 examine the rise

in household debt from 2000 to 2007. Section 5 examines delinquencies from 2007 to 2010 and

Section 6 concludes. In the conclusion, we relate the facts presented here to our earlier research.



2     Data and Summary Statistics

2.1    Data

Our main data set is based on individual-level credit bureau data from Equifax. This is the same

data set used in Mian and Sufi (2011).1 The initial random sample of individuals was drawn for

the year 1997 from a group of 4,025 zip codes with Fiserv Case Shiller Weiss data available. The

initial sample contains 320,295 individuals.

    We limit the sample to the 288,042 individuals that have credit information available from 1997
   1
     In Mian and Sufi (2011), we were required to sort individuals into groups of five. After the publication of that
study, we were granted permission to use the individual level data. The records do not contain any information to
identify individuals.


                                                         3
to 1999. We make this restriction because there is a large amount of attrition in the initial two

years, driven by individuals with very few accounts. The attrition rate is 6% in the first two years,

but then is reduced to a constant 2% afterward. We include all individuals that have data available

for the first three years of our sample. We have data for these individuals through 2010.

   We isolated the sample to people living in zip codes covered by Fiserv Case Shiller Weiss because

our original research using the data required zip level house price indices. These 4,025 zip codes

contain 25% of U.S. population and 40% of total debt. As has been discussed in our previous

research (Mian and Sufi (2009), Mian and Sufi (2011)), the main difference between zip codes in

the sample and not in the sample is population density. Only zip codes with a large number of

households and a large number of housing transactions generate enough data to construct a zip

code level house price index. These are mostly urban areas or suburban areas close to urban areas.

   There are two potential sources of sample bias from our data. First, we miss new individuals

that first enter the Equifax credit bureau system after 1997. Fortunately, this is likely not a major

concern given that new entrants typically do not take on large sums of debt, and they therefore

are unlikely to change the conclusions of our analysis focusing on aggregate debt patterns. Second,

we only have individuals that resided in zip codes in 1997 with FCSW data. It is harder to assess

whether this selection would materially change any results. However, Figure 2 gives us comfort

that the FCSW criteria is not a major issue. It shows debt growth according the Federal Reserve

Flow of Funds and according to our sample. As Figure 2 shows, debt growth from the flow of funds

and from our data match closely.

   The credit bureau data has excellent information on debt and defaults, but it only has limited

information on individual characteristics. The primary measure we have is the Vantage Score,

which is a credit score based on creditworthiness of the individual. We will discuss the Vantage

Score in more detail below. We also have age for 90% of the sample.

   Given the lack of data on income or home values, we supplement the credit bureau data using

zip level information on income and home values from other data sources. More specifically, we

match each individual to their zip-level average adjusted gross income per tax return and zip-level

average home value. Zip level average home value comes from taking the average house price from

Zillow in 2000, and then growing the house price by zip-level price indices from CoreLogic.



                                                 4
2.2   Credit scores

As mentioned above, the credit score we have in the credit bureau data is known as the Vantage

Score. Like FICO and other credit scores, it is meant to measure the creditworthiness of a borrower.

The Vantage Score varies between 550 and 990, as opposed to 300 to 850 for FICO scores. There is

no specific cutoff in the Vantage Score data that indicates a subprime borrower, but 700 is a cut-off

widely used to indicate a low credit quality borrower. In our random sample of individuals, about

35% of the sample has a Vantage Score below 700 in 1997.

   In the analysis below, we split the sample based on the individual’s Vantage Score in 1997. Given

that 35% of the sample has a Vantage Score below 700, the subprime cutoff is at the high end of

our second quintile. It is important to note that the credit score here applies to borrowers, not to

the product used by the borrowers. People with low credit scores may obtain prime mortgages, and

people with high credit scores may obtain subprime mortgages. We are not interested in evaluating

the rise in debt across different products, but rather across different people.

   In all of the analysis below, we group individuals by their initial credit score as of 1997 and

track them over time. Why are credit scores the most natural characteristic on which to group in-

dividuals? The most obvious reason is practical: it is one of the only individual level characteristics

we have in the credit bureau data. However, there are deeper economic justifications for grouping

individuals in this manner. Credit scores are one of the primary variables used in credit origination

decisions, and individuals with low credit scores have been shown in a number of studies to have

high denial rates and a high marginal propensity to borrow. Further, credit scores are designed to

predict default, which is itself an important outcome to evaluate.

   We group individuals based on initial credit scores in 1997; an alternative approach would be

a dynamic sort, in which individuals are grouped into credit score bins every year. We prefer the

static sort for a number of reasons. First, our goal is to evaluate which individuals contributed to

the rise in debt and defaults. A dynamic sort would have different individuals in different groups

every year, which makes answering our primary question of which individuals drove the rise in debt

more difficult.

   Second, and more importantly, credit scores become endogenous to credit outcomes and house

price growth over time. For example, Mian and Sufi (2011) show that low credit score homeowners in



                                                   5
inelastic housing supply cities see a decline in default rates during the housing boom relative to low

credit score homeowners in elastic cities. The main reason is that low credit score homeowners seeing

high house price growth refinance their way out of defaults – i.e., they do a cash-out refinancing

if they cannot make a mortgage payment. As a result, low credit score homeowners in high house

price growth areas will see a relative improvement in credit scores that is not driven by fundamental

improvements in credit quality, but instead by the housing boom. We discuss this in more detail

in Section 5.

   As another example, an individual that starts in a high credit score group but then sees their

credit score drop almost assuredly experienced some kind of financial distress. As a result, we

should not be surprised that individuals that enter the low credit score group from a high credit

score group see lower debt growth. We want to purge our credit score classification from such

endogenous determinants. We use the initial credit score as of 1997, and individuals remain in their

group throughout the sample. One disadvantage to this approach is mechanical mean reversion –

if low credit score individuals start with low debt, we should expect faster growth. We address this

concern in detail in the results below.


2.3   Summary statistics

Table 1 contains summary statistics. Total debt per individual at the beginning of the sample is

$49 thousand on average, and mortgage or home equity related debt accounts for $40 thousand.

Some of the debt on individual credit reports is held jointly with a spouse, and so debt held by an

individual in credit report data is best viewed as something between debt held by an individual and

a household. Table 1 also contains summary statistics on zip-level average adjusted gross income,

and zip-level house price growth from 2000 to 2006.

   In Table 2, we present summary statistics by credit score quintile. Individuals with lower credit

scores have lower debt balances in 1997 and are less likely to have housing-related debt. However,

the relation between debt balance and credit score quintile is not monotonic – those in the fourth

quintile actually have less debt than those in the third quintile. Lower credit score individuals are

younger, and live in zip codes with lower adjusted gross income per tax return. Conditional on

having housing debt, the lowest 60% of the credit score distribution have debt to value ratios around

71%. Individuals with lower credit scores live in zip codes in 2000 that subsequently experience

                                                  6
higher house price growth, which is consistent with the zip code level evidence presented in Mian

and Sufi (2009).



3     Rise in Debt, by Credit Score

3.1   Debt growth

The left panel of Figure 3 shows cumulative growth in household debt since 2000 by initial credit

score quintile. The right panel plots growth from 2000 to 2007 by initial credit score quintile. Low

credit score individuals saw the strongest growth in debt from 2000 to 2007. Debt grew by 175%

for the lowest credit score quintile, and only 40% for the highest quintile. The relation between

debt growth and credit score quintile is monotonic.

    One potential explanation of the pattern in Figure 3 is age cohort effects. We know lower

credit score individuals are younger, and perhaps we should expect debt to rise more quickly

for younger individuals given standard life-cycle predictions. Before addressing this explanation

directly, we want to point out that it is not obvious that younger people show be borrowing more

in an environment in which house prices are increasing. Most borrowing is associated with housing,

and we know home equity withdrawal was a primary driver of increases in household debt from

2000 to 2007. In most life-cycle models without borrowing constraints, an increase in house prices

for older people who plan on reducing their housing services consumption would be a true wealth

shock. A standard model without borrowing constraints would predict that older people would

borrow more out of a rise in house prices than younger people who likely need to purchase more

housing services in the future (see Mian and Sufi (2011) for more on this point).

    In Table 3, we sort individuals by both initial credit score and age. As the first column shows,

younger individuals did in fact borrow more aggressively during this time period, which is consistent

with evidence from Mian and Sufi (2011) that younger households borrowed more against the

increase in house prices. However, the stronger debt growth among lower credit score individuals

is robust across every age cohort with the exception of individuals over 60. Stronger debt growth

by lower credit score individuals is not merely a reflection of cohort effects.

    Another concern is mechanical mean reversion. Low credit score individuals start with lower

debt (see Table 2), and therefore we should expect debt to increase more rapidly. Before addressing


                                                  7
this concern, it is important to remember that the relation between initial debt and credit scores

is not monotonic – the fourth quintile actually has less debt than the third quintile in Table 2.

Regardless, Table 4 sorts individuals by both initial credit score and debt in 1999. As it shows,

the higher debt growth among lower credit score individuals is robust across quintiles of 1999 debt

levels. Stronger debt growth by lower credit score individuals is not merely a reflection of mean

reversion.


3.2   Share of aggregate increase in debt

The growth in debt from 2000 to 2007 was largest for lower credit score individuals, but who

contributed most to the dollar rise in debt? The left panel of Figure 4 shows the average debt

level for individuals by 1997 credit score quintile. As it shows, the lowest credit score quintile has

substantially less debt in 2000 relative to the other groups. However, all four higher quintiles start

with similar debt levels.

   From 2000 to 2007, the largest rise in the nominal amount of debt occurred among the second

and third quintile of the initial credit score distribution. Individuals in these two groups experienced

an increase in debt of about $75 thousand. Individuals in the lowest credit score quintile witnessed

a rise in debt of about $50 thousand. Recall that each quintile contains the same fraction of the

overall sample (20%). As a result, we immediately know from the left panel of Figure 4 that the

total dollar rise was strongest for the 20th to 60th percentile of the credit score distribution.

   The right panel of Figure 4 plots the share of the total rise in debt for each quintile. The 20th

to 60th percentile of the initial credit score distribution accounts for just over 50% of the overall

rise in debt. The lowest and fourth quintile contribute almost 40%, and the highest credit score

quintile contributes only 10%.

   Even though the lowest credit score individuals did not contribute the most to the total rise in

debt, Figure 5 shows a large jump in the fraction of aggregate debt held by these individuals. In

2000, they held just less than 10% of total debt in the sample. By 2007, they held almost 15%.

A smaller jump occured for the second quintile. The highest credit score quintile saw the largest

decline, going from 25% to 18%.

   The uniform message from both debt growth and the share of the aggregate debt increase is that

the highest credit score individuals were least important in explaining the explosion of household

                                                   8
debt from 2000 to 2007. They both had the lowest growth in debt, and the lowest contribution to

the rise in debt. The evidence on lower credit score individuals is mixed. Growth was strongest

among the lowest quintile, but the 20th to 60th percentile of the initial credit score distribution

contributed most significantly to the dollar rise in debt.


3.3   Debt to income and debt to value ratios

Midrigan and Philippon (2011), Favilukis, Ludvigson, and Van Nieuwerburgh (2013), and Justini-

ano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti (2014) present quantitative macroeconomic models of the housing

boom. A potential driver of the debt expansion in these models is a loosening of borrowing con-

straints, which is modeled as lenders allowing borrowers to borrow a higher fraction of collateral

value. Formally, the constraint is:


                                           Bit ≤ θit Qit hit


where Bit is total household borrowing for individual i, Qit is the price of a unit of housing, hit

is the quantity of housing, and θit is the borrowing constraint parameter. In this framework, a

loosening of borrowing constraints for individual i over time would be an increased θit . A higher

value of θit would show up as higher housing debt to home value ratios in the data.

   Alternatively, Justiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti (2014) argue that the boom in household

debt was not driven by a relaxation of borrowing constraints. Instead, it was driven by a loosening

of a lending constraint, which they model as an increase in the total amount of mortgage lending:


                                               Bit ≤ L̄


An increase in L̄ is what they refer to as a loosened lending constraint, and they use debt to income

ratios as a proxy for L̄. Justiniano, Primiceri, and Tambalotti (2014) argue that a loosening of

the borrowing constraint alone cannot explain what happened during the housing boom, because

a loosening of the borrowing constraint would increase the demand for borrowing putting upward

pressure on interest rates. In contrast, they argue that a loosening of a lending constraint is more

consistent with falling interest rates and steady housing debt to home value ratios during the boom.



                                                  9
A key difference in which constraint was loosened is the behavior of debt to value versus debt to

income ratios. If the lending constraint is more important, debt to value ratios would move less

and debt to income ratios more.

    Figure 6 shows the aggregate debt to income ratio and the housing debt to real estate value

ratio for the United States. Debt to income ratios saw a dramatic rise beginning in 2000, whereas

the housing debt to home value ratio was constant until 2005. The latter reflects the fact that house

prices rose rapidly, which means the ratio of housing debt to home values was constant. However,

the housing debt to home value ratio increased in 2006 and 2007.

    We contribute to this debate by showing how debt to value and debt to income ratios changes

across the credit score distribution. More specifically, in Figure 7, we use individual level data

to see which individuals drove the increase in the debt to income ratio from 2000 to 2007. Debt

comes from the individual credit reports, whereas income is measured as the average adjusted gross

income per tax return in the zip code in which the individual resides. As the right panel shows,

the rise in the debt to income ratio was driven by borrowers in the bottom 60% of the credit score

distribution, and the increase was similar across all three groups. In percentage terms, the increase

was largest for the lowest credit score quintile, given that individuals within this quintile started

from a much lower base. The rise in the debt to income ratio was modest for the top 20% of the

credit score distribution.

    Figure 8 examines the housing debt to home value ratio conditional on having housing debt.

Housing debt to home value ratios actually fell for all groups except for the lowest credit score

quintile from 2000 to 2005. However, they rose sharply in 2006 and especially 2007. The rise from

2005 to 2007 was driven by both additional borrowing (see Figure 3) and a stagnation of house

prices. The rise from 2001 to 2007 was largest for the lowest 40% of the credit score distribution.



4    Rise in Debt: By Credit Score and House Price Growth

As we show in Mian and Sufi (2011), an important driver of the increase in household debt during

the housing boom was existing homeowners borrowing against the rising value of home equity.

This finding motivates an additional sorting variable to examine which individuals drove the rise

in aggregate debt: house price growth. In this section, we sort individuals into groups based on


                                                 10
house price growth from 2000 to 2006 of the zip code where the individual lived in 2000. We split

individuals into five groups of house price growth, where the cutoffs are picked to keep roughly 20%

of the sample in each group.

   Table 5 shows debt growth from 2000 to 2007 by initial credit score quintile and house price

growth group. In every single house price growth group, the growth in debt is larger for lower

credit score individuals, which confirms the findings above. However, the new information in this

table is the much stronger growth in debt for high house price growth zip codes, especially at the

low end of the credit score distribution. For the lowest credit score quintile, debt growth was 107%

in zip codes with less than 40% house price growth. In zip codes with greater than 130% house

price growth, debt growth was almost twice as large: 207%.

   Debt growth was significantly stronger in high house price growth zip codes for the bottom 80%

of the initial credit score distribution. However, there is no relation between debt growth and house

price growth at the very top of initial credit score distribution. Debt growth is almost constant

across house price growth groups for individuals with highest initial credit scores.

   The growth in debt was strongest for low credit score individuals living in high house price

growth zip codes. But what about the share of the total rise in debt? The double-sort methodology

introduces a complication because the share of the total population is no longer constant across

each of the 25 cells. In the top panel of Table 6, we show the share of the population in each

cell of the two-way sort. If house price growth and initial credit scores were randomly distributed,

we would expect 4% of the population in each of the 25 cells. However, house price growth was

stronger for lower credit score individuals, and so more of the population is in the top right corner

and bottom left corner of the top panel of Table 6.

   Initial debt levels are an important determinant of who contributes most to the rise in debt for

given debt growth. The middle panel shows initial debt levels for each cell. Initial debt levels are

smaller for lower initial credit score individuals, which we know from above. However, the relation

between initial debt level and house price growth is not constant across the initial credit score

distribution. In the lowest credit score quintiles, it appears that initial debt levels are lowest in zip

codes where house prices rose the most.

   The bottom panel of Table 6 shows what cells were responsible for the rise in debt in dollar

terms from 2000 to 2007. Individuals in the 20th to 60th percentile of the initial credit score

                                                   11
distribution that also experienced high house price growth contributed most strongly to the rise

in debt. More specifically, the eight cells in credit score quintiles 2 and 3 with house price growth

above 40% make up 36% of the population. However, they make of 45% of the rise in total debt

from 2000 to 2007. Once again, individuals in the highest credit score quintile contribute very little

to the rise in household debt from 2000 to 2007.



5     Delinquencies

5.1   Who drove the household debt default crisis?

From 2000 to 2007, debt growth was strongest among low credit score individuals living in high

house price growth areas. The lower-middle part of the credit score distribution with high house

price growth was responsible for the largest share of the aggregate rise in household debt. In this

section, we examine defaults. We answer two questions: first, who had the highest default rates?

And second, who was responsible for the largest share of total dollars in delinquency?

    It turns out that the answer to both questions is the same: individuals with low initial credit

scores drove the default crisis. The left panel of Figure 9 shows the default rate for individuals

based on initial credit score quintile. The default rate jumped from 9% to over 25% for the lowest

credit score quintile from 2005 to 2009. The default rate also increased substantially in the second

quintile. The rise in the default rate was more modest in the top 40% of the initial credit score

distribution.

    The right panel examines the share of total dollars in delinquency by quintile. In 2007, the

bottom 20% of the credit score distribution accounted for over 40% of the dollars in delinquency

in our sample. The bottom 40% made up 73% of the dollars in delinquency in 2007. As Figure

1 shows, the default rate in 2007 was almost 6%, much higher than the United States witnessed

in any recent recession. Further, delinquencies on mortgages led to credit market disruptions in

the summer and fall of 2007. Regulators were discussing mortgage problems as early as May 17th,

2007 when Chairman Ben Bernanke gave a speech on rising defaults in the subprime mortgage

market. Figure 9 shows that the mortgage default crisis was triggered primarily by defaults among

low credit score individuals.

    By 2008 and 2009, the default crisis spread to higher credit score borrowers. However, the


                                                 12
bottom 40% of the initial credit score distribution continued to account for the lion’s share of

delinquencies: 69% in 2008 and 66% in 2009. Individuals in the top 40% of the initial credit score

distribution never accounted for more than 15% of total dollars in delinquency, even at the height

of the mortgage default crisis.

       The fact that the default rate is so much higher for lower credit score individuals is not surprising.

However, it may be surprising that the lowest quintile makes up the largest fraction of total defaults

given that the lowest quintile had smaller debt burdens. Recall however that the lowest quintile

increased their debt burden substantially from 2000 to 2007 (see left panel of Figure 4). So by

2007, individuals in the lowest quintile of the initial credit score distribution had increased leverage

substantially.

       We can see this effect in Figure 10. It plots the share of total debt outstanding in 2007 and the

share of total delinquencies in 2008 across the initial credit score distribution. By 2007, individuals

in the lowest quintile of the initial credit score distribution had 14% of debt outstanding. Individuals

in the bottom two quintiles made up 37% of total debt in 2007. Recall that the majority of

individuals in the bottom 40% of the initial credit score distribution had a vantage score below

700 at the beginning of the sample, which is considered subprime. So low credit score individuals

accounted for a sizable amount of total debt by 2007. As Figure 10 shows, much higher default

rates translated into a large fraction of total delinquencies by the bottom 40% of the credit score

distribution in 2008.

       An alternative approach to constructing credit score bins would be to ensure that each bin

contains 20% of the total debt outstanding as of 2006 as opposed to 20% of the individuals. This

may be the more relevant sort from an aggregate investor perspective, as it measures the share of

defaults for the same principal at risk across the five bins.2 Figure 11 shows an even higher share

of defaults for the low credit score bins using this alternative weighting scheme. Delinquencies on

the 20% of total debt in 2006 held by the lowest credit score individuals accounts for over 50% of

all delinquencies in 2007, and 48% in 2008.

       In Table 7, we examine the share of all delinquencies using the double sort of initial credit score

quintile and zip-code level house price growth. As it shows, the default crisis was driven by low
   2
    Of course, this means there will not be the same number of individuals in each bin – in particular, the lower
credit score bin contains more individuals under this alternative weighting scheme.

include 18% of the sample, but 39% of the defaults.


5.2   Contrasting with other research

The results in Figure 9, Figure 10, and Table 7 stand in contrast to the evidence in Adelino, Schoar,

and Severino (2015) who say “...borrowers in the middle and top of the income distribution, as well

as those with credit scores above 660, are the ones that contributed most significantly to the increase

in the dollar value of mortgages in default after 2007.” Why is there a discrepancy? One reason

discussed in Mian and Sufi (2015) is that Adelino, Schoar, and Severino (2015) rely on income

reported on mortgage applications that is fraudulently overstated in lower income areas. But this

concern is less important when sorting by credit scores.

   We believe a number of factos explain the discrepancy. First, Adelino, Schoar, and Severino

(2015) use a data set that systematically under-represents mortgages to low credit score individuals.

The data used by Adelino, Schoar, and Severino (2015) is based on mortgage loan originations for

home purchase in 2006 recorded by Lender Processing Services (LPS). As Adelino, Schoar, and

Severino (2015) note, LPS “covers approximately 60 percent of the U.S. mortgage market.” They

do not, however, discuss any potential biases due to the mortgages that are missing in LPS.

   Existing research demonstrates that LPS systematically misses mortgages made to low credit

score individuals. As Keys, Mukherjee, Seru, and Vig (2010) note, “... the McDash/LPS database

significantly under-represents the subprime market before 2005 and even after 2005 covers only

about 30% of originated non-agency loans.” Keys, Mukherjee, Seru, and Vig (2010) compare a

data set that captures 90% of subprime mortgages (Loan Performance) with LPS, and they find

that LPS captures only 17% of subprime mortgages with low documentation originated in 2006

(see their Figure 15). Amromin and Paulson also note that the LPS data cover only a fraction

of the subprime market. Recall that Adelino, Schoar, and Severino (2015) focus on the share of

debt in delinquency, not default rates. If their data set systematically misses mortgages to low

credit score individuals, the the fraction of total delinquencies by low credit score individuals will

be systematically biased downward.

   There is another reason for the discrepancy based on changes in credit scores over time. Adelino,

Schoar, and Severino (2015) sort individuals into groups based on the credit score at origination

                                                  14
on home purchase mortgages in 2006. We sort individuals into groups based on their credit score

before the boom in house prices and household debt. We sort on credit scores before the boom

because, as Mian and Sufi (2011) show, low credit score individuals living in high house price

growth areas saw a sharp relative decline in defaults from 1997 to 2005 (see the middle panel of

their Figure 5). In that study, we argue lower default rates were due to the ability of homeowners in

high house price growth areas to extract equity to avoid default in case of a negative shock such as

unemployment (e.g., Hurst and Stafford (2004)). When house prices crashed, the pattern reverses

and default rates increase by far more for the same households that saw the largest drop in default

rates during the boom.

   Because of the lower default rates during the boom, low initial credit score homeowners in high

house price growth areas saw the largest increase in their credit scores from 2000 to 2006. Table 8

shows that the largest increase in credit scores occurred among the lowest 40% of the credit score

distribution living in high house price growth areas (the top right four cells). We know from Table

7 that these individuals made up the largest share of defaults in 2008. In other words, conditional

on the 2006 credit score, the increase in credit scores from 2000 to 2006 predicts higher defaults in

2008, a result we confirm in a regression framework.

   We sort individuals in the top right cells of Table 8 into low credit score bins based on their

1997 credit score, whereas the methodology of Adelino, Schoar, and Severino (2015) would sort

them into higher credit score bins based on their 2006 credit score. Their sort mechanically shows

higher default rates among high credit score individuals because of the endogeneity of credit scores

with respect to the housing boom. This is why our research always sorts on initial credit scores

before the housing boom when examining the expansion in debt and the subsequent default crisis

(Mian and Sufi (2009), Mian and Sufi (2011)).

   Finally, Adelino, Schoar, and Severino (2015) focus only on defaults on home purchase mortgages

originated in 2006. We focus on the universe of all defaults on any debt outstanding. There may be

systematic differences in default rates or originated amounts on home purchase mortgages in 2006

versus all debt outstanding. For example, it may be that LPS does not include second mortgages

or home equity lines, which have higher default rates and originated amounts for lower credit score

individuals. Or alternatively, it could be that the highest share of mortgages for low credit score

borrowers was originated in years other than 2006. The use of credit bureau data avoids these

                                                 15
problems, as it includes all debt outstanding and all defaults.



6    Conclusion

Our purpose in this study is to present facts on which individuals drove the rise in household debt

from 2000 to 2007 and the subsequent default crisis during the Great Recession. Using individual

level credit bureau data, we show the following four facts:


    • Individuals with low credit scores as of 1997 had the largest growth in debt from 2000 to

      2007, and this fact is not driven by differences in age or initial debt levels

    • Individuals in the 20th to 60th percentile of the initial credit score distribution contributed

      most to the dollar rise in household debt from 2000 to 2007; individuals in the highest 20%

      of the credit score contributed the least

    • Low credit score individuals saw the largest increase in debt in high house price growth zip

      codes, consistent with the importance of home-equity based borrowing. Borrowing by the

      highest credit score individuals was completely unresponsive to higher house price growth

    • The household debt default crisis from 2007 to 2010 was driven primarily by individuals

      in the lowest 40% of the credit score distribution, who had much higher default rates and

      contributed most to the total debt amount in delinquency


    We have purposefully avoided causal statements up to this point. However, we believe all of the

facts presented here are consistent with the narrative of our research that more carefully considers

causation and alternative hypotheses. In Mian and Sufi (2009), we examined zip-code level data

on new mortgage originations for the purpose of home purchase, and we found that mortgage

origination growth was strongest in low credit score zip codes. This is consistent with the evidence

presented here that low credit score individuals had the largest growth in debt from 2000 to 2007.

We also argued that the expansion of credit to low credit score individuals triggered the mortgage

default crisis in 2007 and early 2008. The results on delinquencies and default rates presented here

support that view.




                                                  16
   In Mian and Sufi (2011), we argued that rising house prices had a causal effect on borrowing

by existing homeowners, and this home-equity based borrowing was responsible for a large fraction

of the overall rise in household debt. We also argued that the elasticity of borrowing with respect

to house price growth was strongest among low credit score individuals, but it was only zero for

the highest credit score individuals. As we said, “for a consumer one standard deviation above the

mean 1997 credit score, the elasticity of debt with respect to house prices is 0.35. For a consumer

one standard deviation below the mean 1997 credit score, the elasticity is 0.76.” The facts presented

here are consistent with these findings. Only the top quintile of the credit score distribution sees no

relation between house price growth and debt growth. The relation is present for the bottom 80%

of the credit score distribution. We also argued that aggressive borrowing against home equity was

responsible for higher default rates among homeowners during the Great Recession. In this study,

we find that low credit score individuals living in high house price growth zip codes contributed

most to the overall rise in defaults.
