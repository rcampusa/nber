  THE IMPACT OF CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING ON INDUSTRIAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT


                                    ABSTRACT
     This paper investigates whether the recent wave of corporate
restructuring in the United States has had a negative impact on research
arid development investment by industrial firms. Using a newly
constructed sample of about 2500 manufacturing firms from 1974 to 1987,
I examine three major classes of restructuring events: leveraged buyouts
and other "going private" transactions, mergers and acquisitions in
general, and substantial increases in leverage.

     The major conclusions are first, that leveraged buyouts do not
occur in R&D-intensive sectors or firms and cannot therefore be having
much of an impact on R&D spending; rather, the evidence seems consistent
with an agency cost and cash flow-driven model of buyouts. Second,
major increases in leverage are followed by substantial declines in the
R&D intensity of the firms in question, and the effect takes at least
three years to work through. Finally, although the evidence on
acquisitions by publicly traded firms is mixed, the basic conclusion is
that any declines in the R&D intensity of acquiring firms relative to
their past history appear to be associated with the leverage structure
of the transaction rather than the acquisition itself.

I. Introduction

     It is a widely held view that the wave of mergers, leveraged buyouts,

and restructurings in the corporate sector during the 1980s has had and

will have a detrimental effect on industrial spending on research and the

development of new products and processes in the United States. Critics of

this recent activity point to the stagnation in real R&D expenditures by

the private sector during the eighties and suggest that these

restructurings are a major cause of the decline.1 Others view this process

as a healthy revitalization of U.S. industry in the face of foreign

competition and a changing regulatory and financial environment.2

     Why are so many people concerned about this increase in restructuring




1See, for example, the National Science Foundation report, "Corporate
Mergers Implicated in Slowed Industrial R&D Spending," March 1989, which
identified 24 companies among the top 200 R&D performers which had
undergone mergers or other restructurings in 1984-1986. The report
found that the R&D expenditures of these firms declined by 5.3 percent
from 1986 to 1987, while those for the rest of the sample rose by 5.4
percent during the same period.
2See, for example, Michael C. Jensen, "Agency Cost of Free Cash Flow,
Corporate Finance, and Takeovers," American Economic Review 76 (1986), pp.
323-339, and "Eclipse of the Public Corporation," Harvard business Review
(Sept.-Oct. 1989), pp. 61-74 for arguments of this sort.

activity? After all, the traditional view of economists (at least since

the work of Miller and Modigliani)3 has been that the investment policy of

the firm should be independent of its choice of financial structure; one

implication of this theoretical result is that the R&D policy of a firm

should be unaffected by its choice of leverage. Yet it is clear that many

economists and businessmen believe that the increases in debt-equity ratios

which are typical of the corporate restructurings and acquisitions of the

present day put pressure on the firm to use its cash flow to service the

long term debt at the expense of investments, particularly those of a

long term nature such as R&D. The argument is that substituting debt for

equity substitutes a fixed interest obligation for the optional dividends

which were formerly paid to shareholders, thus leaving the discretionary

spending of earnings vulnerable to downturns in the industry or economy.

     This argument, while superficially persuasive, has several obvious

problems; first, if good (high payback) investment projects are available,

the firm should be able to finance them by going again to the equity or

debt markets when retained earnings are not available. The source of

financing for these projects should have nothing whatever to do with

whether they are undertaken. Second, if the merger, acquisition, or LBO

truly causes good projects to be canceled, the firm should be worth less

under the new ownership form, and the shareholders should not have accepted

an offer which reflects this lower value, or conversely, the buyers should

not have been willing to offer more than the current trading price.

Finance and the Theory of Investment," American Economic Review 48, pp.

Growth, and the Valuation of Shares," Journal     Business 34, pp. 411-433..



                                 2
    Most of those who stress the beneficial effect of takeover and

restructuring activity would agree with the second of the above arguments,

but not the first; that is, they do not rely on Miller-Modigliani in its

pure form, but argue that the market values the firm's prospects correctly,

but that managers have a tendency to make the wrong (from the point of view

of the shareholder) investment choices and thus a firm can be "undervalued'

by a market which perceives this fact but is not 100 percent certain that a

raider will come along to correct the situation. In other words, they

would argue that in many cases, diverting the cash flow being spent on

investment projects to interest payments on debt is a good discipline for

the firm's managers, since they have a tendency to invest in projects whose

return is lower than alternatives which would be available to the firm's

shareholders if they instead received the earnings as dividends.4 An

implication of this "efficient markets" view of corporate restructuring is

that substantial increases in debt should occur in firms and industries

where the available investment projects are low return (such as shrinking,

older industries and those without a strong technological base).

     Thus there are two different arguments which imply that increases in

corporate restructuring, particularly those associated with increases in

leverage, will be associated with declines in R&D spending (and investment

in general), but these two arguments lead to opposing conclusions as to the

social cost or benefit of such changes. The first (optimistic?) view is

that financial markets are "efficient", but the managers of firms do not

always act in the shareholders' interest (agency costs). Because long-term




4Michael C. Jensen (1986).




                                 3
debt provides managerial discipline, and the market knows this, we tend to

see leveraging occur in industries and situations where good payback

projects are not available (i.e., where R&D is low or ought to be). Thus

we expect R&D to fall after a (leveraged) acquisition in this story, but

this fact has no negative connotation.

     The second argument assumes that financial markets are myopic, and do

not value long term investments like R&D properly, so that firms which

undertake them may be undervalued and provide attractive takeover

opportunities. After the takeover event (or the successful defense of a

hostile takeover), potentially "good" R&D projects are cut in order to

sustain the interest payments on the increased long term debt. The

implication of this argument is that market myopia is to blame and that the

public good may be served by interfering with the takeover process.

     The main distinction between these two lines of reasoning is in the

results: both suggest that increases in debt will be followed by cuts in

R&D projects, but in the first case this is at the least privately optimal,

whereas in the second, R&D projects which have high potential rates of

return may be cut. Owing to the fact that we do not observe these projects

and their outcomes, it is difficult to see how to choose between these two

pictures of the world except by indirect evidence: we can investigate the

general question of whether there does appear to be market myopia with

respect to R&D investment, or we can explore the characteristics of the

actual transactions -   - in which   industries do they occur, what kinds of

projects appear to be cut, is there evidence that R&D is actually being

threatened.

     There already exist several pieces of evidence to suggest that

financial markets are not completely myopic with respect to R&D spending:



                                     4
these studies are of two different types, a pair of event studies in the

finance literature,5 and a series of total market value studies including
               6
R&D capital.       The event studies investigate the immediate stock price

effect of an announcement of an increase in R&D spending; the argument is

that if the market is myopic, the announcement of such a long-term

investment project should have a negative price effect because the market

expects that short-term earnings will be adversely affected. Jarrell et

al. studied 62 firms that announced an increase in R&D spending and found

that the average 20-day appreciation in the stock of such firms was 1.8

percent. The Woolridge study controlled more carefully for R&D investment

announcements which were accompanied by other earnings news, and still

found a 30-day excess return of 1.5 percent associated with R&D increases

for 45 such announcements. This evidence argues against extreme market

myopia, but a drawback of this type of approach is that it says nothing

about whether the size if the market reaction is of the right order of

magnitude: does the increase in value of the firm have any connection to

the expected present discounted value of the (surprise in) the returns to

be generated from this investment increase? If not, the market may still

be discriminating against such investments.

November 1988).



                                    5
     A similar argument, but one applied to managerial myopia rather than

market myopia is presented by Stein:7 "The more reluctant managers are to

invest, the higher will be the present value of those few projects that

they do find sufficiently attractive to undertake and, hence, the more

positive should be the market reaction to the announcement of a new

investment." The same type of reasoning suggests that value-maximizing

managers facing a myopic stock market may choose to undertake only

very high-return R&D projects, but these would still produce positive

announcement effects.

     The other type of evidence is a long-term analysis in levels: the

basic idea is to regress the total market value of the firm (debt plus

equity) on the book value of the assets, both tangible and intangible,

arguing that long run equilibrium implies that all the assets should be

priced at their book value on average, at least in the cross section.

Departures from a coefficient of unity are interpreted as an overpricing or

underpricing of the particular asset by the market. The regressions are

usually performed with the intangible assets (the stock of R&D capital or

patents, advertising, etc.) measured relative to the physical assets, so

that the coefficient measures the relative price of such capital (a

coefficient of unity is not imposed on the tangible assets). The results

here strongly indicate that R&D capital is not seriously underpriced

(Cockburn and Criliches obtain a coefficient of around 1.4, while I get

about 0.9 using a larger sample of firms for more years; both studies find

a coefficient for tangible assets which is insignificantly different from

Political Economy 96 (February 1988): pp. 61-80.



                                 6
unity). However, belief that this coefficient represents the market's

pricing of R&D investment rests crucially on the choice of depreciation

rate used to construct the R&D capital.8 If the depreciation rate were

actually higher than the 15 percent used in both studies (a likely

possibility, since for these purposes, the depreciation rate we want

measures the decline in the atproDriable R&D capital), the true value of

the coefficient would be even higher. An interesting finding in both these

studies is that the valuation of the current R&D flow is even higher than

that predicted by the coefficient of the stock, which does suggest that

rapid depreciation is taking place.

     Taken together, these pieces of evidence seem to rule out total market

myopia towards long-term investment as a reasonable hypothesis; no one who

reads the glossy annual reports of high technology companies, which trumpet

their R&D spending, would seriously entertain the idea that the market does

not value it at all. However, there are limitations to this approach: the

event studies do not really tell whether we got the correct order of

magnitude, only that the sign was right. The market value studies are

flawed in that there is typically a one-to-one relationship between the

 "depreciation" of R&D and the coefficient of the stock, so that we cannot

tell precisely whether financial markets value the R&D stock correctly, but

only that they value it.

     Thus, in this paper I take a different approach to investigating




 8This is not a new point: see, for example, Zvi Griliches (1981). See

 Patents, Research Gestation Lags, and the Private Rate of Return to

 depreciation or decay rates for the appropriable revenues from R&D
 expenditures.

whether financial markets discriminate against long-term investments (and

thus ignore the returns to such investment while encouraging financial

restructurings). I focus on the R&D characteristics and outcomes of the

actual restructurings which occur, and attempt informally to see which of

the two descriptions of the world seem consistent with the facts.

     The goal of the paper is to assess the empirical evidence on the

implications of corporate restructuring on industrial research spending,

focusing specifically on the manufacturing sector of the economy, where

most industrial R&D is performed. To this end, I have constructed a new

panel dataset for U.S. manufacturing firms from the Compustat files,9

containing publicly available data on the R&D spending and other

characteristics of about 2500 firms from 1959 through 1987 (annual data)

I use this file to investigate the actual consequences for R&D spending of

the different types of changes in corporate structure which have taken

place in the last ten years: mergers and acquisitions, both public and

private, leveraged buyouts, and increases in debt levels which are not

accompanied by ownership changes. After collecting the evidence, I turn to

an examination of what the results can and cannot tell us about the

questions posed at the beginning of the introduction.

aggregate trends in industrial research and corporate restructurings in

order to define more carefully the facts which I would like to explain. In

spite of attempts by researchers here and abroad to find better measures of

innovative activity, expenditures on Research and Development remain the

most widely available and best measured of the so-called "scientific

indicators."11 Since they are also almost the only data on innovation

available at the firm level at this time,12 I rely on them exclusively in

what follows.

     Figure 1 shows three different measures of the level of real

industrial R&D expenditures between 1972 and 1987. The solid curve is the

total amount of R&D expenditure which industrial firms funded themselves

(that is, was not paid for by the government or other source), as reported

to NSF.13'14 The concern raised by the data behind this figure is that while

R&D grew at an average rate of close to 7 percent per annum in real

have also used patent statistics for this purpose [see Zvi Criliches, Ariel
Pakes, and Bronwyn H. Hall, "The Value of Patents as Indicators of
Inventive Activity," in Partha Dasgupta and Paul Stoneman, eds., Economic
Policy and Technological Performance (Cambridge: Cambridge University
Press, 1987) for a summary of this work. Owing both to the fact that we
have found patents and R&D to be highly correlated in the cross section in
the past, with patents a far noisier measure than R&D, and because budget
and time constraints preclude the data construction effort needed to add
individual firm patent counts to my new panel dataset, I have chosen not
use patents here. I may attempt to incorporate them in future work on this
topic.

terms between 1979 and 1984, the rate of growth has dropped to two percent

per annum in the last three or four years; examination of aggregate

investment patterns during the same period shows a smaller decline, from a

growth rate of four percent per annum to approximately zero)5 Is this

decline related to the increase in corporate restructuring, as some would

suggest? Certainly the timing is right: Table I shows that the total size

(in terms of numbers of employees) of corporate restructurings was roughly

constant between 1978 and 1984, and then doubled suddenly in 1985,

increasing again in 1986 to three times its earlier level. Before I

discuss this table in detail, however, I will digress slightly to describe

briefly how it and my dataset were constructed.

     Most of the empirical results in this paper are based on the first

results from a large dataset construction effort to build a new panel of

Compustat firms in manufacturing which contains data from 1959 through 1987

for firms on Compustat during at least one year between 1976 and 1987.16

This sample consists of about 2500 manufacturing firms which were in

existence sometime between 1976 and 1987, augmented by a few

non-manufacturing firms which were formerly manufacturing firms or which

acquired manufacturing firms during the period. In the course of the

construction of this panel dataset, I identified about 1200 firms which had

exited by the last year (1987). For all these firms, the reason for exit

(type of acquisition, bankruptcy, liquidation, name change, or other

reason), the actual year of the event, the stock market value at the time

                                10
of exit (acquisition or liquidation price), and the name of the acquirer

were looked up in variety of printed sources.17 After cleaning and checking

all the exits, I obtained the final result that about 480 of these had been

acquired during the period by other publicly traded firms, about 100 by

foreign firms, and about 250 went private through LEO   or   other transaction.

Approximately 130 went bankrupt or were liquidated. The remainder were not

true exits, but were name changes or delistings from the stock exchanges.18

     This list of exits is a key input into the study of corporate

restructurings, since all such events which involve an entire firm will

appear on this list except for the case where a firm restructures by buying

back its stock and issuing a large amount of debt, i.e., by increasing its

leverage ratio substantially. Using this dataset, however, I attempted to

identify these cases as well, by computing the change in long term debt

for each firm from year-to-year and dividing it by the market

capitalization of the firm at the beginning of the year (that is, by the

sum of debt and equity). Firms with changes in debt which were larger than

75 percent of this number in any one year were deemed to have restructured

during that year.

     The table shows that acquisitions of all types (where size is




17Key sources are the .11. Street Journal Index (Princeton, N.J.: Dow Jones
Books), Capital Cbaiwes Reporter (Chicago: Commerce Clearing House), and

LSThe delistings are a small fraction of the total (about 30 firms, mostly
very small) which generally were delisted because of financial distress
(valueless stock) or because shareholder interest fell below the cutoffs
imposed by the exchanges; to a great extent, firms of this type exit for
another reason such as liquidation or acquisition, but the few which I
cannot identify as having done so end up in this class. The name changes
and other reorganizations are larger in number (about 200 firms during the
period), and for these firms I attempt to splice the data for the
reorganized or renamed firm, when I can find it on the file, to that from
the old firm. Most of the time I was successful in this effort.

                                 11
measured by the number of employees) have been increasing in the

manufacturing sector during the 1980s, with the increase in acquisitions by

privately held or foreign firms occurring somewhat later than the rise in

leveraging or acquisitions as a whole. In 1977, only-one half of 1

percent of employment in this sector was affected by these transactions,

whereas in 1986 (the last year for which complete data are available) 6.4

percent of employment was.

     Does my panel dataset show the same type of aggregate R&D behavior as

the NSF numbers? To answer this question, I look again at Figure 1: The

top curve is the total R&D expenditure by firms in my sample.19 The

closeness of this series to the NSF data up until about 1984 is a bit

misleading, since neither one is a subset of the other: the primary

differences are that the NSF numbers include R&D done by non-publicly

traded firms, and the Compustat numbers (my sample) contain

foreign-performed R&D as well as domestic. I show both series so that one

can get some idea of how my sample reflects the economy as a whole. The

increasing divergence in the two series is undoubtedly due to the

increasing presence of foreign firms on U.S. stock market exchanges and the

increasing performance of U.S. R&D abroad (which is included in the

Compustat numbers, but not in NSFs).




19lnitial analysis of the data for firms in my sample revealed a shortfall
of the number of firms with good data in 1987. This turned out to be due
to the fact that Compustat had not yet updated the data series for
approximately 140 of the 1650 firms in my sample in 1987; those which were
missing data were predominantly smaller firms from the OTC file. In order
not to bias the interpretation of the trends too much, I have adjusted the
1987 figures to reflect the fraction of the firms which were missing 1987
data, using the employment figures for these firms from the previous year.
This yields about a seven percent increase in any totals for 1987,
including those in Figures 1 and 2.



                                 12
     To verify this and examine the discrepancies further, in the same

figure I show the R&D expenditure for Compustat firms with the expenditures

by foreign-owned firms which are included in the database removed (the

bottom curve).20 This series tracks the NSF series very closely until the

last two or three years. where it does not show the same type of decline

(but remember that the 1987 numbers are partially estimated due to the

incompleteness of the sample for this year). The remaining discrepancy is

undoubtedly due to the few privately held firms in the United States which

report R&D to NSF, but are not required to file 10-Ks with the Securities

and Exchange Commission.

     Figure 2 shows the same result in a different way: the growth rates

of real R&D expenditure from NSF and for the domestic portion of the

Compustat sample are very close until 1986, when my data shows less of a

decline than NSF; the major remaining discrepancy in the data is due to R&D

performed abroad by U.S. firms, which may indeed have been increasing,

accounting for the difference between the two sets of numbers. The

conclusion to be drawn from these two figures is that my data will be

adequate for drawing conclusions about the effects of corporate

restructuring on aggregate R&D, although changes in the very recent past

may be somewhat imprecisely measured, since the Compustat data shows much

less of a decline than the NSF data.



II. Private Acquisitions and Leveraged Buyouts

     I begin by examining a type of restructuring that has been




     1972, this spending comprised only 3 percent of the total, but by
1987 it had risen to 18 percent, so that including it in the total will
seriously bias conclusions about aggregate R&D spending by U.S. firms.


                                13
specifically attacked as a major cause of declines in R&D spending, but

which turns out to be a very minor part of the story in manufacturing: the

"going private" transaction, and in particular, the leveraged buyout.

Leveraged buyout is the general term used for a transaction which changes

both the ownership and financial structure of a public corporation. In a

typical buyout, the firm changes from a public company to one that is

privately held by a small group of investors including management, and the

equity of the firm is replaced to a large extent by corporate debt held by

banks, insurance companies, and other purchasers of high-yield debt. The

benefits of this kind of restructuring are held to be twofold: first, for

some firms, debt may be a relatively cheaper form of financing than equity,

and second, concentrating the ownership of the firm in the hands of a few

managers and friendly banks may reduce or eliminate the agency costs which

arise when the ownership of the firm is widely dispersed across public

shareholders.

     Kohlberg, Kravis, and Roberts, an investment firm which assists in a

great many of these transactions, summarize their criteria for selecting

companies as follows:21 1) a history of profitability and steady cash flow,

2) products with well-known brand names and strong market position, 3)

low-cost producers, 4) potential for real growth without cyclical swings in

profitability, 5) products which are not subject to rapid technological

change. Looking over these criteria, the goal seems clear: minimize

volatility in earnings and ensure a stable source of rents so that the debt

involved can be serviced. These criteria, particularly the last, will not

generally select in favor of firms where R&D is important, which increases

the probability that the LBO offer will dominate an offer financed in a

different manner (under the assumption the markets are efficient, at least

at acquisition time).

     It is perhaps natural that practitioners of the LEO should focus on

the problem of servicing the debt incurred by the transaction and that

therefore they should appear to be focused exclusively on the cash flow

properties of the asset in question. However, Williamson22 has provided an

alternative, although complementary, view of the motivation of the

leveraged buyout. His argument is that the LEO will take place in a firm

where the leverage ratio has gotten out of alignment, due to the maturity

of the line of business and the size of the tangible assets. Although

these characteristics are correlated with smooth cash flow, there are

important differences: for example, a major asset of many firms

experiencing LBOs is not redeployable, but can be relied upon to generate a

steady source of rents. This asset may be loosely labelled "brand name

recognition." It is created by a combination of investments, tangible and

intangible (advertising), and is likely to be greater in more mature firms.

     The assets created by investments in R&D are precisely those which are

not very redeployable (and are often difficult to transfer without

substantial investments by the receiving firm): the knowledge of how to

operate a new process or make a new product. A foreclosing bank is likely

 to discount an R&D laboratory and the human capital vested in its employees

 far more highly than it will discount the value of an office building or

factory full of general purpose equipment. Thus both cash flow and asset

specificity considerations argue strongly that LBOs will not take place in

firms and industries where R&D is important. In the following I

investigate whether that is indeed the case.

       In my sample of approximately 700 acquisitions of publicly traded

manufacturing firms between 1977 and 1988, I was able to identify about 80

acquisitions as leveraged buyouts using several sources: a list kindly

supplied to me by Steven Kaplan, the cJall Street Journal articles reporting

the event, and the Kerer jj     Acciuisition   Sourcebook, which reports the

type of financing used to make an acquisition. The remainder of the

acquisitions where the acquirer was not another publicly traded firm (about

180 of them) were generally smaller and could not be clearly identified as

management or leveraged buyouts, although it is possible that some of them

are.

       Table 2 shows the total number of acquisitions which occurred in each

year between 1977 and 1987 and the number of those which were leveraged

buyouts and other "going private' transactions.23 To give an idea of the

increasing size and importance of the LBO, the next five columns show the

total employment involved, the average number of employees in each type

of deal, and the percent of manufacturing sector employment which was

affected. It is clear from the table that the number and size of each LBO

have increased during the mid—eighties, while the private acquisitions

have remained roughly constant in size (while increasing in number).

     have excluded from this table transactions in my sample which took
place in 1988 and 1989, since this part of the sample is incomplete and
would give a misleading picture of the aggregate.




                                  16
However, note that only in 1987 has the number of employees affected risen

above 1 percent of the total. Although a great deal of ink has been

spilled about these types of transactions, they are still small relative to

the sector as a whole.

     Table 3 examines the industrial composition of the LBOs, paying

particular attention to the amount of research and development investment

involved (the data for the private acquisitions are very similar and are

omitted to save space). The first column characterizes the R&D performance

of the industry by displaying the average R&D intensity of all the firms

within that industry in 1976 (the year the sample was drawn). The next two

columns show the number of LBOs which occurred in that industry and the

total number of employees involved. It is easy to see from these adjacent

columns that industries with high R&D intensity are industries where little

L0 activity takes place: There are only seven LBOs (with 70,000 employees)
                        24
in the six industries        where R&D is greater than 2 percent of sales on

average, while there are 58 (with over 600,000 employees) in the ten

industries where R&D is less than 1 percent of sales.25

     The final three columns assess the potential impact of these leveraged

buyouts on the different industries. The column labelled "Total industrial

R&D" gives the spending by all the Compustat firms in the industry in 1982,

while the column labelled "R&D in LBOs" gives the R&D spending for each

firm involved in an LB0 for the year closest to the transaction for which



24 Two of these LEOs account for most of the employment acquired in these
industries: Revlon, which is not really in a high-tech industry, and
Lear-Siegler, an aerospace-automotive-electronics conglomerate.
25For the private transactions, the results are even stronger: there are 24
transactions in the six high-R&D industries involving 25,000 employees, but
144 in the ten low-R&D industries involving 467,000 employees.



                                     17
the data were available (usually one or two years before) .   These figures

have been deflated so that they are all in 1982 dollars for   comparability.26

The percentage figures are intended to give an idea of the importance of

the transactions for R&D in any given industry; since the numerator is

measured over several years and the denominator is a flow variable (the R&D

spending in 1982), these figures are a very rough measure of the importance

of the transactions to the R&D of the industry.

     These columns show that only in the Textile, Rubber and Plastics, and

Stone, Clay, and Glass industries is a significant share of R&D investment

even involved in these transactions. In terms of absolute magnitudes, five

industries account for over 75 percent of the R&D acquired through LBOs:

Textiles, Pharmaceuticals ($100 million of which is the previously

mentioned Revlon transaction), Rubber and Plastics, Electronics (the

Lear-Siegler buyout), and the Automotive industry. Aside from the Revlon

and Lear-Siegler deals, the main story seems to be one in which the

leveraged buyout facilitates the shrinkage of an older, low-tech   industry.27

Such industries already have had low R&D spending for a long time, so that

increases in LBO activity have very little effect. Another way to see this

is to note that the 762,000 employees involved are about 4 percent of the

total employment in 1982, while the $471 million of R&D is only 1 percent

of the total in 1982. Both the industries involved and the relative

unimportance of R&D confirm that LBO activity is largely confined to

sectors which are not technologically oriented.

     Although I would like to study the subsequent history of those firms

which went private via leveraged buyouts, this is difficult because in many

cases they no longer must file 10-Ks with the SEC (this is in fact one of

the stated reasons for going private). In spite of this fact, Kaplan28 has

found that for at least some of these LBOs it is possible to find

publicly-reported post-buyout data. For his sample of about 40 LBOs, he

finds that only seven are even performing R&D, before or after the buyout.29

Using an entirely different sampling methodology (the establishment-based

Census of Manufacturing coupled with data from the previously mentioned NSF
                                       30
RD-i Survey), Lichtenberg and Siegel        have analyzed the 43 firms which

underwent LBOs between 1981 and 1986 and also were surveyed by NSF.31 They

found that the R&D intensity of those firms which were performing &fl

increased by roughly the same amount as non-LBO firms during the same
period, although the average intensity of even the R&D-doing firms which

underwent LBOs was half that of the sample of R&D performers as a whole.

This last fact is consistent with my results.

     The major conclusion from this part of the investigation is that

restructurings which take manufacturing firms private do not pose a major

threat to R&D investment in the United States. This is not because R&D is

necessarily maintained at the same levels after such transactions (which

often do involve increased levels of debt), but because R&D-intensive firms

and high-technology industries are not good candidates for these

acquisitions. In addition, the limited evidence we have does suggest that

even in those cases where an R&D-performing firm does undergo a leveraged

buyout, the newly private firm maintains the same pattern of investment.

These facts, together with the Lichtenberg and Siegel results on

productivity increases following LBOs,32 lend credence to the "efficient

markets" view of at least this type of restructuring activity. In the next

section I move on to look at a far more important set of acquisitions,

those by other publicly traded firms, which affect three times as many

employees as those discussed in this section of the paper.



III. Acciuisition Activity j the Manufacturing Sector

     In previous work33 I investigated the relationship between the increase

in acquisition activity in the U.S. corporate sector in the early eighties

and R&D investment using a large panel of U.S. manufacturing firms.      I


found that the manufacturing sector acquisitions from 1976 to 1986 fell

into two main groups: half were acquired by firms in my sample (the

publicly traded manufacturing sector), and half by private or foreign

firms. The latter group were disproportionately in low-tech industries

(most of which are low-growth also), and accounted for only fourteen

percent of the total R&D that was acquired and less than one percent of the




32Lichtenberg and Siegel (June 1989). They find significant increases in
productivity growth at the plant level in the five years following an LEO,
and substantial reductions in Central Office overhead expense, which argues
for the efficiency-enhancing aspects of these transactions.

total R&D in the manufacturing sector. We have already seen that this

characterization of at least the private acquisitions holds when I

extend the period examined through 1987.

     I then went on to investigate what happened afterwards in the sample

of acquisitions which remained in the publicly traded sector. Using a

sample of about 300 acquisitions, I calculated the change in R&D     intensity
for the combined firm pre- and post-merger (over two and three year

intervals). There was no significant evidence of declines in spending,

although the relatively short intervals after merger and small samples at

the industry level made the tests somewhat less than conclusive. The

same question was also studied by Fusfeld35 using a much smaller (9

observations) sample of significant financial restructurings, and he

reached the same conclusion. In both studies, there is evidence that

longer periods after merger should be examined. In addition, the recently

completed study of 24 major mergers and restructurings by the National

Science Foundation previously cited36 provides evidence of a substantial

decline in R&D spending after acquisition or other restructuring. All of

this suggests that the question is worth further investigation.

     Why are the NSF results different from mine and Fusfeld's? There are




34The acquisitions by foreign firms are a different matter; the total size
of these transactions in the two years 1986 and 1987 was the same as in the
previous ten years, and their R&D and industry profiles are more like that
of the public acquisitions now, although somewhat less R&D-intensive. They
appear to be driven by the increasing globalization of the economy rather
than by the desire to increase leverage.

several possibilities: as mentioned above, they use a different data source

(the RD-i survey conducted for them by the Census Bureau, which is

confidential), the period they examine is somewhat more recent, they focus

specifically on restructurings which are not necessarily acquisitions, and

they use a different measure of R&D performance, the level of R&D

expenditures rather than R&D intensity. It is unlikely that the

differences between the two data sources for R&D spending, the 10-K report

and the RD-i survey, will be systematically biased, although they are

undoubtedly different.37 However, as Lichtenberg and Siegel38 point out, the

NSF sample consisted of one major LBO and seven other restructurings in

addition to 16 acquisitions, so the samples are not directly comparable.

The most important difference is that NSF used the level of R&D investment

rather than the intensity, which I would argue is misleading, since it

fails to adjust for the overall change in the average size of manufacturing

firms during the same period. The discrepancy is magnified both because

the majority of these restructurings seem to be directed at shrinking the

firms and because the overall size of the manufacturing sector was

shrinking at the same time.

     My previous study used data on acquisitions which took place before

1987 and my panel actually ended in 1985, so I was not able to track




37These differences have been discussed earlier; at the individual firm
level, the primary differences are that the NSF numbers do not include R&D
spending by U.S. firms abroad, nor do they include contracted out research
or some routine engineering expenditures (National Science Foundation,
Comparative Analysis    Information    National Industrial B Expenditures
(Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office), Special Report
85-311). None of these differences (which affect a subset of the firms,
mostly the larger ones) are likely to be large enough to change conclusions
about R&D growth in firms undergoing acquisition.

post-acquisition R&D   for   mergers which took place in 1985 and 1986 very

well. Therefore I now repeat my earlier test for post-acquisition

declines in R&D intensity using the 480 acquisitions in my new sample. The

distribution of two year changes in combined-firm R&D intensity for firms

which participated in mergers and for those who did not is shown in Figure

3. For firms which were not acquired, the average two-year change over the

whole 1976 to 1987 period is used.

       The figure shows both the changes for all firms, including those which

report no R&D during the period, and then the changes only for those firms

which do have R&D data both before and after the acquisition.39 The top

part of the figure tells a slightly different story from my 1987 paper:

there does appear to be a significant difference between the distributions

for mergers and non-mergers. This is confirmed by a non-parametric

Wilcoxon test for differences in the distribution, which yields a x2(l) —

9.5.    The difference between the two distributions is small, but it is

significant. However, it does not occur when we confine the sample to those

firms which reported R&D both before and after the acquisition; for the

bottom panel of the figure, the Wilcoxon test yields a 2(l) —      0.5.   This

implies that most of the decline is coming from R&D-doing firms which are

absorbed into firms which do not report R&D.4°




39Firtns are mandated both by the Financial Accounting Standards Board and by
the SEC to report R&D expenditures in their Annual Reports if they are
"material". Most of the firms in the technology sector do so,
particularly since they view it as a positive signal for investors. When
R&D is not reported, it usually means that the R&D to sales ratio is very
low. However, there can be exceptions to this rule for some firms in some
years; for the small number of cases where this happens for one year out of
many with positive R&D, I have interpolated the missing number.
40There are about 80 such firms in the sample, and about 50 firms which did
not report R&D before being acquired, but whose acquirers did afterwards.
The number of acquirers which switch from reporting R&D to rion-reportirg or

                                    23
     To examine this result more precisely and to investigate whether it

has changed over time, I perform a simple comparison of means, while

controlling for differences across industry and time in the average firm

R&D intensity. That is, I ask the question: How does the R&D intensity of

those firms in my sample which acquired other firms differ in the years

immediately following the transaction from that of other firms in the same

industry during the same period? I regress the R&D intensity for each

firm-year observation on a set of industry and year dummies and on dummies

for whether this particular firm is zero, one, two, or three years away

from having acquired another firm in my sample. This regression is

performed with the hypothesized "acquisition" effect assumed constant over

all the years, and also allowing it to vary from year to year. If the

acquisition mix is changing over time, this latter method is required to

avoid biasing the estimates of the effect. It also will tell us whether

the difference in my results with data through 1985 and 1987 is due to a

shift in behavior.

     The results of these regressions are shown in Figure 4 and summarized

in Table 4. The top half of this table shows results for all the firms in

all the years, treating any observations which have no R&D data as zero-R&D

observations (which most, but not all of them will be). The average effect

 is negative and it increases as we go one or two years out from the




vice-versa around the time of acquisition is about 30, with a larger number
electing to stop reporting (20) than start (10). Thus more firms choose to
treat R&D spending as non-material after acquisition than switch to
reporting it, which leads to a small decline in average R&D intensity when
we include these firms. However, the probability of making a reporting
switch, conditional on the state in which the firm finds itself before
acquisition, is the same for either non-reporting or reporting, so it is
difficult to know what to conclude from this.



                                 24
acquisition, reaching almost one half of one percent in the second year

after the acquisition. However, even in this year the coefficient is not

significant at conventional levels (a t-statistic of 1.6) and the

individual year effects are widely varying and all insignificant. The

predominant effect appears to be negative, but there is huge variability in

R&D performance even within an industry, and this dominates the estimates

of the differences of the means. To put it concisely, the summary

F-statistic for an acquisition effect on R&D intensity is F(38,20137) —

0.45 when I measure individual year effects or F(4,20171) — 1.70 when I
constrain the effect to be the same for all vintages.

     If I include the firm's own lagged R&D intensity instead of using

industry dummies to predict the average expected level, the effects are

even smaller and less significant. However, the first lag of R&D intensity

occurs during the year in which the acquisition took place, which may be an

atypical year for the firm's data. Therefore, in Table 4 I also show the

results for R&D intensity lagged twice (using the year before acquisition

to control for the acquiring firm's average R&D to sales ratio). The

results are closer to those I obtain when I only control for the R&D

intensity of the firm's two digit industry; whether I control only for

industry, or for the specific firm, I obtain a similar result: the R&D

intensity appears to decline after acquisition, but by an insignificant

amount.

     In spite of the statistically insignificant results, Figure 4 tells a

different story: this figure shows how the difference in mean R&D

intensity between acquiring and non-acquiring firms evolves over time

relative to the firms' two-digit industry. The four lines are the effects

0 to 3 years from the date of the acquisition. A pattern clearly emerges



                                 25
 from this graph: the acquisitions in the later years are followed by far

 greater declines in R&D intensity and the declines appear to be permanent,

 in the sense that they do not become any smaller even three years after the

 acquisition. Although still insignificant, the declines are quite large i..

 economic terms, a change of intensity of more than one percent in some
       41
 years.

      Because of the near constancy of the effect over several years after

 the acquisition, I chose to constrain the acquisition effect to be

 permanent, that is, to permanently lower the expected R&D intensity of the

 acquiring firm. These results are shown in Figure 5, where I compare the

R&D intensity relative to that of a firm's industry and to its own lagged

 intensity. The pattern here is quite striking: over time, the R&D to

sales ratios of acquiring firms are falling substantially, but when we

control for the past R&D to sales ratio of the firm itself, there is no

such decline (for one lag) or only a small effect (for two lags). This

suggests that the mix of firms performing acquisitions during the
                                                                    period
from 1977 to 1987 is shifting toward those which have low R&D intensity

relative to their own industry.

     What should we conclude from this? Even if we concede that the

methodology is flawed because we cannot assume a one way causal relationship




       graph reveals that the lack of conventional statistical
                                                                significance
may be due to the inadequacy of the probability model I am using to
construct the test. However, the major defect in my model is that I treat
each firm-year as a random draw net of time and industry effects, rather
than allowing for correlation across years for each firm; one expects that
allowing for such correlation would actually lower the significance level
rather than raising it. One can get an idea of what the result would be in
that case by looking at the test-statistics for the regression where I
include the firm's own lagged R&D intensity (the second, third, fifth, and
sixth lines of Table 2), which is almost like including a fixed firm effect
in the model.



                                  26
 between the making of an acquisition and the R&D intensity of the firm       in

 succeeding years (since both are aspects of a particular corporate strategy

 of a particular firm), the fact remains that evidence of a large systematic

 decline in R&D intensity post-acquisition is difficult to find in a

statistical sense, but seems to be visible in the data. A glance at the

estimated differences in R&D intensity by year and time since acquisition

 in Figure 4 does suggest the following: 1) there may be a negative effecc

during the nineteen-eighties (a succession of negative coefficients), even

though the earlier period is mixed, and 2) what effect there is appears to

be cumulative since it is still growing slightly in the second year after

the merger. Figure 5 helps to reconcile this result with my earlier

Wilcoxon test for differences in the growth of R&D intensity between

acquiring and non-acquiring firms, since it shows that it makes a big

difference how finely one controls for pre-acquisit-ion R&D intensity, that

is whether one uses firm or industry levels. It would clearly be desirable

to augment the results for mergers in 1986 and 1987 through 1988 and 1989

in order to clarify the rather murky results in those years.

        These hints of decline in R&D intensity post-acquisition during the

eighties lead me to ask the following question: Unlike the small NSF and

Fusfeld studies, neither this investigation nor my previous one42 explored

the differences between acquisitions undertaken with various kinds of

financing. The arguments given earlier imply that the source of the

problem (if there is one) is the associated change in the leverage ratio of

the acquiring firm. To investigate this question, I computed the total




42
     Bronwyn H. Hall (1988).




                                  27
change in debt for the acquiring firm (including the debt taken on from the

acquiree) between the beginning and end of the year in which the

acquisition took place.   I then divided this change in debt by the total

equity value of the seller at the time of acquisition, i.e., the price paid

by the buyer. This quantity is a kind of leverage ratio for the

acquisition itself if the acquisition was the main investment undertaken

by the firm during the year. It will be approximately zero if no new debt

was incurred to finance the transaction, and approximately one if the

transaction was completely financed by debt.

     The dispersion of these leverage ratios was very wide,43 suggesting

that some acquisitions account for a relatively small portion of the

changes in debt levels experienced by the acquiring firms from one year to

the next. One implication of this fact is that this calculated leverage

ratio is a relatively blunt instrument with which to identify leveraged

acquisitions. Investigation of the buyer and seller in a sample of these

transactions during the relevant year in the Wall Street Journal Index

found that only 12 percent could clearly be identified as acquisitions

financed by debt; in an equal number of cases, the acquiring firm was in

financial trouble for other reasons and had increased its leverage by

taking out new financing. Many of them were too small to be mentioned, or

there was no evidence that the acquirer made any special financial

arrangements for the acquisition. If the acquisitions are relatively

unimportant to the overall acquiring firms, we have to ask ourselves




43The mean was 0.65 with a standard deviation of about 3, while the median
was -0.2, owing to a large number of observations with a slight decline in
debt in the transaction year. Over one third of the observations had debt
changes which were greater than the value of the acquisition in absolute
value (46 negative and 92 positive).


                                28
whether the focus on acquisition-induced leverage is misdirected.     It may

be that the real question we are interested in is the overall effect of

leverage, whether acquisition-induced or not; this is explored in the next
           44
section.

     I then compared these leveraged acquisitions to the leveraged buyouts

discussed earlier. Does the type of firm acquired determine the financial

structure of the acquisition, regardless of whether the acquirer is private

or public, or do the LROs have particular characteristics which can be

attributed to the fact that they are also management buyouts -   - that   is,

the new owners are former managers who may have particular information

about the firm and how it should be managed. The acquisitions by public

firms on the other hand, are more likely to be driven by synergistic

considerations than by the benefits of debt restructuring; the choice of

debt as a means of finance may be a secondary consideration detetmined by

the type of firm being acquired. A table similar to Table 3 (not shown)

confirmed that the two types of leveraged transactions are quite different:

the 84 leveraged acquisitions are considerably smaller than the LBOs in

Table 3, they involve higher R&D relative to their size (about twice as

much per employee), and they are scattered across all industries, with a

slight majority in cyclical capital equipment industries. From this

evidence, it appears that the forces driving LBOs are not the same as those

which cause these types of acquisitions. The most likely reason for the

lack of similarity is that leverage in this case is only occasionally




44The acquisitions themselves were distributed across a wide size range.
Although half of them were less than 14 percent of the combined firm, about
one quarter were larger than 30 percent. The average size was 20 percent,
so they were not negligible with respect to the acquirer.

related to the acquisition itself. In the next section I try a different

approach to estimating the effect of acquisition-induced leverage.



 IV. Leverage

     Earlier I suggested two commonly stated hypotheses which would imply a

negative relationship between corporate restructuring and R&D investment,

only one of which seemed to call for a policy response. There is an

intermediate position, in which financial markets are "efficient" in the

sense of pricing firms correctly conditional on the information available

to them, but where problems of asymmetric information between the managers

of a firm and its shareholders or potential shareholders lead to less than

optimal outcomes for the investment policy of the firm. A decline in R&D

associated with an increase in leverage may result in this world also, and

it may indeed be the case that our current financial structure (including

the tax system) discriminates against these types of intangible

investments.

     Why might leverage be particularly negative for R&D investment? Many

authors have suggested reasons why the cost of external capital (debt or

equity) may be higher for R&D projects than for physical investments.

Leland and Pyle, and Kihlstrom and Matthews have argued that there is a

moral hazard problem in transferring information about a risky project from

an entrepreneur (firm) to investors (shareholders or debt holders), which

leads to a preference for retained earnings as a source of finance for this

type of investment.45 Bhattacharya and Ritter have shown that if there is a

Structure, and Financial Intermediation," Journal    Finance 32 (1977): pp.
371-387; Richard Kihlstrom and Steve Matthews, "Managerial Incentives in


                                30
cost to revealing information about innovative projects to the market (and

hence, to potential competitors), firms will also find the cost of

external capital higher than that of internal finance.46 In the case of debt

finance, there is an additional problem, since banks (and other

bondholders) often prefer some sort of tangible security which can be sold

in the event of default. In cases where retained earnings are not

available, such as new startups, substantial equity shares (in the form of

venture capital), not long-term bonds, are the rule.

     These arguments, together with the empirical evidence on liquidity and

investment, both old and new,47 restore the link between investment and the

source of finance which was broken by Modigliani and Miller. They also

imply that the cost of external finance, especially debt, will be higher

when investment projects are more uncertain, produce fewer redeployable

assets, have knowledge externalities, and are subject to more severe

asymmetric information problems between owners and managers. All of these

factors imply that internal finance will be more preferred for innovation

and R&D investment than for ordinary investment; an implication of this

fact is that an exogenous increase in the fraction of earnings devoted to

interest expense, such as that caused by an increase in long terirt debt,

will penalize these types of investments.

     The difficulty of investigating this hypothesis in the data available

                                 31
to us is that investors are not unaware of this link between investment and

financial policy and a finding that leverage decreases R&D investment may

only mean that that particular firm at that particular time is facing a set

of investment opportunities which do not have high payback potential and

reducing R&D while increasing debt may indeed be the optimal policy, at

least privately. In spite of this problem, I still believe it is

worthwhile to investigate firms where substantial increases in leverage

occur; full consideration of this simultaneity problem awaits further
        48
work.

        My approach to gathering the facts on leveraged restructurings is

similar to the one I followed for acquisitions in Section IV: I define a

leveraged restructuring as a firm-year where the increase in long term debt

is greater than 75 percent of the total market value of the firm (debt plus

equity) in the beginning of the year. There are 177 such restructurings;

their (size-weighted) distribution by year was shown in the last column of

Table 1. Unlike the other types of restructurings, these refinancings show

two period of increased activity, the early 1980s and after 1985.

        In Table 5 I display the industry and R&D characteristics of the firms

involved in such restructurings. Unlike the LBOs shown earlier, these

transactions take place in all types of industries, although there does

seem to be a preference for those which are relatively capital intensive

(chemicals, petroleum, stone, clay, and glass, machinery, motor vehicles,

and aircraft), confirming the importance of redeployable assets in debt




     is not simply a problem of simultaneity of the leverage and investment
decision; the problem is also that individual firm rationality in this
setting may not be socially optimal, since we are dealing with a type of
investment which has been shown repeatedly to have substantial
externalities.


                                   32
financing. The firms in question are less R&D-intensive than the others in

their industry (compare the fraction of industry employment with the

fraction of industry R&D) with two exceptions: the chemical industry, where

DuPont took on large amounts of debt to finance the Conoco acquisition in

l98l, and the automotive industry, where almost all of the total is the

restructuring of Chrysler Corporation in 1980-1982. Thus even here, we see

that the unsuitability of high leverage for R&D-intensive firms may be

having an effect.

     I then go on to perform the same kind of investigation into

post-transaction R&D intensity as I did in the case of manufacturing sector

acquisitions. Specifically, I compute the average R&D intensity of

leveraging firms 0 to 3 years after the transaction, relative to the firms

in their industry. These differences in mean, which are again very

imprecisely determined, are shown in Figure 6. It is not surprising that

they are negative, since we already saw that these firms were relatively

less R&D intensive, but the absolute magnitude, particularly after 1983, is

rather startling: a difference of 2.5 percent in R&D intensity is a fifty

percent difference in R&D if the average level is 5 percent of sales (which

is typical of R&D-doing firms).

     The figure also shows that the difference in R&D intensity is

essentially permanent: the curves for 1, 2, and 3 years out lie almost on

top of each other, and are larger than that for the year of leveraging.     I


therefore treat the effect as permanent in the same way I did the

acquisition effect, in order to reduce the sampling variability, and




49This debt was later paid down fairly quickly and R&D in the combined
company increased both in level and as a percent of sales from 1981 to 1985
(Fusfeld, 1987).


                                  33
compute it relative to the firm's own lagged R&D   intensity   in order to see

if there really was a decline. This is shown in Figure 7, which reveals

that the largest differences shown in Figure 6 are due to the differences

between leveraging and non-leveraging firms in pre-transaction R&D

intensity. When I control for the firm's own behavior, however, I still

show a decline in R&D spending which is roughly constant throughout the

period, and is on the order of magnitude of one half of one percent of

sales.5° The individual year effects are still jointly insignificant, but

the overall decline has a t-statistic of 3.0 (remember that neither of

these tests is completely valid, owing to the lack of independence across

observations).

     Throughout this analysis I have treated leveraging analogously to

acquisitions, as though it were a discrete event, in order to compare the

results directly. However, the change in the leverage for these firms is

actually distributed as a continuous variable, for which I have arbitrarily

chosen a cutoff of .75 to define a restructuring.51 Ideally I would like to

use the full information in the leverage variable, but it is difficult to

know how to incorporate it in the absence of a fully specified model for

the Investment-financing choice. My solution is shown in Table 6: I

regress the R&D intensity of all the firms on the first three lags of the

leverage changes; the coefficients in this regression are the percent




50Both Figure 6 and Figure 7 use only data for R&D-performing firms, about
11,000 firm-year observations; the results are very similar if I use all
19,000 observations, treating firms which do not report R&D for one or more
years as having zero R&D during those years.
51To check the results, I also used .5 as a cutoff. As expected, the
negative coefficients were slightly smaller and more precisely measured due
to the larger sample. This suggest that using a continuous variable as I
do in the following may be a better idea.



                                 34
change in R&D intensity per an absolute change in leverage ratio. I have

again included year, industry, and the lagged R&D intensity for the firm as

controls.

      The results are quite interesting: whether we look at all firms or

only R&D-doers, R&D intensity falls following an increase in leverage. The

full effect is about 0.75 and it takes at least three years to work

(using the numbers in the second and fourth columns). At the cutoff change

in leverage which I was using earlier, this is an absolute change of 0.56

percent in the R&D-to-sales ratio, which is consistent with Figure 7.      For

a typical R&D-doing firm with an R&D-to-sales ratio of 3.7, this would

imply a decline in R&D spending of about 15 percent, which is not

negligible. Of course, most firms in most years do not experience this

kind of leverage increase, so that the aggregate declines will not be huge.

      In this regression, I also investigated the role of acquisitions by

including a dummy for firms which had acquired one of the firms in my

sample during the past three years, and also interacting that dummy with

the change in leverage, to see if there was a separate additive effect from

acquisitions (the results on leverage were not significantly affected by

including these variables, so I only show the combined regression). The

basic conclusion from the regression is that the acquisition effect we saw

in Figure 5 is largely accounted for by controlling for changes in

leverage. The F-statistic for including these variables is very

insignificant, partly because the coefficients are so poorly measured.

Leverage does not appear to have any greater effect when it is associated

with making an acquisition, a fact which is not too surprising once we know

it.

      The conclusion from this part of the investigation is that declines in



                                  35
R&D intensity do seem to follow after restructurings which increase

leverage, and that the small declines after acquisitions which I found

earlier may be associated with increased leverage rather than the

acquisition per se. Although this fact is interesting, and is consistent

with anecdotal evidence, the data have not yet told us whether the foregone

projects are ones that should have been funded.



V. Conclusions and Discussion

     I begin my discussion of what we can conclude about the effects of

corporate restructuring on R&D by summarizing my empirical results. First,

I find that leveraged buyouts and other private acquisitions of publicly

traded manufacturing firms are taking place overwhelmingly in sectors where

R&D investment and innovation have not been important, at least to the

industry as a whole. The industries and firms in question are

those with the steady cash flow necessary to service the debt (they are

largely smaller firms in the consumer nondurable industries: Food,

Textiles, the auto parts sector of the Motor Vehicle industry, the tire

sector of the Rubber and Plastics industry, and Miscellaneous

Manufacturing) or those which have been downsizing for some time under

pressure from foreign competition and reduced innovative opportunities

 (Textiles again, Fabricated Metals, and Stone, Clay, and Glass).

     The total amount of R&D involved in ten years worth of transactions is

767 million dollars, a small fraction of the 40 billion-dollar industrial

R&D budget in 1982. Even if this R&D were to be cut drastically, it would

have little impact on total spending. In fact, although this R&D

disappeared from my aggregate statistics since the firms went private (and

ceased to report to the SEC), I cited evidence from Kaplan and Lichtenberg



                                 36
and Siegel that these firms did not reduce their spending as a result of

the transaction in any case.

     The second finding was less clear: there was mixed evidence as to

whether acquiring firms in the publicly traded manufacturing sector

reduced their R&D intensity as a result of the acquisition. Firms involved

in acquisitions seemed to experience permanent declines in their

R&D intensity relative to other firms in their industry, but this effect

was stronger in the later part of the period than in the earlier, and was

partly due to the fact that the mix of firms making acquisitions shifted

toward firms with lower R&D intensities during the eighties. Although the

statistical evidence was weak, the size of the effect was large in economic

terms, amounting to a one-half of 1 percent decline in R&D intensity

for those firms engaged in R&D (that is, from an overall mean of 3.4

percent to 2.9 percent) for the 1982 to 1987 period. This decline did seem

to be associated with the more leveraged of the acquisitions, lending

credence to arguments that cash flow impacts R&D spending.

     Finally, the most dramatic results of restructuring were found in

those transactions where a firm moves to a substantially higher debt

position than it had been in before; here the size of the decline in R&D

intensity was about 0.8 percent (from 3.4 to 2.6) for the 1982 to 1987

period. It appeared that the declines after acquisition could also be

attributed to increases in leverage, although the results on this question

are very imprecise, in spite of the large samples involved. This

statistical imprecision serves to remind us that the overwhelming

characteristic of a sample of firms is the variability of their experiences

and the number of factors actually involved in predicting outcomes; of

necessity, I have focused only on a limited part of the story.



                                37
     Does this result, that increased leverage is associated with declines

in R&D spending at the firm   level,   explain the decline in industrial R&D

spending in the late eighties? The answer to this question is "probably

not," for several reasons. First, for these firms there were two periods of

substantial leverage increase during the period in question, 1977 to 1980,

when the average change in leverage over all firms was about 0.04 and

1986-1987, when the change was about 0.037. During the earlier period, R&D

spending overall was growing substantially. Even in the later period, the

decline in overall R&D spending implied by this kind of leverage increase

is about one-half of 1 percent, which will not account for the observed

decline in growth rates.

     However, these results are suggestive. Regardless of whether you

believe that leverage is efficiency-enhancing or that it leads to a decline

in productive investment, the link between leverage and reduced R&D

spending has been established. I would interpret the fact that the more

extreme forms of leverage increase (LBOs and other such transactions) are

occurring in industries not normally considered innovative and the fact that

they seem to have other efficiency benefits as evidence that the agency

cost hypothesis is the correct one, and that these transactions are

beneficial on the whole. On the other hand, I would argue that R&D

spending in general may be an unintended victim of the drive to shift the

source of financing toward debt, because its particular characteristics

make it unsuited to that type of corporate environment. The evidence

presented here supports this hypothesis, but far more work needs to be done

before we can clearly identify the problem and say what the solution is.
