         The Variance and Acceleration of Inflation in the l970s:
                 Alternative Explanatory Models and Methods

                                ABSTRACT

     The paper attributes the behavior of U.S. inflation to four sets of
factors: aggregate demand shifts; government intervention in the form of
the Nixon price controls and changes in the social security tax rate and
the effective minimum wage; external supply shocks that include the impact
of the changing relative prices of food and energy, the depreciation of
the dollar, and the aggregate productivity slowdown: and inertia that makes
the inflation rate depend partly on its own lagged vlaues.

     Considerable attention is given to alternative methods of measuring
the impact of government intervention, including the Nixon controls, Kennedy—
Johnson guideposts, and the Carter pay standards. The results imply that
direct intervention has been futile, since the guidelines and pay standards
had no effect at all on inflation, while the Nixon—era controls had only a
temporary impact that stabilized both the inflation rate and the level of
real output.

     Some previous studies have had a problem in explaining why inflation was
so rapid in 1974 and have been forced to conclude that the termination of the
Nixon controls raised prices more than the imposition of controls had lowered
them. We find that much of the explanation of rapid inflation in 1974 is
the same as that in 1979—80: the shortfall of productivity growth below its
ever—slowing trend rate of growth raised business costs and forced-extra
price increases, and the depreciation of the dollar in 1971—73 and 1978
boosted the prices of exports and import substitutes. Rapid demand growth,
the 1979—80 oil shock, the depreciation of the dollar, the productivity slow-
down, and payroll tax increases all help to explain why the inflation rate
accelerated between 1976 and 1980 by much more than was generally expected
two or three years ago.

                              I.   INTRODUCTION


     In the past decade inflation has been both the leading macroeconomic

problem and the bane of forecasters. Not only has the inflation rate been

higher on average than in any earlier peacetime decade, but it has accel-

erated from roughly 5 percent in 1970 to 10 percent in 1980, and it has

exhibited an unprecedented variability throughout the decade. Sensible

advice to policymakers on anti—inflation strategy requires that economists

be able to decompose the inflation of the 1970s among its principal

causes.

     At the beginning of the decade the standard explanation of inflation

was based on an expectational Phillips curve (EPC) equation in which there

was typically one aggregate demand variable, usually representing the

tightness of labor markets, and one variable representing inertia and

gradual price adjustment, usually the influence of lagged prices on current

wages and prices. The basic inflation equation developed in this paper

 supplements the simple EPC approach with an extra aggregate demand variable

 and six types of supply shifts. The demand variable is the rate of change

 of nominal aggregate demand. The supply variables include the effect of

 government intervention in the inflation process (particularly during the

 Nixon control era), the impact of changing relative prices of food and

 energy, of minimum wage changes, and of payroll tax changes, the change in

 the effective foreign exchange rate of the dollar, and, finally, the effect

 of changes in both the actual and trend growth rates of labor productivity.1


     Thus the main themes of the paper are that inflation cannot be explained

simply as the result of excessive aggregate demand stimulation, nor of a
                                                                         2


single type of supply shock, nor of the effect of inertia by itself. An

adequate explanation of postwar U. S. inflation, both before and after 1970,

requires treatment of several different channels by which aggregate demand

inf1uerces inflation, of several different episodes of government inter—
                                                                               d

vention,   of several types of supply shocks, and of the inertia in the in-

flation process that limits the speed with which prices can adjust to

demand and supply shifts

     A central topic in this paper is the interaction between the estimated

effects of the Nixon controls and of the other variables. As Blinder and

Newton (1978) discovered, some traditional price change equations that

freely estimate separate coefficients for the impact of the controls

and for the effect of their removal——hereafter labelled the "on" and "off"

coefficients——yield the conclusion that the 1974 "off" effect was sub-

stantially larger than the 1971—72 "on" effect. Stated another way, price

change equations with a traditional specification cannot explain why in-

flation was so high in 1974, and the introduction of a free dummy variable

for the 1974 removal of controls often leads to the estimate of a large

coefficient for this "off" effect. The more complete specification in this

paper that includes additional variables provides an improved explanation

of inflation in 1974 and yields "on" and "off" coefficients that are of

roughly the same size. The fully specified equation has the important by-

product that it is able to explain why the inflation rate for products

other than food and energy accelerated so much between 1977 and 1980.

     The preferred price change equation developed in this paper is con-

 trasted with two simpler approaches. The first is a naive ARIMA model

 that explains inflation entirely by its own past values. The ARIMA model
                                                                          3


represents an extreme view that the inflation process is entirely dominated

by inertia and is unaffected by changes in current exogenous variables.

Nevertheless, an ARIMA price change equation provides an interesting stan—

dard of comparison for a more complete specification and provides a link

to the early evaluation of the Nixon controls program by Feige and Pearce

(.1976)   that used the ARIMA technique.
     The second   alternative approach is a simple monetarist equation that

makes the rate of change of prices depend only on a distributed lag of

past changes in the money supply. While this framework is taken more

seriously by journalists and laymen than by academic economists, a "money

only" explanation of inflation is implicit in some recent tests of the

classical equilibrium approach to macroeconomics.2 We shall see that the

residuals of both the ARIMA and money—only approaches yield an estimate

that the Nixon controls had a significant effect on the timing of inflation,

just as does the more complete specification.

      This paper attempts to do more than simply present a preferred in-

flation equation. In addition it attempts to characterize the nature of

changes in the inflation process during the past decade. The effect of

each variable is examined both in an equation estimated for the full 1954—

80 period and for the shorter 1954—71 period. Post—sample dynamic simula-

tions of the short—period equations help to reveal the particular aspects

of inflation in the past decade that are explained by shifts in coefficients

in the full—period equations.

      Several limitations are imposed to control the size of the paper.

First, no attention is paid to alternative specifications of the impact of

aggregate demand on the inflation process; the impact of alternative "supply"
                                                                                 4


variables are studied within a single demand specification) Second, all

equations explain the rate of change of prices in relation to lagged price

changes, and there is no attention given to the determinants eIther of the

change in wages or in the relation of prices to wages. Third. with one ex-

ception all of the price equations use a single dependent variable, the

fixed—weight GNP deflator. Without these restrictions the pa?er would

grow to book length, since there is an almost infinite number of possible

combinations of dependent variables (different neasures of wages and prices)

and independent variables.

Stinmary   Statistics Describing th.e Data to be Explained
      The basic features of inflation in the 1970s——both its overall ac-

celeration and its high variance——stand out in Table 1. Means, standard

deviations, and simple correlations are presented there for quarterly rates

of change of prices, of nominal GNP, and of the money supply (M1B), and

the level of the "output ratio," that is, the ratio of actual to natural

real GNP.5 Five twenty—quarter (half—decade) intervals are coranared for

the period between 1954 and 1979.

     The table suggests that all three rate of change variables acceler-

ated by about five percentage points between the earliest and latest of

the five intervals. The fact that inflation accelerated between the first

and last halves of the 1970s seems to conflict with the substantial nega-

tive value of the output    ratio   recorded in   the last half; this raay   suggest

either     that the output ratio is mismeasured or that other variables like

the rate of change of nominal GNP or money are important in explaining

changes in the inflation rate.

     The middle section of Table 1 indicates that the variance of inflation

was greater in both halves o.f the 1970s than in earlier periods, and that

the variance was especially high during the first half of the decade. In

contrast the variance of nominal GNP and money growth were not unusually

high during the 1970s. Fluctuations in the output ratio in 1970—79 were

similar in magnitude to those during 1955—64, as contrasted with a temporary

period of stability in 1965—69.

     How were the alternative demand variables correlated with the inflation

rate during the five periods? The relatively high positive correlations

between inflation and the output ratio——the traditional Phillips curve

relationship——are evident for 1955—59 and 1975—79, while the appearance of

a perversely sloped Phillips curve shows up in the data- for 1970—74. The

correlations with nominal GNP change are weak throughout, with a surprising

negative correlation in the early l960s. The negative correlation of in-

flation with money growth in the first half of the l970s contrasts with

the positive correlation in the last half.

     Table 1, then, provides a preview in crude form of some of the con-

clusions we reach later: the data for the early l970s, including the high

variance of inflation and the negative correlation with demand variables,

suggest an important role for supply shocks in the inflation process. The

data for the late l970s imply not only that a traditional demand—based

explanation of inflation may be relevant, but that the negative average

level of the output ratio during 1975—79 may give a misleading indication

of slack demand.
                                                                             7

"Structural" versus Reduced-For'm Approaches

     The study of inflation in most past research has been based on a two—
equation approach,   one for wages and one for prices. The   wage equation
typically   adhered to the EPC specification described above, and the price

equation illustrated the tendency for the price level to be "marked up"

over some concept of unit labor cost, that is, the wage rate divided by

labor productivity. Often the wage and price equations were part of a

supply—side block in a large—scale econometric model that also included

equations explaining key labor market variables like the unemployment and

labor force participation rates. The wage equation was generally taken

to represent the outcome of events in the labor market, with the influence

of aggregate demand channeled through "labor market tightness" variables

like the unemployment rate, while the price equation was generally taken

to reflect events in the commodity market, with the influence of aggregate

demand channeled through proxy variables like inventory—sales ratios and

unfilled orders.

     In recent years, however, it has become apparent that the two—equation

approach is both misleading and inconvenient. First, wage and price equa-

tions cannot be distinguished as truly structural equations applying to

behavior in particular markets. The behavior of wages, for instance, can

be explained just as well by real GNP as by labor market variables like

unemployment, suggesting that the wage equation does not provide us with

any special insight about the working of labor markets.6 Second, tradi-

tional wage and price equations are particularly prone to simultaneous

equations bias. If current prices explain wages and current wages explain
                                                                         8

prices, then the coefficient on a variable that influences both simultan-

eously——whether a demand proxy like real GNP or a supply variable like

price—control effects——may be biased downward.7 For instance, if the true

impact of controls on wages and prices differs each quarter, while their

effect i restricted in an econometric equation to operate through dummy        4

variables that are uniform each quarter, much of the true impact may be

soaked up by the price coefficient in the wage equation and wage coefficient

in the price equation rather than by the coefficient of the dummy variable.

Third, the use of two equations leads to an artificial separation of the

variables that "belong in each equation. For instance, the payroll tax

has often entered wage equations, but never price equations. Thus the

large impact effect of the employers' portion of the payroll tax in raising

unit labor cost is implicitly assumed to be shifted forward into prices by

the same coefficient as an average wage change. Any absorption of some of

the tax burden by firms will be missed unless the payroll tax variable is

entered symmetrically into both the wage and price equations. Finally, the

two—equation approach is inconvenient and clumsy, The full impact of a

variable on the inflation rate cannot be learned from the simple inspection

of a table, but requires multiplying and adding coefficients. The answer to

virtually any interesting question requires the computation of model

simulations that must include the auxiliary equations needed to generate the

labor market variables typically included in the wage equation.

     On all of:these counts a simple reduced—form inflation equation,

which relates the rate of price change to its own lagged values and other

variables, seems superior. The equation is openly a convenient character-

ization of the data rather than an attempt to describe structural behavior;
                                                                           9

it is less prone to (though not immune from) simultaneous equations bias;

it automatically includes the effect of every variable on both wages and

profits; and it is easier to inspect, interpret, and simulate. Subsequent

work on separate wage and price mark—up equations can help to allocate the

effects of particular variables between wage and profit behavior, but this

seems a distinctly secondary research task to building an improved under-

standing of the inflation process itself.


ho-Lce of Dependent Variable and   Sample Period

     The GNP deflator seems the natural choice as dependent variable in a

study of the basic U. S. inflation process. Given any specified path of

nominal GNP and "natural" (or potential) real GNP, determination of the

path of the GNP deflator automatically yields as a residual the ratio of

actual to natural real GNP (hereafter "the output ratio"), the key indicator

of the economy's utilization rate and cyclical performance. The output ratio,

in turn, leads to predictions of the unemployment rate as long as Okun's

law remains reasonably accurate.

     We have selected for analysis the fixed—weight rather than the implicit

CNP deflator. Two   arguments   support this choice. First, the implicit

deflator, based on current—period expenditure weights, confounds price

changes   with changes in the mix of output. Just as studies of wage infla-
tion now commonly use a fixed—weight wage index, we believe that studies of

aggregate U. S. inflation should use the fixed—weight GNP deflator in order

to insulate true price changes from shifts between expenditure categories.

     A second disadvantage of the implicit GNP deflator arises below in section

VI, where we begin to include nominal GNP growth as an explanatory variable.
                                                                       10

The level of the implicit GNP deflator can shift from quarter to quarter as

the weight of particular expenditure categories shifts. In quarters when

there are large changes in a particular type of expenditure, e.g., during
                                                                                4
the   quarter of an automobile strike, nominal ON? and the deflator could ex-

hibit a positive correlation, even if there were no effect of nominal GNP

changes on any individual price change. Use of the fixed—weight deflator

eliminates this source of spurious correlation between inflation and nominal

demand changes.

       The sample period of the inflation equations developed in this paper

runs from l954:Q2 to 1980:Q2. The starting date is chosen to retain com-

parability with previous, papers and to simplify the presentation by omitting

consideration of the peculiar impact of speculation and government inter-

vention during the 1950—53 Korean war period.8 The ending date is the

latest quarter of data available when most of this research was carried

out. Each alternative specification considered below has also been estimated

for the shorter sample period 1954:Q2 —   l971:Q2 in order to use post—sample
dynamic simulations to evaluate price behavior during the Nixon controls

period. Equations examined in section VI also are estimated for l954:Q2—

l977:Q4, in order to determine the ability of various equations to forecast

the acceleration of inflation between 1977 and 1980.


                          III. METHODOLOGY AND MODELS


Probi ems in   Estimating the Impact of Oontrols
       Our various reduced—form inflation equations are of the general form:


            (1)
                          Pt
                                                                         11

where Pt iS the rate of inflation, x is a vector of explanatory variables

(some of which may be endogenous in the context of a large econometric

model), and the subscript !t_it! refers to variables lagged one or more

periods. The two primary purposes of equations like (1) are retrospective

and prospective policy evaluation. Once the coefficients of the f( )     furction
have been estimated, the effects of different policies in the past or future

can be represented by the calculation of alternative values of price change

      providing that the policy shifts can be interpreted as a change in

one or more of the explanatory variables. Thus the estimated f( )   function
can be used to calculate:


          (2)          Pt =

where the hypothetical alternative values of the relevant explanatory

variables are designated by an asterisk.

     The measurement of the effects of wage—price control policies differs

from that of monetary or fiscal policies for two basic reasons. First,

there is no long continuous relationship between the quantitative h,xu

variable and the dependent variable to allow a coefficient for controls to

be estimated. During most periods in the past there were no controls. Even

when they were in effect, there is generally no official measure of the im-

pact of the program for inclusion as an explanatory variable.9 Second, the

existence of separate control programs in past periods, e.g., guidelines in

1963—66 and Nixon controls in 1971—74, prevents us from treating each

separate program or even each phase of a program as a single continuous

zero—one dichotomous variable, since controls programs differed in their

comprehensiveness and tightness.10 Thus there seems little alternative to
                                                                          12

the two basic techniques used in this paper, (1) the introduction of separate

dummy variables for each program, and (2) the construction of post—sample

simulations to evaluate a program based on coefficients estimated from a

previous no—controls interval.

     There are numerous pitfalls in the use of either the dummy variable

or simulation technique:

     1. The model may be erroneously specified and omit one or more ex-

planatory variables. Movements in the omitted variable during the controls

period may be correlated with the imposition and/or removal of controls

and thus bias the controls coefficient in either direction. For instance,

since aggregate demand growth (either money or nominal GNP) speeded up

during the 1971-72 controls imposition period and slowed dom during the

1974 controls removal period, the omission of this negatively correlated

variable will tend to bIas downward the effect of controls estimated by

either the dummy variable or simulation technique.

     2. Sometimes a misspecification can bias the conclusion of the simula-

tion technique more than that of the dummy variable technique. A simulation

designed to evaluate the 1971—74 controls program is usually based on a set

of coefficients for the f( )   function   estimated to the pre—1971 period.

Unfortunately 1971—72 marks the beginning not only of the controls, but also

of flexible exchange rates. Since there was little variability in the

foreign exchange rate of the dollar before 1971, a post—sample simulation

records errors in years like 1974 and may attribute them to controls rather

than to the impact of the omitted variable. In contrast the dummy variable

technique allows use of the full post—1971 sample period and allows any
                                                                         13

 variable to enter, even if it exhibited no variance before 1971.


     3. There are corresponding disadvantages of dummy variables. First,

a choice must be made of the applicable dates of the program. This choice

is particularly difficult for the "rebound" impact of the termination of

controls on the price level, since this impact may be spread out over several

quarters after the legal termination date. For semi—voluntary programs like

the Kennedy—Johnson guidelines, there was no legal implementation or termina-

tion date.1 Second, a dummy variable that is set at a uniform value for

the whole period of a program's implementation forces its impact to be

uniform each quarter. While the varying comprehensiveness of implementation

can be tracked by the Blinder—Newton variable that shows the percentage of

prices controlled each month between 1971 and 1974, their variable does not

measure the tightness of controls or indicate how promptly firms responded

to changes in the rules.

     4. Some parameters in price equations are measured with wide confidence

intervals. In other cases the data cannot distinguish between alternative

hypotheses. Thus alternative specifications that fit equally well may

yield differing evaluations of the efficacy of a particular program of con-

trols. However, this source of ambiguity in evaluating the effect of con-

trols is no different from that found in many time—series econometric studies.

     5. The measured impact of a control program depends on what is taken

to be exogenous. If the "output ratio" is the only exogenous demand variable,

then the coefficient on a controls dummy measures the downward displacement

of a short—run Phillips curve. If nominal CNP growth is held constant when

controls are implemented, then any such downward displacement will raise the
                                                                       14

the output ratio and, if the short—run Phillips curve linking inflation and

the output ratio is positively sloped, will cause actual inflation to de-

crease less than the vertical downward displacement measured by the controls

dummy. In short, the actual behavior of inflation reflects the combined in-

fluence of the controls in S72 tz7g the Phillips curve and in causing the

economy to move along the curve. Coefficients on controls effects measured

in equations that contain the output ratio or other demand variables isolate

the shift in the curve. This approach seems correct, since if aggregate

demand policy allowed the displacement effect of the controls to be dissi—

pated by movements along the curve, this should not be taken to meai that

the controls "had no impact."

     6.   Measurement errors may be important if controls cause distortions

in price measurement. To the extent that controls are binding and are ac-

companied by rationing, there is some vector of shadow prices at which the

rationed quantities would be preferred, utility—maximizing amounts of those

goods (Tobin and Houthakker, 1950—51). In this welfare sense, the ?ttrueVv

GNP deflator that is relevant for individual utility functions is then a

weighted average of actual prices for uncontrolled goods and the shadow

prices of controlled goods. Such a price concept rises during a control

period relative to the actual deflator. Thus to the extent that rationing

is important, the use of the actual deflator overstates real income in the

welfare sense and hence understates the Tttruel? rate of price increase. The

main impact of controls measured below occurs in 1971—72, when there were

few reported cases of shortages. The main impact of the removal of controls

on measured prices occurred in 1974. Since there were widespread shortages

reported in 1973, the actual beneficial impact of controls may have evaporated
                                                                     15

in 1973 instead of in 1974. But this point seems only to influence timing

and not to deny the two main conclusions reached below——that the cntro1s

did have an impact on prices in 1971—72, and that the beneficial          was

only temporary.


Choice   of E-)aluatjon Techniques and .?xoZanatory Models

     The most common technique used to evaluate the impact of the i:on

controls during the first round of research in 1971—73 was the cor'arison

of the actual path of inflation with the path projected in the dynamic

simulation of a model estimated for the pre—controls period. This technique

is used again here, with equations estimated for the period ending in 197l:Q2

simulated to evaluate the Nixon controls and for the period ending in l977:Q4

used to evaluate the voluntary Carter pay standards. The results from the

dynamic simulations of the 1954—71 equations are supp1etented with an alter-

native evaluation based on the coefficients of dummy variables included in

equations for the full 1954—80 period, in order to use information from the

decade of the 1970s on the impact of variables that were important during

the Nixon controls interval but not before 1971, especially the effect of

flexible exchange rates.

     The "basic" equation developed below in section VI represents our best

effort to describe the inflation process during 1954—80 using a sinole

reduced—form equation. The specification developed there has already proved

its usefulness in studies of a longer historical period stretching sack to

the late nineteenth century. In addition, sections IV and V present for

the sake of comparison two much simpler models. Section IV presents an

ARIMA model of the inflation process that imposes no structure at oil on
                                                                              16
 the data, except for the restrictive assumption that inflation depends only

 on its own lagged values. Section V presents a model in which the only

 explanatory variables are current and lagged changes in the
                                                                    money supply,
 thus forcing the impact of inertia to work through the coefficients on

 lagged money, and excluding the impact of other variables that play a role

in the complete specification of Section VI.


                                 IV.   THE ARIMA MODEL


Methodology and Speolfication
        A straightforward way to view the evolution of
                                                       any time series is as

a univariate stochastic process. Following Quenouille (1957), Zellner and

Palm (1974) provide a justification for this practice. We start from a

linear dynamic equation system relating jointly covariance stationary

variables,


             (3)
                         H(B)x             F(B)e,

where H(B) and F(B) are finite polynomial matrices in the
                                                               lag operator,
   is the vector of variables, and e is a vector of independent white noise

disturbances. Under the usual assumption that H is invertible, we can

write


            (4)          x   =    H(B)F(B)e                F(B)e.
This   implies

                          H(B)x        =
                                            H*(B)F(B)et,
where H is adjoint to H. The 1th variate has the representation

                                       =
                         H(B)Jx.
                                                                                     17

where IH(B)Iis a scalar polynomial and          is the th row of H(B)F(B).

Because the sum of independent moving average processes of order q is also

a moving average process of order q, x. has the ARMA            (autoregressive    moving

average) representation



               (5)                   =


where    a.
          it
               is scalar white noise, c(B) = jH(B)   I,   and O.(B)
                                                               1      is   a finite poly-

nomial    in the lag operator.

         It is clear that the a will be, in general, correlated. Because this fact
                              1
 is   overlooked in univariate time series work, such models must be inferior to

multiple time series models that exploit these correlations. Feige and

Pearce (1976) have used univariate ARIMA models to assess the effects of

the Nixon controls.12 While we find univariate ARIMA models inadequate

to quantify the dynamics of the inflation process, this approach is useful

as a point of departure for our more complete specification developed in

section VI.

        Our ARIMA analysis concentrates on second differences of the logarithm

of the quarterly fixed—weight GNP deflator ((l_B)p). The data plot and auto—

correlation function of (l_B)p show no indication of nonstationarity. The

autocorrelation function and partial autocorrelation function each have a

single significant peak at lag 1; the partial autocorrelation function has

smaller peaks at lags 3 and 5. These facts suggest, but do not demand, an

ARIMA (0,1,1) model, i.e., (l_B)p = (1_QB)at.'3             This accords with the

finding of Granger and Newbold (1977) that appropriately differenced

economic time series are often well represented by low order moving
                                                                                    18
 average processes.

       When a variety of low order ARA models were fit to the data for

quarters excluding the Nixon controls interval (i.e., l954:Ql—1971:Q2

plus 1975:Q2—1980:Q2) . we obtained the. following estimates.

While line 2 has the lowest standard error, its Q statitic is higher than

the models listed on lines 3 through 6.15 The fact that the second auto-

regressive parameter of line 2 is not significantly different from zero

mirrors the fact that the standard error of line 2 is not significantly

less than line 3. Therefore, line 3 is preferred to line 2. Line 5

dominates line 3, so the ARIMA (0,1,1) model is selected as an adequate

univariate representation of the inflation process. When estimated only

over the pre—.controls period l954:Ql—l971:Q2, this model has as its single

parameter 0        .57, a standard error of estimate of 1.00, and Q         10.0.

Estimated controls Effects


       As is true throughout this paper, both the dummy variable and post—

sample dynamic simulation techniques are         used   to evaluate the impact of

the Nixon control program. Both methods require that we establish the
                                                                            19

timing of the program, since both dummy variables and calculations of post—

sample simulation errors must be dated. Because the controls program began

as a surprise, there is no reason to believe it had any effect before

August 15, 1971, and thus it is assumed that the program had an immediate

impact on inflation beginning in 1971:Q3.

       As for its duration, the controls program is alternatively assumed to

restrain inflation through Freeze I only (1971:Q4), through Phase II (l972:Q4),

and through Preeze II (1973:Q3). Periods of catchup inflation due to the

removal of controls are assumed alternatively to begin immediately after

the periods above, and after the end of Phase IV (l974Q2). In any event,

the rebound effect from the controls program is assumed to have run its

course a year after the final dismantling of the controls program (1975:Ql).

       The use of dummy variables in ARIMA models, i.e., intervention analysis,

is slightly ore complicated than in usual regression (see Box and Tiao, 1975).

Suppose non—controls inflation follows (l—B)p        =              and controls
                                                         (l_eB)a,
and the subsequent rebound are thought to depress and increase mean infla-

tion. Then,

             (6)          Pt = l:BBa +            + w2OFF,

 and
             (7)
                         (l_B)p    =   (l-B)wiON + (1_B)w2OFF +
                          1—eB          l—eB               1—OB



in which a is a white noise, justifying conventional multiple regression.

Because


                            =    1 —   B(1—6)(l+OB+62B2+   .   .
                                                                          20

each variable in (7) is first transformed by deducting an exponential

weighted moving average of prior values.

     Estimated coefficients of "on" and "off" controls effects from equa-

tions estimated for the interval 1954:Q2 through 1980:Q2 are reported in the

upper part of Table 2. The standard error and Durbin—Watson statistic for

a regression without transformed intervention dummies is reported in column

(1). These statistics compare unfavorably with those associated with the

ARINA models reported in the previous section because of the addition to

the sample period of the control quarters 1971:Q3—1975:Q1. The statistics

also compare unfavorably with those of the other columns in Table 2, sug-

gesting that some modeling of the controls episode is preferable to none.

     In columns (2) through (5) the reported coefficients are of the total

cumulative effect of the program on the price level. That is, the "on'

and "off" variables are scaled so that they add to 4.0 over the full period

they are in effect. Column (2), for example, estimates that by the end of

Phae II prices were 2.9 percent lower than they would have been had there

been no controls. The catch—up inflation beginning after Freeze II more

than eliminated this gain, and in the price level wound up 1.53 percent

higher than otherwise (i.e., 1.53 equals the 4.43 "off" effect minus the 2.90

?QTV effect). The equations in columns (4) and (5) also display significant

restraint of inflation in the controls period, while all of the equations in

columns (2) through (5) exhibit a significant post—controls rebound effect.

     The   bottom   of Table 2 exhibits results from a dynamic simulation in

which the ARIMA parameter estimated for the period ending in l97l:Q2 is

used to generate post—sample forecasts, with forecast rather than actual

values used as the lagged dependent variable for all quarters after l971:Q2.

The resulting simulated values of Pt are the best estimate that can be

produced by the ARINA model of the inflation that would have occurred

after 1971:Q2 based on information available at that date. The numbers

displayed in lines 4a and 4b of Table 2 represent the difference between

the actual and simulated values for the various sub—periods designated in

lines 1 and 2. Thus the simulation error in each column corresponds to the

time period of the dummy variable used in the intervention analysis shown in

the same column.


      The ARINA model estimated does much better in explaining why there

 was so little inflation during mid—1971 through mid—1973 than in explaining

 why there was so much inflation between mid—1973 and early 1975. In

 short, the total amount of inflation between mid—1971 and early 1975 is

 underpredicted by the dynamic simulations.


     Why   does the underprediction occur in the dynamic simulation but not in
the intervention analysis in the upper part of Table 2? In contrast to the

simulated value, which uses a parameter estimated from the 1954—71 period

to generate the lagged dependent variable, the dummy variables are estimated

in equations for 1954—80 in which the actual lagged dependent variable is

used. Thus any variables other than the controls that influenced actual

inflation after 1971, e.g., oil and food prices, are implicitly taken into

account in the intervention analysis in the upper part of the table but not

by the simulation analysis in the lower part. This, of course, is one of

the disadvantages of the simulation technique cited in our methodological

discussion above.

                  V. A "MONEY—ONLY" EXPLANATION OF INFLATION


      Recently a great deal of attention in the U. S. empirical macroeconomics

 literature has been focussed on models in which the price change process is

 driven by little other than current and lagged changes in the money supply.17

 In such models there is
                           no role for supply shifts, either in the
 form of the Nixon controls or changing relative prices of food and energy,

and any inertia in the price—setting process is forced to enter through the

lagged money terms rather than through lagged price terms, which are excluded

by assumption.

     Column (1) of Table 3 is based on an equation for 1954—80 that explains

price change as a function only of a constant, the current rate of change of

M1B, and 27 lagged changes in money, where the lagged coefficients are

estimated by the polynomial distributed la   technique. As is evident in a
comparison of column (1) in Tables 2 and 3, the ARIMA and money—only models

fit the data equally well, with respective standard errors of 1.25 and 1.27

percentage points (recall that the dependent variable is expressed as a

percentage annual rate). We shall see in ction VI that these standard

errors are relatively large, in the sense that the standard error in explain-

ing the same dependent variable for the same sample period can be cut almost

In half by using a more complete specification of the inflation process.

     The rest of Table 3 is arranged exactly like Table 2. Lines 1 and 2

exhibit coefficients on dummy variables estimated for various "on" and "off"

periods in equations that also include current and
                                                     past monetary changes.
The general pattern of the dummy variables is very close to that of Table 2;

all "on" dummy coefficients are within 0.50 of each other in the two
                                                                       tables,

 and all "off" coefficients are within 1.00 of each other. It is interesting

 that columns (2), (4), and (5) in Table 3 display "on" and "off" coefficients

 that are fairly close in absolute value, indicating that there is no puzzle

of unexplained high inflation in 1974 from the point of view of these equa—

 tions. A final remark on the 1954—80 results is that the standard errors of

the money equations in Table 3 that include dummy variables are uniformly

better than the corresponding equations of Table 2.      Although there is more

evidence of positive serial correlation in the money results, this is to be

expected in view of the bias in Durbin—Watson statistics present when a lagged

dependent variable is included, as in Table 2, but not Table 3.

     Lines 5a and 5b of Table 3 display errors in post—sample simulations

of equations estimated for 1954—71 that include only a constant term and cur-

rent and lagged money. In contrast to the simulation results in Table 2,

there does not seem to be a serious problem of
                                                   underprediction of price change

during the 1971—75 period. In column (5), which includes all but two of the

quarters between l971:Q3 and l975:Ql, the cumulative "on" error and "off"

error are about equal in absolute value, whereas in Table 2 the
                                                                    corresponding
column indicates a cumulative underprediction of about
                                                           4.5 percentage points.
     Why   should   the post—sample simulations of the money—only equations be

more adequate in explaining cumulative inflation during 1971—75?     The answer

is implied by the simple summary statistics of Table 1. The naive ARIMA

model is forced to predict inflation in 19 71—75 only on the basis of informa-

tion available about inflation during 1954—71 and thus has no basis upon

which to explain the high average rate of inflation during 1971—75. In
                                                                           -
contrast the money—only version explains high inflation during 1971—75

through the contribution of the acceleration in average monetary growth that
                                                                       26

occurred in the early l970s, as well as through the contribution of its long

lag distribution when multiplied by the relatively rapid rate of money growth

that occurred in the late 1960s. In short, the money—only post—sample

simulation has a piece of evidence on what actually happened in the early

l970s, the acceleration of money growth, whereas the ARIMA simulation has no

information at all on what actually happened in the early 1970s. This inter-

pretation also helps to explain why the dummy variable and simulation tech-

niques give roughly the same results in Table 3 and not in Table 2. In

Table 3 the two techniques use essentially the same information and differ

only on the estimated coefficients; in contrast in Table 2 the two techniques

are based both. on different information and on different coefficients.



       VI. A MORE COLETE SPECIFICATION OF THE INFLATION PROCESS


Relation   of the Reduced-Form Specification to Conventional Wage and Price   Equations

     The two previous sectIons examined the effect of government intervention

in the price—setting process within the context of two extremely restricted

models. The ARIMA specification implies that inflation depends only on its

own past values, i.e., that "inertia" is the only element in the inflation

process. The money—only approach combines a pure demand framework in its

introduction of current monetary changes with a role for inertia through the

inclusion of lagged monetary changes. Yet both specifications exclude many

variables that may in fact help to explain inflation, especially supply factors

like oil and food prices, productivity growth, payroll taxes, and the minimum

wage. We may also ask whether there is any role in the inflation process

for the traditional Phillips curve variable that represents the impact of
                                                                                  27

 aggregate demand, i.e., the level of the unemployment rate or the output

 ratio.

      Our more complete specification begins with separate equations explain-

 ing wage change and the relation of prices to wages, which we then combine

 to eliminate the wage variable. In the subsequent discussion upper—case

 letters represents logs of levels of variables and lower—case letters repre-

sent rates of change; where possible the notation is chosen to correspond to

 that in Gordon (l980a). Our basic demand variable, representing the effect

on inflation of labor-market tightness and the pressure of excess commodity

demand, is the output ratio              the log of the ratio of actual real GNP

to "natural"       real GNP (Q), i.e.,        =     — Q.   The role of   excess   demand

is always entered both as a level              and also as a rate of change

     The rate of change of wages (we) is assumed to depend on lagged price

changes
                    plus the "equilibriu" growth in the real wage (Xe), the
level and rate of change of the output ratio, supply shifts in the wage
equation (), and an error term (ce):

             (8)            w = c0(p1 + A)         +
                                                       ciQ + a2q.+ ct3z    +


The actual   growth in the real wage rate (relative to last period's inflation

rate) will not be at the equilibrium rate unless            = 1 and all the other

variables in the equation (Q , q , z , and c
                            t   t         y        wt have realizations equal to zero.

Among the supply shifts (z) that might enter the wage equation are the


impact of government controls and of changes in the payroll tax and minimum

wage rate. Because w is the same variable that enters the price equation,
                                                                       28

it is implicitly defined as "gross employer labor cost" including employer—

financed fringe benefits and payroll taxes.

     The price mark—up equation relates current price change        to the

current change in "standard" unit labor cost (w —
                                                    o),   the same demand


variables as appear in (8), a vector of supply shift variables (zr) that

influence the level of prices relative to wages, and an error term




                   Pt Ot c)                   2ci 3pt          pt

The fact that the current wage enters the price equation, but only lagged

price change enters the wage equation, is an expositional convenience that

is not essential for what follows. Among the supply shift variables (z)

that could enter into the price equation are government controls, changes

in foreign exchange rates and in the relative prices of food and energy,

and shifts in indirect tax rates. In principle, capital costs should enter

into the price equation, as in Gordon (1975), but capital costs complicate

the exposition without providing any substantial improvement in the explana—

tion of inflation that is provided below.

     When (8) is substituted into (9), we obtain a reduced—form inflation

equation:




            (10)   Pt =   00t-l + 8oo)           +    lolt +
                          + 3pt

The long—run equilibrium properties of (10) can be seen more easily if we

combine the separate z variables, error terms, and coefficients from the

wage and price equations:




             (11)         Pt =                  +
                                                    y0(X_a    ) +           + 1iQ +        +       +


                          where         =                 =                           =        +
                                                                     2 20a2; Z                     O32wt'
                              andc =
                                    t
                                            c
                                             pt     +cOwt

      What are the conditions necessary for (11) to generate a constant

equilibrium rate of inflation? First, the coefficient on lagged price change

(i) must be unity. Second, the equilibrium real wage term in the wage

equation and standard productivity growth in the price equation must be

equal               =   0).   Third, the coefficient on standard unit labor cost in the

price equation must be unity (y, =                        = l).18   Fourth, the level and rate of


change of the output ratio, as well as every supply shift variable, must also

be equal to zero               =        =z      =   0).   Correspondingly (11) lays out those

events that can cause the inflation rate to accelerate, including an excess of

   over a1, a level of the log of the output ratio above zero, a positive


rate of growth of the output ratio, and any adverse supply shock. Clearly

Q =     0   (i.e., Q =        Q),   represents the "natural rate of output" only if all


of the other conditions stated in the previous sentence are valid. If there
                                                                           30

is, for instance, an adverse supply shift (z >0), inflation can accelerate

even if       —   0.   In other words an excess of    over   or a positive


realization of any z variable, pushes the "constant inflation" level of

output below the value of          from whith    is calculated. Thus the frame-

work of equation (11) has the potential of explaining why inflation acceler-

ated during the 1970s, despite the fact that the measure of           summarized in

Table 1 was    negative    on average during the decade.

     Two   additional     elements could be introduced.into the model of (8) and

(9), but are not pursued here to simplify the paper. First, the workings of

inertia in (8) could take the form of a dependence of wages on lagged wages

rather than lagged prices. In this case lagged wages would enter (10), and

thus a wage equation as well as a price equation would have to be estimated

in order to close the model. Second, wages could depend on consumer prices,

which differ from the value—added prices determined by (9), since the former

include imports. Such a specification would bring the difference between

consumer and va.ue—added prices into (10) as an additional variable. During

the decade of the 1970s, this difference is highly correlated with the food—

energy supply shift variable introduced below, so that our reduced—form

implicitly captures most of the impact of consumer prices on wages.

     There is one rather subtle obstacle to the estimation of (11). We

would expect the rate of inflation to respond positively to the speed of

economic expansion,            But there are two reasons why Pt and     may have a


negative correlation that results in a downward bias in the coefficient

One reason is measurement error; since nominal GNP and prices are measured

independently, with real GNP as a residual, any error in the measurement
                                                                        31

of prices introduces an opposite movement in          Second, for any given

growth rate of nominal GNP, a supply shock (z > 0) raises Pt and reduces

q; any errors in measurement of the         variables may introduce a spurious

negative correlation between Pt and          To avoid this problem we use the


identity Pt + q   =
                      y,   where the latter variable stands for the excess of

nominal GNP growth over the growth in natural real GNP         =


When this identity is substituted for        in (11), we cart factor out p and

obtain our final estimating equation:




      (12)            =                   l2t + lt—l + yo(x_) + y3z +
                          11-2OPt1


where for convenience we assume


     (12) is the final form for which we provide estimates in this section

of the paper. All that remains is to specify the productivity term (X —

and the exact variables to represent the supply shock terms (zr). We note

that the long—run equilibrium properties of (12) differ slightly from those

of (11). If the sum of coefficients on lagged prices in (11) is unity

      1), then in (12) it will be the sum of the coefficients on lagged


prices and on y that equal unity.

     The basic inflation equation to be examined, analyzed, and simulated in the
                                                                         32

rest of this paper contains a number of variables, some of which are uncon-

ventional. To make our approach easier to understand, we present in Table 4

eight equations hich introduce the explanatory variables one at a time. Our

explanation of the method of construction of each variable accompanies the

discussion of the equation where that variable is introduced.

          1. lagged Inflation. Column (1) of Table 4 presents an extremely

simple equation in which the inflation rate is explained only by its own

lagged values. The dependent variable and sample period are identical to

Tables 2 and 3, and the only difference between this equation and the ARIMA

equation in column (1) of Table 2 is the method of specifying the lag dis-

tribution. Here in Table 4 the coefficient of 1.04 is not a single coefficient

for a single lagged dependent variable, but rather the sum of 24 lag co-

efficients constrained to lie along a fourth degree polynomial. Comparing

the first columns of Table 2 and Table 4, we note that the latter has a

slightly lower standard error, indicating that the flexibility provided by

the polynomial distributed lag (PDL) technique provides enough of an improve-

ment of fit to offset the extra degrees of freedom required.

          2.. iiiaon   Control   Dummies. Tables 2 and 3 presented estimates of

Nixon controls effects using dummy variables for several alternative time

periods. Here we choose 197l—Q3 through l972:Q4 for the Tton" effect and

l974:Q2 through l975:Ql for the uoffl effect, both because these periods

seemed to provide the best fit in our preliminary research, and because the

same periods were used in earlier papers. Column (2) suggests that dummy

variables for these periods added to the pure autoregression of column (1)

have insignificant coefficients. This result contrasts with the significant

dummies estimated in the equivalent column (4) of Table 2, a difference that

Notes to Table 4
     a.    The dependent variable is the same as that in Table 3. The numbers

in parentheses are t statistics.

     b. The coefficient shown is the sum of 24 distributed lag coefficients

constrained to lie along     fourth degree polynomial with   a   zero end—point

constraint.

     a. The dummy variables are constrained to addup to 4.0 (reflecting

the conversion of quarterly changes of all variables to annual rates).

Thus the        dummy is equal to 2/3 for the six quarters listed, and the

"off" dummy is equal to 1,0 for the four quarters listed,

     d. The coefficient shown is the sum of a set of unconstrained

coefficients on the current and lagged values, with four lags included

on lines 7 9, and 10, and two lags included on line 8.

     All regressions contain an insignificant constant. -
                                                                        35

may be explained by the ability of the PDL distribution to twist around

enough to explain partially the slowdown of inflation of 1972 and accelera-

tion of 1974.19

            3. The Lagged Output Ratio           Column (3) adds the lagged

output   ratio, one of the two "demand" variables that appear in equation (12).
This traditional    Phillips curve variable is highly significant; its coefficient

of 0.31 indicates that a one percentage point excess of actual real GNP

above natural real GNP causes an acceleration of inflation of 0.31 percentage

points at an annual rate per quarter. The total acceleration over the first

year of such an excess would be greater than 0.31 percentage points, because

after the first quarter the additional inflation would begin to feed through

the lagged dependent variable. Two important features of column (3) are

the jump in the size and significance of the Nixon control dummies, and the

increase in the sum of coefficients on the lagged dependent variable. The

former reflects the negative correlation of        and the inflation rate in

the early 1970s (see Table 1), i.e., in column (3) the "computer cannot under-

stand" why inflation accelerated in 1974 when        was dropping and thus

assigns a positive and significant dummy to the controls "off" variable that

is in effect at the same time. The latter shift results from the failure of

inflation to slow down in the 1970—71 recession, so that the lagged dependent


variable must be assigned a greater role when the        variable (which fell

from 1969 to 1970—71) is introduced.

            4.   Adjusted Nominal GNP Growth (y). The nominal GNP growth

variable that appears in equation (12)    is defined net of natural real GNP

growth. The same natural real GNP variable is used in level form to define
                                                                             36

the output ratio            and in growth—rate form to adjust the officially

measured rate of nominal CNP groith. The introduction of y in column (4)

further increases the size of the Nixon control dummy cOefficients without

having any impact on the theoretical          coefficient, which is now measured

as the sum of the coefficients displayed on line 1 and line 5. Note that a

slowdown in the trend growth rate of productivity will reduce natural real

GNP growth and raise y, so that this variable represents the combined ef-


fects of demand stimulation and long—run productivity growth.

            5.   Relative   Prices   of Food and Energy The   first of the supply

shock   variables to be introduced in Table 4 is the contribution to inflation
of changes in the relative prices of food and energy. This effect is measured
by the difference between the rate of change of the private business deflator
and that of an alternative deflator that attempts to "strip out" the impact

of the changing relative prices of food and energy.20 While this variable is

significant and makes a contribution to the fit of the equation without caus-

ing appreciable changes in the size of the other coefficients, its own co-

efficient seems surprisingly low. This probably reflects errors in the

measurement of the true food—energy contribution; our variable exhibits sub-

stantial jumps from quarter to quarter that may miss the actual timing of the

impact of food and energy prices. Also our dependent variable in this paper

is the fixed—weight CNP deflator, which differs both in coverage and in weight-

ing from the implicit deflator for private business used to construct the

food—energy variable.

           6. Productivity Deviation. The second supply variable is the

deviation of the rate of growth of nonfarm labor productivity from its trend,
                                                                             37

estimated in a regression of the quarterly growth rate of nonfarm productivity

for 1954—80 that contains a constant and a single trend beginning in 1970.

This trend falls from a growth rate of about 2.5 percent to zero over the

1970—80 decade, and a distributed lag of residuals from the productivity

equation is entered in line (6) into the inflation equation. The justification

for the appearance of this variable stems from our inability to observe the

productivity variable that firms actually use in adjusting labor costs whert

making their pricing decisions. Let us imagine that the productivity

variable in the wage equation (x)        is   a constant representing a straight time

trend, t, whereas the "standard" productivity variable in the price equation

     is a weighted average of the actual growth rate of productivity

and another constant trend (t):


           (13)




           (14)             =   p(p)   + (1—)t,2l


so that the productivity variable that appears in equation (12) becomes:


           (15)                   =


The (t —
     w
           tp   )   term becomes absorbed in the constant of the inflation equation
and is indistinguishable from the other possible source of a non—zero constant

term, the misrneasurement of the level of natural real GNP.

     The introduction of the productivity deviation variable in column (6)

of Table 4 yields a highly significant estimate of .i=0.43, indicating that

firms base their pricing decisions on a productivity variable that combines

actual productivity with a 43 percent weight and a time trend with a 57 percent
                                                                      38

weight. Coefficients on several other variables change in response to the

introduction of the productivity deviation. The Nixon cOntrols effect becomes

substantially smaller, because the rapid growth of productivity in 1972 and

the decline in productivity in 1974 both help to explain why inflation was

relatively low in 1972 and high in 1974, thus requiring less of a contributjor
                                                                                  z

from the controls dummies. The other major changes are a doubling in the co-

efficient on y and a further reduction in the sum of coefficients on the

lagged dependent variable.22

          7. Effective Exchzng Rate. The depreciation of the dollar during

the 1970s has not been included as an explanatory variable in previous studies,

mainly because it has been difficult to find a statistically significant ef-

fect for changes in the exchange rate. We believe that this previous insig-

nificance of the exchange rate stems from the impact of the Nixon controls

in delaying the adjustment of U. S. domestic prices to the dollar depreciation

that occurred in two stages between 1971 and 1973. We have created a new

variable which is equal to the actual change in the effective exchange rate of

the dollar (i.e., the number of units of a market basket of foreign currencies

that the dollar can buy each quarter) starting in l974:Q3, but which is set

equal to zero before 1974 and thus forces the entire 16 percent decline in the

effective exchange rate that occurred between 1971:Q3 and l974:Q2 to occur

in two quarters, l974:Ql and 1974:Q2. Column (7) of Table 4 indicates that

this new effective exchange rate variable is highly significant and substan-

tially weakens the Nixon controls "off" effect, in effect implying that the

delayed impact of dollar depreciation rather than the termination of controls

per e explains why inflation accelerated so much during 1974.
                                                                       39

             8. Payroll Tax. Discussions of economic policy in the past five

years have devoted much attention to "self—inflicted wounds," whereby the

government has introduced policies that directly worsen the inflation rate.

One of these factors, changes in the effective social security tax rate, is

entered into our basic equation as a five—quarter unconstrained distributed

lag in column (8) of Table 4•23 A sum of coefficients of 1.00 on this variable

would indicate that all changes in the effective tax rate, which includes both

the employee and employer shares of the tax, are shifted forward into prices.

The coefficient of 0.43 in column (8) indicates a shifting effect that is

only partial but by no means negligible.

             9. Effective Minimum Wage Rate. Another much—discussed "self—

inflicted wound" has been increases in the effective minimum wage rate,

defined as the ratio of the statutory minimum wage to average hourly earnings

in the nonf arm private economy. This variable, also entered as a five—

quarter unconstrained lag, has only a marginal inflationary impact in column

(8). The sum of coefficients of 0.02 means that the cumulative 8 percent in-

crease in the effective minimum wage rate during the four quarters of 1978 ac-

counted for an acceleration of inflation of about 0.16 percentage points. In

section IX below we examine the quantitative impact of the "self—inflicted

wounds" in accounting for the variance and overall acceleration of inflation

in the 1970s.


Conclusion   to Section VI.

     The final equation presented in Table 4 has a standard error of 0.65,

little more than half of the standard error of the pure autoregression in

column (1) or of the pure ARIMA or money—only equations presented in Tables
                                                                      40

2 and 3. The fraction of the total variance of the dependent variable that

remains unexplained drops from 16.4 percent in column (1) to 3.6 percent in

column (8). Thus the more complete model substantially improves our ability

to explain the behavior of the 1954—80 inflation rate.



      VII. ESTIMATED IMPACT OF CONTROLS, PAY STANDARDS, AND GUIDELINES


     Our methodological discussion in section III compared two methods of

estimating the effects of price controls and other types of government inter-

vention. Dummy variables, such as those included in Table. 4, have the advantage

that all of the available historical data can be included in equations that

are used to estimate their coefficients, and the disadvantage that they force

the effect of a particular intervention program to have a uniform impact each

quarter. The other alternative method, post—sample dynamic simulations,

has the advantage that arbitrary decisions regarding the timing of the program

can be avoided, and the disadvantage that the impact of important variables

that operate only in the post—sample period cannot be assessed. If these

left—out variable effects interact with the controls, then the post—sample

dynamic simulations can give quite different answers than the dummy variable

technique.

      A method introduced by Blinder (1979) estimates an equation for the

entire sample period, taking advantage of all the data as in the dummy variable

technique, but instead of using dummy variables, constructs a new variable to

represent the impact of the controls that is equal to the fraction of the CPI

subject to price controls in each month, based on government records. The

Blinder approach has two advantages over the dummy variable technique. First,
                                                                           41

there is no need to make arbitrary decisions regarding timing, as must be

done in dating dummy variables, since the constructed variable contains its

own independent information on timing. Second, the controls are allowed to

have varying effects each quarter rather than the uniform effect imposed by

our "on" and "off" dummies. Below we shall examine the consequences of re-

placing our dunImy variables with the Blinder variables and compare the assess-

ment of the controls implied by the two techniques.


Evaluatinc' the Nixon   Controls Period with Simulations and Dummy Variables

      Table   5 provides the information needed to compare alternative methods

of evaluating the quantitative impact of the Nixon controls program. Belot

in this section we shall also examine the implications of the same techniques

for an assessment of the Kennedy—Johnson guidelines and the Carter pay

standards. The basic inflation equation is presented ii      three   pairs. Each

of the three pairs is estimated for a different sample period, in every case

starting in 1954:Q2 and ending, respectively, in 197l:Q2, l977:Q4, and l980:Q2.

For each sample period the left column presents an unconstrained estimate,

and the right column presents a variant that constrains y (i.e., the sum of

the coefficients on y and on the lagged dependent variable) to be unity.

As in previous research we find that unity constraints are necessary for

equations to yield adequate post—sample simulations, since the unconstrained

versions tend to contain estimates of -     that   exceed unity and thus make the

equations dynamically unstable. 2

      The first pair of columns in Table 5 presents unconstrained and con—

strained equations for the portion of the sample period ending in 1971:Q2,

Notes to Table 5

     a. All variables are the same as in Table 4.     The numbers in parentheses
 are t statistics. No t statistics are shown for the
                                                         constrained equations,
 since these are not calculated correctly
                                            by standard regression programs.

     b. The constraint is that y, the sum of coefficients on adjusted

nominal GNP growth and lagged inflation, be 1.0; our iterative procedure

described in footnote 25 stopped just short of convergence (0.85 + 0.16 =
                                                                               1.01).
     c. Cumulated errors are divided by 4 to make the estimates of controls

effects commensurate with dummy variable coefficients.    Columns (3), (4)
(5) and (6) report durmny variable coefficients on lines a and c and cumulated

regression residuals on line b. Columns (5) and (6) report cumulated

regression residuals on line d.
                                                                     43

in column (1) can be compared with the equivalent full—sample equation in

column (5), which duplicates the final column of Table 4. The main difference

in the shorter sample period is the extremely high sum of coefficients on the

lagged dependent variable; this phenomenon results from the failure of infla—

don to slow down in the 1969—70 recession in the face of a substantial decline

in the contribution to inflation of the      and y variables. In the longer

sample period the sum of the coefficients on the lagged dependent variable is

much closer to unity, in order to allow the equation to remain on track in

the 1970q.

      As would be expected in an equation that is as dynamically unstable as

that in column (1), a post—sample dynamic simulation substantially over—

predicts the actual rate of inflation that occurred between 1971 and l980

Thus the negative simulation errors in 1971—73 have the misleading implication

that the controls had a major effect in holding down th inflation rate, while

the small positive errors in the 1974 "off" interval imply a very small re-

bound as compared with the estimate of "what would have happened otherwise."

We do not believe that these simulation results can be taken seriously in

light of the steadily growing drift of the simulated values away from the

actual values as the decade proceeds.

      Column (2) constrains the    coefficient to be unity, and this results in

a substantial deterioration in the standard error during the equation's sample

period, but a marked improvement in the ability of the post—sample dynamic

simulation to track the inflation rate during the 1970s.25 In contrast to the

cumulative overprediction rjf inflation of 4.32 percentage points between

l971:Q3 and l975:Q1 in column (1), inflation in column (2) for that interval

is now underpredicted by 2.29 percentage points, with the implication that
                                                                            44

the "off"   effect   had a greater effect in raising prices than the "on"

effect had in lowering prices.

      Why does this result differ from the dummy variable estimates of

column (6) of Table 5, where the cumulative "on" and "off" effects are about

the same size? The other coefficients in the constrained short—sample and

full—sample equations, columns (2) and (6), are amazingly close to each other,

with the exceptiot of the effective exchange rate, which does not appear in

the short—sample equation. The post—sample simulation in column (2), which

is given no information on the exchange rate, makes an underprediction error

in 1974 that confuses the true controls "off" effect with the unobserved

depreciation of the dollar, whereas the full—period equation in column (6)

has the extra information necessary to attribute separate effects to controls

and the exchange rate.

      Below in the final section of the paper we run dynamic simulations that

allow us to assess the separate impact of each explanatory variable to the

inflation that occurred between 1970—80; those results indicate that the

1970—80 depreciation of the dollar accounted for a cumulative extra increase

in the price level of 2.7 percentage points between 1978:Q1 and 1980:Q2, as

opposed to a hypothetical alternative of fixed exchange rates throughout the

decade. That figure can be compared to the 4.0 percentage point cumulative

underprediction of inflation for the same interval in the constrained short—

period equation in column (2) that does not include the exchange rate. The

remaining portion of the cumulative 1978—80 simulation error in column (2)

that is not due to the omission of the foreign exchange variable is only 1.4

percentage points, and this seems remarkably small for an equation that is

being asked to forecast inflation between seven and nine years after the end

of its sample period. 26

The   Carter Paj Standards and Other Events During 1978_SO

         Did the Carter pay standards, which were introduced in the fourth

quarter of 1978, have any impact on the inflation rate? This question can be

assessed, as in the case of the Nixon controls, either by use of the post—

sample simulation or dummy variable technique. An equation estimated to the

end of 1977 is used for post—sample dynamic simulations and is displayed in

columns (3) and (4) of Table 5 in both unconstrained and constrained form.

The coefficients are very close to those in the full—period equations dis-

played in columns (5) and (6) and because of this similarity we would not

expect the 1954—77 equations to go seriously astray in post—sample simulations

of the 1978—80 interval.

         The cumulative 19.78—80 simulation errors fOr the unconstrained and con-

strained versions are, respectively, —1.32 and —0.06 percentage points.

Thus the unconstrained version, with its implied dynamic instability

(y0 =    1.10),   overpredicts 1979—80 inflation at about a 0.5 percent annual

rate, whereas the constrained version is almost exactly on track. Within

the five quarters when the first phase of the pay standards was in effect,

l978:Q4—1979:Q4, the respective cumulative errors are —0.86 and —0.18 per-

centage points. In light of the dynamic instability of the unconstrained

equation, the implication of the constraine.d equation——that the pay standards

had virtually no impact on the inflation rate——seems more reliable.

        The alternative method of evaluating the Carter pay standards is to

introduce one or more dummy variables for the period during which they were

in effect. We have taken our "basic equation" from Table 4, column (8) and

Table 5, column (5), and have introduced two dummy variables for the periods
                                                                     46

1978:Q4—1979:Q4 and 1980:Ql—l980:Q2, respectively. The first dummy can be

interpreted as the effect on inflation of the initial year of the pay stan-

dards, while the second dummy can be interpreted either as the effect of the

second phase of the pay standards or of the "postcontrols rebound" following

the first stage. The resulting coefficients and t statistics are:


          Carter dummy I (1978:Q4—1979:Q4)    —0.67 (—1.08)

          Carter dummy II (1980:Ql—1980:Q2)      0.05   C   0.18)

Both variables are insignificantly different from zero, so that the dummy

variable technique supports the post—sample simulation technique in assessing

the pay standards as having no impact. Both the post—sample simulations and

dummy variables suggest that there was nothing unusual about the inflation

experience between late 1978 and mid 1980, and that the other variables in

the equation are capable of tracking the data.


Kennedy-Johnson GuideZines

     Another episode of government intervention occurred during the Kennedy

and Johnson administration, when there were quasi—voluntary guidelInes

established for wage increases. These guidelines, first mentioned in the

1962 Economic Report of the President, are generally assumed to have been in

effect between early 1963 and mid—1966, when the pressure of excess demand

and the victory of the airline machinists union in obtaining a large wage

increase led the Administration to abandon the program. Some investigators,

e.g., Perry (l980) have found that the guidelines indeed did hold down wage

increases. Because the guidelines occurred relatively early in our sample

period, we do not have sufficient degrees of freedom available to estimate an

equation ending in 1962 for the purpose of post—sample dynamic simulations,
                                                                            47
and we are forced to rely on the
                                    dummy variible technique as were other in—

vestigators who assessed the guidelines in the past.

     Our guidelines "on" variable is assumed to be in effect between 1963:Ql—

1965:Q4.27 Despite the substantial evidence presented above and elsewhere

that the Nixon controls had a substantial post—control "rebound" effect,

previous studies have not examined the possibility of a post—guidelines

rebound. Thus we enter a separate dummy variable for the three—year period

beginning in l966:Ql to assess the possibility that part of the 1966—68

acceleration in the inflation rate was due to the end of the guidelines

rather than a general state of excess demand in the economy. When these

dummy variables are included in our basic unconstrained inflation equation,

the resulting coefficients and t statistics are:


             Guidelines dummy I (1963:Ql—1965:Q4)    0.01   (0.01)

             Guidelines dummy II (l966:Ql—1968:Q4)   0.60   (0.61)

     In light of the verdict of these coefficients that the guidelines program

had no significant effect on inflation, two questions remain.        First, how does

the basic equation explain the relatively low 1.4 average annual percentage

rate of inflation during 1963—65 in light of the acceleration of nominal

demand growth and increase in the output ratio that occurred during that

interval? The degree of demand stimulation was minor as measured by our

variables.       did not exceed zero until mid—1964 and prior to that time acted

to decelerate the inflation rate. Adjusted annual nominal GNP growth

was at the relatively modest rate of 3.7 percent. The positive influence of

the excess of      over the inherited past rate of inflation 'ias almost completely
                                                                        48

offset, at least until 1965, by the negative influence on inflation of rapid

productivity growth.

     A second question about the guidelines era concerns the relation of

prices to wages. If the guidelines had a significant effect in holding down

the rate of change of wages, as the work of Perry and others implies, but had

no effect on the rate of price change, as the results in this section imply,

then an important side effect of the guidelines policy was to create a boom

in the profits share. This is exactly the outcome that labor unions fear

will occur when wage guidelines are proposed, and the guidelines era with its

accompanying stock market boom may be looked upon as a golden age of state—

supported capitalism. The interpretation that the guidelines policy tem-

porarily reduced the share of labor income in GNP may also help to explain the

anomalous rise in that share in the late l960s; the shift in shares may have

been the result of a guidelines impact followed by a post—guidelines rebound.

In the absence of the guidelines and Nixon controls, the step—like increase

in the share of employee compensation observed in the late l960s and early

l970s might otherwise have looked more like a time trend.


The Blinder Technique for the Assessment of the Nixon Controls Period


     As discussed above, the Blinder technique that develops an independent

explanatory variable for the Nixon controls period seems superior in principle

to either the post—sample simulation or the dummy variable techniques. But

Blinder's method is not available to assess the impact of the Kennedy—Johnson

guidelines, the Carter pay standards, or other programs in pre—1954 history

or in the future. Thus our main question in this section is whether the con-

clusions reached using the Blinder technique contradict or support our
                                                                      49

preferred estimates, that is those using dummy variables within the constrained

version of the bai.c equation in Table 5, column (6).

     Since a detailed presentation is available in Blinder (1979), we present

here only the minimum explanation required to provide an understanding of our

comparisons. From government data Blinder constructed a monthly time—series

variable for the interval between August 1971 and May 1974, showing the

fraction of items in the CPI subject to the price controls in each month.

This variable, 5, is equal to zero before and after the controls interval and

reaches a maximum of 0.91 in Phase I during the autumn of 1971. In addition

to including this variable in his inflation equation, Blinder also defines a

"catch—up't variable C as the change in     in those months when the controlled

fraction was decreasing:

                     —
                1t       t—l' L<O
          t =1
                     0      ,




     The details of Blinder's study differ radically from ours. His dependent

variable is the change in the CPI. He fits a price mark—up equation with the

wage rate as an explanatory variable rather than a reduced—form equation for

inflation. He adjusts for food and energy inflation by subtracting these

components from the dependent variable. His demand effect is represented by

the inventory—sales ratio, and he does not include our exchange rate, produc-

tivity, social security tax, or minimum wage variables. Since the first two

of these left—out variables explain a substantial portion of the 1974 inflation

in our basic equation, it is not surprising that Blinder's results yield an

"off" effect that substantially exceeds the controls "on" effect. This
                                                                        50

evaluation is performed by comparing two within—sample simulations, one that

sets      and C equal to their actual values, and an alternative simulation

that sets both equal to zero.

       Although Blinder's review of earlier literature criticizes studies that

restrict dummy variables to alter the constant rather than interacting with

every explanatory variable, he discovers that there are insufficient degrees

of freedom within the controls period to allow any interaction effects at

all. Thus his       variable is introduced linearly, and his C variable is

allowed to enter as a linear distributed lag to allow for delays in the catch-

up process. We have exactly duplicated his method within our specification of

the inflation process, replacing our Nixon controls "on" and "off" dummy

variables with quarterly averages of      and C, where the former enters only

as a current variable, while the latter enters both as a current variable and

as an unconstrained la on four past values. The sampl period is the same as

in our basic equations, 1954:Q2 through 1980:Q2. As in all of our equations,

the lagged dependent variable is adjusted to subtract out the estimated impact

of the controls variables. This improves the fit and boosts the estimated

impact of controls with the Blinder variables, just as in our basic equations.

       Because in the Blinder version of our equations the non—controls variables

have coefficients that are almost identical to those in Table 5, we save

space here by omitting a detailed tabular presentation. The coefficients of

the Blinder variables are significant but are hard to interpret by themselves,

so we follow Blinder below by evaluating the estimated impact of the controls

program in dynamic simulations. The following is a comparison of the

standard errors of the alternative equations.

Three pairs of equations are presented, both unconstrained and constrained.

The first pair——copied from Table 5——fits about as well as the Blinder versions,

i.e., the Blinder variables add sufficient explanatory power to balance the

extra degrees of freedom required without improving the equation's standard

error. An inspection of the Blinder simulation results indicates that the

estimated timing pattern of the controls is almost identical to that of our

dummy variables, except that the "off" effect occurs one quarter later. When

our "off" dummy is retimed to apply to 1974:Q3 through 1975:Q2, the standard

error drops well below that of the Blinder versions, as.shown by the middle

pair above.

     Several aspects of our basic constrained equation and the Blinder con-

strained version are illustrated in Figure 1. The upper frame compares the

actual rate of inflation, shown by a solid line, with a dashed line showing

the fitted value of a dynamdc simulation of our basic constrained equation

from Table 5, column (6). The dotted line shows an alternative dynamic

simulation of the same equation with the controls dummies set to zero. The

shaded areas indicate the estimated impact of the controls on the inflation

rate. It is interesting to note that the dotted line suggests that most of

the acceleration of inflation in 1973—74 is attributed to factors other than

the termination of controls.

Blinder's for the displacement of the price level caused by the controls.

The solid line shows that the cumulative downward displacement of the price

level implied by the controls "on" dummy coefficient in the constrained

version is —1.29 percentage points, i.e., from a base index value of 100 in

l971:Q2 to 98.71 in 1972:Q3. The simulation of the constrained Blinder

version with and without the controls variables indicates a maximum downward

displacement of 1.48 points, i.e., from 100 to 98.52. The Blinder"off"

effect eliminates slightly less than all of the "on" effect, raising the

price level to 99.87 percent of its no—controls value, whereas our "off"

dummy coefficient of 1.45 raises the price level to 100.16 percent of its

no—controls value.

     In short, the Blinder technique——despite the extra research required

for construction of the new variable and its lack.of applicability to other

episodes of government intervention——provides neither abetter fit nor an

evaluation of the Nixon controls that differs from our simple dummy variable

approach. It suggests only a single minor improvement in our basic equation,

a shift in timing by one quarter of the Nixon "off." dummy variable.



         VIII. A DECOMPOSITION OF THE INFLATION OF THE l970s


Decomposition   Methodology

     The plot of actual and fitted values in Figure 1 suggests that our basic

equation provides an extremely tight fit of the highly variable inflation rate

of the past decade. In fact the root—mean squared error in the dynamic

simulation is just 0.53 percentage point.s at an annual rate, less than the

standard error of our best equation estimated to the less turbulent 1954—71
                                                                                54

period. Since this dynamic simulation is based on actual values of explana-

tory variables, an interesting decomposition of inflation can be created when

the explanatory variables one—by—one are set equal to alternative hypothetical

values.

       Inflation in the first quarter of 1971 was   5.0   percent as measured by

our dependent variable, the fixed—weight GNP     deflator.     Thus we decided to

create a hypothetical path for each explanatory variable that would have

allowed the inflation rate to settle down to a 5.0 percent long—run equili-

brium path. All the z variables listed in lines 6 through 10 of Table 5,

as well as the Nixon control dummy variables, must be set equal to zero,

and the paths of y and       must be specified as well. Obviously an assumed

value of adjusted nominal GNP   growth   of five percent is required to produce

a long—run equilibrium inflation path of 5 percent. As for             the log of

the output ratio, a value of zero would appear to be required. However, the

constrained equation contains a positive and significant constant term,

indicating that inflation will accelerate when       =    0.   This constant term

could indicate either that our measure of natural real GNP is overstated, and

thus      is understated, or it could at least partly be caused by a value of

real wage aspirations (t) in excess of the trend productivity variable that


appears in the structural price equation above (t). Since t and t are not

observed, our steady—inflation simulation must set             —1.35 percent.

       The details of the decomposition are presented in Table 6. The first

 two lines show, respectively, the actual values and those computedin a

dynamic simulation of the basic constrained equation that starts in l970:Q4.

The hypothetical alternative simulation of a path of the explanatory variables

compatible with a steady inflation of 5.0 percent is shown in line A3. The

quarters shown are chosen to mark peaks and troughs of inflation during the

past decade. The remaining section of the Table corioares successive simula-

tions that make the transition between lines A.3 and 1.2 occur one variable

at a time. For instance, line B.l shows the difference in the estimated

change in the inflation rate between l971:Ql and l972:Q3 in two simulations,

the one presented on line A..3 that is compatible with 5 percent steady infla-

tion, and a second that adds the Nixon control dummy variables multiplied by

their estimated coefficients. Then line B.2 adds in the actual value of

     in place of the assumed value of —1.4, runs another dynamic simulation,

and calculates the different in the fitted values. Finally, after converting

step—by—step to the actual values of all explanatory vaiab1es, we obtain the

dynamic simulation presented on line A.2. Thus the sum of lines B.l through

B.9, displayed in line B.10, equals the change between the specified quarters

in the dynamic simulation shown on line A.2.28


Decomposition   Results
     The explanation of the inflation of the past decade laid out in section

B of Table 6 is an intriguing one. Several factors are singled out to ex—

plain the acceleration of inflation that occurred during 1972—74 and again

during 1976—80, as well as the sharp 1974—76 deceleration. The right—hand

column provides an overall explanation of the acceleration of inflation

between the beginning and end of the decade.

     The simulated values explain only about three—quarters of the slowdown
                                                                          57

in the rate of inflation between 1971:Q1 and l972:Q3. Of this, the most

important causes are the Nixon controls and the rapid growth of productivity

relative to trend. The 1972:Q3 through 1974:Q4 acceleration of inflation is

explained by the termination of controls, the 1974 decline in productivity,

the cumulated dollar depreciation between 1971 and 1974, and the lagged

effects of the 1973 increase in the social security tax and of the 1974 in-

crease in the minimum wage rate. Surprisingly, increases in food and energy

prices explain nothing, because their impact operates without a lag and ac-

cording to our variable has been completed by 1974:Q4.

      Only a small part of the slowdown of inflation between 1974:Q4 and

1976:Q2 can be explained by the recession itself, that is, the slump in

pt—F Instead, most of the slowddwn is accounted for by a reversal of the

elements that caused the temporary acceleration in 1974——especially the end of

the   controls termination effect, the shift from negative to positive pro—

ductivity growth, and the appreciation of the dollar. Finally, the accelera-

tion of inflation between l976:Q2 and l980:Q1 has a multiplicity of causes,

including rapid nominal CNP growth and the slowdown in natural real ON?

growth (the difference between which equals           the explosion of energy

prices; the slump in productivity growth, the 1978—79 depreciation of the

U. S. dollar, and the increase in the effective social security tax rate.

      Why   did   inflation accelerate so far above 5 percent during the period

between 1971 and 1980? The four most significant factors over the decade

taken as a whole were food and energy prices, the productivity slowdown,

the   depreciation of the dollar, and the social security tax increases. The

contribution of nominal GNP growth is surprisingly small, partly because the
                                                                        58

quarter chosen to begin the simulation already had a large growth rate of

nominal CNP.2 These results help to suggest why economic policyrnakers have

been forced in 1980 to foster restrictive demand growth and deliberately to

induce a recession. Because so many adverse supply elements have caused in-

flation to accelerate over the past few years, demand restriction seems the

only available anti—inflationary policy. Of the major contributors to the

acceleration of inflation in the 1970s, only the social security tax is

under the immediate control of policymakers in Washington.


Qua lificators


     The decomposition in Table 6 is obviously sensitive to the size of the

estimated coefficients in the basic equation and would change if those co-

efficients were to change. Thus it is reassuring to turn back to Table 5 and

scan the constrained versions of the equations estimated for three alternative

sample periods in columns (2), (4) and (6). With the exception of the effec-

tive exchange rate, which does not appear in the short—period equation estimated

for 1954—71, the coefficients are surprisingly stable. This indicates that a

decomposition very similar to that of Table 6 would be produced by the

1954—71 equation, if allowance were made for an exchange rate effect.

     In any multivariate analysis of economic time series, we may ask whether

a particular explanatory variable has a consistent impact throughout the sample

period or whether its coefficient is heavily influenced by a particular year

or quarter. One technique available for this assessment is the estimation of

alternative sample periods that "roll forward" several years at a time. We

have reestimated our basic unconstrained equation for twelve year "rolling"

sample periods, e.g., 1954—66, 1956—68, etc. Most of the coefficients appear
                                                                     59

appear to be quite stable and are statistically significant throughout, in-

cluding those of the output ratio, adjusted nominal GN? growth, food and

energy prices, and the productivity deviation. The coefficient on the social

security tax varies between about 0.25 and 0.5, depending on the sample period

chosen. This is not surprising, since there were long periods when the tax

rate did not chang.e appreciably. The least robust variable is the minimum

wage rate, which seems to obtain most of its significance from the year 1956,

when the minimum wage rate jumped from $0.75 to $1.00.

     Does the foreign exchange rate have an impact throughout the 1974—80

period, or is it just acting as a dummy variable for the first half of 1974?

We compared two dynamic simulations of our basic constrained equation, one with

the actual values of effective exchange rate changes and another with those

changes set equal to zero except for 1974:Ql and 1974:Q2. The first simula-

tion has a much better ability to fit the data for the late l970s, with a

decline in the root—mean—squared simulation error from 0.627 to 0.415 for the

interval 1976:Q3 through 1978:Q2, and from 0.791 to 0.562 for the interval

l978:Q3 through 1980:Q2. In addition to their contribution in 1974, changes

in the exchange rate help to explain why the inflation rate was so iow    in
early 1976 and why it accelerated in early 1979.

     The food and energy variable deserves further scrutiny. One surprising

 feature of Table 5 is that its coefficient is actually larger before 1971

 than afterwards, indicating that fluctuations in those relative prices made a

 contribution to the explanation of inflation before 1971 that has been

 neglected in previous research. Another puzzle is the small size of the

 coefficient, only 0.36 in the full—period constrained equation. We have ex-

 perimented with another food and energy variable which we call FAE, the direct
                                                                     60

contribution to the consumption deflator of changes in the relative prices of

food and energy. It performs almost as well in our basic equation as the

variable used in Tables 4 and 5, which we call BDP, and it has about the same

coefficient. We have also experimented with alternative dependent variables,

including the implicit deflator for business product and the implicit deflator

for personal consumption expenditures. When the former dependent variable is

used, the coefficients on both FAE and BDP are similar to those in our basic

equations, about 0.3. When the latter is used, the coefficient on both FAE and

BDP rises to about 0.55, and to about 0.9 when lagged values are included. We

conclude that changes in the relative prices of food and energy are fully

passed into consumer prices but not into GNP prices, due partly to the ex-

clusion of import prices from the latter and due partly to the inability of

our BDP series to capture the precise timing of the adjustment necessary to

remove the impact of imported oil prices.


                           IX. CONCLUSIONS


    An adequate explanation of both the variance and overall acceleration

of inflation in the 1970s requires a model that includes effects of aggregate

demand, government intervention, external supply shocks, and inertia in the

adjustment of prices. Our basic reduced—form inflation equation relies on the

contribution of two variables for its aggregate demand effect, the lagged

level of the output ratio and the change in nominal GNP adjusted for changes in

natural real CNP. Three forms of government intervention influence inflation,

the Nixon—era controls, changes in the effective social security tax rate and

effective minimum wage. External supply shocks include changes in the relative

prices of food and energy, the influence of changes in the effective exchange
                                                                     61

rate of the dollar, and deviations of productivity from trend. Finally,

inertia is represented by the influence of lagged inflation on the current

inflation rate. This classification of variables is partly arbitrary, since

the relative price of food and energy depends partly on government policies;

the foreign exchange rate responds both to domestic demand management as well

as to external events; and productivity deviations also respond both to demand

management and external events.

      Because changes in demand policy influence not only the growth rate

 of nominal GNP and the lagged output ratio but also the effective foreign

 exchange rate and the productivity deviation, the inflation equation developed

 in this paper cannot yet be used to compute policy simulations that show

 the impact on inflation of alternative demand management policies. Further

 research will be necessary to produce auxiliary equations relating the

 exchange rate and productivity deviation to output and prices before such

 research on alternative demand strategies can be undertaken.

      Instead, the central focus of this paper has been on the interaction

 of the estimated impact of the Nixon—era controls with the inclusion or

 exclusion of important demand and supply factors. Previous studies have

 estimated substantial effects of the controls in holding down inflation in

 1972 and causing inflation to accelerate in 1974, and in many cases have

 found that the implied impact of the removal of controls in raising inflation

 in 1974 was greater than the initial impact of the controls in holding down

 inflation in 1972. Several of the variables that play an important role in

 our basic equation, especially the productivity deviation and exchange rate,

help to explain the actual inflation performance of 1972 and 1974 and thus

 assign a smaller role to the Nixon controls. In this sense part of the impact
                                                                         62

 of the Nixon controls in some previous studies confound the actual influence

 of the controls and the influence of left—out variables.

      We have presented detailed results of alternative models and methods for

estimating the impact of episodes of government intervention, including the

Nixon controls, Kennedy—Johnson guidelines, and Carter pay standards. We

conclude that ARIMA and money—only models are inadequate for this kind of

research because they omit many variables that play an important role in the

inflation process, and therefore they yield biased estimates of intervention

effects. Three different methods are used to assess the impact of the Nixon—era

controls within the context of our basic reduced—form inflation equation.

Post—sample dynamic simulations of equations estimated to the pre—controls

period are misleading unless the equations are constrained to be dynamically

stable. Simulations of such constrained equations tend to underpredict

inflation in 1974 more than they overpredict inflation in 1972, partly be-

cause there was no role of the effective exchange rate before 1971. The

second technique, the inclusion of dummy variables for the imposition and

removal of the controls, has the advantage of using all of the information

available in the full sample period, including that on the impact of the

effective exchange rate. Dummy variables indicate that the Nixon controls

held down the price level by about 1.3 percent between mid—1971 and late 1972,

and then allowed a rebound of about 1.4 percent to occur in 1974 and early

1975. A third technique, introduced by Alan Blinder, replaces the dummy

variables with a variable that measures the fraction of prices that were

actually controlled each quarter. Although this variable seems conceptually

superior, it does not alter the conclusions of the dummy variable technique,

yielding almost exactly the same standard error of estimate and the same

estimated magnitude and timing of the impact of controls on the price level.
                                                                           63

     The model developed here can be used to answer the basic questions posed

at the beginning of the paper. Why was inflation so variable between 1971

and 1980? And why did inflation accelerate from 5 percent in early 1971 to

10 percent in early 1980? Our basic equation explains the high variance of

inflation mainly as a result of swings in the effect of Nixon controls, the

deviation of productivity from trend, the relative prices of food and energy,

and the effective exchange rate, with an additional minor contribution made by

the aggregate demand variables and by social security tax changes. The overall

acceleration of inflation during the past decade is explained by the adverse

contribution of most of the variables. Only the output ratio, Nixon controls,

and minimum wage made no contribution to the excess of 1980 over 1971 infla—

tion. The paper also concludes that the 1978—79 Carter pay standards had no

effect at all on the inflation rate, just as the Kennedy—Johnson guidelines

made no impact during the 1963—65 period (although in both cases wage growth

and the distribution of income may have been altered.

     The conclusions of the paper send a mixed message to policymakers in

Washington. On the one hand, much of the acceleration of inflation in recent

years has been caused by factors, especially food and energy prices and the

productivity slowdown, over which domestic policymakers have little control in

the short run. On the other hand, there seems to be substantial potential for

achieving a deceleration of inflation. Restrictive demand policies have a

strong impact on inflation, working not only through the output ratio and

nominal GNP growth variables, but also through the indirect impact of demand

man,agement policy on inflation through the effective exchange rate. And   the
relatively large coefficients on the social security tax suggest some anti—

inflationary potential for a tax substitution. But direct intervention in
                                                                        64

the inflation process is strongly condemned by the results; the guidelines and

Carter pay standards had no effect at all on inflation, while the Nixon—era

controls had only a temporary impact that destabilized both the inflation rate

and the level of real output.

                                                        conclusions regarding
       the efficacy of past incomes policies when he first constrains four

      programs to have the same effect and then allows each to have a

      different effect.

11. This ambiguity is evident in the work of Perry, who in a recent paper

       (1980) chose l964:Ql—1965:Q4 as the dates for his guideline dummy,

      but in early papers had extended the dummy between 1963 and mid—1966.

12.   If x = (l_B)dx      then X    is said to be an integrated process of

      order d whose uuivariate representation is an ARIMA (autoregressive

      integrated moving average) model.

13. In the notation (p,d,q) the p term is the number of autoregressive

      parameters, the d term is the degree of differencing, and the q term

      is the number of moving average parameters.

14. The inflation rate is scaled throughout this paper as an annual rate.

15. The Q statistic, analogous to the Durbin—Watson statistic, is a measure

      of the degree to which the residual sequence is observed to depart

      from serial independence.

16. In principle, more precise estimates of all parameters could be ob-

      tained by simultaneous estimation of 6 and the two regression coefficients.

      In practice, little refinement is apt to arise from adding 15 observa-

      tions to the 90 used to estimate 0, so the computational simplicity of

      the two step procedure is favored.

17. The closest to a pure money—causes—price model is presented by Barro

      and Rush (1980, Table 2.2, columns 4 and 5).   Here the price level is ex-

      plained by the current level of money (in logs), a distributed lag of past
                                                                    69

    money 'surprises," the current share of government spending in real GNP,

    and a time trend (an interest rate term is insignificant). The money

    surprises, in turn, are residuals from an equation that explains quarterly

    changes in money as a function of six lagged dependent variables, a

    federal spending variable, and lagged unemployment. The implied reduced

    form thus basically explaIns price changes by money changes, the two

    government spending variables, lagged unemployment, and the time trend.

    There is no consideration of any of the supply factors discussed below

    in Section VI.

18. This does not deny a role for the prices of other inputs, e.g., capital

     or raw materials, since these variables can be entered as relative

    prices. See the more complete specification of the price mark—up

     equation in Gordon (1975, p. 620).

19. In column (2) and all of the other equations presented in this paper

     the lagged dependent variable is adjusted to remove the estimated

     impact of the controls. Thus we assume that the impact of the termina-

     tion of controls in raising 1974 inflation does not carry over in making

     inflation higher in 1975. This adjustment marginally improves the
    standard error of estimate of the basic equation in column (8), and has the

    advantage that the effects of controls may be seen in the coefficient estimates,

    rather than in the alternative dynamic simulations necessary if the controls

    have persistent effects.

20. The exact method of performing the "stripping" process is described

     in Gordon (1975, pp. 656—660). This variable was updated using the

    methods described in that source to the end of 1976, and has been extra—

     polated using a regression of the 1954—76 variable on current and lagged

    values of the deflators of consumer direct expenditures on food and

     energy.
                                                                       70

21. For previous uses of this specification, see Gordon (1971, pp. 128—9)

    and (1975, pp. 619—20).

22. The interaction with y comes in years like 1975—76, when the equation

    in column (5) "cannot understand" why inflation declined despite an

    acceleration in y, but in column (6) has the rapid growth of actual

    productivity available as an included variable to help explain the

     inflation slowdown. The interaction with the lagged dependent variable

    comes in 1969—70, when column (5) "needs" a high sum of coefficients on

    lagged inflation to explain high inflation but in column (6) has the

    help of the 1969—70 productivity slowdown.

23. The variable is calculated as the percentage change in (1/(l—-r)), where

    T   is   the ratio of total Federal and state social security contributions

     to total wage and salary income in the national income accounts.

24. Cordon (1977) in Tables 2 and 3 shows that unity constraints substantially

     improve the ability of equations estimated to the 1954—71 period to track

     the 1971—76 period in post—sample simulations.

25. Constraining the sum of the coefficients on the lagged dependent variable

     (LDV) and on y to sum to unity is not straightforward if the shape of the

     polynomial lag distribution is to be freely estimated in the constrained

     equation. We have used an iterative procedure in which the freely

     estimated coefficients on the LDV and y are divided by their joint sum, and

     that part of inflation not explained by unity constrained LDV and      y is
    regressed on the other right—hand variables. The fitted value of this

    first regression equation represents the contribution of the other variables

    to the explanation of inflation. The next step is to run a second regression

    explaining the difference between the actual dependent variable and the
                                                                71

     fitted value from the first step (i.C., the portion of inflation that

    cannot be explained by the other variables) in which the right hand

    variables are     and a polynomial distributed lag on the LDV. The

    process is repeated until the sum of squared residuals in the two

     equations converge.

26. Since the cumulative error over 2.5 years is L4 percentage points, the

     simulation after adjustment for the exchange rate effect underpredicts

     the annual inflation rate during 1978—80 by about 0.6 percentage points

     on average.

27. Perry's most recent research (1980) limits the guidelines dummy to

     1964 and 1965, in contrast to his earlier work that included 1963.

28. Line B.9, "Dynamic Adjustment,'t shows the change in the equilibrium

     simulation of line A.3.

29. Nominal GNP growth was rapid in l97l:Q1 due to th& rebound effect from

     the 1970 General Motors strike.
