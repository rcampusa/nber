                                         ABSTRACT

The prospect of capital obsolescence inhibits investment. Investors thus become more optimistic
when the obsolescence of their capital slows down. We propose a model with no fixed costs of
investment, and random technological progress that induces obsolescence of capital in place.
Spikes occur precisely when technological progress slows down. Moreover, the more variable the
progress, the larger are the spikes. Cross-industry data show that where price of capital declines
are more variable, investment spikes are larger.

1    Introduction
The cost of capital has been declining in most industries as documented by Cummins
and Violante (2002). The rate of decline and, in particular, the variability over time of
that decline varies across industries. This paper shows that this behavior of capital goods
prices can lead to investment spikes as measured e.g., by Doms and Dunne (1993), Ilyina
and Samaniego (2011) and Kehrig and Vincent (2018).
     We model an industry that may be competitive or a monopoly in which, as a result of
technological progress the cost of capital declines exogenously and irregularly over time.
Innovations in the capital-goods producing industries reduce the cost of investment for a
while, but then the phase of decline ends and costs of investment remain constant until the
next innovation phase starts. The model'   s three main implications are investment spikes,
a rising inter-spike hazard, and a coexistence of falling costs of capital with investment
inactivity; let us outline them in turn.
     Investment spikes occur when the rate of progress slows down. The intuition is that
declining investment costs imply declining product prices and represent bad news for
owners of capital and makes investment relatively unattractive. First, as costs are declin-
ing, prices of output are expected to decline as well, which reduces the present value of
investment. Second, as costs will be lower tomorrow, it is better to postpone investment
till then. Once the rate of progress slows down, investment becomes more attractive,
hence the spike.
     The inter-spike hazard rises because after the spike, once costs begin to decline again,
as time passes, the cost is more and more likely to reach the point where it will again be
pro...table to invest.
     When investment is irreversible, periods of zero investment coexisting with falling
costs of capital arise in our model because, following a spike, the value of capital declines
below its cost. Thus investment only becomes pro...table again once the cost of capital
drops su¢ ciently to catch up.
     These phenomena have been shown to also arise for other reasons. The leading ex-
planation is that there are ...xed costs of investment. Cooper and Haltiwanger (2006),
Caballero and Engel (2000), Khan and Thomas (2008) and Jovanovic and Stolyarov
(2000) all associate spikes with ...xed investment costs. A rising inter-spike hazard ob-
tains because the passage of time generally raises the distance between the actual and
desired capital stocks, and in the simplest version of the models, between spikes there is
no investment.
     Second, vintage-capital models can generate spikes in the form of capital replacement
echoes, as Boucekkine, Germain and Licandro (1997) and Jovanovic and Tse (2011) show.
In those models, the inter-spike hazard falls as less productive or more labor intensive
older vintages become increasingly unpro...table.


                                             2
     Third, demand shocks and productivity shocks can cause spikes. Guo, Miao, and
Morellec (2005) generate spikes from positive surprises in demand growth, and Abel
and Eberly (2012) generate them when the productivity of capital jumps up discretely.
By contrast, in our model it is a drop in the rate of technological progress that causes
the spike. Moreover, we show that this occurs even when the drop in technological
progress is fully foreseen. Related, Jorgenson (1963) shows that when capital investment
is reversible, changes in the rate of capital obsolescence can lead to sudden changes in
the capital stock, but not to a coexistence between declining capital goods prices and an
inactivity of investment.
     Fourth, cyclical variation in product demand has been shown to a¤ect the occurrence
of spikes. In a ...xed-cost model Caballero and Hammour (1996) ...nd that reallocation
should occur during recessions, when the opportunity cost of doing so is lowest. And in
a vintage capital models in which the productivity of a new vintage depends on learning
by doing, Klenow (1998) ...nds that technology updates are more likely in a boom than in
a recession since a high rate of production enables faster learning. Cooper, Haltiwanger
and Power (1999) incorporate both vintage e¤ects and ...xed costs and ...nd that spikes
are procyclical.
     In our model, the presence of spikes requires that there be variability and persistence in
the rate of decline of capital-goods prices. In particular, without ...xed costs, no investment
spikes occur when capital prices decline steadily. By contrast, in the ...xed-cost model,
a faster decline in the cost of capital relative to revenues raises the desired capital stock
faster and produces more frequent spikes. And in vintage capital models a steady rise in
the quality of capital causes more frequent replacement echoes. Our evidence shows that
at the industry level, higher variability positively a¤ects the frequency of spikes and thier
size.
     The plan of the paper is as follows: Section 2 describes the model and derives some
of its properties. Section 3 shows that the implications are robust with respect to having
reversible investment and physical depreciation, to adding monopoly power, and that if
modi...ed to include idiosyncratic productivity shocks it can generate di¤erences between
...rm-level and industry-level spikes. Section 4 reports tests of some of the implications,
and a more detailed comparison to what other models imply, and Section 5 concludes the
paper. The Appendix contains most of the proofs.


2     A competitive industry
We formulate the model in continuous time so that spikes are jumps in the capital stock
which otherwise changes continuously over time.
   There is a competitive industry with free entry in which each unit of capital invested
produces one unit of a homogenous product in perpetuity at marginal cost zero. In-

                                              3
vestment is irreversible; we discuss the implications of reversible investment in Section
3.1.
    To highlight the e¤ect of value obsolescence, we assume that capital does not depre-
ciate. The accumulated capital stock at date t is kt ; and investment at date t is denoted
xt = dkt =dt: The market price of output at any date is determined as

                                        pt = D(kt ):                                    (1)

where D is a decreasing demand function. By k we mean capital held collectively by all
                                                    R
the measure-zero ...rms in the industry, i.e., k = k (i) di.
   Value of capital in place.-- Conditional on the output-price sequence, at date t this
value is                                 Z 1
                                 vt = Et       e r(s t) ps ds:                       (2)
                                           t

where Et is the expectation operator as of date t; and r is the rate of interest.
   Exogenous technological progress.-- The cost of capital declines at the rate gt so that
                                                   Z   t
                                ct = c0 exp                gs ds :                      (3)
                                                   0


We assume that there are two levels for g and we normalize the lower one to be zero:
gt 2 f0; g g. When gt = 0; the cost of capital is "stagnant,"whereas when gt = g > 0; the
cost is declining and we have "progress."
    Since there are no adjustment costs and the industry is competitive,

                                     x t > 0 ) v t = ct ;                               (4)

and
                                     vt < ct ) xt = 0:

   De...nition of a spike.-- An investment spike is a discontinuity in kt and pt ; an upward
jump in kt and a downward jump in pt .

   Let T1 ; T2 ; ::: be exogenous transition dates at which costs stop declining and become
stagnant, i.e., gt falls from g to 0 at T n . Let un be the duration of the n'   th epoch of
stagnation, i.e., gt = 0 from Tn until Tn + un : Let wn > 0 be the duration of the nth
epoch of cost decline, i.e., gt = g from Tn + un until Tn + un + wn = Tn+1 .
   Let the transition dates be unknown and assume that wn and un are random so that
Tn are random as well. Speci...cally, we assume that wn are i.i.d. with CDF 1 e L t ; and
un are i.i.d. with CDF 1 e H t . In other words the hazard of escaping from stagnation
is L and the hazard of termination of progress is H . We sometimes refer to epochs of
declining costs as state H and epochs of stagnant costs as state L.

Lemma 1 For t 2 (Tn ; Tn + un ]
                                                         xt = 0.                                           (7)

Proof. The escape hazard L is constant. Since for t 2 (Tn ; Tn + un ] ct = cT n , there
can be no investment at t 2 (Tn ; Tn + un ] that was not pro...table at date Tn , and which
therefore would have happened at Tn .

   We now establish that except at transition dates there are no spikes. Appendix A
proves

Lemma 2 A spike cannot occur at t 6= Tn .


   The following proposition states that if by a certain time during a period of progress
investment has taken place, the very next transition into stagnation will generate an
investment spike. Appendix B proves the following:

Proposition 1 If xt > 0 for some t 2 (Tn                      1    + un 1 ; Tn ), an investment spike will then
occur at t = Tn :

   Proposition 1 establishes that there are spikes. Spike size is de...ned as

                                  kT           kT         D 1 (pT )
                                                    =                       1 > 0;                         (8)
                                          kT              D 1 (pT )

where kT = limt%T kt and pT = limt%T pt . Before proceeding with the analysis of the
main model, we can obtain some insight by considering a simpler example in which the
transition dates are deterministic.


2.1    The case where un = u and wn = w are known constants
Suppose that the durations un = u > 0; and wn = w > 0 are repeating constant durations
that are known with certainty in advance as then are the transition dates Tn : We will
show that investment spikes occur when costs actually stop declining, each time that this
event occurs, even though it is fully anticipated beforehand.

                        Figure 1: ct > vt on the interval (0; )

    The behavior of c and v is depicted in Fig. 1. First, vt < ct after the spike because the
spike causes the price to drop while the cost initially remains high. Then vt is decreasing
even before progress resumes because as we draw nearer to the resumption of progress -
and declining costs - investment becomes even less valuable. Therefore, as established by
lemma 1, there is no investment for t 2 (Tn ; Tn + un ] and moreover, as v < c even after
progress resumes at Tn + un ; investment only begins again at > Tn + un : This is stated
more formally in proposition 2 and proved in Appendix C.

Proposition 2 If w is su¢ ciently large, (i) there is an investment spike at each tran-
sition date Tn , and (ii) continuous investment resumes periods later, where > u
uniquely solves:
                                    r      1 e r
                                      = g( u)      :                                (9)
                                    g    e       1
(iii) is decreasing in g and in r, (iv ) @ =@u > 1; and (v ) the spike size in (8) is
increasing in u.

    The condition in Proposition 2 that w be "su¢ ciently large"is parallel to the condition
in Proposition 1 that " xt > 0 for some t 2 (Tn 1 + un 1 ; Tn )"   : In both cases, a spike
will occur at the end of a period of progress only if progress has gone on long enough for
investment to become pro...table again. In the deterministic case, this is guaranteed if w
is su¢ ciently long. Otherwise, several epochs of progress may be needed before a spike
will occur, which means that there will be investment spikes at some but not all Tn : Such
will also be the case in the stochastic version, where w is random.
    The intuition for (iv ) in the proposition is that the longer is the stagnation delay,
u, the more costs have to decline before investment begins again. Therefore we have to

                                             6
wait longer until c is low enough for investment to be pro...table again. And the longer
the duration during which there will be no post-spike investment, the more attractive
investment is at the spike date, and therefore the greater the spike. The comparative
statics in the Proposition 2 is consistent with our simulation results for the stochastic
case (where we cannot derive the comparative statics analytically).
    Having explained why there is no investment following a spike, we now explain why
there are spikes in the ...rst place; when progress stops the value of investment jumps
up, therefore investment also increases discontinuously, thus the capital stock spikes. We
have vt = ct whenever investment occurs. Di¤erentiating (2) at the resumption date leads
to the Jorgenson user cost formula

                                           pt = (r + gt ) ct :                                         (10)

If there was no investment spike a drop in g would cause a downward jump in p, but that
would be impossible unless k were to jump up, i.e., unless there was an investment spike.


2.2       Waiting time distributions
In this section we seek to characterize the distribution of the no-investment epoch and
the inter-spike distribution. We begin, however, with the random variable w + u; the
"inter-kink"waiting time which has a known closed form solution.

2.2.1      The inter kink distribution

Let H denote the inter-spike CDF. We do not have a closed form expression for H but
we do have it for the inter-kink CDF that we shall denote by G. This is the distribution
of w + u, i.e., the time between the successive dates T .1

Proposition 3 The inter-kink distribution is that of a sum of two exponentially distrib-
uted random variables. It has CDF G;density g; and hazard given by

   We shall plot         in Fig. 2 along with the inter-spike hazard to which we turn next.

2.2.2     The inter-spike distribution

To simplify the notation, we shall normalize the spike date Tn = 0, in which case
becomes the duration of the no-investment epoch, the CDF of which will be denoted
by F ( ). Let s be the cumulative time in state H from the spike date until when
investment resumes and let
                                              c
                                     = e gs = ;                                (14)
                                              c0
and let F ( j ) be the CDF of conditional on , i.e., the probability that ct reaches c0
before date . Appendix D proves the result in Proposition 4 and shows that satis...es
                                                   Z    1
                                     1       g                           r
                                         =1+                 1       e            dF ( j ) :                                (15)
                                             r      0


Proposition 4 Investment does not resume immediately when ct starts to decline again,
i.e.
                                       > u:                                      (16)

   This result implies that we cannot guarantee that xt will be positive in each period of
progress, because the latter could be quite short and could end before investment becomes
pro...table again.
   Deriving F ( ).-- There are two building blocks to deriving F . Because can span
more than one epoch H and because there is an L epoch between any two H epochs we
shall use a renewal equation approach. Let ! I, t be the cumulative time spent in state H
up to date t starting in state I 2 fL,Hg. Let

                                         (! j t) = Pr (! L;t                 !)          and
                                    A (! j t) = Pr (! H;t                     !) :

The relation between the two probabilities is in the renewal equation

because, if we start in state L, we spend less than ! periods in H if we have spent at least
t ! periods in L in our current visit to L (the probability of which is e L (t !) ) or we
spent less than ! periods in H after our ...rst visit to H.
                                       1
   Starting in L, we spent at least g    ln periods in state H before date was reached.

We shall use F to derive the inter-spike distribution that underlies the plots in Figs. 2, 3,
4 and 5. We note that neither nor s are random variables but is : Appendix F solves
for the value that satis...es Eq. (15) and Eq. (18), and then we write F ( j ) F ( ).
    The inter-spike CDF H .-- No investment takes place for t < . The probability that
the next spike will occur before date t is

                             H (t) =                              He         dwdF ( ):                            (19)

After date , the very next transition to state L will generate a new spike, which explains
the inner integral. Note that F ( ) = 0 for < s and therefore H (t) = 0 for t < s.
Remarkably, the preceding solution for the vector ( ; s; F; H ) does not depend on the
form of the demand function D () :We plot (t) in (13) as the solid curve in Fig. 2; the
dashed curve is the inter-spike hazard, H 0 (t) = (1 H (t)) with H de...ned in Eq. (19).
    The inter-spike hazard rises because as time passes following a spike, ct likely gets
closer to c and to the resumption of investment. By contrast, in the lumpy cost models,
the hazard rises because as time passes the distance between the actual and desired capital

stock rises, justifying new investment. At the parameter values in Fig. 2, long-run average
progress is E (g ) = g L = ( L + H ) = 0:06:


2.3     Comparative statics results
This subsection describes how equilibrium responds to changes in g , in                               L   and in r.

2.3.1   Varying g

Fig. 3 illustrates the e¤ect of changes in g on distribution of , the inter spike distribution
and the inter spike hazard. As g increases, the distribution of shifts to the left, implying
a shorter waiting time until investment resumes. This is the analog of part (iii) of
Proposition 2 in the deterministic section. There will be a spike after investment resumes,
therefore, when the distribution of shifts to the left, the inter spike distribution and
inter spike hazard will both shift to the left, as shown in Fig. 3.
     Spike size and g .-- At the post-spike capital stock k 0 , the equilibrium price (at T and
at ; both) is D(k 0 ) = p0 = (r + g ) c0 . On the other hand, at the pre-spike capital stock
k , the equilibrium price is D(k ) = (r + g )c0 . If demand is isoelastic, i.e. D(k ) = k ,
with < 1, then we have

                                   k0          (r + g ) c0   k0                  1=
                                           =               )    =                     .                               (20)
                                   k            (r + g )c0   k

Thus, the size of the spike is decreasing in . Table 1 shows that spike size rises with g ,
and that s;the cumulative time in state H from the spike date until investment resumes,
decreases with g :

   This is the analog of Proposition 2 in the deterministic section. That declines means
that the decline in c must be larger, but this is more than o¤set by the faster decline in
costs due to the larger g .

2.3.2   Varying           L

Fig. 4 shows how changes in L a¤ect the distribution of , the inter spike distribution
and the inter spike hazard. As L increases, the distribution of shifts to the left,
implying a shorter waiting time until investment resumes. Analogously to part (v ) of
Proposition 2 which showed that is increasing in u, here a larger L means the time
spent in state L is shorter, i.e., u is smaller.
   Spike size and L .-- Table 2 shows that spike size decreases with L :

As L rises, rises and s falls. This is because a larger L makes investment less attractive
because obsolescence will set in earlier. The spike size will, as a result, be smaller: At the

2.3.3   Varying r

Fig. 5 shows the e¤ect of changes in r on the distribution of , the inter spike distribution
and the inter spike hazard. As r increases, the distribution of shifts to the left, implying
a shorter waiting time until investment resumes. This is the analog of part (iii) of
Proposition 2.
   Spike size declines with r.-- This is seen in Table 3:

                                           Table 3: The e¤ect of r

                                                 L=   1;        H=   0:4; g = 0:1
                                           r = 0:01 r = 0:05 r = 0:1

Raising r reduces investors'patience. The table shows that @   @r
                                                                  > 0. The less patient one
is, the less valuable investment is, thus the less one wants to invest at the spike date and

                                                                12
therefore the target c at which investment resumes rises, waiting time falls. If demand is
                                          0
D(k ) = k with < 1, then once again k    k
                                            = 1= , and the size of the spike is decreasing
in and, since @ @r
                   > 0, decreasing in r.


3     Robustness
We show robustness to four possible changes to the model: adding reversibility of invest-
ment, having a monopoly instead of competition, adding physical depreciation of capital,
and to adding ...rm speci...c TFP shocks and resulting investment rates and spikes.


3.1    Reversible investment
We now show that the reversible-k case will also be characterized by investment spikes
(positive and negative ones), but not by periods of falling costs accompanied by zero
investment as Proposition 4 showed. Reversibility implies that the value of capital must
be the same inside the industry and outside it. I.e., regardless of whether xt > 0, we
must have
                               i
                              vt = ct ;  for i 2 fL,Hg

 for all t which together with Eq. (6) means that

                                             dct
                                rct = pt +       = pt         gt ct :
                                             dt
         j    i                                               1
because vt   vt = 0. And, since p = D (k ) ) k = D                 (p),

                                             1
                                   kt = D        ([r + gt ] ct )

E.g., let D (Q) = Q . Then kt = ([r + gt ] ct ) 1= .
   Since ct is continuous (and di¤erentiable) in t whereas gt jumps between zero and g ,
whenever gt jumps (either up or down), kt jumps in the opposite direction. Therefore,
when we enter stagnation and gt drops from g to zero, kt jumps up (i.e., there is a spike)
and when gt rises from zero to g , kt drops, as ...rms take their capital and put it to other
use (because it is fully reversible). This is the dashed red line in Fig. 6.


3.2    Monopoly
The preceding has analyzed a competitive industry with free entry, in which individual
...rms and the industry are the same in the sense that they produce the same product and
that they face the same cost of capital. To address ...rm level heterogeneity more in line
with the data, we would need a model of an imperfectly competitive industry. This brief

  Figure 6: reversible k (dashed red line) and irreversible k (black line)


section shows that the model could be applied to such a setup by showing that the basic
results in Sec. 2 apply to monopoly ...rms as well.
    We now extend the model to the monopoly case. Let k denote a monopolist'   s capital
stock in a market with demand function D (k ). We now de...ne the monopolist'
                                                                            s marginal
revenue as
                                    d
                          m (k ) =    kD (k ) = D (k ) + kD0 (k ) :                (21)
                                   dk
and the marginal present value of capital as
                                                       Z    1
                                                                    r(s t)
                                         Mt = Et                e            ms ds:                          (22)
                                                        t


Then the same equations hold for the monopoly:

Proposition 5 A monopolist has the same Bellman equations (6) in state H and the
same spike conditions as a competitive industry, but with p = D (k ) replaced by m (k )
de...ned in (21) and vt replaced by Mt de...ned in (22).

Proof. We start by taking the random sequence (kt ) as given. Then we will derive the
conditions that kt must satisfy in the case of monopoly. Let

                                                  mt = m (kt )

Conditional on the marginal revenue sequence, at date t, Then let MtL and MtH denote
the monopoly'   s discounted marginal revenue products of capital in the two states. Then

            0 : And therefore the same spike dates apply. The   analysis of Eqs. (52)-(54)
applies with p0 replaced by m (k0 )
    The next result refers to two di¤erent market structures (i.e., monopoly and compe-
tition) facing the same demand function.

Corollary 1 If DM (k ) = DC (k ) = k , and if the capital cost (ct )1
                                                                    0 sequence is the
same, then
                                 M
                                kt = (1   )1= kt
                                               C
                                                 :                               (25)

                                      C    M
Proof. By Proposition 5 we know that kt ; kt must be such that

                                    M         C
                                 m kt = pt = kt                 :

We also have

                     M
                  m kt = D M kt
                              M    M M0
                                + kt D   M
                                        kt = (1                             M
                                                                         ) kt   :

Combining the two equations gives:

                                            M             C
                                (1       ) kt          = kt         ;

i.e., (25).
     Thus, given the same demand function, the monopolist will at each date have a smaller
kt , which implies that the spikes (measured as proportion of the stock) will be the same
for a monopoly as for a competitive market. Given a particular (ct ) series, spikes dates
are the same for monopoly and competition.
     Corresponding to a D ( ) for the competitive case, one can ...nd an alternative demand
function that would generate identical Bellman equations for the monopoly case and
identical solutions for (kt )1
                             0 :
     Example.-- Suppose the demand of the competitive industry is D (k ) = k            with
                                                              M
   < 1 so that demand is elastic. Then pt = D (kt ). Let D (k ) be the demand for the
monopolist'  s product. Then if DM (k ) = 1 1 D (k ), then

                                     m (kt ) = D (kt ) = pt :                          (26)

3.3      Physical depreciation
We now show that the main implications survive adding physical depreciation of capital
 > 0 so that instead of Eq. (2), the value of capital is
                                                Z    1
                                                             (r+ )(s t)
                                    vt = Et              e                ps ds:                                 (27)
                                                 t


We then consider the following three implications
    1. Spikes happen only at the end of an episode of progress.-- This is still true; p is
constant and if a spike did not occur at Tn ; p would remain constant for t 2 (Tn ; Tn + un ]
(see point 2 below) and vTn would rise discretely and exceed cTn
    2. No ow investment occurs while c is constant.-- This changes to "only replacement
investment while c is constant." Since now xt = kt > 0 for t 2 (Tn ; Tn + un ], di¤erenti-
ating (27) and setting vt = ct leads to (r + ) ct = pt + dc  dt
                                                               t
                                                                 : And since for t 2 (Tn ; Tn + un ]
dct =dt = 0; price is also constant at pt = (r + ) ct which implies that kt is also constant
so that only replacement investment occurs.
    3. No investment for a while even after c starts to fall again.-- Still true in the general
                                        H          L
version because v falls discretely to vT n +un
                                               < vT n +un
                                                          ; a period of zero investment exists.
It will be shorter the larger is , but it is positive no matter how large is.


3.4      Firm vs. industry spikes
The main model of section 2 is a representative ...rm model with no well-de...ned ...rm
size and, whether under perfect competition or monopoly, any time a ...rm experiences a
spike or zero investment, so does the industry. With heterogeneity among ...rms (or even
among plants of a single ...rm as Kehrig and Vincent 2018 document) we would expect a
fraction of the spikes to wash out with aggregation up to the industry level.
    Suppose the production function shows diminishing returns in k and a serially uncor-
related ...rm-speci...c shock z; and that

                                          output = y = zk ;                                                      (28)

where < 1 and so that pro...ts are y cx: Let be the Poisson event at which a new
z 0 is drawn independently from the CDF 0 and so for I, J 2 fL, Hg,
                                                                                   Z
  I                                       J                   I                         I                 I             @v I @v I
rvt   (z; k ) = max zk     ct x +    I   vt   (z; k )        vt   (z; k ) +            vt (z 0 ; k ) d   vt (z; k ) +       +     x
              x 0                                                                                                       @t    @k

Firms all face the same c, but now irreversibility of k implies that some low-z ...rms will
                         I
be at a corner where @v@k
                           < c; i.e., where the value of an additional unit of k is less than
the cost. By contrast, in the model of Sec. 2, all ...rms have the same incentives to invest.


                                                         16
    For the same (z; k ), investment is more valuable at a spike than otherwise, for the
same reason as before. Therefore, although an individual ...rms might invest more during
stagnation than at a kink if it is then hit with a high z , on average aggregate investment
should be greater when progress stops. Thus it will still be true that investment spikes
at the kinks at the industry level, but some low-z ...rms will not take part in that spike.
Another di¤erence will be that during epoch L some ...rms will draw high z s and their
capital will rise, thereby raising industry output. Thus, instead of being a constant during
epoch L as was the case in the homogeneous ...rm model of Sec. 2, pt would now decline
although more slowly than it did in state H. Nevertheless, such a slower decline in p
invites the spike.
    Thus in spite of the idiosyncrasies of the productivity shocks, common shocks to the
price of capital still create spikes at the industry level. A completely stated discrete time
version of this extended model is in Appendix H


4       Tests
The results in Proposition 2 for the deterministic case and in Table 1 for the stochastic
case state that spike size increases in g , the rate of cost decline in state H. To test this,
we need a measure of spikes, and a measure of the process g for an industry (as in Sec.
2) or a ...rm (as in Sec. 3).


4.1     Three measures of spikes
We use three industry-speci...c de...nitions of spikes: One is from Ilyina and Samaniego
(2011, henceforth IS) and two are from Kehrig and Vincent (2018, henceforth KV-A and
KV-B)

    1. IS measure the lumpiness of investment as the fraction of years that an industry
       experiences investment in excess of 30% of the capital stock. The Ilyina-Samaniego
       data cover 1970-1999.

    2. KV-A: E[xt /kt j xt /kt > 0.2]; i.e., a spike means simply that investment rates are
       large.

    3. KV-B: E[xt /kt j xt /kt > 0.2, xt /kt > 2xt 1 /kt 1 , xt+1 /kt+1 < 0.5xt /kt ]; i.e. the
       investment in a spike year must be at least twice as large as the investment rate
       in the adjacent years, i.e., and jump up and down over time (which may be more
       consistent with a ...xed investment adjustment cost).2
    2
    Since the Census moments have not been o¢ cially disclosed, these were computed using Compustat
data. The investment spikes according to de...nition B are quite similar in the Compustat and Census
data; investment spikes according to De...nition A are positively correlated but not as close.


                                                17
     Note that the data are not direct measures of industry-level spikes but aggregates of
spikes in more micro data. Kehrig & Vincent'     s data are annual Census data on manufac-
turing establishments, and they de...ne spikes as establishment investment rates exceeding
15 percent. Ilyina & Samaniego'    s spikes are large investments undertaken by Compustat
...rms, in particular, annual capital expenditures exceeding 30 percent of a ...rm'
                                                                                  s stock of
...xed assets; they arrive at industry measures by reporting the average or median ...rm
statistics for each industry.
     Table 4 reports the cross-industry correlations between the variables. De...nition A is
not highly correlated with the other two de...nitions.

                  Table 4: Correlations of the three Spike Measures
                                         IS   KV-A .KV-B
                                   IS     1
                                   KV-A 0.217   1
                                   KV-B 0.776 0.221  1


   The high correlation between IS and KV-B suggests that years in which the investment
rate exceeds 0.3 also are years when it is at least twice as large as investment in the
adjacent years.


4.2       Two measures of g
To correspond to the model we shall classify each industry'       s observations into state H ,
and state L, and to estimate the parameter g for each industry. Our tests will assume that
  L and H are identical across industries, and that only g di¤ers among them. Quality-

adjusted capital-goods prices at the industry level are provided by Cummins and Violante
(2002 ­henceforth CV). We now reports test results based on these industry-level data
which provide annual time series for 2-digit SIC industries for the years 1947- 1999 except
for motor vehicles which is three digit (SIC 371).
    We use the capital-goods prices as a measure of technological change at the industry
level, i.e., as a measure of ct in di¤erent industries. These data will serve as a measure of
the of g~i;t , the random growth rate for industry i. That is, we use the CV quality-adjusted
price pi;t ; and then compute gi;t = ln (pi;t =pi;t 1 ) :
    We construct two alternative industry measures that conform to the two-states g       ~i;t 2
    ^i g as follows: 3
f0; g
                                     ^i;1 = E [gi;t j gi;t > 0] :
                                     g

I.e., our ...rst measure, g
                          ^i;1 , simply calculates an average, over all dates, among the positive
realizations of gi;t in industry i. According to this measure, gi;t > 0 corresponds to state
  3
      We now use a hat to denote the industry's gi in state H. I.e., g
                                                                     ^i corresponds to g > 0 in the model.


                                                    18
                               Figure 7: IS spikes and g
                                                       ^1


H, and gi;t 0 corresponds to state L.
   Our second measure is similar to the ...rst measure, except that g   ^i;2 is the average,
again over all dates, but among the realizations of gi;t that are above the median:

                               ^i;2 = E [gi;t j gi;t > gi; median ]
                               g

As for g
       ^2 , we note that the stationary probability of being in state H is L = ( L + H ) ;
then g
     ^2 would be the correct measure if L = H so that exactly half of the observations
are predicted to be in the high state.


4.3    Results
Both g^1 and g
             ^2 show a positive relationship with each spike measure, consistent with our
comparative statics results. Figs 7, 8, and 9 plot the relationship between g^1 and spike
size. The regressions are reported in Table 5.

   Figs 10, 11, and 12 plot the relationship between g  ^2 and spike size. The regressions
are also reported in Table 5.
   Weighted regressions.-- In our regressions industries are weighted by their size. We use
an industry's total investment expenditure coming from the NAICS-CES Manufacturing

    The model performs well: The estimated coe¢ cients remain signi...cant except for the
e¤ect of g^2 on KV-A. The results are similar if we do not use industry weights ­ these
results are in Appendix G, Table A1. The estimated coe¢ cients remain signi...cant except
for the e¤ect of g
                 ^2 on KV-A.

      The use of other weights such as capital stock, value added, and total sales leads to similar results.

4.3.1   Spikes and average progress, gi

We now plot the relationship of spike size and average growth rate gi over the period
1947 to 1999. The reason for doing so is that both the echoes and the ...xed costs models
imply there should be more spikes when g rises whereas in our model the e¤ect of g on
spikes is ambiguous.
    The e¤ect of g in our model.-- The stationary probability of being in state H is
 L = ( L + H ) ; the model predicts the mean of g to be


                                                                                L
                                                            E (g ) =                       g
                                                                                           ^:                                                       (29)
                                                                            L +        H


Thus, if g rises, that does not mean that g    ^ rises. The two become identical if H = 0 so
that progress is uninterrupted. Indeed, when H = 0 our model implies no spikes because
there never is a switch to the no-progress state. More generally g can be higher due to
higher L or higher g ^, but the two channels have opposite e¤ect on spike size, as a result,
the e¤ect of g on spike size is ambiguous.
   Echoes and g .-- A higher g should speed up the growth of capital. If there are vintage-
capital related echoes, the fraction of capital that is of older vintages is smaller, and this
should reduce the fraction of capital that exhibits spikes due to replacement. Both the
scatter plots and the last three columns of Table 5 show that spikes seem to be larger in
industries where the price of capital declines faster.
   Fixed costs of investment and g .-- The ...xed cost model yields spikes if growth in the
desired capital stock, call it kt , is positive. To take a simple example, let C be the ...xed
cost of adjustment of capital. If competition yields a product price declining at the same

formula states that each ...rm would raise its capital at discrete intervals,5 as follows:

In other words, while our model generates spikes only if technological progress is variable,
the ...xed-cost model generates them even if progress is constant.
    Comparing the regression results in Tables 5, g  ^1 does a better job explaining spikes
than g ­the e¤ect of g on spike size is insigni...cant except for the KV-B measure.


5     Conclusion
In a model with no ...xed investment costs we have shown that spikes occur when a sudden
reduction in technological progress occurs, both at the level of the ...rm and at industry
level. In our model investment spikes occur when progress stops. Following a spike, the
decline in price causes investment to stop until costs decline su¢ ciently to justify further
investment. As time passes after a spike, the hazard rate for the next spike rises, just as
it does in the lumpy costs models.
    The model predicts that higher variability leads to greater investment spikes and the
data con...rm it; in industries where the variability of progress is higher, spikes are larger.
Future empirical work may consider combining other motives for spikes such as ...xed
costs, vintage capital, and demand shifts, and assess the relative contribution of each.


A      Appendix
A. Proof of Lemma 2
Proof. Suppose that, on the contrary, a spike did occur at t 6= Tn . By Proposition 1,
xt = 0 on (Tn ; Tn +un ]. Therefore the only place where such a hypothesized spike can occur
is on (Tn + un ; Tn+1 ) : That is, the spike must occur in the interior of the epoch of progress,
i.e., in state H . Let t ^ be the spike date, and by contradiction let t   ^ 2 (Tn + un ; Tn+1 ) so
that dcdt
          = gct  ^ < 0: Now, letting Et denote the expectation operator conditional on

information available at t,

                                                                                    pt

                                                       t&t              ^

But limt&t^ ct = ct^ since c is continuous and since there is a spike at t  ^. This means
that limt&t^(dv=dt) > limt&t ^ ct , which implies vt      ^+" for " small enough, and this
                                                   ^+" > ct

contradicts investment incentives. In other words, the derivative of v has an upward
jump at the hypothesized spike date, and if that date is in the interior of the progress
epoch, this leads to the contradiction.

Normalize time so that gt = g at date t = 0, and let T be the date at which gt switches
to g = 0. To prove the proposition 1, we ...rst establish the following two Lemma.

for all s 2 (t; T ].

Proof. Positive xt implies vt = ct . As long as ct is strictly decreasing and since, by
Lemma 2 there are no investment spikes, xs > 0 for all s 2 (t; T ); if not, we would have
 H                            H
vs  > cs . This implies that vs = cs for all s 2 (t; T ) which proves (31) and (32) except for
                         H                                  H                          H
s = T . Finally, since vt and ct are both continuous, vT      6= cT would imply that vs  6= cs
for some s < T , a contradiction.

Now Lemma 1 states that for t 2 [T; T + u); xt = 0; which implies that kt = kT and
                                         H
pt = pT : Then since Lemma 3 says that vT  = cT , and since there is no spike at T and since
Lemma 1 says that xt = 0 on the interval (T; T + u), this means that kT +u = limt%T kt
and then the state of the industry as described by the triple (c; k; I ) is the same at T + u
as it was just prior to T and that therefore

Substituting for vs from (32) implies that for s 2 (t; T ),

                                                                           L

Suppose no spike occurs at T . Then pt is continuous at T: Taking limits in (37) as s % T ,

                                                                        27

and rvT = pT +         L   vT    vT . By (39), dvs =dt = 0; so that

                                                           rcT = pT :                                                      (40)

But (38) implies that
                                                      rcT = pT            gcT :                                            (41)

Thus (41) contradicts (40), i.e., it contradicts the supposition that no spike occurs at T .


C. Proof of Proposition 2
Proof. Proof of (ii).-- Let t = 0 be a transition date into stagnation so that progress
resumes at date u. By Lemma 1, x = 0 at 0 < t < u: At any date t 6= T at which x > 0,
di¤erentiating (2) and setting vt = ct leads to6

                                                                          dct
                                                      rct = pt +              :                                            (42)
                                                                          dt

And, since dct =dt =        gct , (42) implies

                                                  pt = (r + gt )ct .                                                       (43)

Since by assumption xt = 0 for t < ; it must be that pt = p0 for 0 t < : At date ;
when investment resumes, the PV of earnings = c . Thus the PV of earnings at date 0
satis...es:             Z

Let 0          . Then, dividing the preceding equation by c0 , gives:

Also, since p = p0 ; by (43), p = p0 = (r + g ) c = (r + g ) c0 e                                                , i.e.,

                                                                           g(     u)

Multiplying by reg(   u)

i.e., (9).

     Note that if    u; then the RHS of (9) 0; which, since g    > 0, is a contradiction.
Thus > u :
     To complete the proof of (ii) we now show that if w is su¢ ciently large, a solution
for 2 (u; u + w) exists and is unique. To this end, note that the RHS of (9) is: i) a
continuous function of ; which ! 1 as ! u; and ! 0 as ! 1 and ii) strictly
decreasing in . In fact:

                           dRHS     re r
                                = g( u)                       1   eg (       u)+r
                                                                                                <0
                            d    e                   1

because g (      u) + r > 0. So, since         doesn'
                                                    t depend on w,                               satisfying this constraint
exists if w is large enough.
    Proof of (i).-- Let w >     u so that (the date at which investment resumes) occurs
                                                                                     pT
before the next transition date, i.e., before the next stagnation begins. Let T =       :
                                                                                     cT
Then, by reasoning analogous to the derivation of 0 in Eq. (45), T = 0 ; i.e., T is just
a function of and exogenous parameters, independent of T . Thus pT =cT = p0 =c0 . Since
cT = c0 e gw
                          pT    c0 e gw
                             =          = e gw ! pT = e gw p0 :                     (46)
                          p0       c0
Note that pt = p0 for all t 2 [0; ] and only starts to decline when investment starts at
date : Thus pt = p e g(t ) = p0 e g(t ) for t 2 [ ; T ).
   Let pT     limt%T pt : Then

                                              g (T   )               g (u+w             )
                               pT = p0 e                 = p0 e                             :                             (47)

Thus, using (46) and (47),

                               pT       e gw p0                     g(       u)
                                  =                           =e                  < 1:                                    (48)
                              pT    p0 e g(u+w            )


That is, the price jumps down at the transition date T implying that capital jumps up,
i.e., a spike.

Di¤erentiating it with respect to g;

    Using the same steps as before but di¤erentiating (9) with respect to r;

   Proof of (iv ).-- From (9) we have r eg(                             u)

with respect to u,

i.e., the fall in price at the spike rises with u and thus the size of the spike (kT kT- )=kT - also
rises with u; i.e., (v ).


D. Proof of Proposition 4.
Proof. Let s be the cumulative time in state H from the spike date Tn until                                             when
investment resumes, so that
                                  c = c0 e gs ;                                                                          (50)

where c0 is the cost at the spike date. I.e., s it is the waiting time (in state H) for ct to
reach c = c0 . With de...ned in Eq. (14), we need to show that < 1.
   At the spike date cost equals discounted revenue. Then, as there is no further invest-
ment until ; pt = p0 for t 2 [0; ]. At that date we are in state H , and since continuous
investment resumes at ; v H = c . And since obsolescence is higher in state H , vt   H     L
                                                                                          vt .



                                                              30
And since vt cannot exceed ct this means that v H = v L = c . Eq. (6) then reads

                                                          rc = p                      gc :                                       (51)

where p = p0 is the price established at the last spike. When investment resumes at
the value of the unit of capital created will equal c , and thus with F ( j ) the CDF of
  conditional on , we have
                                         Z   1                        r
                                                          1       e                       r
                         c0 =                        p0                       +e              c        dF ( j ) :                (52)
                                         0                        r

Using (50), Eq. (52) reads
                                         Z       1                    r
                                                      1       e                           r

                                             0                r

where
                                                                              p0
                                                                                 :                                               (54)
                                                                              c0
Since p0 = p = (r + g ) c0 where the second equality follows from (51), we have                                                    =
(r + g ) which, when substituted into (53) yields
                                 Z       1
                                                          g                       r                    r
                     1=                              1+           1           e               +e            dF ( j ) :
                                     0                    r

i.e., we have an equation in alone. Expanding the value inside the integral, we have
  1+ gr
         (1 e r ) + e r = 1 + g
                              r
                                (1 e r ) ; and so the equation for is
                                                              Z   1
                                         1       g                                        r

i.e. Eq. (15) in the text. We shall complete the proof by showing that < 1. Since      u,

so

H. Firm vs. Industry spikes
We augment the discussion in Sec.3.4 with a discrete time model with an equilibrium
with a Markov structure. There is a continuum of ...rms with no entry or exit. In state
H, costs decline so that next period cost c0 is

                                              c0 =     c;                                 (61)

where    < 1 and where                    (
                                              0 if J = L
                                     =                   :                                (62)
                                              1 if J = H
In other words, state L costs do not change and c0 = c so that = 0 means there will
be no progress and = 1 means there will be progress. For I, J 2 fL, Hg, let I =
Pr(I ! J) so that the Markov transition matrix for is

and its z is again drawn from the CDF        each period, independently of other ...rms'
z values and of its past z realizations. Next period' s value z ­ call it z 0 ­ is perfectly
foreseen one period ahead.
    The industry state is S (c; ; ) ; and for the ...rm state we include s (z; z 0 ; k ).
    Market clearing.-- The market-clearing price solves for p in the equation

and later make it consistent with ...rms'decisions. The Timing of decisions is as follows:--
   1. When the period opens, everyone learns whether next period J will be H or L, and
every ...rm learns its z 0 . Therefore the ...rm'
                                                s state (s; S ) is in place.
   2. Each ...rm then chooses its x and collects its pro...t pzk         xc

The LHS of Eq. (74) is the expected marginal product of capital and the RHS is the
Jorgenson user cost consisting of the interest cost rc plus the obsolescence term (1    ) c.
The inequality is strict if k 0 < k: Exact equality in Eq. (70) holds when k 0 > k ; denote
its solution for z 0 as a function of a hypothetical k 0 by

                                                                 (r + 1      )c 0 1

This solution exists for all k 0 if the support of is RR+ .
    The aggregate law of motion in Eq. (66).-- For a given value k 0 , any ...rm with k >
k 0 will have more capital than k 0 in the next period. And so will a ...rm with a value z 0
exceeding Z (k 0 ), and so

Equilibrium consists of the 3 functions (p; v; ) describing aggregates and their law of
motion, and the ...rms decision rules for k 0 .
   Spikes.-- To show that a spike results from the cessation of progress we start two
hypothetical economies at the same (c; ), but one with = 1 (tech. progress) and the
other with = 0. Solving (70) for k 0 ,

                                               0         p ( (S )) z 0
                                           k = max k;                                             :                      (73)

When alone among the aggregate states changes, the user cost drops from (r + 1             )c
to rc. Then if p did not fall, the RHS of Eq. (73) would rise for all ...rms, except some
for which z 0 is signi...cantly below the zero investment boundary. Such ...rms must exist if
the lower bound of the support of is zero as would be the case, for example, if was
the log normal distribution
    The zero-investment boundary.-- The value of z 0 at which the ...rm with current capital
k is indi¤erent between investing and not investing at all is Z (k; S ), i.e., the expression
in Eq. (71) evaluated at k 0 = k .
    Size of spike.-- Since p ( (c; 0; )) < p ( (c; 0; )) the industry'     s output must rise;
the rise in the industry'    s capital stock is larger the more elastic is the demand for the
product.
    One would expect that if remains at zero and the low-progress state persists for a


                                                                    37

long time, the RHS of (73) would remain unchanged at max k; (r+1pz )c , ...rms with
higher z 0 values will still invest driving the p further down (but by less than initially),
but not by much so that ...rms with low z 0 realizations get further and further below their
zero investment boundaries. Asymptotically investment should cease and p approach a
constant.
