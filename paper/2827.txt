    PREGNANCY   RESOLUTION AS AN INDICATOR OF WANTEDNESS ANI) ITS IMPACT ON
                     THE INITIATION OF EARLY PRENATAL CARE

                                      ABSTRACT

    The study examines the impact of the wantedness of a pregnancy on the

demand for early prenatal care.      Past attempts to address this question

have depended on the self-assessments of women as to the wantedness of

their pregnancy and birth.      Our approach can be described as a form of

revealed   preference in which only those pregnancies that are voluntarily

terminated by induced abortion are considered to be unwanted.      Using a

cohort of pregnant women in New York City, we estimate a prenatal care

demand function in which we control for the probability of giving birth,

given a woman is    pregnant.   We interpret this control as a measure of

wantedness.    The results indicate that if the black and Hispanic women who

aborted, had    instead given birth, they would have delayed the initiation

of prenatal    care, on average, over three—quarters of a month longer than

the mean   number of months of delay that were actually observed for the

women who gave birth.    By allowing women to terminate an unwanted

pregnancy, induced abortion increases the average utilization of prenatal

care among black and Hispanic women relative to what would have been

observed if the women who aborted had instead given birth.

   Two recent and comprehensive     reports on infant health in the United

States both recommended that efforts be directed at reducing the number of

unintended or unwanted pregnancies.     (Institute of Medicine 1985; United

States Department of Health and Human Services 1986.)        The recommendation

was based on the proposed link between pregnancy planning, improved prena—

tal behavior, and favorable birth outcomes.        Specifically, women who choose

to become pregnant are apt to be better prepared emotionally and finan-

cially for the demands of pregnancy and childbearing.        Thus, they may be

more likely to avoid smoking, to seek out prenatal care earlier, and in

general to have a more heightened concern for the impact of their behavior

on the health of the fetus than women whose pregnancies were unwanted or

unintended.

    As plausible as the recommendation appears, the evidence supporting

it is scarce.     A number of ecological analyses have documented a rela-

tionship between the use of family planning clinics and lower rates of

neonatal mortality (Grossman and Jacobowitz 1981; Joyce 1987a).        The

                                                                    with
availability and use of abortion services have also been associated

improvements in area—wide birth outcomes (Corman and Grossman 1985; Joyce

1987b).     The authors argue that the utilization of contraception and abor—

Hon   should be inversely related to the incidence of unwanted pregnancies

and births and positively related to the increased use of prenatal care and

other healthy behaviors.

    At the individual level, there is some evidence that women who describe

their births as wanted begin prenatal care earlier and smoke less during

pregnancy    (Weller, Eberstein, and Bailey 1987; Marsiglio and Mott forth—
                                        —2—


coming).     However, the methodological problems of using self-assesssents to

measure wantedness are substantial.     For instance, the timing of the

assessment can affect the response since a woman's attitude towards her

pregnancy and birth may be shaped by the experience       itself.1 Social cir-

cumstances can also affect a woman's response (Klerman and Jekel 1q84).

Teenagers and unmarried women may be more inclined to say that their

pregnanciem are unwanted because of the social stigmas attached to young

and out-of-wedlock childbearing.     Similarly, married women may feel inhi-

bited about describing their births as unwanted especially if their atti-

tudes differ from those of their husbands.        Perhaps the most serious drawback

is that most research has focused on women whose pregnancies end in a live

birth.     This excludes all pregnancies that are terminated by induced abor-

tion.

    In this study we investigate the impact of pregnancy resolution on the

demand for prenatal care by treating women who give birth as a self-

selected sample from the population of pregnant women.        It is our hypothe-

sis that pregnant women who choose to give birth differ in unobserved ways

from similar women who voluntarily terminate their pregnancies.        A   dis-

tinguishing characteristic    is the wantedness   of the pregnancy.

    Our approach can be described as a form of revealed preference in which

only those pregnancies that are voluntarily terminated are considered to be
unwanted.     In statistical terms, we treat women who give birth as a cen-

sored sample from the population of pregnant women.        Such a framework




   1For example, Marsiglio and Mott (forthcoming) point out that after
control ing for numerous characteristics, women who reported on their
pregnancies while pregnant were more likely to have wanted the pregnancy
than women who reported after giving birth. Moreover, among the subsample

allows us to exploit the well-developed       econometrics on selectivity bias

(Heckman 1979; Maddala 1983).    As   a   result, we estimate a demand function

for prenatal care in which we control for the probability of giving birth

given a woman is pregnant.    We interpret this control as a measure of wan-

tedness.

    Our study is based on a cohort of pregnant women who were residents of

New York City in 1984.     New York City is one of 14 vital registration areas

in the United States that submits induced abortion reports on individuals

to the National Center for Health Statistics       (NCHS).    By combining 1984

induced termination records with birth certificates in the same year, we

were able to generate a sample of pregnantwomen        all   of whom had conceived

within a twenty-month period.     Another reason for choosing New York City is

that the proportion of pregnancies (live births plus induced abortions)

that are terminated by induced abortion far exceeds national estimates.2

Thus, the use of induced abortion to distinguish between wanted and

unwanted pregnancies may be most effective in an area such as New York

where the widespread availability of abortion services makes it a readily

accessible option.   Finally, the racial and ethnic composition of the city

allows us to analyze black, white and Hispanic women separately.          The

impact of pregnancy resolution on the demand for prenatal care is likely to

differ by race and ethnicity given the marked variation in abortion rates

by these various groups.




who reported while pregnant, wantedness was not related to early prenatal
care.

   2Forty—six percent of all pregnancies to New York City residents in 1984
were terminated by induced abortion. The average for the other 12 states
that reported induced abortions to the National Center for Health Statistics

                 11.     Analytical and Statistical Framework

   Self—selection   is a potential problem for researchers whenever the sub-

jects under study have not been randomly assigned.     In the economic litera-

ture the problem of self selection has received widespread attention

following the seminal work of Heckman (1976, 1979).     For example, the wages

of individuals who have completed a manpower training program are a biased

estimate of the wages individuals with similar characteristics would have

earned had they gone through the program, since the individuals enrolled in

the training program represent a self-selected sample from the population

of all potential trainees.    Put differently, those who seek out training

are likely to differ in unobserved ways (more ability or more ambition)

from those who do not.     Thus, the success of the training program at

                                                                of the
improving the earning power of graduates may be less a function
                                                                    asso-
training per se, and more related to the unmeasured characteristics

ciated with the trainees.

    The notion of self-selection can be readily applied to prenatal beha-

vior.   Contraception and abortion have provided women with the means to

control the number and timing of their pregnancies and births.

Consequently, women who choose to give birth represent a self-selected

sample from the population of pregnant women.     It is our hypothesis that

                                                                  from
pregnant women who choose to give birth differ in unobserved ways




was 21 percent (Powell—Griner 1987; NCHS 1986). Although New York City has
a large minority population, the percent of all pregnancies to white
non-Hispanic women that were terminated by induced abortion was 45 percent
(see Table Al in the Appendix).

similar women who voluntarily terminate their pregnancies.              A charac-

teristic that distinguishes those who give birth from those who abort is

the wantedness of the pregnancy.

      From a statistical standpoint, data on prenatal care can be charac-

terized as a censored sample with an unobserved stochastic threshold.                  In


particular, let M.      be the month in a woman's pregnancy in which individual

i
    began prenatal care; let                be a vector of exogenous determinants; and let


It represent a woman's desire to have a child given that she is pregnant

There exists some threshold of "wantedness" above which this woman will

choose to carry to term.             If the wantedness of the pregnancy is below this

threshold, then the woman will terminate the pregnancy.               it is unobserved,


yet we do know which pregnancies were terminated by induced abortion.

Thus, we know the women for whom the wantedness of a pregnancy was below

this threshold.       The model can be written as follows:


                        M. =        B +
                                 X.iii       u.     iff   It > 0       (1)

         is   a dummy variable that equals one if a woman gives birth and

zero if she aborts.          Heckman's insight was that if selection into the sub-

sample was not randoe, then the expected value of the error term in

equation (1) was conditional on the regressors in equation (2).               This vir-


tually insured that the estimates of B1 obtained by ordinary least squares

would be biased given the correlation among the variables in                 and X2.

       Heckman's solution was to treat the problem of selectivity bias as a

specification error.              Heckman (1979)       showed that unbiased estimates of

equation (1) could be obtained under the assumption that the joint distri—

bution of             and         was bivariate normal.         His procedure was to fit the
                ui          u12

equation (2) as a probit equation and to compute the inverse of Mill's

ratio (A) for each woman who gives birth.


                                  =
                                          f(Q.)/F(Q)                           (3)


            =
Here    Q       X2B2/02     and       f   and F are, respectively, the density and distribu-

tion functions for a standard normal variable.                    The inverse Mill's ratio is

then inserted as a regressor in equation (1) which after adding the distur-

bance term
                 (v1) becomes:

                                   =
                                          Xi8i   +
                                                     12"2'i +   v1              (4)



       The coefficient on
                                  A1 in equation (4) estimates 012 up to a positive
scale factor                      The sign of the coefficient on lambda depends on
                     (1/02).
which is the covariance between the disturbance terms in equations (1) and

(2).     Following Trost (1981), we believe that 012 has a particularly useful

interpretation given the context of our model.                    For instance, if
                                                                                      M1   is the
number of months a woman delays before initiating prenatal care, then women

whose pregnancies are more wanted, all else equal, should delay the ini-

tiation of prenatal care less than women whose pregnancies are less wanted.

Thus, a negative coefficient on lambda, (012 <                   0)   implies that, on average,

women with a greater than expected probability of not aborting (i.e.,                           >
                                                                                           u2
0),    have a less than expected delay in the initiation of prenatal care
                                           —7—


(u.1
        <   O).   In short, a negative and statistically significant coefficient

on lambda, is consistent with the interpretation that pregnancies that are

more wanted, delay the initiation of prenatal care less.

    Although we have argued that the wantedness of a pregnancy distinguishes

women who abort from women who give birth, clearly caution is in order when

giving names to unmeasured variables.        For example, a model in which the

cost of contraception       is the underlying unobservable would generate the

same predictions as a model based on wantedness.        Specifically, a decrease

in contraceptive costs, all else constant, diminishes the probability of an

unintended pregnancy, and decreases the likelihood of aborting.        This

lowers optimal family size and raises the investments per child (Willis

1973).       On the other hand, some women will not abort a pregnancy on moral

grounds while others, adolescents in particular, choose the birthing option

because the direct and indirect costs of obtaining an abortion are too

high.       Thus, increases in the shadow price of abortion, increase optimal

family size and lessen the resources devoted to each child.        Finally,

advancements in prenatal diagnosis, such as amniocentesis and ultra

sonography, yield very detailed information as to the health of the fetus.

Although pregnancies that are terminated because of this information are

obviously unwanted, it is the health endowment of the fetus which is the

underlying causal factor.4




   3The expected probability of aborting and the expected probability
of delay are based on F(X12B2) and X1B1 respectively.


   ' fuller  discussion of the unobservables that determine the probability
of giving birth and their implications for infant health is presented by
Grossman and Joyce (1988).
                                                    —8—



    The upshot      is     that   there     are numerous   unobservables   that    impact   on

pregnancy    resolution.          Some yield predictions consistent with a wantedness

model, and others do not.                 Trying to identify which is the dominant factor

would require a more elaborate model as well as more data.                        We have empha-

sized the wantedness of a pregnancy because we feel it represents the most

straightforward      interpretation of the decision to abort or give birth.                      We

acknowledge that some women who give birth describe their pregnancies as

unwanted.5     This means that the intensity of their subjective evaluation

was insufficient to overcome the disutility, or high costs, of an abortion.

Our choice of New York City should lessen the proportion of unwanted births

due to the inaccessibility of abortion services.6 Moreover,                       if the propor-

tion of unwanted births is substantial, then the sign of the residual

covariance will be biased towards zero or even positive.7                     The advantage of

using pregnancy resolution as an indicator or wantedness is that pregnan-

cies which are voluntarily terminated are clearly unwanted and in New York

City, this represents a major portion of all pregnancies.




   5Data from the National Survey of Family Growth (NSFG) indicate that
approximately 10 percent of cumulative births to ever-married women 15 to
44 in 1982 were described as unwanted. By race, 8 percent of white births
and 22 percent of black births were unwanted at the time of conception
(NCHS 1985).

   6New York has a well-developed market of private and public abortion pro-
viders, an inexpensive system of mass transit, no parental notification laws
and New York State is one of only 14 states that funds abortions for
Medicaid eligible women. This explains in part why the proportion of
pregnancies (live births plus induced abortions) in New York City that are
terminated by induced abortion greatly exceeds national averages (see foot-
note 2).

   7Spec,fjcally, women whose births were unwanted                   may have a higher than
expected probability of giving birth (u2>O) but a                    greater than expected
delay in the initiation of prenatal care (u.1>O).                    This positive correlation
among the residuals would lead to a rejecti?iñ of a                  model based on wantedness.

                            III.   Data and Estimation

   Data on births and abortions are from New York City vital statistics           in

1984.8   In that year there were approximately 105,000 singleton live births

and 89,000 induced abortion to New York City residents.      Our analysis is

based on randomly chosen subsamples of the combined population of births

and induced abortions,     Specifically, we subdivided the population into

three race/ethnic groups and two age groups (less than 20 years of age and

20 years and older).     The six groups and the number of observations in each

group are as follows:     white non—Hispanic adults (11,589), black

non-Hispanic adults (11,106), Hispanic adults (10,913), white non-Hispanic

teenagers (4,132), black non—Hispanic teenagers (12,437) and Hispanic

teenagers (8,266).      Our analysis is made possible because many of the

parental characteristics reported on the birth certificates are also

reported on the induced termination records.      Thus, by concatenating the

data sets we were able to specify an equation predicting the probability of

giving birth, given a woman was pregnant.      A similar concatenation has been

done by Powell-Griner and Trent (1987) and Joyce (1988) to study pregnancy

resolution.   A description of the variables    is provided in Table   1.   The

means and frequency distributions within each Subsample are presented in




   8We do not include women whose pregnancies were terminated by spon-
taneous abortion. Early spontaneous abortions are poorly reported. The
New York City Department of Health reported 4,960 spontaneous abortions in
1984.  This represented less than 4.4 percent of all live births. Yet data
from the National Survey of Family Growth indicate that the ratio of spon-
taneous abortions to live births is greater than .21 (Pratt et al. 1984).

   9For white and Hispanic adolescents the observations represent the
entire population except for records that were deleted because of missing

the   Appendix.

      Data from the abortion and birth certificates were augsented with 1980

census data which had been aggregated up from the census tract to the

health area level.    The health mrea is the smallest geographical area iden-

tified on the birth and mbortion certificates.         New York City is divided

into 352 health areas.    The average health area contains between 15,000 and

25,000 residents.    The census data enabled us to calculate the percentage

of persons below the poverty level in each health area by race and eth-

nicity.

      The vital statistics were also augmented with variables that measure

the availability of various reproductive health services.         Combining data

from the Alan Guttmacher Institute and the New York City Department of

Health, we knew the number of family planning clinics, abortion providers,

and prenatal clinics by health area in 1983.         These availability measures

ware divided by the number of women 15 to 44 in a health area in 1980.            The

denominators were from the 1980 census.         A fourth availability measure was

a dichotomous variable that equaled one if the woman lived in a health

district in which was located a health center operated by the Supplemental

Program for Women Infant and Children (WIC).1°

      For most of the variables missing data were not considered a major

problem.    Except for previous induced and previous spontaneous abortions,

less than three percent of the combined birth and abortion recorda lacked

data    on the variables of interest.   If the percent missing was evenly

distributed by births and abortions we deleted these observations.          In the

case of parity and the method of finance one percent of the observations

were missing on the induced termination records, but between 3 and 6 per-

cent were missing on the birth records.          To avoid altering the ratio of

abortions to births, we substituted race/ethnic- and age—specific means for

the unknowns.

    A similar problem existed with previous spontaneous and previous

induced abortions.    On the abortion certificates approximately one percent

of the records lacked data on previous induced abortions, but on the birth

certificates the percent missing ranged from a low of 6 percent for white

adolescents to a high of 21 percent for Hispanic adults.          For spontaneous

abortions approximately 3 percent of the abortion records lacked data but

again the birth records showed a range of 4 percent missing for white ado-

lescents and 23 percent for Hispanic adults.          To preserve the ratio of

abortions to births we substituted race/ethnic- and age—specific means for

the unknowns.

    Prenatal care is measured by the number of months a woman delays before

seeking medical care for her pregnancy (equation 1).          Women who received no

care are assumed to have delayed 10 months.          The birth probability equation

has a dichotomous dependent variable: one if the woman gives birth, zero if

she aborts (equation 2).

    Equations (1) and (2) are estimated simultaneously by maximum likeli-

hood.    Although the two-step estimator proposed by Heckman (1976) is con-

sistent, maximum likelihood estimates are more efficient.         In order to

identify the   model at least one regressor from the prenatal care demand

equation must not be included from the birth probability equation        (Maddala

1983).    Further, the model is on firmer ground if there are unique deter-

minants of each equation.     Thus, we assume that the availability of family

planning clinics and abortion providers have no impact on the demand        for'



prenatal care,    and that the number of WIC centers and prenatal care cli-

nics have little impact on the decision to give birth.         In short, the

cross-shadow price effects are restricted to be zero.       Similarly, we

exclude the number of previous induced abortions from the prenatal care

demand equation since experience with abortion may represent a low psychic

cost of an abortion or a high cost of contraception.       We excluded parity

from the birth probability equation because the left—hand side of the

equation is in essence a measure of parity.        However, we include parity, as

well as late spontaneous abortions, in the prenatal care equation because

they proxy experience with pregnancy and birth.

   A unique feature of the New York City vital records is that the method

of finance is included on both the birth certificates as well as the

induced termination records.     The three categories include Medicaid, self

pay and some other third party.     With respect to prenatal care, we expect

that     women on Medicaid and women who paid for the birth themselves to

                                                                    a
delay the initiation of prenatal care longer than women enrolled in

Health Maintenance Organization (HMO),      or some other third party.   Women

applying for Medicaid for the first time may experience delays in pro-

cessing their applications.     Moreover, all Medicaid recipients may face

greater search costs since not all providers accept Medicaid due to the
                                          —   13    —




level   of reimbursement.    However, in the birth probability equation, it is

unclear a priori whether Medicaid recipients are more likely to abort than

non-Medicaid    recipients.31    New York State finances abortions for Medicaid

                                                 are zero.            Yet, Medicaid
eligible women and thus, the out—of-pocket costs

status clearly measures poverty.       If the opportunity costs of giving birth

are lower for poor than nonpoor women, then Medicaid status could be posi-

tively related to the probability of giving birth (Joyce 1988).

    With respect to the areal measures, we would expect the poverty rate to

be positively related to the probability of giving birth and positively

related to prenatal care delay.        The availability of abortion providers

should increase the probability of aborting by lowering the indirect Costs

of accessing a provider.        However, given New York City's well-developed

mass transit system, neighborhood health facilities may be a less relevant

availability measure.       The same may apply to prenatal care and family plan-

ning clinics.

    We have also included demographic characteristics of the mother.

Among adults, older women should be more likely to abort since their

pregnancies have a greater likelihood of being unplanned.            For similar

reasons unmarried women should be more likely to abort.             With respect to

prenatal care delay, unmarried women should proxy households headed by

single women, especially among adults.             Thus one would expect greater delay

due to less income than households with two potential earners.             The greater

the level of schooling, the greater the opportunity costs of pregnancy and




  111n the birth probability equation the method of finance is reduced to
two categories, Medicaid and all others. The selfpay category is difficult
to interpret because third—party coverage of abortions is not common.
However, among women who give birth, third party coverage more accurately
                                        —   14   —




childbearing   and the greater the likelihood of abortion.       Moreover, more

educated women may access information regarding the availability of abor—

tion more effectively than less educated women        (Powell-Griner and Trent

1987).   Regarding prenatal care, more educated women, holding income

constant, may be more aware of the epidemiological        relationship between

early care and birth outcomes.     Thus, we would expect greater schooling to

be negatively related to prenatal care delay (Cooney 1985; Rosenzweig and

Schultz 1983).

    Among adolescents, however, a number of the demographic characteristics

may be endogenous.     For instance, education may determine the probability

of aborting, but the years of schooling completed could be affected by the

time spent pregnant.    Consequently, our measure of adolescent education is

a dichotomous variable that equals one if a teenager has completed at least

eight years of schooling and zero otherwise.         Such a low cutoff should

lessen the potential problems associated with reverse causality by cap-

turing the adolescents whose educational problems existed before they

became pregnant.

    A similar problem exists with marital status.        Vital statistics do not

indicate whether a teenager conceived inside or outside of marriage.            The

distinction is potentially important because the decision to give birth can

be made simultaneously with the decision to get married.         For example,




reflects a well—insured individual.  For example, among adult white women,
66 percent of the abortions, but only 10 percent of the births, were self
pay (see Table A-i in the Appendix).
                                                -   15




estimates     for   1980 and 1981 reveal     that    28 percent   of the white first births

to adolescents and 8 percent of the black first births to adolescents were

conceived premaritally but born inside of marriage (O'Connell and Rogers

1984).      These figures are national estimates so their applicability to New

York City     is unclear.     For example, the proportion of adolescent births

born out-of—wedlock in New York City is substantially higher than the

national figures.12         This suggests that the proportion of pregnancies con-

ceived outside of marriage but delivered inside of marriage is probably

less in New York.        In particular, 93 percent of all black teenagers in New

York City who gave birth        in 1984    were unmarried (Table Al).      The figures

for whites and Hispanics are 50 and 75 percent respectively.                Thus, for

blacks the endogeneity of marital status in the birth probability equation

appears unimportant.        For Hispanics and whites we are unsure.          This caveat

should be kept in mind while interpreting the results.


                                      IV.     Results

     Maximum likelihood estimates of the birth probability equation and the

prenatal care demand equation are presented in Tables 2 and 3.                The results

for adolescents are in Table 2 and the results for adults are in Table 3.

Ordinary least squares estimates for the prenatal care demand equation are

shown in Table 4.

     Regardless of age, race, or ethnicity, unmarried women and women with

at least one previous induced abortion are much less likely to give birth




  12Nationally, 89 percent of all black live births and 43 percent of all
non-black live births to women 19 years and less were born out-of-wedlock.
The non—black category includes the vast majority of Hispanic births (NCHS
1986).

than their married or nulliparous counterparts.           This is expected because

unmarried women are more likely to have experienced an unintended or

mistimed pregnancy   (Pratt et al. 1984).        The result with respect to pre-

vious induced abortions is consistent with the interpretation that the

psychic costs of abortion are less for women who have aborted in the past.

Moreover, these women may be more willing to use abortion as a substitute

for contraception.

    Women who are covered by Medicaid have a greater likelihood of giving

birth than women not supported by Medicaid.           Again, the finding pertains to

all women regardless of age, race, or ethnicity; however, Medicaid Status

has a much greater impact on the probability of giving birth among ado-

lescents than it does for adults as measured by the magnitude of the coef-

ficients.    The results for adolescents are similar to findings from a recent

study of adolescents in California   (Leibowitz, Eisen, and Chow 1986).        The

finding is notable because for women on Medicaid the out-of-pocket costs

for an abortion are zero.   One interpretation, therefore, is that economic

support for adolescent childbearing as provided by Medicaid and Welfare is

a disincentive for pregnant teenagers contemplating an abortion.          However,

as Joyce (1.988) argues, disentangling the economic causes of adolescent

pregnancy resolution from the emotional and psychological ones may require

more refined data.

    Adult women with at least twelve years of schooling are more likely to

terminate a pregnancy than are women with between nine and eleven years of

schooling.   A similar finding has been reported before (Powell—Griner and

Trent 1987).   In addition, previous pregnancy loss among adult women is

positively associated     with   giving   birth.       Very young teens are more likely

to abort than are older adolescents irrespective of race and ethnicity.

Except for Hispanics, older adult women are more likely to abort than their

younqer   counterparts.

      Among   the areal characteristics, the          availability of abortion providers
has the correct sign among whites but is statistically significant Only for

adults.    Among black adults the sign is positive and significant.              Hispanic

adolescents living in neighborhoods of relative poverty have a greater than

average propensity to give birth; white adults residing in similar neigh-

borhoods are more likely to abort.         Differences among Hispanics with respect

to pregnancy resolution are pronounced.               Cubans have a greater likelihood

of aborting than do Puerto Ricans, but Mexicans as well as Central and

South Americans are more likely to carry to term.               One explanation for the

variations may be the degree of assimilation among the various groups

(Ortiz 1987; Schur, Bernstein and Berk 1987).

      Ignoring the impact of pregnancy resolution, the results for the prena-

tal   care demand equations are in general conformity with the literature.

More educated adult women delay less irrespective of race and ethnicityl3

(Taffel 1980; Rosenzweig and Schultz 1983).                Women in areas of above

average poverty initiate care later than women from less poor neighborhoods

(Joyce 1987a).     Residence in a health district with a WIC center is asso-

ciated with less delay for black women while neighborhood prenatal care

clinics are positively related to delay among Hispanic adults.                Finally,




  13The one exception is Hispanic adults in which women with less than 9
years of schooling delay approximately one-third of a month less than women
with between 9 and 11 years schooling.
                                         -   18 —




except for Hispanic teenagers, women on Medicaid, or women with no health

insurance begin prenatal care later than women with some other form of

health insurance (Cooney 1985; General Accounting Office 1987).

    Regarding other characteristics of the mother, older adult women delay

less,   while very young adolescents delay more than women in the respective

reference categories.    Unmarried women begin care later than married women

and the differential is greatest for whites and smallest for blacks.

Greater fertility is associated with greater delay and women who have

experienced a late spontaneous abortion respond no differently than women

with no such history.    Finally, as in the birth probability equation, there

is substantial variation among Hispanic subgroups.         Mexicans and Central

and South Americans are more likely to delay prenatal care relative to

Puerto Ricans; Cubans and other Hispanics delay less.

    The presence of selectivity bias     is measured by the residual covariance

        between equations (1) and (2).       We find evidence of selectivity bias

in the prenatal care demand equations for blacks and Hispanics irrespective

of age although for black adults, the null hypothesis of selectivity bias

can be rejected at only the .07 level.        There is no evidence of such bias

among whites.    Put differently, holding variations in demographic charac-

teristics, years of completed schooling, neighborhood poverty, and method

of finance, we find that black and Hispanic women who give birth represent

a non-random draw from the population of pregnant women.         The negative

covariance   indicates that, on average, the unobserved factors which raise

the probability of giving birth are positively correlated with the unob-

served factors that decrease delay in the initiation of prenatal care.            It
                                        —
                                            19 -



is   our contention that by controlling for self—selection into the birth

sample, we are controlling, in part, for the wantedness of the pregnancy.

The negative covariance between the residuals in the pregnancy resolution

equation and the prenatal care demand equation is consistent with the

interpretation that pregnancies that are more wanted, delay the initiation

of prenatal care less

     What these results imply about white pregnant women is that the deci-

sion to abort or give birth yields no information regarding the utilization

of prenatal care.   One explanation is that we have no equation predicting

the probability of becoming pregnant.       If whites use contraception more

often than blacks, and a number of sources indicate that they do, then the

selection process which reduces the proportion of unplanned pregnancies may

occur at an earlier point in the reproductive cycle among whites than it

does for blacks (Henshaw et al. 1985; Pratt et al. 1984; Stephen, Rindfuss

and Bean 1988).   Thus, by analyzing only pregnant women, as opposed to

Sexually active women, we are unable to incorporate the impact of contra-

ception on prenatal behavior.

     One means of gauging the magnitude of the selection effect on the ini-

tiation of prenatal care is to compare the observed mean number of months a

woman delays before initiating care to the expected mean delay of women who

aborted had they chosen to give birth.      Our first comparison is based on

unobserved factors only.14   Ignoring the results for whites, we find that

black teenagers who aborted would have delayed the initiation of care 1.5




  l4Let Mb be the observed mean number of months a woman delays before ini-
tiating prenatal care. Let Ma be the expected delay in months that we
would have observed among women who aborted had they chosen to give birth.

months more than the mean number of months delayed that were actually

observed for black adolescents.        Hispanic adolescents who aborted would

have delayed .8 of a month more than what was observed.        The relevant

                                             and .7 months respectively.
figures for black and Hispanic adults are .4

If we allow for differences in both observed and unobserved characteristics

between women who gave birth and women who aborted the results change

slightly.15   Hispanic adolescents who aborted would be expected to delay 1.0

months more than their counterparts who gave birth; black adults who

aborted would delay the initiation of prenatal care, on average, .5 of a

month more.   There were no changes for black adolescents and Hispanic

adults.   As the results make clear, the expected differences in the ini-

tiation of prenatal care between aborters and those who give birth are

dominated by the unobserved characteristics.

and let B1 be the estimated vector of coefficients. Correcting for the

alone on prenatal care delay.

equation (5) of footnote 14 are allowed to differ.

      Failure   to correct for self—selection can yield biased estimates as

shown by comparing the corrected with the uncorrected results in Table 4.

Among adults, for instance, the impact of completing high school on prena-

tal   care delay falls by 27 percent among black adults and 17 percent among

Hispanic adults.     For black adolescents the differential delay between

those on Medicaid and those with some other third party coverage falls 62

percent when self-selection is corrected.          However, in the case of Hispanic

adolescents the same differential increases by 41 percent.            The most drama-

tic change between the corrected and uncorrected estimates occurs for

unmarried women.     Among blacks of all ages the coefficients on out-of-

wedlock births more than doubles; for Hispanics the same coefficient

increases by more than 50 percent when corrected for self—selection.               The

results imply that unmarried women who do not voluntarily terminate their

pregnancies are at a greater risk of inadequate prenatal care than would be

predicted by direct correlational methods.            The results are especially

worrisome given the rise in out—of-wedlock childbearing among women of

Hispanic descent.


                                 V.   Conclusion

      In this study we have attempted to incorporate the information as to

how a pregnancy is resolved into the prenatal care demand equation.           We

accomplished this by treating women who give birth as a self-selected

sample from the population of pregnant women.           However, instead of simply

testing for selectivity bias, we have argued that the sign of the residual

covariance between the pregnancy resolution equation and the prenatal care
                                          —   22   —




demand equation   nay   offer   useful insights as to the effect of unobservables

on the demand for prenatal care.       In particular, women with a higher than

                                               a smaller than expected
expected probability of giving birth, evidence
                                              result is consistent with the
delay in the initiation of prenatal care. The

                                            are more wanted, obtain prena-
interpretation that women whose pregnancies

tal care earlier than women whose pregnancies are less wanted.

    We found that the black and Hispanic women who give birth differ in a
                                                         who abort.          We
statistically significant manner from their counterparts

observed no such differences for whites.           We have speculated that black and

Hispanic women may substitute abortion for contraception more frequently

than white women.       As a result, the selection mechanism encouraged by abor-

tion has a greater impact on the prenatal behavior of minorities than it

has among whites.

     It must be noted that New York City is a rather unique setting.          It has

a well-developed market of private and public providers, a state government

that continues to fund abortions for all Medicaid—eligible women, no paren-

tal notification laws with respect to minors, and a readily available

system of transportation.        At the same time the shadow price of contracep-

tion may be higher for minorities than for whites due to language barriers,

 lower levels of schooling, and less access to private gynecological care.

Given these factors, the shadow price of abortion relative to contraception

may be lower for black and Hispanic women which would induce greater

 substitution away from contraception towards abortion.

     The upshot is that the results reported here may not generalize to

 other areas where the shadow price of abortion is higher.          Consequently, an

agenda for   future   research                                       analysis

states where abortion services are less accessible.              A higher shadow price

of abortion would either promote greater contraceptive use or result in

more hnwanted births.       The latter outcome is more likely for adolescents

and minorities given the frequency with which contraception is used by

these groups (Pratt et al. 1984).

    Another area of future research is to examine the impact of pregnancy

resolution on birth outcomes.        Given the positive association between

                                                                     the
early prenatal care and birth outcomes (Institute of Medicine 1985),

results reported here suggest an important indirect effect of pregnancy

resolution on birth outcomes through its impact on prenatal care.               However,

wantedness, as captured by pregnancy resolution, may improve other prenatal

behaviors (Weller, Eberstein and Bailey 1987).            The result could be a

direct effect on birth outcomes if pregnancies that are more wanted are

positively related to such hard to measure inputs as exercise, nutrition,

and lower levels of Stress.
