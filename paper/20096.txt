                                             ABSTRACT

This paper analyzes the use of the corporate form among nineteenth-century manufacturing firms in
Massachusetts, from newly collected data from 1875. An analysis of incorporation rates across industries
reveals that corporations were formed at higher rates among industries in which firm size was larger.
But conditional on firm size, the industries in which production was conducted in factories, rather
than artisanal shops, saw more frequent use of the corporate form. On average, the ownership of the
corporations was quite concentrated, with the directors holding 45 percent of the shares. However,
the corporations whose shares were quoted on the Boston Stock Exchange were ‘widely held’ at rates
comparable to modern American public companies. The production methods utilized in in different
industries also influenced firms’ ownership structures. In many early factories, steam power was combined
with unskilled labor, and managers likely performed a complex supervisory role that was critical to
the success of the firm. Consistent with the notion that monitoring management was especially important
among such firms, corporations in industries that made greater use of steam power and unskilled labor
had more concentrated ownership, higher levels of managerial ownership, and smaller boards of directors.

1. Introduction

        The ownership structure of public corporations in the United States today is unique.

Relative to those of other countries, American corporations are less likely to have a parent

company or be part of a family business group, and more likely to be widely held (LaPorta et al,

1999). The historical origins of the distinctive patterns of corporate ownership in the United

States are widely debated, and a number of competing explanations have been offered, ranging

from populist politics (Roe, 2004) to the protections of investors resulting from the early origins

of the American legal system (LaPorta et al, 1998). But the historical evolution of corporate

ownership in the United States is poorly documented, and the timing of the emergence of the

distinctively American style of corporate ownership, along with the factors that may have been

responsible for its emergence, are not well understood.

        Most accounts of the history of American corporate ownership tend to echo the

influential work of Berle and Means (1932), who argue that prior to the rise of ‘big business’

around the turn of the twentieth century, American industrial corporations were owned by

limited numbers of investors who participated actively in the governance of their firms.1 More

recent work has challenged this view, arguing from early nineteenth century data that the

separation of ownership from control occurred much earlier (Hilt, 2008). The contradictory

and fragmentary findings of this literature reflect the frustrating scarcity of data on early

American corporations, particularly industrial firms, which were subject to relatively few

disclosure requirements in most states’ corporation laws.

        This paper presents new, comprehensive data on the ownership and governance of

industrial corporations from the third quarter of the nineteenth century—before the rise of ‘big

business’—from the State of Massachusetts. At the time, Massachusetts was among the most


1For example, Becht and Delong (2005: 614) argue that the unusually diffuse ownership of American
corporations “is not a long-standing historical tradition.” Likewise Cantillo Simon (1998) argues that
prior to 1890, American stock markets did not function actively, since corporate ownership was so
concentrated in the hands of company founders (Cantillo Simon, 1998). See also Dodd (1938),
Hovenkamp (1991) and Coffee (2001). An important exception is Werner (1986).

                                                     1
heavily industrialized states. Entrepreneurs in Massachusetts were pioneers in the textile

industry, and developed the first ‘integrated’ cotton textile mills in the United States in the early

nineteenth century (see Ware, 1931). Dozens of enormous textile corporations were eventually

founded in the state, and the shares of many of these enterprises were traded on the Boston

Stock Exchange, which was then the premier market for American industrial securities (Atack

and Rousseau, 1999). In the second half of the nineteenth century, a number of new industries

developed in Massachusetts, including chemicals, fabricated metals, and machinery, and

entrepreneurs in these industries also made heavy use of the corporate form.

       Relative to those of nearly all other states, Massachusetts’ corporation law included an

unusually strict disclosure requirement which mandated that industrial firms submit

‘certificates of condition’ to the state government, which listed the names of their directors and

stockholders. In this paper I use the certificates filed for the year 1875 to construct a

comprehensive dataset of operating industrial corporations in the state, which includes detailed

ownership information. I then classify each corporation by industry and match them to data

from the state’s 1875 manufacturing census, which recorded information on production

methods, total numbers of firms and employees, and wages, in different industries. These data

present a detailed and comprehensive picture of corporate ownership among industrial firms in

the third quarter of the nineteenth century. With the matched data I am able to analyze the

variation in incorporation rates as well as the differences in corporate ownership structures

across industries. In particular, I can document the extent of the separation of ownership from

control among the prominent textile corporations in the state, and compare them to

corporations operating in other industries.

       The analysis proceeds in three steps. First, I study the adoption of the corporate form

across industries. The data reveal substantial variation in incorporation rates, ranging from a

high of more than 60 percent among producers of chemicals and of glass, to zero among

producers of carriages and wagons. Perhaps unsurprisingly, an analysis of the determinants of


                                                  2
incorporation rates reveals that they were higher among industries where average firm size,

measured by either capital or total employees, was large. However, conditional on firm size,

industries that made greater use of steam power and unskilled labor, and industries in which a

relatively large proportion of firms’ capital was accounted for by fixed assets, were incorporated

at higher rates. This is consistent with the notion that the corporate form found heaviest use

among those industries in which production was undertaken within factories, rather than

artisanal shops.2 The data suggest that the corporation was used not only to achieve greater

scale, but also to adopt mechanized, factory-based production methods.

        In the second step I analyze the ownership of the corporations, and calculate a variety of

statistics comparable to those commonly used in the analysis of modern corporate governance.

The data indicate that the degree of ownership dispersion in general and managerial ownership

in particular varied widely across industries. The great textile corporations, whose shares were

traded on the Boston Stock Exchange, were ‘widely held’ at even higher rates than those of

modern American publicly traded corporations.3 The degree of the separation of ownership

from control among those firms was comparable to large modern publicly traded firms, and

Berle and Means (1932) would have characterized nearly all of them as subject to “management

control.” The ownership structures of those firms certainly contradict any simplistic narrative of

the evolution of American corporate ownership in which the separation of ownership from

control suddenly occurs at the turn of the twentieth century.

        However, the data also indicate that the great textile mills were rather atypical of the

state’s industrial corporations: they were larger, had greater numbers of shareholders, and

lower degrees of managerial ownership. Entrepreneurs were apparently able to use the

flexibility of Massachusetts’ corporation law to configure their enterprises in a variety of ways,

2 On the distinction between the two, see Katz and Margo (2013) and the references cited therein. On the
significance of steam power for productivity, see Atack, Bateman and Margo (2008).
3 La Porta et al (1999) document that 80 percent of their sample of large modern American public

companies are widely held in the sense that they do not have an owner holding 20 percent or more of their
stock. In contrast, 98 percent of the manufacturing corporations traded on the Boston Stock Exchange
were widely held by that definition.

                                                   3
according to their needs and circumstances. Most corporations had relatively few shareholders

and high levels of managerial ownership, but the degree of ownership concentration observed

across industries, and also among firms within particular industries, varied significantly.

        Finally I analyze the determinants of ownership concentration and managerial

ownership. Unsurprisingly, larger firms were more widely held. But the results indicate that,

conditional on firm size, corporations that made greater use of steam power and unskilled labor

had more concentrated ownership. That is, relative to corporations of similar sizes in industries

that relied more on skilled labor and less on steam power, those in industries that organized

production within factories, rather than large artisanal shops, had fewer shareholders, and a

greater proportion of the shares were held by the directors. This is consistent with the notion

that incorporators and investors responded to the challenges posed by the complex role

performed by managers in those firms by ensuring that there was adequate ownership

incentives to monitor and supervise management.

        This paper contributes to three interrelated lines of research. First, it complements the

large and growing literature on the development of manufacturing in New England.4 Much of

this work has focused narrowly on textiles, and the very large corporations that were formed

within that industry (for example, McGouldrick, 1968). This paper complements that work by

presenting an account of how the corporate form was utilized within manufacturing. The data

reveal that in the third quarter of the nineteenth century, the corporation had proliferated well

beyond textiles into a broad range of industries. And across those industries, somewhat

different “styles” of ownership were adopted.

        Second, the paper contributes to a literature that documents the history of corporate

ownership, both in the United States and elsewhere.5 This paper complements that literature by


4See, for example, Temin, ed (2000) and Handlin and Handlin (1974).
5Recent work on British corporations, for example, includes Acheson et al (2014), Cheffins et al (2013),
Freeman Pearson and Taylor (2013), and Hannah (2007). Work on the historical ownership of American
corporations includes Bodenhorn (2012, 2013), Davis (1958), Hilt and Valentine (2012), Majewski (2006)
and Wright (1999).

presenting comprehensive statistics on the ownership of nineteenth century industrial

corporations, prior to the rise of ‘big business.’

       Finally, the paper also contributes to the literature on the adaptability of the corporate

form to the needs of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Recent contributions to this

literature have argued that the corporation laws of American states were quite rigid and

regulated governance institutions in ways that were unattractive to SMEs, and that innovations

in the menu of organizational forms available to American firms in the later twentieth century,

such as the Limited Liability Company (LLC), created alternatives that were vastly superior to

the corporation for the needs of SMEs (Guinnane et al, 2007). The results of this paper suggest

that there was sufficient flexibility in the corporation law of Massachusetts for entrepreneurs to

adapt the corporate form into a wide range of enterprises.



2 The Massachusetts Legislature and Corporation Law, 1790-1850



       As in most American states, during the first half of the nineteenth century the corporate

form was not freely available to entrepreneurs in Massachusetts. Instead, incorporation was

only possible if the state legislature passed a law granting a charter to a business. These ‘special

act charters’ were probably not accessible to entrepreneurs who lacked a fair measure of legal

sophistication and financial resources. Nonetheless, over the first half of the nineteenth

century, Massachusetts granted charters to nearly 550 manufacturing firms. The terms of these

charters were initially restrictive in some respects, but they quickly became quite liberal,

particularly with regard to the internal governance of the firms they created. This flexibility was

unusual, relative to the terms of other states’ corporation laws, and may have contributed to the

heavy use of the corporate form in Massachusetts.

        Beginning in the Early National period, the state government actively used the law to

promote economic development, offering public support to private enterprises that would


                                                     5
furnish transportation infrastructure or develop the capacity for manufacturing (see Handlin

and Handlin, 1974). When entrepreneurs sought charters to incorporate manufacturing

businesses, they were generally accommodated. As the state industrialized and new companies

proliferated, demand for corporate charters grew rapidly, and the state showed a clear

willingness to meet that demand. In the first half of the nineteenth century, Massachusetts

granted the highest number of corporate charters of all the American states and territories.

Figure 1 presents the charters granted by the state in a comparative perspective. By 1850

Massachusetts had granted more than twice the number of corporate charters relative to its

population than the national average.

        Especially in the period before 1830, however, these charters often did not contain all the

terms sought by entrepreneurs. For example, the petition for the Boston Manufacturing

Corporation, the firm that would become the first to create an integrated cotton mill, sought

banking powers for their enterprise, which were refused (McGouldrick, 1968). The success of

that firm and the other Waltham-Lowell mills that followed under the terms of the charters they

were granted demonstrated that banking powers were unnecessary. Yet those firms’ charters

lacked another important power that was routinely granted to manufacturing incorporations in

other states: limited liability for the shareholders. The state refused to grant limited liability to

any manufacturing corporation in the 1810s and 1820s. All charters granted to such enterprises

explicitly made shareholders subject to an 1809 statute, which made them personally liable for

their firms’ debts.6 When it was later objected that shareholders could circumvent this provision

by selling their shares to “men of straw,” the legislature strengthened its requirement of

individual liability by passing legislation that made shareholders liable for any debts incurred




6
 This general regulating act for manufacturing companies to some extent standardized many of the terms
in subsequent charters, and helped reduce the scope for special privileges to be granted in particular
charters. Massachusetts Laws, 1809, ch. 65. The special privileges granted to some very early
Massachusetts manufacturing corporations, ranging from lottery tickets to grants of land, are described in
Davis (1917).

                                                    6
while they were shareholders, even if they subsequently sold their shares.7 Yet in spite of this

restriction, manufacturing enterprises sought to incorporate in Massachusetts at very high rates;

from 1800-1809, 15 charters were granted to manufacturing enterprises, and from 1810-1819,

133 were granted. In the 1820s, another 146 were granted.8

       The burden of unlimited liability for shareholders ultimately came to be perceived by

many to be limiting economic development. In 1829, a year of high numbers of business

failures, the personal liability of many households owning corporate stock led to “wide

spreading and irretrievable ruin to individuals.”9 Ultimately the governor, Levi Lincoln, took up

the cause and despite the vigorous opposition of some influential merchants, a new law granting

limited liability to manufacturing enterprises was passed in 1830.10 This law, a “general

regulating act” that dictated virtually all of the terms of subsequent manufacturing charters,

stated that the shareholders of these enterprises would have unlimited liability for debts until

their capital subscriptions were fully paid-in, at which point their liability would be limited to

the amount of their shares. The act included various other safeguards for the creditors of

corporations, for example limiting total indebtedness, and prohibiting the payment of dividends

from the capital stock or loans to stockholders.

       The 1830 act did not, however, include any terms relative to the governance of the

corporations subsequently created, other that imposing the requirement that each corporation

have a president, a clerk, a treasurer, and at least three directors. The voting rights of the

shareholders, and their method for choosing these officers, were left to the corporations

themselves to decide. The silence of the law on these issues was quite unusual; most states’ early

corporation laws strictly regulated director elections and shareholder voting rights (Hilt, 2013).

All subsequent manufacturing charters were quite brief, stating only the name of the firm, the

nature of its operations, and the size of its capital stock, and then simply indicating that the firm

was subject to the 1830 act. In the 20 years between 1830 and 1850, Massachusetts granted

more than 400 charters to manufacturing firms.11

        Finally, in 1851 Massachusetts took the important step of passing a general incorporation

act for manufacturing enterprises.12 Rather that applying to the legislature for a charter, the act

provided that any three people could form a corporation, in virtually any manufacturing or

mining industry, by simply filing the certificates required in the act with the Secretary of the

Commonwealth and with their county.13 Following the precedent of the 1830 general regulating

act, the 1851 general incorporation act was mostly silent regarding the internal governance of

the corporations, beyond requiring that the firms have a president and a treasurer—the act did

not even specify a minimum or maximum number of directors. The act required that

corporations created through its terms have a minimum of $5,000 in capital, and also imposed

a maximum of $200,000, which was far smaller than the capital of many chartered

corporations. The legislature thus intended the statute to serve as an alternative route to

incorporation for small firms, while still requiring large firms to seek charters from the

legislature. In 1855, the maximum capital permitted for corporations formed under the general

act was raised to $500,000, but the legislature continued to retain control over access to the

corporate form for extremely large enterprises.14

        The 1851 general act imposed one significant burden on the corporations created

through its terms that chartered corporations were not subject to. And that was an annual

report, known as a certificate of condition, which stated the names of the officers and

shareholders, and provided other basic information.15 But in 1870 the state formally imposed a

requirement that a more detailed certificate of condition be submitted annually by all industrial

These certificates of condition form the basis for the data analyzed in this paper.



3 The Adoption of the Corporate Form in Massachusetts



       The corporate form was utilized with great frequency, but many multi-owner firms of

course remained unincorporated, effectively choosing to remain partnerships. The privileges of

incorporation should have been most attractive to firms seeking to raise relatively large amounts

of capital from investors. For example, the transferability of shares, the governance structure of

a board of directors to whom control over day-to-day management would be delegated, and the

limitation of personal liability for shareholders would all seem to be well suited to the needs of

passive, outside investors. For a firm with a small number of owners, who were perhaps from

the same family, the formalities of an annual meeting and director elections, and the

requirement of detailed annual disclosures, probably represented a substantial nuisance. On

the other hand, the corporation laws of Massachusetts were relatively flexible, and effectively

permitted incorporators to configure their enterprises’ voting rights and decision making

procedures as they wished. Did small firms, or firms with small numbers of owners, actually

incorporate?

       One way to address these questions is to examine the industries in which firms chose to

incorporate at high rates, and compare them to industries in which incorporation was

uncommon. Massachusetts’ manufacturing censuses reported detailed information on the total

numbers of establishments, their capital, and their employees, by industry. These records can

be compared to the filings of manufacturing corporations, whose certificates of condition stated

their capital and other information. The certificates unfortunately do not specify the industry of

the corporation or its products or revenue. However, the corporate names (eg., “Bay State

Faucet and Valve Company”) often provide a relatively clear indication of the firm’s industry.


                                                 9
For those with names that do not provide identifying industrial information (eg., “Paul Whitin

Manufacturing Company”) contemporary business directories were used to classify most

corporations into the categories of the state census.16 The earliest year for which totally

comprehensive corporation records are available, and a manufacturing census is available, is

1875.17 In that year, the manufacturing census listed more than 10,000 manufacturing

establishments in Massachusetts, and the certificates of condition of 601 corporations could be

classified into the industrial categories of the census.18

        The resulting data are presented in Table 1.19 The data in the table show quite clearly

that incorporation rates differed significantly across industries. Several of the state’s largest

industries (measured by the number of establishments), such as boots and shoes, clothing, food

preparations, and printing and publishing, had very few incorporated firms at all, and

vanishingly low incorporation rates. At the other end of the spectrum, there were smaller

industries with relatively small numbers of establishments, such as chemicals, glass, jute

baggings, and textile printing (“print works”), where the corporate form was quite dominant.

The various categories within the textile industry, as expected, had large numbers of

corporations and relatively high incorporation rates. But there were also relatively large




16 In particular, the Massachusetts Register and Business Directory (1878) and the New England
Business Directory and Gazetteer (1877) were consulted, along with directories of individual towns. The
industries of 11 of corporations could not be identified and were excluded from the analysis.
17 The collection and analysis of the data for the 1875 census was overseen by the chief of the

Massachusetts Bureau of Statistics of Labor, Carroll D. Wright, who would later become the U.S.
Commissioner of Labor and oversee the 1890 Federal Census. The 1875 Massachusetts Census was
designed and implemented using relatively sophisticated methods, and represented a substantial
improvement over earlier state censuses. See Wright (1877).
18 The state census did not require a minimum for revenues or size for establishments to be included in

the census (Wright, 1877: 103). However, excluded from these data are around 11,000 firms engaged in
“occupations,” rather than manufacturing. These occupations included blacksmithing, coopering,
butchering, painting, sewing machine repairing, fish curing, butchering, cobbling, tinsmithing, roofing,
plumbing, and related tasks. These firms had been classified as engaged in manufacturing in earlier state
censuses.
19 The average capital of all establishments, column (2) in the table, is calculated by dividing total capital

in the industry by the number of establishments. There is not sufficient data to calculate median capital
from the census data. The table excludes industry categories with very few firms, and industry categories
where the census reports did not present data on firm characteristics.

                                                      10
numbers of incorporated firms producing machinery, metallic goods, paper, and brick and

stone.

         The data in the table also seem consistent with the notion that incorporation rates were

higher in industries with higher average capital per firm. The industries with the smallest

average firm capital, such as tobacco, lumber, vessels, and carriages and wagons, all had

incorporation rates of 2 percent or less, whereas those with the highest firm capital, such as

cotton goods, textile printing, linen, and “other textiles,” all had incorporation rates of more

than 40 percent. The data in Table 1 also indicate that in all but one industry, the average

capital of corporations was larger than the average capital of all establishments, sometimes by as

much as a factor of ten. In at least a few cases, it seems very likely that the corporations were

effectively operating in a different industry, even though according to the rough classification

system of the census they were grouped into the same category.

         How consistent is the relationship between average firm size and incorporation rates at

the industry level? An analysis of the relationship between firm size and incorporation rates

across industries is presented in Figure 2. The scatterplot in the figure indicates that industries

with higher levels of capital per firm (in logs) indeed had higher incorporation rates. The

regression line included in the figure illustrates the strong tendency towards higher

incorporation rates among firms in industries with higher average capital. However, the

residuals of many industries are also high, and in particular, there are several industries with

relatively high incorporation rates and relatively low levels of average capital. The lower panel

illustrates the same pattern, but using the log of total employees, rather than capital, as a

measure of firm size.

         The census recorded detailed data on certain elements of manufacturing firms’ capital,

workforce, and operations. These data, which are summarized in Table 2, provide some insight

into the production methods utilized by firms in different industries. For example, some

industries appear to have been dominated by artisanal shops, with relatively small numbers of


                                                 11
workers and little fixed capital. Producers of tobacco products, scientific instruments, and food

preparations on average had fewer than six employees, and less than $10,000 in capital. Firms

in each of these industries also made relatively little use of steam power, with around 0.10 steam

engines per establishment or less. In contrast, producers of cotton goods, linen, and print works

typically had well over 200 employees and $200,000 or more in capital, and in these industries

there were 0.8 steam engines per establishment.

Establishments in these industries are best characterized as factories.

       Likewise the workforce of some industries consisted of a relatively large proportion of

skilled labor, whereas others relied heavily on unskilled labor. The table presents proxies for the

share of skilled labor, based on wages and the gender composition of the labor force. A higher

wage is consistent with a greater level of skill; the fraction of the labor force that was female is

an indicator for the proportion that was unskilled. The table presents wages for all workers,

which reflects the mix of skilled and unskilled labor (in the form of women and children) and

also the wage for adult male workers only. The industries with the highest levels of wages were

musical instruments and clocks and watches, whose adult male workers earned $876 and $882

per year, respectively. The lowest wages of adult males were in jute baggings ($307) and linen

($390), and in these industries female workers represented more than 50 percent of total

employees.

       We can gain some insight into the purposes for which the corporate form was utilized by

analyzing how incorporation rates varied with these industry characteristics. In addition to

achieving a greater scale, incorporation facilitated the creation of firms that utilized particular

kinds of assets or production processes, and the variation in incorporation rates across

industries reflected these patterns. Table 3 presents regressions of industry-level incorporation

rates on industry characteristics. Panel A presents univariate regressions, and since many of

these characteristics may be correlated with firm scale, in Panel B the regressions are repeated

with a measure of scale included—the log of the number of employees per establishment.


                                                  12
        The estimates in Panel A indicate clearly that incorporation rates were higher in

industries in which production took place primarily within factories, rather than artisanal shops.

The capital-output ratio, the use of steam power, and the use of unskilled labor (reflected in both

lower average wages and a higher percentage of female labor, although the latter estimate is not

statistically significant) were all substantially higher among industries with higher incorporation

rates. The incorporation rate also varied with the composition of firms’ capital. Column (3)

presents regressions of the percentage of firms’ assets represented by ‘fixed assets’ – buildings

and machinery – rather than stock on hand. This measure was also positively correlated with

incorporation rates, which likely reflects the fact that the capital of incorporated firms was used

to finance fixed investments.20

between the 1865 and 1875 censuses on incorporation rates. If the corporate form facilitated

investments in rapidly growing, new or innovative industries, then one would expect that this

measure would be positively correlated with incorporation rates. However, the estimated

correlation is negative, and even significant at the 10 percent level. This is likely due to the

negative correlation between industry growth rates and average firm size – industries with

larger firms grew more slowly.21

        In Panel B of Table 3, the same regressions are estimated, but with log total employees

included as a measure of scale. That is, in these regressions the relationship between industry

characteristics and incorporation rates are analyzed, conditional on average firm size. Some of

the estimated relationships change substantially, implying that the correlations in Panel A were

20 In contrast, working capital (‘stock on hand’) was likely financed by commercial credit. All else equal,
borrowing terms for unincorporated firms, whose owners faced unlimited liability, may have been more
favorable than those faced by incorporated firms, and this may have contributed to the lower
incorporation rates among firms in which stock on hand represented a substantial portion of total assets.
21 The correlation between the industry growth rate and log total employees was -0.36. It should also be

noted that over the 1865-75 period many industries in Massachusetts contracted significantly, and this
contraction may have been related to the end of the Civil War. In addition to the arms and ammunition
industry, which contracted by more than 70 percent, the oils and illuminating fluids, glass, and woolen
goods industries, all of which had relatively high incorporation rates, saw substantial contractions in their
output.

                                                     13
simply due to the greater scale in industries that had higher incorporation rates. In particular,

the estimated correlations with the capital-output ratio (Column (1)), the percentage of the labor

force that was female (Column (4)), the log wage for all employees (Column (5)), and the growth

rate of industry output following 1865 (Column (7)) all show substantial decreases in absolute

magnitude and statistical significance. Evidently these relationships were driven by scale.

Interestingly, the log average wage paid to adult male employees – which should reflect the

degree of skill among those workers, rather than the overall mix of skilled and unskilled labor –

continues to indicate a strong negative relationship, although the magnitude of the estimate is

diminished. Likewise the estimated effects of the use of steam power and the fraction of firm

assets represented by fixed capital, both of which were likely correlated with factory production,

were robustly correlated with incorporation rates, even conditional on firm scale.

       Unfortunately it is impossible to infer from these data whether access to the corporate

form enabled firms to form that could not otherwise have been created, or if it enabled firms to

achieve a greater scale or adopt different production methods than would have been possible

otherwise. It is worth noting that if the corporate form enabled firms to increase their scale or

adopt steam power, relative to what was attainable as a partnership, then these results imply

that the corporate form increased productivity. Using data from the federal census, Atack,

Bateman and Margo (2008) find strong productivity gains associated with the adoption of steam

power, and that these gains were increasing in firm size.

       But overall these results indicate that corporations were formed in industries in which

establishments resembled factories more than artisanal shops. Even conditional on average

firm size, industries with high incorporation rates were more likely to utilize steam power, and

relied on less skilled male workers, relative to their peers. In what follows, I analyze the

ownership of corporations, and how their governance may have responded to these industry

characteristics.

4. Ownership and Governance of Massachusetts’ Corporations



       Concentrated corporate ownership imposes costs, and also presents some benefits. The

most obvious cost is that the wealth of investors holding large blocks of stock will be illiquid and

poorly diversified. In cases where a shareholder holds a controlling stake, an additional cost

may arise, namely that the controlling shareholder may engage in ‘tunneling’ or other actions

that benefit himself at the cost of the other owners, and those other owners may have little

recourse. On the other hand, concentrated ownership creates incentives for investors to

monitor the management of the firm. In the nineteenth century many corporate directors likely

participated directly in management (they were the managers), implying that large stakes held

by the board would create strong ownership incentives for diligent effort. One of the main

arguments of Berle and Means (1932) is that when there are no large blockholders, control falls

into the hands of management, who become unaccountable to the shareholders, except in rare

circumstances.

       The historical record indicates that among the very large textile corporations in the state,

there was an absence of substantial owners who would have had strong incentives to monitor

management, and this appears to have been a source of some concern. There is a long tradition

of sophisticated merchants expressing skepticism that the managers of early corporations would

be capable of performing as well as those who operated on “an individual basis.” For example,

Henry Lee, a Boston merchant, complained in his correspondence that many major textile

corporations were “in danger of being ruined by extreme salaries and high wages in all the

departments,” a problem he attributed to weak performance incentives for managers (Porter,

1937: 125). But the most clear and direct evidence of such managerial opportunism is found in

the early 1860s, when an activist investor named J.C. Ayer initiated a campaign to reform the

governance institutions of the major textile corporations. He produced a pamphlet, On the

Usages and Abuses in the Management of Our Manufacturing Corporations (1863) that argued


                                                 15
that opportunism by directors was rampant: they engaged in self-dealing in their transactions

with firms to whom the purchase of raw materials or the sale of finished products were

delegated, and paid excessive fees; they hired their relatives for important supervisory positions;

they drew excessively high salaries; and they concealed the effects of these practices from the

shareholders. Ayer specifically argued that “relations of owners and managers” had changed

since the founding of the companies, since the existing owners were completely passive, and

bought their shares “in the hope that somebody interested in it can and will take care of it.” He

also argued that the directors perpetuated their control over their firms by soliciting proxy votes

from the shareholders through duplicitous means, and, where necessary, by holding the annual

meetings of companies with many shareholders in common simultaneously, thereby preventing

the larger shareholders from participating in more than one.

       Although it is impossible to verify many of Ayer’s claims, it is possible to discern the level

of shareholder participation in annual meetings for at least a handful of companies, and thereby

assess whether or not the scope for managerial opportunism was as broad as Ayer claimed. And

indeed it does appear to be the case that stockholders participated in annual meetings only

infrequently.22 The Massachusetts legislature responded to the complaints of Ayer and other

stockholders by enacting a statute in 1865 intended to limit the power of directors to utilize

proxy votes to perpetuate their control.23 In particular, the statute limited the number of proxy

votes that a sitting director could exercise to 20, a very small fraction of the total of around

1,000 shares that were typically outstanding.



4.1 Ownership structures of manufacturing companies

       Whether or not these problems were representative of those faced by investors in early

manufacturing corporations generally depends at least in part on how unusual the ownership

22 For example, between 1850 and 1875, the number of stockholders in the Pepperell Manufacturing

Company grew from 117 to 321 . At the annual meetings during that period, the number of stockholders
present generally ranged from 10 to 25 (Knowlton 1948: 16). See also McGouldrick (1968).

                                                  16
structures of the great textile corporations were, relative to other firms. Panel A of Table 4

presents data on the degree of ownership concentration among all manufacturing corporations.

The average manufacturing corporation had around $210,000 in paid-in capital, and 47

shareholders. It had a relatively small board consisting of four directors, who owned around 45

percent of the shares. Its ownership was relatively concentrated the standards of modern public

companies, with the largest investor holding 28 percent of the shares. By the definition of La

Porta, et al (1999), only about 42 percent of Massachusetts’ corporations were ‘widely held,’ in

the sense of not having a 20 percent owner. For the average firm, the complaints of Ayer seem

unlikely to have been relevant.

       Panel B of the table presents the same statistics for the 31 manufacturing corporations in

the sample whose shares were traded on the Boston Stock Exchange.24 Those firms included

most of the great Waltham-Lowell textile mills, as well as a few other major industrial firms

from other regions in the state. The data reveal that the Boston Stock Exchange firms were quite

unusual. Their capital was more than fourfold greater than average, and their numbers of

shareholders were fivefold greater. Ownership by management was less than one fourth that of

the average corporation, as was the size of the largest stake held. These were huge corporations

with an extraordinary degree of diffusion in their ownership. The problems faced by the

shareholders of these firms were likely unique.

        A more detailed portrait of the structure of ownership of manufacturing corporations is

presented in Table 5, which shows averages for each industry group where there was more than

one operating corporation. The data in the table indicate that in nearly every industry,

managerial ownership was on average quite significant, and typically the largest blockholder

owned more than 20 percent of the shares. Concentrated ownership was the norm, and the

managers’ own stakes were likely sufficiently large so that they would at least partly internalize

24 Martin’s Boston Stock Market indicates that in 1875, the stocks of around 44 New England

manufacturing companies were traded regularly on the Boston Stock Exchange. Among those 44, at least
11 were located in other states. See Atack and Rousseau (1999) on the performance of Boston Stock
Exchange traded shares during this period.

                                                  17
the costs associated with shirking or taking other actions harmful to the performance of the

firm. On the other hand, their stakes were often so large that they held majority control and

could not be removed from their positions by the other shareholders. This suggests that

oppression of minority shareholders by dominant owners was likely to have been a problem

among a substantial portion of the corporations.25

        What explains the variation in ownership structures across industries? Why did some

firms have much larger managerial ownership and smaller numbers of outside shareholders

than others? The data in Table 5 suggest that scale played a role: in the industries with the

largest average capital, the degree of ownership concentration appears to be lower. This was

likely driven at least in part by the constraints of raising large sums of money—it was probably

necessary in the case of very large firms for a group of founding investors to seek investments

from large numbers of outsiders.

        The relationship between average firm scale and ownership across industries is explored

more systematically in Figure 3. The scatter plots in the figure clearly indicate that the number

of shareholders was increasing, and the degree of managerial ownership was decreasing, in the

average scale of the firm. However, scale was not the only driving force behind the variation in

ownership concentration. Across industries and firms, ownership was likely more concentrated

where the resulting benefits were greater. The next section analyzes the variation in ownership

concentration, and investigates the circumstances in which there may have been greater benefits

to more concentrated ownership.



4.2 Ownership structures and production methods

        The corporate form was adapted into a broad range of industries. Incorporators’

endogenous choice of governance institutions in response to the particular circumstances of

their firms renders any analysis of the relationship between governance institutions and firm
25Hilt (2008) argues that early corporate governance institutions were often focused on addressing this
problem.

                                                   18
performance empirically problematic. But those choices of governance institutions, and how

they responded to industry characteristics and production methods can be analyzed empirically,

particularly if these industry characteristics can be taken as exogenous for individual

incorporators within that industry.

       In what follows, I analyze how the degree of ownership concentration, which is likely to

be correlated with owners’ incentives to monitor management, varied with the production

methods used across industries. The corporate form was adapted into industries dominated by

establishments resembling artisanal shops, and, more typically, industries dominated by

factories. Factories made greater use of steam power and unskilled labor, and their production

processes likely created a greater division of labor and specialization of tasks among employees

(see the discussion in Katz and Margo, 2013). Among these firms, managers likely performed a

complex supervisory role that was critically important to the success of the firm. Although the

organizational structure of most manufacturing corporations in 1875 was likely rather simple,

some of the larger and more complex firms may have begun to develop new managerial systems

and organizational structures (Chandler, 1977). The complexity and importance of the role of

managers within these firms, and the potential difficulties outsiders may have faced in

monitoring and evaluating their performance, likely presented a challenge for their governance.

Concentrated ownership may have been a solution.

       From the certificates of condition, we cannot observe the production process or

managerial structure of the corporations. However, the industry averages available from the

census, which reflect the typical production methods used among all firms, can be used as a

proxy for the firms’ own process. To the extent that they reflect the available choices of

production methods given the state of technology and knowledge of management techniques,

these industry averages can be taken as exogenous determinants of the governance institutions

of individual corporations within each industry. In order to analyze this relationship, I estimate

the following model:


                                                19
                                                               log            ,

where       is the governance measure of interest for firm i in industry j in county c,         is a county

fixed effect,       is the average production method (such as the rate of use of steam power) in

industry j, log   is the log level of capital of firm i, and     is a vector of other characteristics

observed at the firm level. Thus the model estimates the relationship between industry-average

production methods and the governance of individual firms, conditional on firm scale. Controls

for geographical locations, in the form of county fixed effects, are included in order to address

the possibility that different production techniques (again, such as the use of steam power) may

have shifted the location of production into places that may have independently influenced

firms’ governance structures. In order to address potential problems associated with the use of

industry-averages for the production method variables used in the regression, the standard

errors will be adjusted for clustering by industry. The governance characteristics used as

dependent variables in these regressions are the log number of shareholders, the fraction of the

firm owned by the directors, the size of the board, and the size of the largest stake held.

        Table 6 presents the results for specifications using steam power, the log annual wage

paid to adult male employees, and the fraction of the workforce that was female—the first an

indication of factory production, the second an indication of a greater degree of skilled labor,

less consistent with factory production, and the third a measure of the use of unskilled labor,

consistent with factory production. The results of all specifications are clear and broadly

consistent. The use of factory production methods, conditional on firm scale, was associated

with more concentrated ownership and stronger governance by shareholders. In particular, the

upper panel of Table 6 indicates that in industries that relied more heavily on steam power, the

corporations had fewer shareholders, were owned to a larger extent by their directors, had

smaller board sizes, and the size of the largest stake held in their equity was greater.26 In


 Larger boards of directors have been found to hamper performance across a variety of measures among
26

modern corporations; see Yermack (1996) and the references cited therein.

                                                    20
contrast, corporations in industries where the wages paid to adult male workers were higher,

which likely utilized more skilled labor in their production, had larger numbers of shareholders,

lower ownership by directors, larger boards, and smaller maximum ownership stakes. The

estimates for the share of the workforce that was female, although smaller and less statistically

precise, are of the same sign as those for the use of steam power.

       One potential source of concern with these results could be that an omitted variable, firm

age, may be partly responsible for the observed correlations. If newer corporations tended to be

formed in industries that utilized factory production methods, and newer corporations also had

more concentrated ownership structures, as their founders had not yet sold off parts of their

stakes (and the shares generally had less time to diffuse among investors), then the observed

correlations between production methods and firm governance could be driven by firm age. In

order to address this possibility, the date of incorporation of each firm was obtained from the

Massachusetts Tax Commissioner’s Annual Report, and from it the log age of each firm was

calculated.

       Table 7 presents the results of regressions of the same specifications as those of Table 6,

but with log firm age included as an additional control. As expected, firm age is positively and

strongly correlated with the number of shareholders, although not with other measures of

ownership concentration. However, the inclusion of this variable does not substantially change

the estimated effects of the production methods of the corporations on their governance. We

can conclude that the results are not driven by firm age.

       These results are somewhat speculative, and await confirmation in future work using

more detailed data in which production methods can be observed for individual firms, rather

than at the industry level. Nonetheless, they suggest that one of the ways in which the corporate

form was successfully adapted into different industrial contexts was that ownership structures

and governance institutions were varied endogenously. In particular, in corporations that

operated in industries that relied heavily on factory production using steam power and a high


                                                21
proportion of unskilled labor, there was more concentrated ownership relative to corporations

of similar sizes in industries that relied more on skilled labor and less on steam power. This is

consistent with the notion that incorporators and investors responded to the challenges posed

by the complex role performed by managers in those firms by ensuring that there was adequate

ownership incentives to monitor and supervise management.



5. Conclusion and Epilogue



        Over the course of the nineteenth century the corporate form was adopted at high rates

by manufacturing firms, particularly in Massachusetts. This paper has analyzed the variation in

incorporation rates, and the ways that corporations were owned and configured, across

industries in 1875.

        One important finding of the paper is that among the large textile corporations of the

state—the so-called Waltham-Lowell mills, whose shares were traded on the Boston Stock

Exchange—the degree of ownership by the board was extraordinarily low, and there were very

few if any large blockholders. The degree of separation of ownership from control among these

firms was in fact typical of widely held modern American firms. However, the data presented in

the paper indicate that the great textile corporations were quite unusual. Most nineteenth-

century manufacturing corporations were smaller, had fewer owners, and a high degree of

ownership by their managers. Some were indeed extremely small; around 10 percent had four

shareholders or fewer. And many of these firms adapted the corporate form to their needs by

creating extremely small boards of directors; 10 percent had boards of two or fewer people.

Most Massachusetts corporations were in fact controlled and operated by the men who owned

them.

        Unsurprisingly, the corporate form was adopted more frequently among firms in

industries where average establishment size was higher. However, conditional on firm size,


                                                22
industries that made greater use of steam power and unskilled labor were incorporated at higher

rates. This is consistent with the notion that the corporate form found heaviest use among those

industries in which production was undertaken within factories, rather than artisanal shops.

Evidently the corporation was used not only to achieve greater scale, but also to adopt

mechanized, factory-based production methods.

        The results also indicate that, conditional on firm size, corporations operating in

industries that made greater use of steam power and unskilled labor had more concentrated

ownership. That is, relative to corporations of similar sizes, those in industries that organized

production within factories, rather than artisanal shops, had fewer shareholders, and a greater

proportion of the shares were held by the directors. This is consistent with the notion that

incorporators and investors responded to the challenges posed by the complex role performed

by managers in those firms by ensuring that there was adequate ownership incentives to

monitor and supervise management.

        What happened after 1875? In the 1890s, several states, beginning with New Jersey,

substantially liberalized their corporation laws, permitting businesses located in other states to

incorporate within their borders, eliminating many restrictions on capital contributions, and

enabling the formation of holding companies (see Larcom, 1937 and Grandy, 1989). For a brief

period, Massachusetts’ corporation laws, with their detailed annual disclosure requirements and

strict limitations on corporate powers, were among the most conservative in the United States.27

Ultimately in 1903, Massachusetts substantially liberalized its laws to reflect the “modern view

that the State owes no duty to investors to look after the solvency of corporations” (Hall, 1908).

With this change, the detailed data on business corporations utilized for this study ceased to be

collected.



27When Theodore Roosevelt became President, his first message to Congress signaled his intention to
impose federal corporation laws, but reassure the business community that “supervision of corporations
by the National Government need not go so far as is now the case with the supervision exercised over
them by so conservative a State as Massachusetts” (Roosevelt, 1901).

                                                  23
          Nevertheless, it is possible to follow the evolution of the use of the business corporation

in Massachusetts into the early twentieth century using data generated by the imposition and

collection of the federal corporate income tax in 1909. In 1909, there were 3,637 operating

manufacturing corporations in the state, with $1.013 billion in capital. This was equivalent to

1.08 manufacturing corporations and $598 in capital per 1,000 persons, relative to a national

average of 0.97 manufacturing corporations and $234 in capital nationally.28 Thus

Massachusetts remained a prominent center of manufacturing corporations, but it was no

longer as unusual in the extent to which the corporate form was utilized as it had been in the

mid-nineteenth century. As new industries and new centers of innovation emerged, and as

many states revised and liberalized their corporation laws, Massachusetts was eclipsed by other

states.

these data are not directly comparable to those of Figure 1, which presents the total number of
corporations created in all sectors, rather than manufacturing corporations that were actually in
operation.
