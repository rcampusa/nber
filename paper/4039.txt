                   STRUCTURAL ADAPTABILITY




                                 ABSTRACT



         This paper provides definitions and measures of the extent of
adaptability of an economy to exogenous changes in product prices, factor
availability and technological change. It is argued that flexibility can in
general only be defined relative to the exogenous changes that occur. Using
a dual approach, measures of flexibility in response to the particular exogenous
shock are developed. In addition, a decomposition of the total change in
National Income into its component parts including gains due to flexibility or
losses due to inflexibility is developed.

1. Introduction
         The objective of this paper is to provide conceptually based and, we
hope, empirically implementable measures of structural adaptability.' Our
work on adaptation can be broken down into two parts. The first part is to
define adaptation in terms of a primitive concept and imbed this definition in
a suitably general model. The second is to use the model to derive the
empirical counterpart of the definition and to construct the relevant measures
for a number of countries over time. This paper deals with the first part of
the project. The second part is the subject of ongoing research.
         By "conceptually based," we mean a number of things. First, the
measure should be based upon a primitive concept.            For example, the
primitive concept associated with adaptability is "flexibility", i.e. the ability
to adjust in response to exogenous changes.2
         The exogenous changes studied here are price, factor endowment, and
technology changes.
         In order to be "empirically implementable," a measure should be
implemented by way of a technique which is relatively general. For example,
our definition of structural flexibility can be implemented using the revenue
function. This model of production is quite general, although it does make a
number of restrictive assumptions about technology and market structure.
Finally, the measure should be estimable given existing data and estimation
techniques. With structural flexibility, implementation involves estimating the
revenue function, a difficult but not hopeless task.
         A natural conceptual definition of structural flexibility is the ability
of an economy to respond to changes in exogenous parameters. A larger
response would be associated with greater "flexibility".          Since on the
production side of an economy the basic endogenous variable is the allocation
of factors of production across sectors, flexibility will be associated with the
rate at which physical marginal products diminish as factors are reallocated in
response to exogenous parameter changes. The definition of structural
flexibility will depend on the parameters that are changing. An economy may
be flexible in adjusting to price changes but not in adjusting to endowment or
technology changes. Thus, definitions of flexibility can only be relative to
given shocks.
        It is important to define structural flexibility for at least two reasons.
Firstly, different economies are thought of as being more or less flexible on
a priori grounds. However, there is no hard evidence to support this in the
absence of empirically implementable definitions that are conceptually based.
Secondly, flexibility has been closely associated with the economic
performance of high growth economies, such as the NICs. A major reason to
develop measures of structural adjustment, therefore, is to look at the
relationship between performance and flexibility.
         At this juncture, we would like to stress that our main objective is
simply to develop a rigorous and empirically implementable measures of
adaptability; we are not suggesting that our proposed definitions are the only
valid ones. Instead, our definition is developed in the spirit that it captures
some important aspects of the term in question and is what we call
"conceptually based". Our measures of adaptation are both appealing, as they
capture the intuitive idea that a more flexible economy adjusts more to
exogenous changes, and empirically implementable. In contrast to the large
literature that exists on macroeconomic structural adjustment,3 our approach
is micro-based.
        In what follows we shall rely on the dual approach to a large extent
and make considerable use of the revenue function,4 R(p,v). With p and v
denoting exogenously given vectors of prices and endowments, respectively,
the revenue function is defined to be:




                                         2
         R(p,v) = max p'x subject to (x,v) being in the feasible set.
                   x


The reader is reminded that, given constant returns to scale, the revenue
function is homogeneous of degree one in both prices and endowments. Its
derivative with respect to prices equals the vector of equilibrium outputs,
Rjp,v) = x(p,v), while its derivative with respect to endowments equals the
shadow prices (i.e., equilibrium returns) of the factors of production, R(p,v)
= w(p,v). The revenue function can also be defined as the value function for
the program that minimizes factor payments subject to the constraint that price
weakly falls short of costs:


         R(p,v) =   mm   w'v such that p c(w).
                     w


As will become apparent, our definition of flexibility is related to the second
order derivatives of the revenue function.5 In sections 2, 3 and 4 below we
develop indices of adaptation with respect to changes in prices, endowments
and technology, dealing with each change in isolation. Iii each case, our index
measures the percentage gain or loss of national income attributable to the
economy's ability (or inability) to respond to exogenous changes.
Consequently, it is possible for us to decompose, the growth of national
income between any two periods, during which prices, endowments and
technology all simultaneously change, into gains and losses attributable to the
economy's adaptability, or lack therof. This is the subject of Section 5.
Section 6 concludes.




                                      3
2. Adaptation to Price Changes
         Our definition of price flexibility is a very natural one. Essentially,
flexibility is defined in terms of the curvature of the production possibilities
frontier, or PPF. The PPF for a two-good economy is depicted diagrammatic-
ally in Figure 1. At any instant in time, with factor allocations given, the PPF
is depicted by the curve FBG. Over the medium and long run, however,
factors of production can be reallocated between sectors, which yields the
smoother curve DBE. Initially prices are such that production is at point B
and national income, in units of good 1, is given by OV. As prices change
from P to P', the production point moves from B to A, and national income
falls to OT. If production had not adjusted, however, income would have
fallen to OS. Thus, by adjusting its production structure the economy enjoys
a gain of ST. It is the benefit of this adaptation that our measure of adaptation
is designed to capture.
         Consequently, our index of structural adjustment is given by:

                             —
               =   R(p',v)       R(,p°,v)   —
                                                (p' —p'1)'R(p°,v)
                                      R(p',v)

               = R(,p',v)  —p"R(p°,v)
                          R(p',v)                                           (1)


               =   pI/[x(p1,v) — x(p°,v)}
                           R(,p',v)

              O.

The index is defmed, in the first line of the equation, to be the actual change
in nominal national income less the change in income that would have
occurred if the economy had kept on producing base period outputs (that is,


                                            4
if it had been totally inflexible), divided by first period income. The second
and third lines show that this is equal to the growth rate of the value of output
at current or period 1 prices.6. This is why we use the notation I(p'). With
endowments given, the index captures the gain from adjusting production in
response to exogenous price changes. Dividing by period one income ensures
that this index is homogeneous of degree zero in both p° and p'.7 The last
line simply points out that the properties of the revenue function ensure that
the index is non-negative.
         Alternatively, we could define an analogous index taking period 1 as
the initial period and period 0 as the new period. This would give us:

                    R(p°,v) — R(,p',v)       —
                                                 (p°—p')' Rj,p',v)
                                          R(p°,v)


               —
               —
                    R(,p°,v)    —p°'R(p',v)
                           R(,p°,v)                                         (2)


                =   p°'[x(,p°,v)    —
                                        x(p',v)]
                               .RCp°,v)


               0.

which is the change in income between period 1 and period 0 less the change
that would have occurred had the economy been totally inflexible and not
adjusted its production, divided by period 0 income. In other words, it is the
change in the value of output evaluated at period 0 prices, relative to period
0 income.8 Dividing by period 0 income ensures that the measure is
homogeneous of degree zero in both p° and p'.
         It is easily seen from the first equality in the above equations that the
numerator of our price flexibility indices can be interpreted as the error from


                                             5
a first order approximation of the revenue function. By the mean value
theorem then, the numerator of this index is also equal to the second order
terms evaluated at some point between the two prices:


               =   (p'-p°YRjp,v)(p'-p°)
                           2R(,p ',v)

                                 *
                                     ,v)(p°—p')                           (3)
          (,fi) — (p°—p')'R(p
               —

                            2R(,p°,v)


                p• p*

Thus our measure of adaptation is fully defined by the price changes and the
matrix of second order derivatives with respect to price of the revenue function
at some point between the two prices.9 Note that our analysis focuses on
discrete changes since one cannot think of adaptation with infinitesimal
changes. As we know from the envelope theorem, the gain from adapting
optimal behavior to changes in exogenous parameters is, at the optimum, nil.
For infinitesimally small changes in prices, the index is automatically zero.


3. Adaptation to Changes in Endowments
         We can defme flexibility with respect to endowment changes in a
manner analogous to our index of price flexibility. Here it is convenient to
use the dual of the Lerner-Pearce diagram, illustrated in figure 2. For
illustrative purposes, consider an economy with two factors and one good.
The curve, p = c(w), depicts the price equals cost condition. If factors of
production are perfectly substitutable then the price equals cost curve is given
by the L shaped curve ABC.'° Imperfect substitutability is reflected in the
flattening of the curve, as in the case of DBE in figure 2.". Consider a
change in the endowment of labor, with capital fixed. This makes the factor


                                        6
payments line steeper. If the economy is perfectly flexible, wages do not
change, and income (per unit of capital) rises from OF to 00. With imperfect
substitutability, the return to labor falls, while the return to capital rises, with
the net effect being that income only rises to OH. The distance OH measures
the loss due to imperfect factor substitutability. It is this loss which is the
basis for our measure of flexibility.
         Consider the function:

                                —             —
                    —[R(p,v')       R(p,v&)   (v'—V')' R,jp,vG)]
          (v —  —

                                        R(p,v')

                                —
                -
                —   —[R(p,v')       v"R(p,v°)]
                            R(,p,v')                                           (4)


                =   v"[w(p,v") — w(p,v')]
                           R(p,v')

               O.

The first line of the equation above shows that the function, 1(v1) can be
interpreted as the difference in the response of an economy which is perfectly
flexible (that is, which can absorb factors at given wages so that the change
in national income is the change in endowments times original wages), and that
of an economy which can only fully absorb factors of production if wages
change. 12 Rearranging terms to get the last line shows that 1(v1) equals the
change in the value of period 1 endowments as v changes from V to v'. Note
that 1(v1) falls as the economy becomes more flexible, thus it is not an index
of the gain from adaptation, but rather of the loss due to imperfect flexibility.
By the definition of the revenue function, this index is always non-negative.




                                              7
An analogous measure based upon period 0 endowments, I(v°), is easily
constructed.'3
          As in the case of price flexibility, our measure of endowment
flexibility is related to the properties of the second order derivatives of the
revenue function. Examining the first line of the equation earlier above, it is
easily seen that it is the error from a first order expansion of the revenue
function, i.e. it equals the negative of the second order terms evaluated at
some endowment, vtm, between v' and v° and hence corresponds to a positive
definite quadratic form:


          1(v) =      i (v' —v°'Rjp,v )(v' —v°)
                   —[...                        ]
                      2         R(p,v')                                       (5)

                 O.

The index thus measures the curvature of the revenue function with respect to
v. Note that I(•) is zero for a perfectly flexible economy by this definition and
that as I(•) rises, the economy becomes less flexible. We should note that an
economy which is not flexible with respect to price shocks could be very
flexible in response to endowment changes."


4. Adaptation to Changes in Technology
         The third parameter change we can deal with is a change in
technology with prices and endowments constant. Consider first the simplest
such change, which is a Ricks-neutral change in technology which varies
across industries. Now notice that this can be represented by x = aitFi(vi) in
the ith sector, where x1 represents output, a' total factor productivity and v1 the
factor input vector used in the ith sector. The revenue function is then:




                                        8
         max E p1x1              subject to x' =    aitFi(vi)
         1      a

                                       for i=l,...,n, E1v' = v.

Alternatively, we can write this problem as:


         max E piaitP subject to P =

                                        for i=1,...,n, E1v1=v.



Notice that in this case, technological change can be thought of as a change in
effective prices.          Thus, R(p,v,A41)          R(Ap,v,I) where   A.j   is the
diagonalization of the Hicks-neutral technology vector which has a" as its ith
element, and I is the identity matrix.
        Consequently, the gains from adapting to Hicks-neutral technical
change can be measured in a manner analogous to that used in our measure of

price flexibility:


                     =
                         R(Ap,v) — R(Ap,v)      —
                                                    (P'Ai—P'AI)RAP(4P,V)
             I(AJ)
                                             R(Ap,v)



                     =
                         R(Ap,v) —
                                 R(AJp,v)                                      (6)



                                       —
                     = p'AJ[x(AJp,v)       x(A,?p,v)]
                                 R(Adp,v)


                     O.

where we use x(Ap,v) to denote the derivative of the revenue function with
respect to the effective price, that is it equals the vector of optimal P's. Thus,


                                            9
the index is defined as Ihe growth in national income less the growth that
would have accrued to the economy if it had not changed its factor allocations.
The difference is the percentage increase in national income attributable to
adjusting factor allocations in response to the change in effective prices. It is
easily confirmed that this measure is homogeneous of degree zero in           and
Ad°.

         Figure   3 provides a diagrammatic exposition of our index of
flexibility in response to Hicks-neutral changes in technology. Initially, the
economy is at point F, which represents Ad°x(Ad°p,v). Now suppose
technology changes from A° to Ad', and suppose the technological change is
faster in good 1 than in good 2. If factor allocations remain constant in the
two sectors at base period levels, output would be Ad'x(A..°p,v) in the second
period, which is depicted by point D in Figure 315 The movement from F
to D corresponds to (p'A,11 - p'Ad°)x(Ad°p,v). This gives AB as the increase
in income due to technological change in the absence of flexibility. As factor
allocations change, the economy moves from D to F, so BC represents the
gain from adaptation. Our index, using period 1 technologies as the base,
equals BC/OC.'6
         Factor-augmenting technical change is equally easily handled, in this
case, in a maimer analogous to that used to analyze endowment flexibility.
We consider the case of factor augmenting technical change which is uniform
across all industries.   Thus, the effective endowment of each factor i,
regardless of the industry in which it is used, be given by aitvi. With AF'
denoting the vector of factor augmentation coefficients, and Ad' now denoting
the diagonalization of Ar', the supply of effective factors is now given by Ad'v.
Thus, for given prices, the wages per factor can be higher and keep price
equal to cost. Hence, the revenue function can be written as:




                                       10
        R(p,v,Ad') = miii w'v such that p c((Adt)'w).
                      w


where w is the vector of factor returns. Alternatively, this revenue function
can also be formulated as:


        R(p,A11v,I) =   mm    w'A1tv such that p c(w).
                          w


where w must now be interpreted as the return per effective factor. Con-
sequently, the appropriate index of flexibility in response to changes to
effective factor endowments would seem to be:

                                   —                  —
                   —[R(p,Ad'v,I)       R(p,A4°v,I)        (v1'A —V'A5RA j,p,Av,1)]
         I(Afl =
                                                 R(p,Av,I)
                   —[R(p,AJv,I) — v'ARA          j,p,Av,l)]
                                R(p,Av,I)

               -   v'A[w(p,A?v)        -   w(p,Av)]
                             R(p,AJv,I)
              o.                                                              (7)



where w(j,,A1v) denotes the derivative of the revenue function with respect to
effective factor endowments, i.e. the equilibrium return per effective factor.
The first line of the equation above is the difference between the change in
national income in an economy which is perfectly flexible (that is, can absorb
the change in effective factor endowments at given wages), and that of the
sample economy. This difference is the loss due to imperfect factor
substitutability. This index is always non-negative and. is homogeneous of
degree zero in both A and A,1°. An analogous measure based upon effective


                                            11
endowments in period 0 is easily constructed)7 Thus, the effects of any
combination of Hicks-neutral or uniformly-factor augmenting technical change
can easily be interpreted using our indices of price or endowment flexibility.
The interpretation of more general forms of technical change will be explored
in subsequent work.


5. Decomposing the Growth of National Income
         Clearly, the above measures allow for an easy interpretation of the
sources of growth in an economy in which each exogenous variable (price,
endowment or technology) changes one at a time. Our measures also allow
for a straightforward interpretation of changes in national income in an
economy in which all three parameters vary simultaneously during the period
of analysis. We illustrate the technique with the analysis of an economy in
which both prices and endowments change during the comparison period, with
technology held constant.
         The total change in income between the two periods can be

Looking at the algebra above, one can decompose the change in national
income by first changing endowments, and then prices (VP) or by first
changing prices and then endowments (PV). Figure 4 illustrates these two
alternative paths. We assume that endowments increase between the two
periods, so that the period 1 PPF lies economy produces at point B, while at
period 1 prices and endowments, it produces at point A. If faced with period
1 prices, but period 0 endowments it would have produced at point D, while
if it had been faced with period 1 endowments and period 0 prices it would
have been at point C. Thus, the VP path corresponds to moving from B to C
as endowments change, and then from C to A as prices change. Similarly, the
PV path involves moving from B to D as prices change, and then from D to
A as endowments change. Each price change can in turn be decomposed into
a pure price effect and the gain due to flexibility, while each endowment
change can be decomposed into a pure endowment effect and the loss due to
imperfect flexibility, as illustrated in the above equations.          Using the
techniques presented earlier, one can easily extend the technique to allow for
Hicks-neutral and factor-augmenting technical change as well.
        A problem with the approach presented above is that although the
total change in national income is independent of the path, the quantities
attributable to the various effects do depend upon the path chosen for the
decomposition. The usual index number problems apply as the indices are



                                        13
affected by the choice of the evaluation point. This is a problem common to
all empirical work and cannot be avoided in this analysis either.


6. Conclusions
         On the theoretical side, at least three issues need to be worked on.
First, the measure of adaptation in response to changes in technology needs to
be extended to allow for other kinds of changes in technology. If tech-
nological changes can be thought of as a combination of factor augmenting and
Hicks neutral changes in technology, we can deal with it in our existing
framework. We are as yet unsure of how to deal with other kinds of technical
change. In particular, we cannot deal with factor augmenting technical change
where the rate of technical change varies across industries. However, we are
not terribly concerned about this, as this is not likely to be a constraint in
practice since most cross-national estimates of technical change focus on the
Hicks neutral ease.
         A second, more substantial, issue is dealing with the dependence of
our measures of adaptation on the choice of the evaluation point. This is, of
course, the standard index number problem.          Most problematic is the
dependence of our decomposition of the change in income on the choice of the
path. In both cases, we hope to be able to better deal with the issues on the
basis of further theoretical work.
         A third issue is extending the analysis to study the flexibility of
particular sectors rather than the whole economy, and to extend our analysis
to cases where endowments are not exogenous, for example, when capital is
mobile internationally or where there are migrant workers. The two are
clearly related.   If we wish to study the flexibility of a sector, it is
inappropriate to take endowments of factors as given; rather, we should let
endowments be endogenous and take factor prices as given. However, this
simply involves treating factor prices as product prices and inputs as negative

                                      14
outputs in the revenue function. We can use the same approach if factors are
mobile internationally and the economy can be thought of as a small open
economy.
         This final point suggests that our work may shed light on the capital
mobility debate spawned by the work of Feldstein and Horioka (1980). This
work argues that a close positive correlation between savings and investment
for an open economy is indicative of an absence of international capital
mobility. This is important as it implies that policies that increasing savings
will also raise investment domestically. However, as pointed out by Obstfeld
(1986), this depends on the particular pattern of shocks. It is quite possible
to construct a pattern of shocks such that, despite capital being perfectly
mobile, a close positive relation exists between savings and investment
nationally both in time series and cross sectional data)8 The policy
implications of observed correlations between savings and investment could
therefore be very different from those of Feldstein and Horioka (1980).
Mobility of capital is related to flexibility in response to changes in the "price'
vector of different sources of capital in the above framework. An application
of interest is to directly look for estimates of flexibility in response to changes
in the price of capital in order to shed light on this debate. The approach
outlined above also appears promising in getting estimates of the extent of
mobility of other factors.
         In terms of the empirical work we hope to do, computing our indices
requires estimating revenue functions. Moreover, these revenue functions
should be capable of allowing different degrees of substitutability in inputs and
transformation between outputs. The appropriate starting point here is work
on particular functional forms for the revenue function that already exist in the
literature. These functional forms have been used extensively in the past in
developing CUE (computable general equilibrium) models such as the ORANI
model of the Australian economy)9 In addition, much work has been done

                                        15
on estimating revenue functions. In international trade, this literature has
focused on estimating import and export demand functions as in Kohli (1978)
and Lawrence (1989).

1.   This paper is related to a larger project by Krishna dealing with
conceptually based definitions of a number of terms such as "openness", b; the
TMterms of trade', and "trade diversification".
2.     Young (1983, 1989) defined 'structural flexibility" as the ability to
change the relative shares of factors of production accounted for by the
different sectors of an economy. Arguing that this ability explains the
remarkable economic performance of the East Asian NICs, Young measured
rates of factor reallocation in a large sample of economies, showing that the
NICs had indeed experienced some of the most rapid rates of structural change
in the world. This paper defines flexibility more broadly as the ability to
respond to exogenous changes. Further, while Young argued that cross-
national differences in flexibility were due to incomplete markets, labor market
barriers, and political intervention in the market place, the approach of this
paper emphasizes cross-national differences in technologies, within a
framework of perfect competition.
3. For some recent work on macroeconomic adjustment see Taylor (1991).
4. A good reference source for those unfamiliar with the general approach is
Dixit and Norman (1980). Our convention will be to define vectors as column
vectors, and denote their transposes by "'"s as row vectors. There are m
factors and n goods so that v is mx 1 and p is n x 1.
5.   The standard way to decompose the effects of price, technology, and
endowment changes on national income would be to do the following. Let r(P,
v, A) denote the revenue function capturing the production side of the
economy, where P denotes price, v denotes the endowment vector and A
denotes the technology level. Then assuming that P, v, and A change over



                                      19
time but the function r(') does not, differentiating the revenue function and
using the fact that the derivative with respect to P is output and with respect
to v is wages, gives:

          f±
          dir   ='' o'1p + xi!v + &i
                           dt     dtA'       di          '—'




The percentage change in income is decomposed into the appropriately
weighted sum of percentage price changes, percentage factor endowment
changes and percentage technology changes. The weights on prices and
endowments are the production value shares and the factor value shares in
income respectively. The weight on technology is the same as the weight on
prices if technological change is Hicks neutral. The weight on technology is
the same as the weight on the factors if technological change is factor
augumenting. Note that flexibility does not even enter here.
6. In terms of figure 1, the index is (OT-OS)/OT = ST/OT.
7. Since, in this section, we are examining price changes in isolation, we
ignore the issue of homogeneity in endowments. As will be seen further
below, when accounting for all types of changes our flexibility measures are
homogeneous of degree zero in prices, factors and factor productivity.
8. In terms of figure 1, this is UV/OV.
9. Note that we are assuming the revenue function is differentiable and hence,
there are at least as many factors as goods. This is easy to motivate in terms
of the specific factors model.
10. For example, if the production function is given by x = AK + EL, then
one unit of the good can be made with either 1/A units of capital, or 1/B units
or labor. Thus, the unit cost is given by mm [wL/B,wK/A] so that the price
equals cost line is L shaped.
11.   In the extreme, if there are fixed coefficients in production, the



                                     20
production function is given by x = min[KIaK, L/aJ, so that the cost of
malcing a unit of the good equals wLaL + WKaK, which is a straight line.
12.   Note that if there are as many produced goods as factors, w is
independent of v as the minimization would occur at the intersection of the
price equals cost conditions for the two sectors, that is, at a kink. In this case,
output changes are sufficient to ensure full flexibility. This independence of w
from v is the key factor in multi-good and multi-factor generalizations of the
Rybczynski theorem.

                           R(p,va)



14. An obvious example is the standard HOS model in trade with the same
number of goods as factors and no specialization. It is well known that in this
model, factor prices remain fixed as endowments change so that there is
complete flexibility in response to factor changes. However, the response to
price changes can be large or small depending on technology.
15. One finds point D by multiplying the outputs at E by the percentage
increase in total factor productivity in each industry. The reason that the
scaling up of outputs by the technological change parameters lies on the PPF
is due to the specification of technological change chosen. The initial allocation
of factors remains efficient as it remains on the contract curve; only the labels
on the isoquants change in this case.
