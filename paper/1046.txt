                 REAl WAGES AND THE TERMS OF TRADE:

          ALTERNATIVE INDEXATION RULES FOR AN OPEN ECONOMY




                              ABSTRACT


       This paper examines the desirability of wage indexation in an
open   economy subject to economic disturbances which
                                                        change the terms
of trade and raise the prices of
                                   imported goods. Two indexation rules
are considered, the traditional form of indexation to the consumer

price index and indexation to the price of
                                             domestic goods alone, the
latter proposed as a means of limiting the influence of import prices

on the economy. The effects of the rules are shown to depend upon how

the terms of trade rather than
                                 import prices alone respond to dis-

turbances, since changes in the terms of trade determine what adjustments

are required in the two real wages faced by firms and labor.

      Wage indexation attempts to fix real wages throughout the length of labor

contracts regardless of the source of price fluctuations. Many of the

economic disturbances experienced recently in industrial countries have called

for changes in real wages, especially those disturbances altering the terms of

trade between domestic and foreign goods, This paper examines the

desirability of indexation when such changes in the terms of trade occur.

     There are two real wages in an open economy producing a product

differentiated from those abroad: the nominal wage deflated by the price of

the domestic good and by a price index composed of domestic and foreign

goods. The producer responds to one real wage, while labor responds to the

other.' When the terms of trade change, these two real wages diverge, so that

fixing one real wage through indexation still allows the other real wage to

vary. The paper will examine the effects of this interplay between the two

real wages, since it is a key   feature   in the macroeconomic adjustment to

economic disturbances.

     One suggestion commonly made is to limit wage indexation agreements to

domestic prices alone by tying wages to the GM' deflator rather than the

consumer price index.2 The proposal is attractive to many observers because

it apparently offers a way of shielding the domestic economy from increases in

the prices of imports, whether due to increases in foreign prices or the

depreciation of the domestic currency. The paper will examine under what

conditions this form of indexation is preferable to the traditional form of

indexation to consumer prices. The choice of indexation rule will depend less

upon how import prices change than upon how the terms of trade are affected by

disturbances.

    Most previous studies of optimal wage indexation, including those of Gray

(1976) and Fischer (1977b), have confined their analyses to closed
                                     —2--




economies.3 The basic conclusions about indexation in such economies can be

summarized as follows: monetary or aggregate demand disturbances call for

full wage indexation since fixing real wages prevents output from

fluctuating. Only aggregate supply disturbances call for less than full

indexation, essentially because the adjustment of the real wage helps to

moderate output movements. This paper shows why these propositions must be

modified in an open economy.

     Indexation is analyzed in the context of a small open economy subject to

a variety of disturbances, all of which share a common feature: these

disturbances ordinarily result in a rise in the domestic price of imports.

Otherwise they are very different in nature, as their descriptions indicate:

(1) an increase in the foreign money supply which raises the price of foreign

     goods;

(2) an increase in the domestic money supply;

(3) a reduction in demand for the domestic good; and

(4) a fall in productivity in the domestic industry.

The first disturbance is assumed to occur under fixed exchange rates, since

foreign prices have their greatest impact in that regime, while all the

remaining disturbances are analyzed under flexible rates. Each will be

described more fully later in the paper.


I. DESCRIPTION OF THE MODEL

     The domestic country trades with the rest of the world but is assumed to

be too small to affect foreign output, prices, or interest rates. It produces

a good which is an imperfect substitute for foreign goods, but consumes both

domestic and foreign goods. Pt is the price of the domestic good, X is the

exchange rate and p is the foreign currency price of the foreign good.

(These and other variables are expressed in logs; a list of variables is
                                             —3--




 provided in an appendix). The consumer
                                                price index, I, and the terms of
 trade, Tt, are defined as functions of these prices:


                                = aP   4- (l—a)(X ÷ P)


                                           (x + P)

 The consumer price index is a weighted average of domestic and
                                                                foreign prices
 expressed in domestic currency, while the
                                                    terms of trade measures the price of
 the domestic good relative to that of the foreign good.

      The model of the domestic country consists of three equations,
                                                                              aggregate
 supply and demand for the domestic good and
                                                      an equation describing financial
behavior. In order to explain the impact of indexation on supply behavior,
                                                                           we
begin with a model of aggregate supply in
                                                    a frictionless economy without
contract lags or indexation,

A. Supply Behavior in a Frictionless Economy

     The terms of trade affect
                                    aggregate supply even in an economy without

contract lags because producers and labor respond to different real wages. The

real wage facing the producer is defined relative to the domestic price, whIle

the real wage that is relevant for labor is defined relative to the
                                                                    consumer
price index. The model of supply behavior specified below shows how domestic

output is affected by the relative movements of these two real wages. (All

variables in this frictionless economy are starred).

               L =     —(W     P )/c' + u/c' + ln(1 —         c')/c'                 (ib)


                   = n(W* —
                               I)   + n0                                             (ic)

               =   (1 ÷ n)/(1       + nc')


    The model consists of a Cobb-Douglas production function (equation la), a

labor demand function derived from the production function (equation ib), and

a labor supply function (ic). The production function includes a disturbance

term representing changes in productivity, u , which
                                                     is assumed to have a

mean of zero and to be serially uncorrelated (as are the other disturbances in

the model introduced below). Notice that the producers real wage appears in

the labor demand function, while 1abors real wage appirs in the supply

function.

     Solving this model results in the aggregate supply equation (1)*. Output

is a function of the terms of trade as well as the productivity disturbance.

How the terms of trade affect output can be illustrated by Figure 1 which

shows how the nominal wage and employment are determined.

     Consider first the effects of an equal rise in domestic and foreign

prices which keeps the terms of trade constant.

                                                                     X)   +      f* —f

The price changes are defined relative to prices in a stationary

 equilibrium (, 1, X,       1)      where all disturbances are equal to zero. As will

 be seen below, this change in prices could be due to (1) an unanticipated
                                                                  fixed exchange rates which induces
 increase in the foreign money supply under

 a rise in the price of the foreign good, or (2) an unanticipated increase in
                                                                              rates which induces a
 the domestic money supply under flexible exchange

 depreciation of the domestic currency.                      Labor demand and supply both respond
  Proportionally to these price changes with the demand and supply
                                                                   curves
  shifting up to point b. Labor
                                 employed and therefore output remain constant
  since the nominal, wage rises as much as prices, thus
                                                                          keeping real wages
  constant .4

       Now consider a case where the
                                              foreign exchange rate, and therefore the
 domestic currency price of the foreign good, rises more than the
                                                                  domestic
 price so that the terms of trade
                                  fall. (For simplicity, the price of the
 foreign good in foreign currency is assumed to remain
                                                       constant.) This price
 behavior could be due to a shift
                                  in demand away from the domestic good under
 flexible rates:


                             0< P-'F< I—T< x —L
 These price changes induce a fall in the
                                          amount of labor employed and output.
The labor supply curve shifts up by the change in the consumer price
                                                                      index
(to L), while the labor demand
                                  curve shifts up by the change in the domestic
price (to L ). Labor employed must fall (to c). Both real
                                                              wages change:
the real wage faced by the producer must rise while the real
                                                              wage earned by
labor must fall.

     In equations (id) and (le) below we express the two real
                                                              wages as
functions of the terms of trade
                                       and the supply disturbance (the latter of
which we assume equal to zero for purposes of the present discussion).

                                                                                               (le)



These two equations confirm the
                                       diagramatic analysis: as long as the terms of
trade are constant, real
                            wages remain constant whether defined in terms
                                              —6—




of P or I. But if the terms of trade fall, the producer's real wage rises,

so producers reduce output; at the same time, however, the fall in the terms

of trade lowers labor's real wage.

       Only in special cases is either real wage constant.           If labor supply is

completely inelastic (n =    0),   then the change in the terms of trade has no

effect upon the producer's real wage and therefore upon output in this

frictionless economy. Alternatively, if labor supply is infinitely elastic

(n =   ), then   labor's real wage remains constant. But in the general case,

changes in the terms of trade call for changes in both real wages. That will

pose problems in an economy with contract lags and Indexation if indexation

holds one or the other real wages constant.

B. Supply Behavior in an Economy with Contract Lags

       When there are lags in labor contracts, current wages do not generally

reflect current prices unless there is some type of indexation. The model

 specified below assumes that there is a one period contract lag so that wages

 contracted for period t, W, reflect labor market conditions expected as of

 period t1.5 (See equation if).

  The model allows for two alternative types of indexation: consumer price

 indexation, where wages are tied to the general price level, and domestic

 price indexation, where wages are tied to the price of domestic output

 alone. If there is consumer price
                                           indexation, current wages are adjusted by a
 fraction b of the difference between
                                             current and expected consumer prices

                                             output produced depends upon the actual

 wage, W, and the domestic price, Equation (1), the supply equation for

domestic output, is obtained by substituting the actual wage from equation

 (ig) into the non—starred equivalent of the labor demand function (ib), and

substituting the latter into the non—starred equivalent of the production

function (la).7 The result is a formidable—looking supply equation that

expresses output as a function of two price prediction errors as well as the

supply disturbance. As in a closed economy (where a =
                                                              1),   output is

positively related to unanticipated changes in the price of domestic output.

But output is also positively related to unanticipated changes in the terms of

trade if wages are indexed at all to the consumer price index (i.e., b > 0),

since then wages and therefore output
                                             respond to unanticipated changes in both
domestic and foreign prices.

      Before closing the model with aggregate demand and financial equations,

we can use equation (1) to review some of the results of the domestic

indexatiori literature (where a =    1).

     (1) If there are monetary disturbances or aggregate demand

    disturbances in a closed economy, then output changes in

     proportion to the rcsulting unanticipated change in prices:

           —           However, if there is full indexation, which can be
     represented by either b=1 or b'=l since the price of domestic

     output and the consumer price index are identical in this simple

     closed economy, then output is shielded from this disturbance.

     (2)       If there are supply disturbances, such as a fall in

     productivity, u < 0, then output is affected both directly

     (proportionally to u) and indirectly (through the resulting

     unanticipated rise in the domestic price.). With full indexation,

     the change in output is even larger, since Indexation prevents the

     rise in the domestic price from dampening the direct effect of the

     disturbance on output. Thus indexation increases the effect of the

     disturbance on output.

Both of these results are modified by the introduction of foreign goods and

the terms of trade into the economy.

C. Closing the model
     Aggregate demand is assumed to be a function of the terms of trade, the

real interest rate, and a stochastic disturbance,            u
                       =   — gT   —
                                      g[r   —

A rise in the terms of trade (rise in the domestic price relative to the

foreign price) is assumed to reduce aggregate demand, as is a rise in the real

interest rate. In the case of perfect substitution between foreign and

domestic goods, where g becomes infinite in size, this aggregate demand

relationship reduces to the familiar purchasing power parity relationship.

 II. MONETA1y DISTURBANCES

      We begin by analyzing two types of disturbances for which
                                                                indexation is
 ideally suited, foreign and domestic
                                                monetary disturbances. In the appendix
 we determine the impact of the
                                     foreign monetary disturbance on the foreign
 price and interest rate under the
                                           assumption that the foreign country is

optimally (i.e., fully) indexed. If
                                                ur denotes the foreign monetary
disturbance, which like the domestic
                                                disturbances has a mean of zero and is
serially uncorrelated, then the
                                         changes in the foreign price and interest rate
are as given below:


                        f — —f   =   mf
                             P

                                                    k1)
                                                              f
                                                           —(re —     r
                                                                      —f
                                                                           )


The increase in the foreign
                                 money supply raises the price of
                                                                                      foreign output,
but lowers the foreign Interest rate.

 domestic wage or price from the disturbance.

         Consider indexation to the consumer price level first. Full indexation

 (b=1, b'=O) ensures that the rise in the
                                                          price of the foreign good is fully
 transmitted to the domestic wage; the price of the domestic good, in turn,

 rises in proportion to the wage. As a result, the domestic price rises as

 much as the foreign price:



                         Ptppf_umf/(l÷k)
 Thus with full indexatlon, the terms of trade remain constant, and so also

 does domestic output. It is because the
                                                      domestic wage and price adjust fully
 to the disturbance that the terms of trade and domestic output can be shielded

from the disturbance.

      Indexation to the domestic price alone (b'=l, b=O) has the same effects

on the economy as indexation to the consumer price level since with the terms

of trade constant it cannot matter which type of indexation is employed. To

see why this is true, consider the following relationship between the two real

wages:


                           W —
                            t
                                 P
                                     t
                                         =
                                             t
                                             W   —   It   — (1—a)T
                                                                  t
As long as the terms of trade are constant, fixing
                                                   one real wage through
indexation also fixes the other real wage. So the two types of indexation are

equivalent, with both types insulating domestic output completely from the

disturbance.

     Under flexible exchange rates, the foreign monetary disturbance leads to

an appreciation of the domestic currency. The                 appreciation   completely
insulates all domestic variables from the disturbance, a familiar result for

this type of disturbance, so the degree of indexation is irrelevant.8
                                          —12--




B. Domestic Monetary Disturbance under Flexible Rates

     This disturbance affects the domestic economy much like the previous

disturbance since an increase in the domestic money supply under the flexible

rates leads to a depreciation of the domestic currency and a rise in the

domestic currency price of the foreign good. In the absence of indexation,

domestic output and the price of that output both increase in response to the

depreciation. But if wages are fully indexed, whether to the consumer price

index or the domestic price alone, then the rise in the domestic price is

equal to the change in the exchange rate:


                              —       = (Xt   — •5) =
                                                        u'/(1+k1)

Since the terms of trade are constant, indexation insulates domestic output

just as in the case of the foreign monetary disturbance.

     We note that under fixed exchange rates, the assumption of perfect

 capital mobility ensures that domestic output and price are completely

 insulated from the disturbance (regardless of the degree of indexation),

 another common result in the literature on exchange rate regimes.

                                              candidates for indexation because
      The two monetary disturbances are ideal

 neither disturbance has real effects in the absence of contract lags. (Recall

 the geometric analysis of the frictionless economy above.) Indexation allows
                                                                    as they would in the
 nominal wages to adjust fully to the disturbance just

 frictionless economy. Indexation is less well suited for the other two

 disturbances to be considered, however, since both disturbances have real
                                                        The choice of indexation rule makes
  effects even in the frictionless economy.

                                      both disturbances induce changes in the terms of
  a difference, moreover, since

  trade thereby opening a wedge between the two real wages.

      Before considering these disturbances, we must discuss the proper

 criterion for judging indexation since an ambiguity arises in the case of

 these disturbances. We might judge indexation according to whether or not it

 minimized the effects of disturbances on domestic output, a traditional

 objective of economic policy. Gray (1976), however, proposed an alternative

 criterion: the stabilization of output relative to that prevailing in a

 frictionless economy without contract lags. In our notation, the criterion

involves minimizing the value of the loss function, Z, which is expressed in

terms of deviations of actual Y from output in an economy without contract

lags, Y:


                                 Z =          —
                                       E[(Y
The rationale for this criterion lies in the inefficiencies
                                                            associated with
being off labor demand and supply curves because of contract lags. This

criterion is the proper one if the fundamental objective of indexation is to

undo the distortions caused by contract lags. In a closed economy, the two

criterion differ whenever there are supply disturbances, since output in a

frictionless economy is not then constant. In an open economy, the two

criteria also differ for any disturbance that changes the terms of trade

since y* is a function of the terms of trade.9 The two criteria were

identical for the two monetary disturbances considered above since neither

disturbance affects Y. But the two criteria will differ for both of the

disturbances considered below.

     The two remaining disturbances to be considered are as follows: a

reduction in the demand for the domestic good and a fall in productivity in

the domestic industry, both under flexible exchange rates. Since the terms of

trade are central to the discussion, we solve the domestic model (equations

A. Aggregate Demand Disturbance

      If there is an unanticipated fall in the demand for the home good

(u < 0), then in the frictionless economy without contract lags domestic

output and the terms of trade fall. (See equations (7)* and (8)*). Because

 the terms of trade change, the economy behaves differently under the two types

of indexation:

 Consumer Price Indexation (b=1)

      Output and the terms of trade still fall if wages are fully indexed to

 consumer prices:

                                                                                                 (9)

Indexing to the consumer price index ensures that labor's real wage remains

constant. But because the ternis of trade change, the real wage facing

producers cannot also remain constant. And it is the producer's real wage

which determines the behavior of output. Recall the relationship between the

two real wages: W —             = (Wt —             —
                                                         (1-.-a)T.   With the terms of trade

falling, the producer's real wage must rise. Thus output must fall even with

complete indexatlon.

Domestic Price Indexation (b'=l)

     This type of indexation keeps the producer's real wage constant, so

output itself remains constant despite a fall in the terms of trade:


                                                =0                                              (9)'

                                                     'p
Because the producer's real wage cannot adjust, the terms of trade must absorb

the full impact of the disturbance, falling enough to keep aggregate demand

constant. Thus output and employment are shielded from the disturbance. If

the objective of indexation is to keep output constant, then domestic price

indexation is optimal.

     If instead, the objective of indexation is to minimize deviations from

output in an economy without contract lags, then neither type of indexation is

optimal. Consumer price indexation induces output to fall more than it would
                                         —16—



in a frictionless economy, while domestic price indexation prevents output

from falling at all.

The reason should be clear from the discussion of behavior in the frictionless

economy in Section I. This type of disturbance calls for a rise in the

producer's real wage and a fall in labor's real wage. (See equations (Id) and

(le)). If labor resists the fall in its real wage by adopting consumer price

indexation, output falls even more than in an economy without contract lags.

[f the wage is indexed to the domestic price, in contrast, the producer's real

wage cannot rise and so no real adjustments take place. Each type of

indexation leads to deviations from the frictionless norm, one causing an

excessive reduction in output, the other preventing any real adjustment at

all.

       Only in polar cases does either type of indexation lead to output

variation equal to that in an economy without contract lags. If labor supply

is inelastic (ri =   0),   then as discussed in Section I, output remains constant

in the economy without contract lags, so domestic price indexation is

optimal. (Notice that the two criteria merge in this case.) Alternatively,

if labor supply is infinitely elastic (n =      a'), then   labor's real wage remains

constant in the frictionless economy; so indexing to the consumer price index

must result in the same output behavior as in the frictionless economy)0 But

otherwise, both types of indexation are suboptimal (measured relative to

behavior in the frictionless economy).

       In the general case where neither form of indexation is optimal, we might

choose between the two indexation schemes according to which more closely

approximates behavior in the economy without contract lags.         It should be
                                              —17--




  clear from the above discussion
                                        that the choice would
                                                                  depend upon the
  sensitivity of labor supply to real
                                            wages. As long as labor supply is
  relatively insensitive to real
                                       wages domestic price indexation would be

                                          Supply must be depends upon other parameters
  in the model.1'

         Alternatively, we might retain the traditional form of indexation
                                                                           to
 consumer prices, but choose an indexation
                                                      parameter less than one. The
 indexation parameter that
                                  keeps actual output equal to that in a frictionless
 economy is

                        b =   1



 This parameter is equal to one if the labor supply curve is
                                                                       infinitely elastic
 (n =   ), but   less than one otherwise.'2
                                                 In general, partial indexation is
 called for, unlike the case of a closed economy.

        We can summarize the discussion
                                            of the decline in demand for the domestic
good as follows:

(1) Domestic price indexation
                                      can stabilize output completely iii the presence
of this disturbance, while unlike In a closed economy consumer

indexation allows output to fall.

(2)     If the policy objective is to minimize deviations from
                                                               output in an
economy without contract lags, neither form of indexation is generally

optimal, although domestic price indexation
                                                      is still preferred as long as the
labor supply elasticity is relatively low.

(3) If consumer price indexation is
                                           retained, the optimal indexatjon
parameter is generally less than one, again in contrast with the case of a

closed economy.

B. Aggregate Supply Disturbance

     The supply disturbance to be considered is a decline in productivity

(u < 0). This disturbance lowers domestic output in the frictionlss

economy, but raises the terms of trade as well as the price of domestic

output. (See equations (7)* and (8)*).      The decline in productivity has an

indeterminate effect on the exchange rate; with domestic output falling but
                                                         demand for money can either
the price of that output rising, the transactions

fall or rise. Even if the domestic currency depreciates, however, the

exchange rate still rises less than the price of domestic output, o the terms
                                                                     also rises less than
of trade must rise. The general price level, moreover,

the domestic price (and may actually fall) because 1 is just a weighted

average of the prices of the two goods.

     With the terms of trade rising, the two real wages respond differently to

                    13

 The real wage facing the producer falls as a result of the productivity

 suggests, labor's real wage can actually rise in response to this disturbance
                                                appreciates enough to lower the general
  if, for example, the domestic currency

  price level. But a rise in that real wage can be ruled out as long as the
                                                     to the terms of trade exceeds a
  elasticity of aggregate demand with respect

  critical value less than one:         g > 1 —          a —      ga.   For the remainder of this
  section, we assume that this elasticity
                                                         condition is fulfilled,'4 so that
  labor's real wage also falls in response to this disturbance.

       The effect of indexation again
                                                 depends crucially upon which type of
 indexation is employed. We begin
                                            by describing domestic price indexation:
 Domestic Price Indexation (b'=i)

      In the case of a productivity
                                                disturbance, keeping the producer's real
 wage fixed does not keep output fixed since the
                                                                     disturbance directly affects
 output. With full indexation, output falls and the terms of trade rise by:


                       (Y —        ,        = uS     I   c'    < 0
                           t      b=1            t                                               (11)'
                                                              S
                       (Tt                  =   —             u

 Because the producer's real wage is prevented from falling, in fact,
                                                                      output
variation is greater with domestic price indexation than in the
                                                                economy
without contract lags. Adjustment of the real wage in the frictionless

economy helps to minimize the effects of the disturbance
                                                                              on output, while
indexatjon prevents that adjustment.

Consumer Price Indexation (b=i)

     In the case of consumer price
                                            indexation, output still falls, and the
terms of trade rise:

Choosing this form of indexation, however, always results in less output

variation than when domestic price indexation
                                                               is adopted. (Compare (11) and
                                         —20—




(11)'). The reason is clear from examining the relationship between the two

real wages and the terms oi trade: W —            = (Wt   —
                                                              I)   —

labor's real wage, consumer price indexation still allows the producers real

consumer price indexation than under domestic price indexatiori.

  That is, the indexation parameter that keeps output equal to that in a

  frictionless economy is less than one.17

       We can summarize this discussion of the decline in productivity as

  follows:

  (1) Neither type of indexation can keep output constant because the

       productivity disturbance directly affects output.

  (2) Domestic price indexation results in greater output variation than

       consumer price indexation both in absolute terms and relative to output

      variation in an economy without contract lags.

  (3) If some form of consumer price indexation is adopted, the optimal

      indexation parameter is generally less than one, just as in a closed

      economy.


 IV. CONCLUSIONS

      The relationship between the terms of trade and real wages provides the

 key to understanding the effects of wage indexation in an open economy. All

 of the disturbances considered above raise the domestic price of imported

 goods, but the desirability of indexation differs according to how the terms

 of trade rather than the import price itself responds to the disturbance.

      Of the two forms of indexation studied, domestic price indexation shows

 advantages over consumer price indexation only in the case of aggregate demand

• disturbances. A decline in demand for the domestic good leads to a fall in

 the terms of trade; stabilizing labor's real wage through consumer price

 indexation still allows the producer's real wage, and therefore output, to

 vary when the terms of trade fall, whereas domestic price indexation

 stabilizes output completely. For aggregate supply disturbances, on the other

hand, domestic price indexation leads to greater variation of domestic output

both in absolute terms and relative to output in a frictionless economy. For

disturbances which leave the terms of trade unchanged, moreover, it does not

matter which indexation rule is chosen since fixing one real wage also fixes

the other. This is the case for monetary disturbances, including foreign

monetary disturbances which raise the price of foreign goods. Thus only

limited support is found for delibrately excluding foreign prices from wage

indexat ion schemes.

      'For   previous analyses of the labor market emphasizing this difference

 between the two real wages, see Salop
                                          (1974), Purvis (1979), Sachs (1980),
 Flood and Marion (1982), and Marston (1982).

      2Countrjes where such proposals have been debated include Denmark,

 Israel, and the United Kingdom. See, for example, the study of wage

 indexation by Braun (1976). Israel opted instead for a partial (70%)

 adjustment to the CPI which was meant to exclude on an average basis only

 those increases in the CPI due to rises in import prices or indirect taxes.

 For a discussion, see the Bank of Israel (1975),
                                                     Recently the Congressional
 Budget Office (1981) has compared a variety of Indexation rules for the United

 States including tying wages and federal benefits to the CNP deflator

specifically to exclude import prices.

     3An important exception is the recent study by Flood and Marion (1982) of

optimal indexation in an open economy. For most of their study they assume

that there is a single world good so that the law of one price holds, whereas

here changes in the terms of trade are central to the analysis. Where the

results are similar is in the case of a
                                          productivity disturbance, since they
show how their results are modified for this disturbance when the domestic and

foreign goods are distinct. See the discussion of the
                                                         productivity
disturbance below.

     4Output changes are directly proportional to employment changes as long

as there are no supply disturbances. (See equation la).

     5This contracting approach to the aggregate supply function has been

criticized by Barro (1977) who offers an alternative description of labor

market behavior which gives Pareto optimal outcomes. Barro develops a model

where wages are set in contracts but where employment is kept at its Pareto
                                         —24—




optimal level at all times. Such contracts dominate the simple ones

considered here, but raise problems of moral hazard because of the contingent

contracts required, as Barro himself recognizes, and seem to be very different

from actual labor contracts, as Fischer (1977a) observed in his comment on

Barro's paper.
     6
         t_IE 1 is the expected value of the general price level at period t

based on information available at period t—1. The expectation, like others in

the model, is assumed to be formed rationally on the basis of behavior in the

model.

     7Cukierman (1980) shows that the effects of indexation are sometimes

changed if employment is determined by labor supply rather than labor demand.

Although the employment rule deserves further study, we have chosen not to

further complicate our analysis with alternative rules.

     81f the foreign country were less than fully indexed, however, flexible

rates would not insulate the economy from a foreign monetary disturbance. See

Marston (1982) for a discussion of this case.          The disturbance would raise

 foreign output which would affect domestic aggregate demand much like the

 aggregate demand disturbance to be discussed below.

         9When the terms of trade can change, real income is not equivalent to
                                                      the objective function in terms
 real output. We might alternatively specify

 of real income, Y ÷         —       The criterion would be expressed in terms of

 the deviation of actual real income from real income in an economy without

 contract lags as follows:


                         =
                             E[((Y   ÷     I) (Y +              —



                             = E[((Y     Y*)   ÷   (1a)(T
                                                            -   T*)2]

 This expression, however, can be simplified so that only output appears in the
                                                       25

 loss function. (Flood and Marion (1982) make a similar point). If we take

 the aggregate demand function (2) and
                                                       subtract its (starred) equivalent in the
 frictionless economy for the case where all foreign variables are constant, we

 obtain:

                                  y          = —(g     ÷ g a)(T — T*)
                                   t     t         p      r   t    t
 The objective then simplifies to


                                             = E{K2(Y —
                                                     t        t
where K =
                (g +      ga —
                                 (1-a))/(g    ÷   ga).      All of the results in the text for

real output carry through for real income except in the special case where
                —
                                                                                                  g
+ ga =     1        a.    In that case, real income is always identical in the economies

with and without contract lags, with the deviation In output exactly

offsetting the deviation in the terms of trade.

        10When labor supply is infinitely elastic, output in the frictionless

economy changes by


            —   V=       c(1—a) udi(g + ga ÷ c(1—a)) =               —




since   c1 = c(1—a) in that case.

        "To choose between the two forms of indexation, we compare the change in

output in each indexation scheme relative to                      — Y.   Output variation under
domestic price indexation is closer to                 Y —Y    if and only if

Note that this expression is positive when labor supply is inelastic (n =
                                                                                             0),
but negative when labor supply is infinitely elastic (n =                    ). An   example of
an intermediate case is as follows: Suppose that the
                                                                         elasticity of aggregate
demand with respect to the terms of trade exceeds a critical value less than

one, g > 1 — a —    ga,       a condition discussed below in connection with

productivity disturbances; the expression must be positive (i.e., domestic

price indexation is preferred) if the labor supply elasticity is less than or

equal to one, n1.

        12Note that b =   1   if a =   1   as in a closed economy. We assume that the

denominator in the expression above is positive which is the case even for

n = 0 (i.e. so that c1 = 0) as long as k2(1—a) > k1a.
        13These expressions are derived by substituting (8)* in (id) and (le).

        14This is the same condition encountered earlier in the discussion of

real income. Unless ga > 1 — a, the condition is somewhat more stringent

than the Marshall—Lerfler condition which implies only that g > 0. The
                                              the domestic currency occurs with a low
possibility of an appreciation of

price elasticity because the domestic price may
                                                             then   increase enough to raise

 the transactions demand for money.

        5One exception arises when the labor supply curve is infinitely elastic

 (n =   ). The    real wage of labor in the frictionlesS economy then remains

                                                  indexation leads to the same variation
 constant (see le'), so consumer price

 of output as in the frictionleSS economy.

         The model of the foreign country parallels that of the domestic country

    except that there is only one good Involved. Aggregate
                                                                      supply, therefore, is
    a function of the price of that good alone; output responds to unanticipated

    changes in that price if there is Incomplete indexation (or bt less than

    one). Note that for simplicity the money demand function Is assumed to have

    the same Income and Interest rate elasticities as the domestic country.

         If there is a monetary disturbance (u > 0), full indexation (b =
                                                                          1) is
    optimal since It can shield output fully from this disturbance.           With full

    indexation, the foreign price rises and the foreign interest rate falls in

proportion to the disturbance as follows:


                            —       = u'/(1   + k1) =
