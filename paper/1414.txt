         Empirical Tests of Alternative Models of International Growth

                                     ABSTRACT


          Recent changes in patterns of international trade and growth have
rekindled interest in the relationships among trade, growth, and the inter-
national distribution of income. Three alternative models can serve as a
theoretical foundation for an empirical analysis of these relationships. The
first is the standard Heckscher—Ohlin—Samuelson (Ho) trade model with equal
numbers of factors and   goods   and incomplete specialization. The second
model allows complete specialization and more goods than factors. The third
model posits short run capital immobility. Each of these models has quite
different implications for the determination of wage levels and growth

rates.

          The conclusions that we draw from this research are rather mixed.

Each of the models perform well on certain criteria and poorly on others.

While the standard HO model clearly fails to satisfy certain cross—equation

constraints, national endowments are remarkably good predictors of the locus

of international production. There are, however, significant nonlinearities

in the relationship between factor allocations and national endowments. Such

nonlinearities are predicted by the uneven version of the HO model. At odds

with both of these models is our finding that lagged values of inputs provide

an important explanation of current factor demands. Such correlations are

suggested by the adjustment cost model.

I. Introduction

               Recent changes in patterns of international trade and growth have

rekindled interest in the relationships among trade, growth, and the inter-

national distribution of income. Three alternative xa'dels can serve as a

theoretical foundation for an empirical analysis of these relationships. The

first is the standard Heckscher—Ohlin_Samuelson (Ho)      trade   ImDdel with equal

numbers   of   factors and goods and incomplete specialization. The second

model allows complete specialization and sore goods than factors. The third

model posits short run capital immobility. Each of these models has quite

different implications for the determination of wage levels and growth

rates.

           The traditional even (nxn) HO model with incomplete specialization

predicts instantaneous factor price equalization and equivalent growth rates

of wages across countries. In contrast, altering the standard HO model to

permit specialization of production potentially eliminates factor price

equalization and allows growth rates of wages to differ, both in the short

and the long run. The third model, which assumes short      run costs to
                                          —2—


adjusting capital intensity, predicts short run differences in the levels and

growth   rates of factor returns, but     long run equalization    of these

variables.

             Because these three models can      have   very different policy con-

sequences,    it is important to   make   an   attempt to determine which   is the most
accurate approximation of the real world. Unfortunately, many observations
can be rationalized within the context of any one of these models, and it is
therefore difficult to determine which is the most accurate. Take, for
example, the data reported in Table 1 that show vast international differen-
ces in   wages. If the even HO model is taken as the maintained hypothesis, then

these    data iaist be   regarded to be wages averaged across skill groups. Wages

within a given skill group are regarded to be the same in every country, and a
country that has a relatively low reported wage is interpreted only to have a
relatively large supply of low skilled workers. As a matter of fact, Krueger
(1968) shows that a surprisingly large amount of the differences in gross wage
rates can be accounted for by a bit of disaggregation.
          On the other hand, If the uneven HO model is taken as a guide, the
wage differences in Table 1 are suggestive of countries with factor endowment
vectors sufficiently different that they fall in different cones of speciali-
 zation;   in this case the increasing similarity of wages over time is regarded

 as evidence either of increasing similarity of factor endowments or as evidence

 of the blurring of the differences among the specialization cones associated,

 for example, with product price changes. These wage data can also be rationa-

 lized within the context of the third model ——the even HO model with adjustment

costs.   Here the differences in wages   are   attributed to differences in initial

conditions; and   the   tendency of wages to equalize over time   is   thought to be a

consequence of increased domestic factor mobility over time.

           Although the wage data can be rationalized within the framework        of
any one of these models, each model has very different implications con-

cerning policies to raise wages in low wage countries. In the even HO model

the route to increased wages is increased training or, more generally,

increased human capital. Physical capital deepening can have no effect on

wages of a specific skill group because the accumulation of physical capital

leads only to an adjustment of the output mix and no change in capital

per man within a given industry. For the uneven model, on the other hand,

accumulation of physical capital can move a country from one cone of spe-

cialization to another, and can raise wages paid to each of the skill groups.

Policies to promote wage increases Implied by the third model (the even model

with   adjustment costs) aim at reducing the effective adjustment costs including

policies that alter the path of net foreign Investment.

           The paper proceeds in the next three sections by briefly describing

each of the models, pointing out In the process their different testable

implications. Section IV describes the data used to test the three models

and some of its main features. Section V presents regressions of value

added, factor demands, and factor returns on country specific as well as

industry specific inputs. These regressions permit more formal tests of the

three models. The final section summarizes the findings and suggests addi-

tional areas of research.

            The conclusions that we draw from this research are rather mixed.
Each   of the models perform well on certain criteria and poorly on others.
While the standard HO model       clearly fails to satisfy certain cross—equation

constraints,     national endowments are remarkedly good predictors of the locuB
of international production. There are, however, significant nonhinearities
in the relationship between factor allocations and national endowments. Such
nonhinearities    are predicted by the    uneven version of   the   HO model. At odds
with   both of these models is our finding that lagged values of inputs provide

an important explanation of current factor demands. Such correlations are

suggested by the adjustment cost model.

           The inability to clearly discriminate among the three models leaves

open the issue of long as well as short run wage equalization. The partial

support for each of the models offered here suggests that an uneven HO model

with adjustment costs provides a better basis for discussing international

trade than any of the three models on their own.


II. The Even Heckscher—Ohlin—Samuelson General Equilibrium Model

           The traditional general equilibrium theory of production describes

a country- with a fixed endowment of a set of resources, facing commodity

prices that are completely determined in international markets. Competition

for scarce resources determines their allocation among industries and their

rates of remuneration. The notation which we will use to describe this model

is the following:

           X =   vector   of outputs of in commodities

           V =   vector   of endowments of n resources
                                        —5—




         p   =   vector   of prices of m commodities

             =   vector   of factor rents of n resources

         A = 11 x n mtrix of factor input coefficients with elements equal

                   to the amount of factor k used to produce one unit of com-

                   modity j

         The factor input nmtrix, the vector of outputs, and        the   vector of

endowments necessarily satisfy the relationship

         AX=V.                                                                   (1)


With a suitable list of assumptions, including identical linear homogeneous

production functions for all countries, equal numbers of commodities and

resources, and incomplete specialization, it can be shown that the mtrix A

is the same for all countries, and in particular is independent of V. Under

these conditions (1) umy be inverted to obtain

          X = A1V                                                                (2)


which expresses outputs as linear functions of the endowments, with X and V

varying among countries, but A'1 constant.

          Equation (2) which flEPS factor endowments into commodities pro-

duced, also implicitly allocates the factors among the industries. The

amount of factor k used to produce            of commodity j is      where Aki

                                                              the allocation of fac-
the (k, j) element of the input—output nmtrix. Thus,
                                                       to output and can be described
tor k to a particular industry is proportional

by an equation which is linear in the factor endowments V. This equation can

be estimated by regressing factor allocation

To clarify this regression model, consider the system for the simple case of
                                                 —6—



two factor8, labor, L, and         capital,      K:


                     L            K
             X1 aL+aK1
             L1 =

                 =
                          X   =



                              =       a L+
                                          a L+          ja  aKjKi                             (3)




                                                               K

where   a   arid a are elements of                    and i denotes the country. Because of the

constancy across countries of output per n, X/L1 and capital per n,

            in industry j, these three equations are proportional to each other.

Linearity and proportionality are two strong implications of the even HO

model. In addition, the assumption of costless interindustry factor mobility

rules out any- influence of past history-. However, higher order functions of

national endowments, lagged values of national endowments, and lagged values

of factor allocations do influence current factor allocations in the uneven

HO model and   the   adjustment cost model in ways               described below.
            The factor demand system         (3)      can be transformed into a factor
expenditure system by m.iltlplying          each factor demand by its rental rate.

Multiplying   the L1 equation by the wage, w, and the                      equation by   the rental
rate,   r, on capital gives:

The equations in 4) and (5) indicate that factor payments as well as value

added are each linear functions of national endowments. In addition, each of

the 6 equations in (3), (14), and (5) Is proportional to the others.

              EstimatiOn of the factor payments and value added relations may be

less subject to bias from measurement error than estimation of factor

demands. Consider, for example, labor effort, which is ideally measured as

total effective hours worked, but in our data is proxied by total employment.

Assume that effective hours worked, Lij and employment, Lij differ by a

country specific factor A1, i.e., L1 =       A   L1 and Li            L. The term A1

may reflect cross country differences in hours worked per employee, the

intensity of work effort, or the effectiveness of work effort due to training

 and ability. It is likely that         and A1 are positively correlated because

 larger countries, with several notable exceptions, have higher per capita

 to work. In addition, wL1 in (14) can be replaced by E. total national labor

 earnings, thus eliminating the problem of Inismeasuring total national labor

 input. A straightforward test of the constant proportionality properties of

this model that do not involve iasurement of the labor input is to determine

whether the ratios
                     Eij/Kj E/R1 and Eu/Vu are roughly- constant across
all countries i. This is equivalent to asking whether profit rates and

factor shares are equal across industry.


III. The Uneven Heckscher—Ohlin General Equilibrium Model

          The simplest uneven model has xrany     goods and two factors. A
possible equilibrium of such a model has countries with sufficiently dif-

ferent factor supplies producing different subsets of the commodities and

having different factor returns. Roughly speaking, the relatively capital

abundant countries produce the relatively capital intensive commodities and

have the higher wage rates and the lower returns to capital. This is

illustrated in Figure 1 where the first panel contains the unit value iso—

quants and expansion paths of three commodities: automobiles, textiles, and

clothing. The second panel illustrates the levels of factor returns as a

function of capital per rrmn, and the third panel contains the corresponding

outputs per man.

          In the first panel, there are two unit isocost lines, each of which

 is   consistent with the production of two of the three commodities.        The

 hypothetical endowments of three countries are also indicated in this figure.

 The United States, which is capital abundant, has   high   wage   rates   and produ-
 ces the two capital intensive products —    autos and textiles. Japan, which
 is less well endowed in capital relative to labor has lower wage rates and

 produces the two less capital intensive products —   textiles      and   clothing.
Korea, which is still less well endowed in capital, specializes in the least

 capital intensive product (clothing) and has the very- lowest wages. Note

that although both the U.S. and Japan are producing textiles, the U.S. uses

the more capital intensive technique.

            This figure provides a stylized picture of the situation in the

1950s and early 1960s. Figure 2 then represents the current situation          arid

differs from Figure 1 in two ways. First, both Japan and Korea have accumu-

lated capital at a more rapid rate than the United States.         Japan has moved
into the same cone as the United States. Korea has moved into the cone where

both textiles and clothing are produced. The other change that is evident in

Figure 2 is that the spread in wages between the two cones of diversification

is less than in Figure 1. What accounts for this change is the shifts in the

world supply curves induced by- the rapid accumulation of capital in Japan and

Korea, and the consequent change in the relative prices of the three goods.

In Figure 2 it is assumed that the relative supply of textiles increased and

clothing decreased, and, consequently, the price of textiles fell, and the

price of clothing rose. This change is depicted in Figure 2 by a shift out-

ward of the textile unit value isoquant and a shift inward of the clothing

 unit value    isoquant. This shift is accompanied by (1) a reduction in the
 wage in the U.s.,    (2)   a shift toward more labor intensive techniques in the

U.S.   and a   reduction in labor productivity, (3)   an   increase in the Korean

wage   rate, and (1) a shift toward more capital—intensive techniques in Korea
Ond an attendant increase in labor productivity.
          Worldwide accumulation of capital has generally the same effect in
the even and the uneven model. Namely, supply curves of the relatively capi-
tal intensive commodities shift outward and, as is         indicated by- the

Rybczynski     theorem, supply curves of the labor intensive commodities shift

inward. This will lead to a fall in the relative price of capital intensive

products and a general rise in wage rates. In the uneven model, however,

wage rates of the most capital abundant countries will         fall   if the supply
curves   of the most capital intensive products shift outward less than the

next most capital intensive products. In terms of our stylized diagrams,

this occurs if the supply of textiles increases more rapidly than the supply

of automobiles.

           Evidence in support of the uneven model would be wage, employment,

or output data that conformed in a general sense to the second two panels of

Figure 1. Namely, wages depend on national endowments, and industry output and

employment are nonlinear functions of the national endowments. Since the out-

put and employment functions are linear within cones of diversification a

theoretically appealing data analysis would estimate linear models based on

different subsets of the countries, possibly selected on the basis          of   sirni—

larity in factor returns.
                                       —11—


           A word of caution is in order here about aggregation effects.

First it ny appear that wage rates increase with capital abundance only

because   earnings include a return to hun.n capital which naturally increases

along with   physical   capital. On the other band,   the   output and employment

function nay exhibit no clear nonlinearities because commodities with very

dissimilar factor requirements are combined in a single aggregate. The tex-

tiles aggregate, for example, include both capital and labor intensive pro-

ducts. Countries that are capital scarce produce the labor intensive

textiles and countries that are capital abundant produce the capital inten-

sive textiles. As a result, there is relatively little variation in output

of textiles overall associated with capital accumulation.


IV. A Generlized Heckscher-Ohlin Model of Economic Growth         with Adjustment

     Costs
             The key feature that differentiates the adjustment cost model

described here from the standard Heckscher—Ohlifl model of international trade

is the assumption that firms Incur costs for altering their level of capital

in any finite period of time. The adjustment cost techriolor we consider

expresses adjustment costs as an increasing function of the rate of invest-

ment (or disinvestment). Since the rate of investment depends on both the

 absolute level of the firm's (industry's) existing capital stock as well as

 the absolute level of new investment, a firm's Investment decision today will

 affect its capital stock tomorrow and, therefore, its nrginal        adjustment
 costs tomorrow. This formulation of the problem links the production and

 investment decisions of the firm at one point in      time   to these decisions at
                                      —12—


  other points in time. Rather than equate the nrginal product of capital to

 a common rental rate, as in the standard static
                                                    trade model, firms in this
 environment alter their capital stocks over time to nximize the present

 value of profits where profits are net of adjustment costs. The relative

 immobility of physical capital does riot preclude perfect national and inter-

 national mobility of financial capital. In addition, the standard trade

 theory assumption of costless domestic,
                                           interindustry labor mobility is nin—
 tamed.

           The assumption that altering levels of industry—specific capital is

 costly in the short run has several important
                                                  implications. First, wage
 rates will differ across countries in the short run despite the fact that

countries have identical technologies, are
                                              incompletely specialized in pro-
duction, and financial capital is internationally mobile.     The world relative
price of the two commodities is not sufficient here to determine wage rates.

In the short run marginal revenue products of labor are equated across

domestic industries, but marginal revenue products of capital are not. It is

the satisfaction of both of these sets of
                                             Conditions plus the assumption of
identical constant returns to scale technologies that leads to factor price

equalization. However, both conditions are satisfied in the long run when

the economy has Converged to a steady state
                                              characterized by- incomplete spe-
cialization. Hence, if the economy converges to such a steady state, wage

rates across different countries must converge as well.

          A second feature of this model is that positive investment iray take

place even in those industries exhibiting low
                                                 marginal revenue products of
                                         —13—


                                         concentrating substantial levels of new
capital. The reason is simply that

investment in any given industry or set of industries within any year entails
                                                    unprofitable relative to
increasing adjustment costs; this will prove

investing in low marginal revenue product, but low marginal adjustment cost

industries.

           Even if disinvestment occurs, the rate of disinvestment will be
                                            of increasing costs to that activity.

A consequence of this is that specialization

firms maximize the present value of profits.          In country i, industry j, pro-

 in 1963 using the perpetual inventory method (e.g., Learner (19814)). Missing

 intermediate investment data were imputed with straight line interpolation

 methods. As a consequence of these imputation schemes, we are not altogether

 comfortable with the econometric analysis that follows, since it

 inappropriately ignores the possibility of gross or chronic measurement

 errors in the data.

             Features of our data set are reported in Tables 2, 3, 14, and 5.

The first four columns of Table 2 contain the total number of workers in each

of the industries in each of the years, and the share of these industries'

workers In the total world 'work force included in our data. Over this period

of time there was a fifteen percent increase in employment in these

industries, but the composition of world employment across industries did not

change such. The one n.jor exception to this statement is that employment In

textiles dropped substantially, both as a share of total employment and in

absolute numbers. Iron and steel experienced less extreme employment decli-

nes. On the other side of the ledger, plastics had very substantial growth,

as   did nEchinery.
            The last   six columns of Table 2 contain the shares of the

industrial employment located in each of the three regions: the U.S., other

developed countries, and the rest of the world. The list of other
                                                                       developed
countries includes the eleven countries with the highest overall capital per

man, as measured in    our   resource data set. Generally speaking, the large
changes   in the distribution of employment across these regions   involve shifts
in   favor of the "rest of the world" and to some extent to the U.S.   at   the

        The "World" refers to these twenty—seven countries plus the U.S.

                                                       There were very substantial
  increases in the employment share of the "rest of the world" in tobacco, and

 the more labor intensive products:
                                       textiles, apparel, and footwear. The U.S.
 share generally- fell for these
                                   industries, though textiles is an interesting
 exception.

             As indicated in Table 3 the industrial distribution of world labor

 earnings also remained remarkably- constant
                                               over the 15 year period 1963 through
 1978. Though the U.S. share of total
                                         employment rose roughly from .25 to .29
 (Table 2), the U.S. share of
                                total earnings fell substantially from .60 to .141.
 In fact, the U.S. share of total world
                                        industrial earnings has fallen in every
 industry which reflects the faster growth rate of wages over
                                                              the 15 year period
in the rest of the world relative to
                                        the U.S. Developed countries other than
the U.S. account for most of the gain in the non—U.S. world earnings share

despite their decline in employment shares documented in Table 2. These data

thus conform to the data in Table 1 in the sense of revealing much faster
                                                                          wage
growth rate in these countries relative to the U.S. and less developed

countries.

          The data in Table 14 indicate little change over time in the

industrial composition of world output just as the previous tables reveal

slight changes in employment and earnings. In food, textiles, and apparel

there is more than a 1 percentage point drop over the 114 year period in the

share of world output. Industries whose output share rose by over 1 percentage

point are industrial chemicals, petroleum
                                            refining, plastics, and machinery.

         The capital data summarized in Table    5   indicate   that there are great

  differences in the capital intensity of production in the three regions data,

 both overall and at the industry level.
                                               These suggest that in a few industries
 current U.S. production techniques
                                      nay be less capital intensive than those in
 the other developed countries (tobacco,
                                            furniture, petroleum refining, petro-
 leum and coal production, non—metal
                                       manufactured products, and iron and steel).
 While the high rates of investment in many- of the countries in the developed

 country- aggregate is well documented, it is
                                                  surprising that the U.S. advan-

 tage in capital per worker may have been eroded in many industries as early-

 as 1978. There are, on the other hand, 12 industries out of the 28 for which

measured 1978 U.s. capital intensity is sore than one third larger than that

in the other developed industries. These
                                               industries are food, textiles,
wood, printing, industrial chemicals, other chemicals, rubber products,

plastics, metal products, machinery, professional goods, and other

industries. These capital intensity figures niist be viewed with great skep-

ticism because of the unknown quality of the
                                                  available investment data and its

intermittent nature, and also because of the capital depreciation method which

is used. In particular: (1) investment occuring before 1963 does not contri-

bute to the measured 1978 capital
                                    stock, (2) the depreciation rate is taken to
be the same in all countries, (3) nominal
                                               exchange rates are used to convert

foreign investment expenditures into dollar units.

          With these caveats in mind it is interesting to note that the

measured share of output in the U.S. (Table 14) exceeds the measured share of

both capital and labor. One may suspect that the proper inclusion of pre—1963

investment would raise the U.S. share considerably.

            The sixnhlaritiea in relative capital intensities by- industry   among
the three country- groups is ren.rkably high, particularly given the great dif-
ferences in these numbers across country groups. For each region, petroleum
refining,   beverages, petroleum and   coal   products, and industrial chemicals rank

among the top industries in terms of capital intensity. The       correlation coef-
ficients between   industrial capital intensities are .89 for the U.S. and the

other developed countries, .96 for the U.S. and the less developed countries,

and .8T for the other developed and the less developed countries. There are

also several anamolies. Tobacco has a quite high ratio of capital to labor in

the U.S. and a quite low ratio in the less developed country group. A second

example is the apparel industry; while the U.S. capital labor ratio is 2.6

times that of the less developed countries, it is only .2 times greater in

apparel.

            Assuming Table 5's capital intensity figures are fairly accurate

measures, the table provides strong evidence against the even HO model. The

similarity in relative capital intensities across industries suggests,

however, that systematic measurement error, in particular in the measurement

of human capital, could account for much of the disparity between the

services. Similar evidence casting doubt on the even HO model appears

in Table 6, which presents correlation coefficients between each country's

capital per worker and its industry—specific capital per man, value added per

man, and earnings per man. While the even HO model predicts zero correlation

coefficients between these variables, 15 of the 8 coefficients exceed .5 and

33 exceed .8.

VI. Regression Analysis

         Table 7 reports industry—specific cross country results using 1978

data for four of the equations described in (3), (1) and (5). The four
dependent variables are the industrial employment of capital and labor, factor

payments to labor, and output. The explanatory variables are country

endowments of capital, high, medium, and low skilled labor (Labor 1, Labor 2,

and Labor 3, respectively), and land. Learner (1983) describes the construc—

tion of these variables. National endowments are strikingly sIgnificant

explanatory variables in each of the four regressions for each of the 28

industries. All but 2 of the 112 R2 equal or exceed .8; 8r equal or exceed

.95. The large R2s may, however, simply reflect scale effects. Table 8 pre-

sents these R2s as well as R2s adjusted for scale effects. The adjusted B2

computed here are one minus the ratio of the error sum of squares of the

Table 7 regression to the error sum of squares resulting from regressions

including only national capital endowment as an explanatory variable. Hence

the adjusted R2s represent the fraction of the variance of the dependent

variable explained by national endowments after controlling for scale

effects. These scale adjusted R2s are also quite large; 81 of these 112 R2s

equal or exceed .5, and 9l exceed .li.

          The coefficients in the rows labelled Capital, Labor 1, Labor 2,

Labor 3, and Land indicate the impact on the various depend variables of

raising these national endowments by specific amounts. As described above the

even HO nde1 predicts that the coefficients of each of the four regressions

of Table 7 have the same sign. In addition the ratio of any two coefficients

 in any of the four industry regressions should equal the ratios of the

 corresponding coefficients of the same exogenous variables in each of the

 other three industry regressions. These predictions of the even HO ndel are

 sustained by many of the findings in Table 7.   Consider, for example, the 28
 pairs of capital and labor demand regressions. Of the l1O (28 x 5) pairs of

 coefficients, only 2 pairs are opposite in sign, and only i1 of these pairs

of coefficients that violate the prediction about equal sign have corres-

ponding pairs of t values that are each greater than one in absolute value.

In addition there are seven industries, non—ferrous
                                                      metals, food, beverages,
tobacco, apparel, leather, and other chemicals in which each of the pairs of

capital and labor coefficients agree in sign. Note that the probability of 5

equal sign coefficient pairs is 1/32 assuming an equal independent probabi-

lity of each coefficient being positive or negative. In this case, the

expected number of regressions with identical coefficient pairs in 28 trials

is .875, well below the 7 actually observed.

          The regressions of factor payments and   output   are potentially less

plagued by systematic measurement error. Of the ])O pairs of coefficients in

these two regressions only 25 exhibit opposite signs, and only 13 of these

coefficient pairs have t values greater than one. 13 of the 28 pairs of ear—

flings and output regressions have pairs of coefficients each of which agree in

sign.

          As indicated, tests of proportionality of the four regressions    may-

fail due to mismeasurernent of both the endogenous and right hand side

variables. The nature of this mismeasure is, however, likely to be roughly

 constant in   the   two sets of   results;   the method of estimating industry--.
 specific capital    stocks as well as national endowments is quite similar for

 the two periods. As a consequence, differences in estimated coefficients

 across the two periods may provide more reliable evidence of changes in

 underlying production technologies and/or world relative commodity prices,

 either of which would alter the coefficients in
                                                         (3), (14) or (5). Table 9

 presents labor input and earnings regressions using 1963 data.           A comparison
of the estimated coefficients of this table with those for the corresponding

1918 regressions suggests substantial changes in technologies or relative

prices across the two periods.

          While the regression findings of Tables 7 through 9 are broadly

supportive of the even HO model, tests to distinguish between the even and

uneven HO model provide strong support for the uneven version. The uneven HO

model suggests factor price equalization among countries with similar rela—

tive factor endowments. This implies that subgroups of countries with simi-

lar relative endowments will satisfy equation (3), (iL), and (5) for a given

set of coefficients. As one shifts from one subgroup to another, however,

the predicted coefficients will change.

          Table 10 reports tests of structural differences in coefficients in

the factor demands, output, and earnings regressions, where the sample of

countries was split between the 15 countries with the largest and the 12 with

the smallest 1918 capital—labor ratios. The table provides both F statistics

testing for structural differences as well as the posterior probabilities of

structural breaks. The posterior probability is calculated using a prior

 50 percent chance that there is a structural break (see Learner (19T8),

 chapter Ii). The posterior probability is computed as 6/1—6, where 6 Is given

 and T is the number of observations, K Is the number of parameter restric-

 tions, ESS   is    the- error sum of squares in the
                                                       regression including the entire
 sample, and ESSD and ESSU are the respective error sums of squares from the

separate regressions for the high and low

Holding the sample size and parameter restrictions
                                                           constant, the posterior
probability of structural differences is an increasing function of the calcu-

lated F statistic.

          The critical F value at the 95       percent   confidence level is 2.T1.
Virtually all of the F statistics in Table 10 exceed this critical value;

many exceed 15. The corresponding posterior probabilities
                                                                   of structural dif-
ferences are also very large. Over three quarters of these 112 probabilities

are essentially unity. With the exception of the wood industry, there is a

strong rejection of the structural equivalence of the two samples for at

least one of the four dependent variables.
                                                   The equally strong rejection of'
structural sixn±larities in the case of the earnings and labor input

regressions indicates that these tests are probably picking up more than dif-

ferential measurement error.

         The fact that significant structural differences are found for vir—
tually each industry suggests that    dividing   the sample based  capital per
                                                                    on

                                                     countries lying in different
cones    of diversification. However, since there are 5 factors in our data Bet

rather than 2, there is no theoretical rationale to split the sample on the

basis of capital divided by the sum of the three types of workers. In a

multi—factor setting there appear to be no simple rules for segmenting the

sample. In the absence of a theoretical guide to splitting the sample, we

also tested for structural differences across countries by including higher

order terms in the regressions. More precisely, we added the squares of the

country's endowments as well as the cross products of the country's capital

and each of its three types of labor. Table 11 presents tests of the signi-
                                            Like Table 10, the F values as well
ficance of these additional variables.

as the posterior probabilities that the regression properly includes these

higher order terms are typically quite large.       They also constitute fairly

strong rejection of the linearity prediction of the even HO model.

             Additional regression results are presented in Table 12 that also
                                                 consistent with both the uneven HO

and the adjustment cost models. The dependent variable here is earnings

 per worker in a particular industry and country. According to the even

 model, earnings per worker in an industry should be unrelated to a country's

 endowment of capital per worker. In addition, given domestic labor mobility,

 an assumption of all three models, industrial wages should be unrelated to

 the capital in place in the particular industry.

              The t values in column two of Table 12 quickly dismiss the notion

of   cross country wage eq.ualizatiOfl

error in measuring labor input, such error apparently goes beyond industry—

specific differences in skills.      While high capital—labor ratio countries

have higher within—industry earnings per worker, the particular amount of

capital in place in the industry typically has a negligible effect on this
variable. Only 5 of 28 industry—specific capital coefficients are signifi-
cant explanatory variables in Table 12. The evidence here is broadly suppor-
tive   of the domestic labor mobility assumption.

            Tables 13 and l4 provide two different tests of the adjustment cost
                                                                    of

adjustment costs implies that lagged

significantly correlated with current input demand. To test this we added

the industry's 1963 labor input to the list of country endowments in cross—
                                     1978 labor demand. We also included 1963
industry regressions explaining
                                 1978 output on national endowments. Lagged

 lagged output has a generally
                                                with capital, which is the opposite
 that labor is rather inmobile compared

 mobility assumption that we have made so far.
