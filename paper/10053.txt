                                           ABSTRACT

       We examine the effects of total suspended particulates (TSPs) air pollution on infant health
using the air quality improvements induced by the 1970 Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA). This
legislation imposed strict regulations on industrial polluters in “nonattainment” counties with TSPs
concentrations exceeding the federal ceiling. We use nonattainment status as an instrumental
variable for TSPs changes to estimate their impact on infant mortality changes in the first year that
the 1970 CAAA was in force.

       TSPs nonattainment status is associated with sharp reductions in both TSPs pollution and
infant mortality from 1971 to 1972. The greater reductions in nonattainment counties near the
federal ceiling relative to the “attainment” counties narrowly below the ceiling suggest that the
regulations are the cause. We estimate that a one percent decline in TSPs results in a 0.5 percent
decline in the infant mortality rate. Most of these effects are driven by a reduction in deaths
occurring within one month of birth, suggesting that fetal exposure is a potential biological pathway.
The results imply that roughly 1,300 fewer infants died in 1972 than would have in the absence of
the Clean Air Act.

                                                   Introduction

         The 1970 passage of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) and the establishment of the

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) marked an unprecedented attempt by the U.S. government to

mandate lower levels of air pollution. The stated goal of these efforts was to achieve air quality standards

that “protect the public health.” In the case of total suspended particulates (TSPs), widely thought to be

the most pernicious form of air pollution, the EPA set maximum allowable concentrations that every

county was required to meet. 1 This study uses the reductions in TSPs concentrations induced by the 1970

CAAA to estimate the effects of TSPs on infant mortality.

         Figure 1 shows trends in average TSPs pollution and infant mortality rates for the entire United

States from 1970-1990.2 It is apparent that air quality improved dramatically in the 1970s and 1980s,

with particulate concentrations falling from an average of 95 micrograms-per-cubic meter (µg/m3) to

about 60 µg/m3. Almost all of the reduction occurred in two punctuated periods, 1971-1973 and 1980-

1982. The figure also shows the large decline in the infant mortality rate over the entire period. Although

both TSPs pollution and infant mortality rates trended downward, their time-series correspondence does

not provide conclusive evidence of a causal relationship. First, the punctuated declines in TSPs are not

mirrored in the infant mortality rate series. Further, other potential determinants of infant mortality (e.g.,

social insurance programs, medical technology) were also changing during this period.

         Chay and Greenstone (2003) establish that most of the 1980-82 decline in TSPs was attributable

to the differential impacts of the 1981-82 recession across counties. The study uses the substantial

differences in air pollution reductions across sites to estimate the impact of TSPs on infant mortality. We

find that a one percent reduction in TSPs results in a 0.35 percent decline in the infant mortality rate at the

county level. Most of these effects are driven by a decline in deaths occurring within one month of birth,



1
  In this period, the EPA defined TSPs to include all particles with diameters less than or equal to 100 micrometers
(µm). The focus of federal regulation shifted to particulates with diameters less than or equal to 10 µm (PM10) and
2.5 µm (PM2.5) in 1987 and 1997, respectively.
2
  The TSPs pollution series is based on averages across the 1,000-1,300 counties a year with TSPs monitors, while
infant mortality rates are derived from the entire U.S. and are for all causes of death. The counties with TSPs data
account for upwards of 80% of the U.S. population. Unless otherwise noted, infant mortality refers to death within
the first year after birth.
suggesting that fetal exposure during pregnancy is a potential pathophysiologic mechanism. Overall, the

estimates imply that about 2,500 fewer infants died from 1980-82 than would have in the absence of the

dramatic reductions in particulates pollution.

        In view of the significance of a potential causal link between TSPs pollution and infant mortality,

we believe it is important to validate the results from our analysis of the early 1980s. In this paper, we

examine data on infant mortality and air pollution from the other major episode of substantial changes in

TSPs levels in the early 1970s. We begin by demonstrating that these changes are largely attributable to

the 1970 CAAA. This legislation divided all U.S. counties into TSPs nonattainment and attainment

categories based on whether their ambient TSPs concentrations were above or below the legislated

maximum. Industrial emitters of TSPs were subject to significantly stricter regulations in nonattainment

counties than in attainment ones. We find that the entire decline in TSPs during the early 1970s occurred

in nonattainment counties and that two-thirds of the 1971-1974 decline in these counties occurred

between 1971 and 1972, the first year that the 1970 CAAA was in force. Consequently, this study uses

nonattainment status as an instrumental variable for 1971-1972 changes in TSPs to estimate their impact

on changes in infant mortality.

        This research design has several attractive features. First, it is plausible that federally-mandated

regulatory pressure is orthogonal to county-level changes in infant mortality rates, except through its

impact on air pollution – thus, nonattainment status may be a valid instrument. Second, nonattainment

status is a discrete function of the previous year’s TSPs levels. This discontinuity in the assignment of

regulations can be used to gauge the credibility of the research design. Third, our analysis provides direct

and easily interpreted estimates of the air quality and health benefits of the 1970 Act – benefits that can be

compared with the costs to industry of complying with the regulations.

        Finally, this study provides a unique opportunity to cross-validate the results from our earlier

work by examining a different design applied to a different era. In contrast to the recession-driven TSPs

reductions of the early 1980s, we use regulation-induced changes that occurred during an economic

expansion (1971-1972). Thus, any potential biases due to economic shocks are likely to be mitigated.

Also, particulates pollution levels were much higher in the early 1970s than in the early 1980s. As a

                                                      2
result, we can examine a different range of the pollution-infant mortality function and analyze the health

benefits at the federally mandated concentration ceiling.

        We implement the design using the most detailed and comprehensive data available on infant

births, deaths, and TSPs levels for the 1969-1974 period. We find that the federally imposed county-level

regulations are associated with large reductions in both the TSPs pollution levels and infant mortality

rates of nonattainment counties. We estimate that a one percent reduction in TSPs results in a 0.5 percent

decline in the infant mortality rate at the county level. As in our earlier study, most of these effects are

driven by a reduction in the number of deaths occurring within one month of birth, suggesting that fetal

exposure is a potential biological pathway.

        Our attempts to probe the robustness of these conclusions suggest that the instrumental variables

estimates of the effect of TSPs pollution on infant mortality are far less sensitive to specification than

conventional cross-sectional and fixed effects estimates. Further, the timing and location of the TSPs and

infant mortality improvements correspond remarkably well. As a test of internal validity, we find that the

regulation-induced TSPs reductions are uncorrelated with infant deaths due to accidents and homicides.

Finally, nonattainment and attainment counties near the federal ceiling exhibit discrete differences in

TSPs and infant mortality changes, but do not exhibit differences in other observable characteristics. This

provides our most convincing evidence that the regulations are causally related to declines in both TSPs

and infant death.

        Overall, our findings support the conclusions that air pollution has a causal effect on infant

mortality and that the 1970 CAAA provided significant health benefits by reducing TSPs concentrations.

The estimates imply that roughly 1,300 fewer infants died in 1972 than would have in the absence of the

Clean Air Act. Also, the results correspond well with the findings in Chay and Greenstone (2003).

        The paper proceeds as follows. Section I provides background on the 1970 Clean Air Act.

Sections II and III discuss the research design and the econometric methods used to implement this

design. Section IV summarizes the data, and Section V presents the empirical findings. Section VI

provides estimates of the economic benefits of the Clean Air Act regulations, and Section VII concludes.

                         I. Background on the 1970 Clean Air Act Amendments

         Before 1970 the federal government did not play a significant role in the regulation of air

pollution, a responsibility left primarily to state governments.3 In the absence of federal legislation, few

states acted to impose strict regulations on polluters within their jurisdictions. Concerned with the

detrimental health effects of persistently high concentrations of suspended particulates pollution, and of

other air pollutants, Congress passed the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970.

         The centerpiece of the 1970 CAAA was the establishment of separate federal standards, known as

the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS), for six pollutants. The CAAA’s goal was to

reduce local air pollution concentrations so that all U.S. counties would be in compliance with the

NAAQS by 1975 (with the possibility of an extension to 1977). The first step in this process was the

assignment of pollution-specific “attainment-nonattainment” designations to all U.S. counties for each of

the regulated pollutants.4 For TSPs pollution the EPA was required to designate a county as

nonattainment if its TSPs concentrations exceeded either of two thresholds: 1) the annual geometric mean

concentration exceeded 75 µg/m3, or 2) the second highest daily concentration exceeded 260 µg/m3. This

standard prevailed from 1971 until 1987, when the EPA shifted its focus to the regulation of finer

particles.

         To achieve these standards, the fifty states were required to formulate and enforce State

Implementation Plans (SIPs) that specified precise abatement activities. For nonattainment counties, the

SIPs detailed plant-specific regulations for every major source of pollution. These local rules ordered that

any substantial investment by a new or existing plant must be accompanied by the installation of state-of-

the-art pollution abatement equipment and strict emissions ceilings. The SIPs also set emission limits for

existing plants in nonattainment counties.

  Lave and Omenn (1981) and Liroff (1986) provide more details on the CAAAs. In addition, see Greenstone
(2002) and Chay and Greenstone (2000).

  It is unclear whether the EPA assigned nonattainment status at the county level or at a more aggregate geographic
unit in the early 1970s. Our analysis assumes that the assignment was at the county level. The rationale for this
choice is discussed in the “Nonattainment Data” subsection of the Data Appendix. Further, below we find that using
nonattainment designations at a more aggregate geographic level does not change this paper’s qualitative findings.

                                                        4
        In stark contrast to the oversight in nonattainment counties, the restrictions on industrial polluters

in attainment counties were considerably less stringent. Large-scale investments, such as new plants and

large expansions at existing plants, required the installation of less expensive (and less effective) pollution

abatement equipment. Moreover, existing plants and smaller investments were essentially unregulated.

        Both the states and the federal EPA were given substantial enforcement powers to ensure that the

goals of the CAAA were met. To limit variation in the intensity of regulation across states, the federal

EPA had to approve all state regulation programs. On the compliance side, states initiated their own

inspection programs and frequently fined non-compliers. Further, the EPA was required to impose its

own procedures for attaining compliance in states that failed to adequately enforce the standards.

        The 1970 CAAA was signed into law by Richard Nixon on December 31, 1970. Four months

later on April 30, 1971, the EPA announced the final publication of the NAAQS that specified the

national standards for TSPs concentrations. On August 14, 1971, the EPA published “Requirements for

Preparation, Adoption and Submittal of Implementations Plans” in the Code of Federal Regulations,

which set forth how states were to write their SIPs in order to achieve compliance with the NAAQS by

1975. Finally, the SIPs were due to the EPA by January of 1972, the first year in which the CAAA was

enforced. Appendix Table 1 shows the timeline of the key dates associated with the 1970 CAAA, and the

Data Appendix gives additional details.

        Henderson (1996) provides evidence that the regulations were successfully enforced. He finds

that ozone concentrations declined more in counties that were nonattainment for ozone than in attainment

counties. Chay and Greenstone (2000) find that TSPs levels fell substantially more in counties that were

nonattainment for TSPs than in attainment counties after the passage of the 1970 CAAA and throughout

the 1970s.5




5
  Greenstone (2002) provides further evidence on the effectiveness of the regulations. He finds that nonattainment
status is associated with modest reductions in the employment, investment, and shipments of polluting
manufacturers. Interestingly, the regulation of TSPs has little association with changes in employment. Instead, the
overall employment declines are driven mostly by the regulation of other air pollutants.

                                                         5
                                              II. Research Design

        Previous research has documented a statistical association between TSPs concentrations and adult

mortality.6 However, the reliability of the evidence has been seriously questioned for several reasons.

First, since air pollution is not randomly assigned across locations, previous cross-sectional studies may

not be adequately controlling for a number of potential confounding determinants of adult mortality (Pope

and Dockery 1996; Fumento 1997). For example, areas with higher pollution levels also tend to have

higher population densities, different economic conditions, and higher crime rates, all of which could

impact adult health. Second, the lifetime exposure of adults to air pollution is unknown. Many studies

implicitly assume that the current pollution concentration observed at a site accurately measures each

resident’s lifetime exposure. Third, the excess adult deaths that are attributed to temporarily elevated air

pollution levels in time-series studies may be occurring among the already sick and represent little loss in

life expectancy (Spix, et al. 1994; Lipfert and Wyzga 1995).

        In the absence of randomized clinical trials, this study uses the air quality improvements induced

by the 1970 Clean Air Act Amendments in the first year that they were in force to estimate the impact of

TSPs on infant mortality. A research design based on comparisons between nonattainment and

attainment counties has several attractive features.7 First, TSPs nonattainment status is associated with

sharp differences in changes in TSPs across sites in the early 1970s. Panel A of Figure 2 shows the trends

in TSPs levels from 1969 to 1974 separately for counties that were nonattainment and attainment for

TSPs in 1972 – the first year of CAAA enforcement.8


6
  Studies of the adult mortality effects of particulates pollution include Lave and Seskin (1977), Pope and Dockery
(1996), Dockery and Pope (1996), Dockery, et al. (1993), and Pope, et al. (1995). Chay, Dobkin, and Greenstone
(2003) examine the association between adult and elderly mortality and regulation-induced TSPs declines.
7
  Despite extensive efforts, we were unable to obtain a list of the counties that were initially designated TSPs
nonattainment by the EPA. Given the timeline for states to comply with the CAAA, states likely ascertained the
identity of the counties with TSPs concentrations above the NAAQS while writing their SIPs during the second half
of 1971. We assume that they relied on the available TSPs concentrations data from 1970 to determine which
counties would be nonattainment for 1972. Thus, we assign counties with TSPs concentrations exceeding the
NAAQS in 1970 to the 1972 TSPs nonattainment category. All other counties with nonmissing TSPs data are
designated attainment for that year. The measures of TSPs concentrations are derived from the same network of
TSPs monitors used by the states and the EPA in this period. The Data Appendix provides further details on our
assignment rule.
8
  The sample consists of the 401 counties with continuous monitor readings from 1969-1974 – 229 of these counties
are TSPs nonattainment in 1972. Together these counties account for almost 60 percent of all births in the U.S. in

                                                         6
         The figure documents that before the 1970 CAAA, TSPs concentrations were 40-µg/m3 higher in

nonattainment counties. While the pollution trends are similar in the two groups from 1969 to 1971, there

is a sharp break in trend in nonattainment counties after implementation of the CAAA. From 1971-74

newly regulated counties had a stunning 20-µg/m3 reduction in TSPs, while TSPs fell by only 3 µg/m3 in

attainment counties. These comparisons suggest that virtually the entire national decline in TSPs from

1971-74 in Figure 1 was attributable to the regulations. In addition, two-thirds of the 1971-74 TSPs

decline in nonattainment counties occurred from 1971-72, the first year of CAAA enforcement.

Consequently, our analysis focuses on this abrupt, one-year improvement in air quality. 9

         Second, below we find evidence that this design may reduce the role of omitted variables bias in

analyzing the association between TSPs and infant mortality. Panel B of Figure 2 displays the trends in

internal infant mortality rates (IMR) in the same two sets of counties. 10 It shows that before the CAAA

was enforced, infant mortality rates were 120-150 deaths per 100,000 births higher in nonattainment

counties. Further, attainment and nonattainment counties had similar IMR trends between 1969 and

1971, with attainment counties experiencing a slightly larger decline. However, this pattern is reversed

between 1971 and 1972, with the attainment-nonattainment IMR gap narrowing by over 75 deaths per

100,000 births. The figure also reveals that attainment counties had a larger decline in infant mortality

between 1972 and 1974.

         The correspondence of the trend breaks in TSPs and infant mortality differences between

nonattainment and attainment counties in 1972 suggests a causal relationship. Since the patterns after

1972 are less compelling, we probe the case for causality more rigorously in the analysis below. To



1970.
9
  We probed how industrial polluters may have significantly reduced TSPs emissions in this narrow time frame.
Electrostatic precipitators were one of the primary control devices used to abate particulates pollution during this
period. The Industrial Gas Cleaning Institute reports that while annual sales of precipitators were approximately $50
million from 1968 through 1970, this figure doubled to $100 million in 1971 and 1972 (White 1984). According to
Donald Hug of the Environmental Elements Corporation, a supplier of pollution abatement equipment, an
electrostatic precipitator ordered in 1971 could be operating in 1972. We conclude that the large decrease in TSPs
emissions between 1971 and 1972 is the plausible result of polluter response to the 1970 CAAA.
10
   We define internal infant mortality to be infant death due to health related causes (i.e., 8th International
Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes 001 through 799). This excludes non-health related “external” causes of
death such as accidents and homicides (i.e., 8th ICD codes 800 through 999).

                                                         7
maximize the signal-to-noise ratio in TSPs changes and minimize the potential biases from confounding

changes in other variables, we focus on the striking one-year changes that occurred between 1971 and

1972. The analysis uses nonattainment status as an instrumental variable for 1971-1972 changes in TSPs.

Since federally-mandated regulatory pressure is plausibly orthogonal to changes in infant mortality rates,

except through its impact on air pollution, nonattainment status may be a valid instrument. Consistent

with this, we find little association between nonattainment status and other observable variables,

including parents’ characteristics, prenatal care utilization, and transfer payments from social programs.

        Further, nonattainment status in 1972 was a discrete function of the annual geometric mean and

second highest daily concentrations of TSPs in the regulation selection year, 1970. Thus, the assignment

of regulatory status has the feature of a quasi-experimental regression-discontinuity design (Cook and

Campbell 1979). If other factors affecting infant mortality are similar for counties just above and just

below the regulatory thresholds, then comparing outcome changes in nonattainment and attainment

counties with pre-regulation TSPs levels just around the threshold will control for all omitted factors

correlated with TSPs. Under this assumption discrete differences in mean outcome changes between

nonattainment and attainment counties near the federal ceilings can be attributed to the regulations. The

discontinuity in the assignment of regulations provides a valuable opportunity to gauge the credibility of

the research design and develop convincing specification tests.

        Third, our focus on infant, rather than adult, mortality may circumvent the other important

criticisms of previous research. The problem of unknown lifetime exposure to pollution is significantly

mitigated, if not solved, by the low migration rates of pregnant women and infants. Thus, we assign TSPs

levels to infants based on the exposure of the mother during pregnancy and the exposure of the newborn

during the first few months after birth (we focus on deaths within 24 hours, 28 days, and 1 year of birth).

        Further, since the mortality rate is higher in the first year of life than in the next 20 years

combined (NCHS 1993), it is likely that infant deaths represent a large loss in life expectancy. In

contrast, time-series studies of adult and elderly mortality based on daily air pollution fluctuations may be

detecting effects among the already very ill and dying. In this case, the actual loss of life expectancy may

be much smaller than these studies implicitly suggest.

                                                       8
        A final advantage of the design is that it permits a direct analysis of the health benefits of TSPs

reductions at levels just above the EPA’s maximum allowable concentration. The optimality of the

CAAAs depends crucially on the existence and relative magnitudes of the health effects above and near

the federal regulatory threshold.



                                              III. Econometric Methods

        Our analysis compares changes in infant mortality rates and TSPs pollution from 1971-1972 for

counties that were nonattainment and attainment for TSPs in 1972. Here, we discuss the econometric

models used to estimate the infant mortality-TSPs association. For simplicity, it is assumed that the

“true” effect of exposure to particulates pollution is homogeneous across infants and over time.

        The cross-sectional model predominantly used in the literature on air pollution and health is:

(1)     yct = Xct′β + θTct + εct,               εct = αc + uct

(2)     Tct = Xct′Π + ηct,                      ηct = λc + vct,

where yct is the infant mortality rate in county c in year t, Xct is a vector of observed characteristics, Tct is

the mean of TSPs across all monitors in the county, and εct and ηct are the unobservable determinants of

infant mortality rates and TSPs levels, respectively. The coefficient θ is the “true” effect of TSPs on

infant mortality. For consistent estimation, the least squares estimator of θ requires E[εctηct]=0. If there

are omitted permanent (αc and λc) or transitory (uct and vct) factors that covary with both TSPs and infant

mortality, then the cross-sectional estimator will be biased.

        With repeated observations over time, a “fixed-effects” model implies that first-differencing the

data will absorb the permanent county effects, αc and λc. This leads to:

(3)     yct - yct-1 = (Xct - Xct-1)′β + θ(Tct - Tct-1) + (uct - uct-1)

(4)     Tct - Tct-1 = (Xct - Xct-1)′Π + (vct - vct-1).

For identification, the fixed effects estimator of θ requires E[(uct - uct-1)(vct – vct-1)]=0. That is, there are

no unobserved shocks to TSPs levels that covary with unobserved shocks to infant mortality rates.

        While first-differencing removes permanent sources of bias, it may magnify any attenuation bias

due to measurement error. Since our measure of TSPs concentrations is an average across the monitors in

                                                              9
a county, it imperfectly captures individual exposure to TSPs.11 This mismeasurement will attenuate the

estimated TSPs regression coefficient leading to a bias that is proportional to the fraction of the total

variation in TSPs that is attributable to measurement error. To the extent that the serial correlation in

“true” TSPs exposure is greater than the autocorrelation in the TSPs measurement error, first-differencing

the data will increase the magnitude of the attenuation bias.12

           Now suppose there exists an instrumental variable, Zc, that causes changes in TSPs without

having a direct effect on infant mortality rate changes. Such a variable would purge the estimates of the

biases due to both omitted variables and measurement error. One plausible instrument is the 1970 CAAA

regulatory intervention for TSPs, measured by the 1972 attainment-nonattainment status of a county.

Here, equation (4) becomes:

(5)        Tc72 - Tc71 = (Xc72 - Xc71)′ΠTX + Zc72ΠTZ + (vc72 - vc71), and

(6)        Zc72 = 1(Tc70 > T ) = 1(vc70 > T - Xc70′Π - λc),

where Zc72 is the regulatory status of county c in 1972, 1(•) is an indicator function equal to one if the

enclosed statement is true, and T is the maximum concentration of TSPs allowed by the federal

regulations. Regulatory status in 1972 is a discrete function of 1970 pollution levels.13

           An attractive feature of this research design is that the reduced-form relations between 1972 TSPs

nonattainment status and the two endogenous variables provide direct estimates of the benefits of the

regulations. In particular, ΠTZ from equation (5) measures the 1971-1972 air quality improvement in

nonattainment counties relative to the change in attainment counties. In the other reduced-form equation,

(7)        yc72 - yc71 = (Xc72 - Xc71)′ΠyX + Zc72ΠyZ + (uc72 - uc71),




11
  During the 1971-1972 period, the mean and median numbers of monitors in a county are 4.2 and 2, respectively.
12
  However, in our context it is unclear whether the serial correlation in the TSPs measurement error from 1971 to
1972 is smaller or larger than the serial correlation in true TSPs exposure.
13
     For simplicity, we have written (6) as if regulatory status is a function of a single threshold crossing. If Tcavg
                                                                                                                     70 and

footnote 7 and the Data Appendix for details on the timing of the CAAA intervention.

ΠyZ captures the relative improvement in the infant mortality rate in nonattainment counties between 1971

and 1972.

         Since the instrumental variables (IV) estimator (θIV) of the effect of TSPs on infant mortality is

exactly identified, it is equal to the ratio of the two reduced-form relations – i.e., θIV = ΠyZ/ΠTZ. Two

sufficient conditions for θIV to provide a consistent estimate of the TSPs effect are ΠTZ ≠ 0 and E[vc70(uc72

- uc71)]=0. The first condition requires that the regulations induced air quality improvements. The second

condition requires that transitory shocks to TSPs levels in 1970 are orthogonal to unobserved shocks to

infant mortality rates from 1971-1972.14

         Even if E[vc70(uc72 - uc71)] ≠ 0, causal inferences on θ may be possible by leveraging the

regression discontinuity (RD) design implicit in the 1(•) function that determines nonattainment status.

For example, if E[vc70(uc72 - uc71)] = 0 in the neighborhood of the regulatory ceiling (i.e., 75 µg/m3), then a

comparison of changes in nonattainment and attainment counties in this neighborhood will control for all

omitted variables. Below, we present IV estimates based on all counties and RD estimates in which the

sample is limited to counties with TSPs concentrations “near” the 75 µg/m3 threshold in the regulation

selection year.15 In the next section, we show that the observable characteristics of nonattainment and

attainment counties near the federal TSPs ceiling are very similar.

         Another potential source of bias comes from unmeasured state-specific determinants of infant

mortality (e.g., generosity of state Medicaid programs, state weather conditions). Since the analysis is at

the county level, in some specifications we control for unrestricted state-time effects in infant mortality to

absorb all unobservables that vary across states over time. Here, the effect of TSPs is identified using

only comparisons between attainment and nonattainment counties within the same state. Figure 3

provides a graphical overview of the location of attainment and nonattainment counties in 1972. A

county’s shading indicates its regulatory status – light gray for attainment, black for nonattainment, and



14
   In the simplest case, the IV estimator will be consistent if 1972 nonattainment status is orthogonal to unobserved
infant mortality shocks – i.e., E[Zc72(uc72 - uc71)]=0, which is a stronger condition than E[vc70(uc72 - uc71)]=0.
15
   If the relationship between vc70 and (uc72 - uc71) is sufficiently “smooth” at the regulatory ceilings, then causal
inference may also be possible by including smooth functions of the selection variable, Tc70, as controls. Below, we
also provide RD estimates that are adjusted for a quadratic in Tc70.

white for the counties without TSPs pollution monitors. The pervasiveness of the 1972 TSPs regulatory

program is evident. In addition to the traditional counties in the Rust Belt and in the South Coast Air

Basin around Los Angeles, scores of other counties were designated nonattainment. Importantly, most

states contain both attainment and nonattainment counties.



                                 IV. Data Sources and Summary Statistics

        To implement our evaluation strategy, we use county level data on air pollution, infant health, and

a number of additional control variables for the 1969-1974 period. Here, we describe these data and

provide summary statistics showing that the nonattainment-attainment research design balances the

observable characteristics of counties. More details on the data sources and variables are contained in the

Data Appendix.



A. Data Sources

        The health outcome variables and a number of the control variables come from the National

Mortality Detail Files and National Natality Detail Files, which are derived from censuses of death and

birth certificates.16 We merge the individual birth and infant death records at the county level for each

year to create county by year cells. For each cell, the infant mortality rate is calculated as the ratio of the

total number of infant deaths of a certain type (age and cause of death) to the total number of births. The

mortality rates within 24 hours, 28 days (neonatal), and one year of birth are computed separately for each

year. Fatalities that occur soon after birth are thought to reflect poor fetal development. Thus, we use the

estimated effects of TSPs on 24-hour and neonatal mortality to probe whether fetal exposure to TSPs may

have adverse health effects.

        We also calculate separate mortality rates for deaths due to internal health reasons and deaths due

to external “non-health” related causes such as accidents and homicides. 17 Internal infant deaths are not

16
   The Natality Files provide a 100% census of all births in every year from 1969-1974. The Mortality Files provide
a 100% census of all deaths in every year except for 1972, in which a 50% random sample of all deaths is provided.
17
   “Internal” and “external” deaths span all possible causes of death. See footnote 10 for the definition of the
internal and external categories based on the 8th ICD codes.

                                                        12
disaggregated further for two broad reasons. First, coroners assign about 70% of these deaths to two

categories -- “certain causes of perinatal morbidity and mortality” and “congenital anomalies.” Second,

since the pathophysiological pathways through which TSPs may affect fetal or infant health are largely

unknown, there is no a priori basis for dividing these causes of death into ones that are and are not

plausibly related to TSPs.18 However, it seems reasonable to assume that there is no causal pathway

linking air pollution to external causes of death. So we use the estimated association between external

mortality rates and TSPs pollution as a check on the internal consistency of our findings.19

        The microdata on the control variables available in the Natality Files are also aggregated into

annual county cells. The detailed Natality variables include information on: socioeconomic and

demographic characteristics of the parents; medical system utilization, including prenatal care usage

(Rosenzweig and Schultz 1983; Institute of Medicine 1985); maternal health endowment, such as

mother’s age and pregnancy history (Rosenzweig and Schultz 1983; Rosenzweig and Wolpin 1991); and

infant birth weight. Since TSPs may affect fetal development, we use infant birth weight as another

outcome variable. The Data Appendix describes the Natality variables used in the analysis in detail.

        Annual, monitor-level data on TSPs concentrations were obtained by filing a Freedom of

Information Act request with the EPA. This yielded annual summary information from the EPA’s

nationwide network of pollution monitors, including the location of each monitor and their readings. The

data also contain information on the annual geometric mean TSPs concentration for each monitor in a

county and the number of daily monitor readings exceeding the federal standards in each year. These

measures are used to determine the annual nonattainment status of each county (see the Data Appendix

for more details). From the data, we also calculated the mean of TSPs concentrations in each county and

year, which we use as our measure of TSPs exposure in the analysis.20


18
   See Utell and Samet (1996) for a summary of the evidence on the pathophysiological relationship between TSPs
and human health.
19
   That is, the association between TSPs and external infant deaths may result from unobserved secular factors that
affect all types of infant death.
20
   Specifically, the annual TSPs concentration used is the weighted average of the annual arithmetic means of each
monitor in the county, with the number of observations per monitor used as weights. Some recent research has
focused on the effects of PM-10 particles. Most of these studies multiplied TSPs concentrations by a constant factor
to obtain PM-10 measures (e.g., Pope, Dockery, and Schwartz, 1995).

                                                        13
        In addition to the key infant health and pollution data, we use a variety of other county-level data

as controls. Per-capita income data come from the Bureau of Economic Analysis’ annual series, which

provides the most comprehensive measure of income available at the county level. This file also provides

annual, county-level data on per-capita net earnings, the ratio of total employment to the total population,

and the ratio of total manufacturing employment to the total population. The Regional Economic

Information System file provides annual, county-level data on several different categories of transfer

payments. These include separate series for total transfer payments; total medical care payments; public

expenditures on medical care for low-income individuals (primarily Medicaid and local assistance

programs); income maintenance benefits; family assistance payments, including AFDC; Food Stamps

payments; and Unemployment Insurance benefits.

        Table 1 presents summary information from 1969-1974 for the 501 counties with available TSPs

and infant mortality data in 1970, 1971, and 1972. This is our primary sample in the below analysis. In

1969 and 1973-74, the sample is further restricted to counties with nonmissing data on TSPs and infant

mortality in those years.

        The top rows of the table show that these counties account for over 60% of the 3.2-3.7 million

live births that occur annually in the United States in this period. The next rows present infant fatalities

per 100,000 live births, by cause of death. The internal infant mortality rate in 1971 is 1.8 deaths within a

year of birth per 100 births, while infant deaths due to external causes are much rarer. In 1971, about 45

and 75 percent of all internal infant deaths within a year of birth occur within the first 24 hours and 28

days of birth, respectively. The table also shows national trends in infant mortality, average TSPs

concentrations, and per-capita income across counties. Internal infant mortality rates decreased steadily

from 1969-74. TSPs, on the other hand, fell by over 18 percent from 1971-74, but were relatively stable

from 1969-71. Per-capita income increased by 8.5 percent from 1971-73, before falling slightly from

1973-74, presumably a result of the recession.

        The remaining rows of Table 1 present 1969-74 trends for several of the control variables used in

the analysis. Importantly, the magnitude of changes in these variables is small when compared to the

TSPs pollution changes that occurred from 1971-72. Our measures of parental background characteristics

                                                      14
suggest that the average socioeconomic status (SES) of parents was declining from 1969-74, as the

fractions of births to single, high school dropout, and black mothers increased. On the other hand, the

likelihood of a mother receiving prenatal care or having a prenatal visit in the first trimester increased

slightly. The percentage of births attributable to teenagers rose, and the share among women aged 35 and

over fell.21 Finally, the share of first-time births increased slightly while the fraction of mothers who had

a prior fetal death remained stable.



B. Balancing of Observable Characteristics

          Before proceeding, we examine whether the nonattainment instrumental variable is orthogonal to

the observable predictors of infant mortality. While it is not a formal test of the exogeneity of the

instrument, it seems reasonable to presume that research designs that meet this criterion may suffer from

smaller omitted variables bias. First, designs that balance the observable covariates may be more likely to

also balance the unobservables (Altonji, Elder, and Taber 2000).22 Second, if the instrument balances the

observables, then consistent inference does not depend on functional form assumptions on the relations

between the observable confounders and infant mortality. Estimators that misspecify these functional

forms (e.g., linear regression adjustment when the conditional expectations function is nonlinear) will be

biased.

          Table 2 shows the association of TSPs levels, TSPs changes, and TSPs nonattainment status with

other potential correlates of infant mortality using the same sample of counties as in Table 1. Each

column of the table presents the differences in the variable means between two sets of counties (with

standard errors in parentheses). The first column contains differences in the 1971 levels of the covariates

between counties with high (above the median) and low (below the median) TSPs concentrations in 1971.

If TSPs levels were randomly assigned across counties, one would expect very few significant differences

between the two groups. However, there are significant differences for several key variables, including

21
   Rees, et. al. (1996) find that much of the correlation between poor infant health and mother’s age is due to the
higher incidence of low birth weight births among teenagers and women 35 and older.
22
   For example, in experimental designs testing for differences in the observable characteristics of the treatment and
control groups is used to assess whether the treatment was actually randomly assigned.

                                                          15
mother’s race, immigrant status, use of prenatal care, and likelihood of being a teenager. Though not

presented in the table, there are also large and significant differences between the county groups in per-

capita receipts of income maintenance benefits, family assistance payments, and public expenditures on

medical care for low-income individuals (e.g., see Chay, Dobkin, and Greenstone 2003). Overall, these

findings suggest that “conventional” cross-sectional estimates may be biased due to omitted variables.

         The next two columns of Table 2 perform a similar analysis for 1971-1972 TSPs changes. They

contain differences in 1971 variable levels and 1971-72 variable changes between counties that had large

(above the median) and small (below the median) reductions in TSPs between 1971 and 1972. These two

county groups exhibit significant differences in the 1971 levels of per capita income, mother’s immigrant

status, prenatal care use, likelihood of being over 34 years old, and pregnancy history. There are also

significant differences in the 1971-72 changes in mother’s and father’s education levels and marginally

significant differences in the changes in the fractions of mothers who are teenagers and who had a prior

fetal death. Thus, fixed effects models may also lead to biased inference.

         The next two columns of the table show the differences in 1971 levels and 1971-72 changes

between nonattainment and attainment counties. While nonattainment status is associated with a large

and significant reduction in TSPs concentrations, it is uncorrelated with nearly all of the 1971 levels and

1971-72 changes in the covariates, with the only exceptions being per capita income and mother’s race in

1971. The differences in the changes in mother’s and father’s education and in the changes in the

incidences of mothers who are teenagers and experienced a previous fetal death are greatly reduced by

comparing nonattainment and attainment counties. Also, in contrast to the previous two sets of county

group comparisons, nonattainment and attainment counties exhibit little difference in their receipts of

transfer payments from social programs (results available from the authors). Thus, it appears that the

attainment-nonattainment research design does a better job of balancing the observables.23




23
   It should be noted that the composition of counties who are nonattainment and attainment in 1972 is different
from the composition of counties with “high” and “low” mean TSPs in 1971 (i.e., column 1).

                                                         16
         In the last two columns, the sample is further restricted to the 176 counties with 1970 geometric

mean TSPs concentrations between 60 and 90 µg/m3 – i.e., counties with TSPs levels near the TSPs

regulatory ceiling in the regulation selection year. It is evident that focusing on nonattainment and

attainment counties near the regulatory threshold eliminates all of the significant differences in the

covariate levels and changes, including per capita income, mother’s race, and the infant mortality rate in

the year before CAAA enforcement. While nonattainment status is orthogonal to all of the other

covariates, the second row shows that it is still associated with a sharp reduction in TSPs levels between

1971 and 1972 for counties near the regulatory threshold.24 These results provide reassuring evidence on

the quality of the instrumental variables research design used in this study. We probe this further below.



                                               V. Empirical Results

A. Cross-Sectional and Fixed Effects Results

         First, we replicate the conventional cross-sectional approach to estimating the association

between TSPs pollution and infant mortality that is common in the literature. Table 3 presents the

regression estimates of the effect of TSPs on the number of internal infant deaths within a year of birth

per 100,000 live births for each cross-section from 1969-1974. The final row contains the results for the

pooled 1969-1974 data. Column 1 presents the unadjusted TSPs coefficient; column 2 includes the basic

control variables available in the Natality data; column 3 includes additional Natality variables and

flexible functional forms for the variables; and column 4 further adjusts for per-capita income, earnings,

employment, and transfer payments by source.25 Columns 5 and 6 add unrestricted state effects to the

column 2 and column 4 specifications, respectively. The sample sizes and R2’s of the regressions are

shown in brackets.

         There is wide variability in the estimated effects of TSPs, both across specifications for a given

cross-section and across cross-sections for a given specification. While the raw correlations in column 1



24
   Given the notation in equations (6) and (7), it should be noted that 1972 nonattainment status is orthogonal to the
levels of covariates in 1970 as well (results available from the authors).
25
   The control variables included in each specification are listed in the Data Appendix.

                                                          17
are all positive, only those from the 1969 and 1974 cross-sections are statistically significant at

conventional levels.26 Including the basic Natality controls in column 2 reduces the point estimates

substantially in most years, even as the precision of the estimates increases due to the greatly improved fit

of the regressions. In addition, only two of the estimates in columns 3 and 4 are significant at

conventional levels, and one of these has a perverse negative sign. This is also true of the most

unrestricted specification in column 6 that also adjusts for state fixed effects.

         The largest positive estimates from the cross-sectional analyses imply that a 1-µg/m3 reduction in

mean TSPs results in roughly 3 fewer internal infant deaths per 100,000 live births, which is an elasticity

of 0.14. Overall, however, there is little evidence of a systematic cross-sectional association between

particulates pollution and infant survival rates. While the 1974 cross-section produces estimates that are

positive, significant and slightly less sensitive to specification, the 1972 cross-section provides estimates

that are routinely negative. The sensitivity of the results to the year analyzed and the set of variables used

as controls suggests that omitted variables may play an important role in cross-sectional analysis. We

suspect that the fragility of the cross-sectional results to changes in specification and sample is likely to

apply to the estimation of the relationship between other measures of human health (e.g., adult mortality)

and environmental quality (e.g., other air pollutants).

         Table 4 presents the fixed effects estimates of the association between mean TSPs and internal

infant mortality rates based on 1969-1974 pooled data (first panel) and 1971-1972 first-differenced data

(second panel). The columns correspond to similar regression specifications as those in Table 3. The

1971-1972 first differences results provide a baseline for comparison to the subsequent instrumental

variables results that use the same samples and control variables. The inclusion of county fixed effects or

the use of first-differenced data eliminates the bias in the cross-sectional estimates attributable to time-

invariant omitted factors that vary across counties. However, these approaches will be biased if there are

unobserved shocks that are correlated with changes in TSPs and infant mortality rates.

26
   It is worth noting that the comparison of counties with “high” and “low” 1971 TSPs levels in the first column of
Table 2 implies an unadjusted TSPs effect of 2.8 (129.8/45.8), which is 75% greater than the estimated correlation
for 1971 in Table 3 (1.6). This is consistent with measurement error in TSPs leading to substantive attenuation bias,
since the aggregation in Table 2 “averages out” the measurement errors over many counties.

                                                         18
        The 1969-1974 panel shows that the inclusion of county-specific intercepts greatly improves the

fit of the regressions when compared to the pooled cross-sectional regressions in the last row of Table 3.

The raw fixed effects correlation in column 1 is positive and highly significant. However, the estimated

TSPs coefficient falls significantly when the analysis controls for the Natality variables, economic

conditions, transfer payments, year effects and state-year effects. The 1971-1972 first differences results

also suggest little association between changes in TSPs and changes in infant mortality rates.

        The fixed effects association between TSPs and infant mortality is small and sensitive to

specification, which is consistent with potential biases due to omitted variables and/or measurement

error.27 We conclude that conventional approaches may not provide reliable estimates of the causal effect

of TSPs on infant mortality and turn our attention to the instrumental variables design outlined above.



B. The Impact of the 1970 Clean Air Act on Air Quality and Infant Mortality

        The instrumental variables estimate of the effect of TSPs is a function of two reduced-form

effects: the impact of 1972 nonttainment status on improvements in air quality, and its association with

declines in infant mortality. Here, we provide estimates of the air quality and infant health benefits of the

1970 Clean Air Act and present evidence that our design may plausibly identify the causal effects of

nonattainment status on both outcomes.

        Figure 4 depicts the 1969-1974 time-series of the raw differences in TSPs levels (Panel A) and

internal infant mortality rates (Panel B) between counties that were nonattainment and attainment in 1972.

Separate series are plotted for three samples: 1) all counties with nonmissing TSPs data, 2) the subset of

counties with a 1970 geometric mean TSPs concentration between 50-115 µg/m3, and 3) the subset of

counties with 1970 TSPs between 60-90 µg/m3. 28 The last two samples are restricted to those counties

with TSPs concentrations closer to the 75 µg/m3 regulation ceiling in the regulation selection year.


27
   The comparison of counties with “big” and “small” 1971-1972 TSPs reductions in the third column of Table 2
implies an unadjusted TSPs effect of -0.73 (18.8/(-25.6)) for 1971-1972 first differences. This suggests that the
small 1971-1972 first-differences estimate in column 1 of Table 4 is not the result of attenuation bias due to
measurement error. See footnotes 12 and 26 for more details.
28
   The samples consist of the fixed set of counties with continuous monitor readings from 1969-1974. The numbers
of counties are 401, 262, and 141, respectively.

                                                       19
        Panel A shows large trend breaks in the nonattainment-attainment difference in TSPs that

correspond with the timing of the first year of CAAA enforcement in 1972. There is a clear convergence

in TSPs from 1971 to 1972 even for the subset of counties with 1970 TSPs levels close to the regulatory

threshold. Among counties with 1970 TSPs between 60-90 µg/m3, the 10.5 unit nonattainment-

attainment gap in TSPs in 1971 is almost eliminated by 1972 before rebounding somewhat in 1973. For

counties with 1970 TSPs between 50-115 µg/m3, there is also a significant relative reduction in TSPs

from 1971-1972, though the break in trend appears to have started a year earlier than for the other two

county groups. On the whole, the timing and location of the TSPs reductions suggest that enforcement of

the 1970 CAAA led to improved air quality.

        Panel B of the figure shows a striking correspondence between the breaks in trend in infant

mortality differences between nonattainment and attainment counties and those in TSPs differences. For

the full sample, the sharp break in infant mortality trends from 1971-1972 matches the break in TSPs

differences. The differential timing of the relative shift down in infant mortality across the three samples

also matches the TSPs patterns. While the full sample and the sample with 1970 TSPs between 60-90

µg/m3 show relative mortality reductions from 1971-1972 only, the sample with 1970 TSPs between 50-

115 µg/m3 exhibits a relative mortality reduction the previous year also. Also consistent with the patterns

in Panel A, the sample with 1970 TSPs between 60-90 µg/m3 exhibits the largest rebound in relative

mortality rates from 1972 to 1973. Below, we show that some of the 1972-1974 rebound in infant

mortality differences is explained by differential changes in the observable characteristics of attainment

and nonattainment counties after 1972.

        Taken together, these plots provide evidence of a direct link between regulation-induced

improvements in air quality and reductions in infant mortality rates. First, the timing of the abrupt

declines in TSPs and infant mortality correlate remarkably well across all three groups of counties.

Further, none of the observable covariates, including per-capita income and transfer payments, exhibits

similar trend break patterns in nonattainment-attainment differences. It seems unlikely that any

unobserved factors had nonattainment-attainment differences that changed as sharply or abruptly as the

differences in TSPs and infant mortality from 1971 to 1972. Based on these raw numbers, a 1-µg/m3

                                                     20
reduction in mean TSPs leads to 6-14 fewer internal infant deaths per 100,000 live births from 1971-

1972, which implies an elasticity between 0.3 and 0.6. The counties with TSPs concentrations closest to

the TSPs regulatory ceiling provide the largest estimate.29

         Table 5 contains the regression results from estimating reduced-form equations (5) and (7). The

first panel shows the association between the 1972 nonattainment indicator and changes in mean TSPs

from 1971-1972. The second panel presents the estimated effects of nonattainment status on changes in

infant deaths due to internal causes per 100,000 live births. The columns correspond to the same six

specifications used in Table 4.30

         In the first panel, the regulation indicator is associated with a 9-12 µg/m3 reduction in TSPs from

1971 to 1972. This represents a 9-12% improvement in air quality in nonattainment counties and is

similar in magnitude to the effect sizes shown in Figure 4. The estimates are relatively insensitive to the

inclusion of controls for the Natality variables, economic conditions, transfer payments, and unrestricted

state-year effects in columns 1-5. The estimate is reduced in the most unrestricted specification in

column 6, but is still highly significant. In fact, the F-statistics imply that nonattainment status is the most

important (observable) determinant of TSPs changes from 1971 to 1972. The first-stage impact of

regulation is powerful and explains almost all of the overall reduction in mean TSPs in the sample. This

finding contradicts recent research that contends that the CAAAs failed to improve air quality (Goklany

1999).

         The second panel reveals another striking empirical regularity. The 1972 TSPs nonattainment

variable is associated with 53-116 fewer infant deaths per 100,000 live births. This implies a 3-6%

decline in the infant mortality rate in nonattainment counties and is similar in magnitude to the implied

effects in Figure 4. The estimates are also generally significant – four of six are significant at the 5-

percent level and a fifth at the 10-percent level – and tend to increase in magnitude as more controls are



29
   Taken literally, the numbers underlying Figure 4 imply that a unit-reduction in TSPs has a larger marginal effect
at TSPs concentrations just above the 75-µg3 regulatory ceiling than at higher concentrations.
30
   It should be noted that the specifications for columns 1 and 2 of Table 4 do not control for year effects, whereas
columns 1 and 2 of Table 5 do include a constant to absorb year effects in the first differences. For 1971-1972 first-
differences, the estimates in columns 1 and 2 of Table 4 that include a constant are –0.40 (0.71) and –0.36 (0.67).

                                                          21
added. This is particularly notable given the unpredictability of changes in infant mortality rates. In

column 3, for example, only the coefficients on the indicators for twins or greater birth and mother’s race

have t-ratios similar in magnitude to the t-ratio for the nonattainment coefficient.31

         These results imply that the Clean Air Act regulations resulted in substantial reductions in infant

mortality in nonattainment counties. The weighted average of the estimates (with weights equal to the

inverse of the sampling errors) suggests that relative to attainment counties nonattainment counties had 82

fewer infants deaths per 100,000 births. Multiplying this figure by the 1.52 million births that occurred in

nonattainment counties in 1972 implies that 1,300 fewer infants died in 1972 than would have in the

absence of the 1970 Act.

         Figure 5 presents the raw and regression adjusted trends in differences between attainment and

nonattainment counties in TSPs (Panel A) and infant mortality (Panel B) from 1969 to 1974. The graph

plots the estimated coefficients on interactions of 1972 nonattainment status with year indictors from

regressions that also include year main effects. The Adjust 1, Adjust 2, and Adjust 3 series are based on

specifications that respectively use the same controls as in columns 2-4 of Table 5.32 Panel A of the

figure shows that regression adjustment has little effect on the size of the trend break in relative TSPs in

nonattainment counties after 1971.

         Panel B shows that regression adjustment also has little effect on the size of the relative infant

mortality reduction from 1971 to 1972 and, if anything, tends to increase the measured improvement in

nonattainment counties. Covariate adjustment does however have a substantial effect on the levels of the

nonattainment-attainment mortality differences in the pre-regulation period, 1969-1971. Importantly, it

also reduces the magnitude of the rebound in relative mortality rates from 1972 to 1974, suggesting that

some of the rebound is due to a worsening in the observable characteristics of nonattainment counties

relative to attainment ones. Appendix Figure 1, which plots the predicted mortality differences between

   Being black and having a twins or greater birth are both associated with higher rates of infant death. The
estimated coefficients on almost all of the other variables (e.g., parents’ socioeconomic characteristics, mother’s
prenatal care use and pregnancy history) are statistically insignificant.
32
   The regressions use the pooled 1969-1974 data and restrict the effects of the control variables to be constant over
time. The sample is the fixed set of 401 counties with continuous TSPs readings from 1969-1974.

                                                          22
nonattainment and attainment counties based on the Adjust 3 regression specification excluding TSPs,

confirms this conclusion.33 It shows that in the absence of the TSPs changes, the nonattainment-

attainment mortality gap would have been predicted to widen over the period due to the general

worsening of the relative characteristics of nonattainment counties.

         These findings suggest that while the observable controls are strong predictors of infant mortality

levels, they cannot account for the sharp mortality change in nonattainment counties from 1971 to 1972.

Interestingly, Figure 5 also explains the differences across cross-sections in the estimated TSPs

coefficients in Table 3. In 1972, for example, nonattainment counties had higher TSPs levels than

attainment counties but lower infant mortality rates once differences in observable predictors are

controlled for. This corresponds with the perverse, negative estimates for the 1972 cross-section in Table

3. The nonattainment-attainment differences in TSPs and infant mortality in 1974 also correspond with

the systematically positive estimates for the 1974 cross-section. In fact, much of the across-year variation

in the cross-sectional estimates in Table 3 appears to be due to the sharp improvement in air quality

caused by the Clean Air Act.

         Our final assessment of the causal impact of the 1970 Act on air quality and infant mortality

exploits the discontinuity in the assignment rule that determines 1972 nonattainment status. Figure 6

graphs the bivariate relations of both the 1971-1972 change in TSPs and the 1971-1972 change in infant

mortality with the geometric mean of TSPs levels in 1970 (the regulation selection year). The plots come

from the estimation of nonparametric regressions that use a uniform kernel density regression smoother.

Thus, they represent a moving average of the raw changes across 1970 TSPs levels.34 This graphical

analysis allows us to test whether there are sharp differences in the outcomes that correspond with the

discrete zero-to-one change in the probability that a county was designated nonattainment at the

   Appendix Figure 1 was constructed from two steps: 1) a regression of infant mortality rates on the observables
excluding TSPs; and 2) a regression of the predicted infant mortality rates from the first regression on year effects
and interactions of the year effects with 1972 nonattainment status. Thus, the figure provides a “single-index”
summary of the differences between nonattainment and attainment counties in the observable confounders.

regulatory ceiling (the vertical line in the figure) mandated by the CAAA. Recall, counties with 1970

geometric mean TSPs levels below (above) 75 µg/m3 are attainment (nonattainment) in 1972.35

        For the full set of counties in our primary sample, the figure confirms the regression results in

Table 5. Nonattainment counties with 1970 TSPs levels above the regulatory ceiling had much larger

reductions in both mean TSPs and infant mortality rates from 1971-1972 than their attainment

counterparts with 1970 TSPs below the ceiling. The most striking features of the graph, however, are the

clear “trend breaks” in TSPs and infant mortality rate changes at the regulatory threshold. These breaks

strongly suggest that the CAAA regulation is a causal factor in improvements in both outcomes for

nonattainment counties.

        Focusing on the counties with geometric mean TSPs between 50 and 100 µg/m3 in 1970, there is

a clear association between larger reductions in mean TSPs and greater decreases in infant mortality at the

EPA-mandated air quality standard. The correspondence of the trend breaks implies that our research

design may identify the casual effect of air pollution on infant mortality through the mechanism of

regulation. This “nonparametric” display of the data suggests instrumental variables estimates that are

similar in magnitude to the two-stage least squares estimates presented in the next section.

        On the other hand, there appear to be secular decreases in infant mortality rate reductions at 1970

TSPs levels well below (30-50 µg/m3) and well above (100-150 µg/m3) the 75-µg/m3 threshold. Thus, IV

estimates based on the subsample of counties close to the regulation discontinuity will be larger in

magnitude than those based on the entire sample. This could be due to either a nonconstant infant

mortality-TSPs gradient or greater differences in the characteristics of nonattainment and attainment

counties with 1970 TSPs levels far away from the discontinuity.

        Figure 7 provides two checks of the validity of the 1972 nonattainment research design. First,

Panel A of the figure empirically examines the validity of the “smoothness” condition discussed above. It

plots the infant mortality changes predicted by the observable covariates excluding TSPs changes, E[(yc72-



35
  The six counties that were nonattainment in 1972 for exceeding the daily concentration standard but not the
annual geometric mean standard in 1970 are dropped from the analysis. Thus, the sample contains 264
nonattainment counties and 230 attainment counties.

                                                        24
yc71)|(Xc72-Xc71)], along with the actual infant mortality changes from Figure 6, as a function of 1970 TSPs

levels. The predicted changes come from a regression that includes the full set of Natality control

variables – i.e., column 3 of Table 5.

        The figure shows that this index of the non-pollution determinants of infant mortality changes is

smooth at the regulatory threshold. By contrast, actual infant mortality rates fall substantially at the

threshold, presumably due to the large TSPs reductions. The mortality predictors do appear to explain the

decreasing reductions in infant mortality at low 1970 TSPs levels. But for counties with 1970 TSPs

greater than 55-60 µg/m3, there is little association between predicted mortality changes and pre-

regulation TSPs levels. Consistent with the results in Table 2, this finding suggests that attainment and

nonattainment counties in the neighborhood of the regulatory ceiling have the same characteristics. In

addition, the only observable variable that exhibits a break at the ceiling that corresponds with the infant

mortality break is the change in TSPs.

        Panel B of Figure 7 plots pre-regulation changes in infant mortality and mean TSPs from 1969-

1970 by the geometric mean of TSPs in 1970. This figure provides the following falsification test. Since

the 1970 Clean Air Act was not yet in force, there should not be a “trend break” in 1969-1970 changes in

the outcome variables near the 75-µg/m3 threshold. The graph shows that pre-regulation changes in

infant mortality and TSPs have a smooth relation with 1970 TSPs levels at the regulatory ceiling. This is

consistent with 1972 nonattainment status being the cause of the 1971-1972 outcome changes. In fact,

before the passage of the 1970 CAAA, nonattainment counties had rising TSPs levels relative to

attainment counties, which corresponds with the growing gap in infant mortality in the pre-regulation

period. These patterns are consistent with the more aggregated patterns in Figure 4.

        Taken together, Figures 4-7and Table 5 provide convincing evidence that the 1970 CAAA had

significant air quality and infant health benefits. The results imply that the regulation of nonattainment

counties in 1972 resulted in a 10 percent reduction in TSPs concentrations and a 4-5 percent decline in

infant mortality rates from 1971 to 1972. Further, the nonattainment design allowed us to develop several

credible tests of the causality of the CAAA intervention and of the infant mortality-TSPs relation. Tests

of this type are not possible in the cross-sectional settings typically used in the literature.

C. Instrumental Variables Estimates of the Effect of TSPs

         Table 6 presents the instrumental variables estimates of the effect of TSPs pollution on internal

infant mortality rates within one year of birth. Here, the indicator for 1972 nonattainment status is used as

an instrument for 1971-1972 changes in TSPs. The first column presents the unadjusted estimate – i.e.,

the Wald estimate. The remaining columns correspond to specifications that include the same sets of

control variables as in Tables 4 and 5.

         While the Wald estimate in column 1 implies that a 1-µg/m3 decline in TSPs results in 4.4 fewer

infant deaths per 100,000 live births, it is not significant at conventional levels. However, when the

Natality controls are added in columns 2 and 3, the estimated TSPs coefficient rises to 7.1 and 8.5 and is

significant at the 5-percent level in both cases. The TSPs coefficient is not affected when the controls for

economic conditions and transfer payments are added in column 4. The specifications in the final two

columns include unrestricted state effects, which absorb unobservable differences across states in 1971-

1972 changes. Thus, the treatment effect is identified using only comparisons of changes between

attainment and nonattainment counties within the same state. In column 5, the TSPs estimate rises to 13.1

and is highly significant. In the most saturated model in column 6, the TSPs coefficient is 15.1 and is less

precisely estimated, which is not surprising. 36

         In direct contrast to the cross-sectional and first-differences estimates, the instrumental variables

estimates of the TSPs effect are much larger in magnitude and generally significant. The weighted

average of the IV estimates (with weights equal to the inverse of the sampling errors) implies that a 1-

µg/m3 reduction in TSPs is associated with 8.3 fewer infant deaths per 100,000 live births, which is an

elasticity of 0.45. This is roughly three times greater than the largest cross-sectional estimate in Table 3

and is similar in magnitude to the effects found in Chay and Greenstone (2003), who estimated a 0.35

elasticity. 37 For the counties in our sample, the internal infant death rate fell by an average of 55 per


36
   The IV estimate (sampling error) from a specification that includes state-time effects and the unrestricted Natality
controls in column 3 is 16.8 (7.1), which is significant at the 1-percent level. Thus, among these seven IV estimates,
four are significant at the 5-percent level, two are significant at the 10-percent level, and the Wald estimate is
significant at the 15-percent level.
37
   Chay and Greenstone (2003) also find that black infant mortality is more sensitive to county-level TSPs
reductions than white infant mortality. Although we find similar qualitative results when we stratify our analysis by

                                                          26
100,000 births from 1971 to 1972. Thus, the estimates also imply that the entire reduction in infant

mortality from 1971-1972 is due to the 11-unit average decline in TSPs induced by the 1970 CAAA.

         The IV estimates are also more stable across specifications than the cross-sectional and first-

differences estimates. However, they do tend to increase in magnitude as the observable controls and

state-time effects are added to the specifications. This suggests that in the absence of the regulation-

induced TSPs reductions, attainment counties had characteristics that favored greater declines in infant

mortality relative to nonattainment counties from 1971-1972. This is consistent with the patterns in

Figures 5B and 7A. On the other hand, Table 2 and Figure 7A suggest that comparisons between the

nonattainment and attainment counties with 1970 TSPs levels in the neighborhood of the regulatory

ceiling may reduce both observable and unobservable sources of bias.

         Table 7 examines this possibility by presenting instrumental variables estimates for the

subsamples of counties with 1970 geometric mean TSPs near the nonattainment threshold. The first two

columns show the estimates for the entire sample of counties. The first specification controls for the basic

Natality variables while the second further adjusts for unrestricted state-time effects (i.e., columns 2 and 5

in Table 6). 38 The remaining columns present the IV estimates from these specifications for the

subsamples of counties with 1970 geometric mean TSPs between 50-115 and 60-90 µg/m3.39

         The first panel of the table contains the results for internal infant mortality rates within one year

of birth. The findings are consistent with our hypothesis. As the sample is limited to counties with 1970

TSPs levels closer to the regulatory threshold, the IV estimates tend to increase and are insensitive to the

inclusion of state-time effects. The largest estimates come from the 173 counties with 1970 TSPs levels

between 60-90 µg/m3. They imply that a 1-µg/m3 TSPs reduction results in 15-17 fewer infant deaths per

100,000 live births, which is an elasticity of 0.6-0.7.40 Further, the estimated reduced-form effects of


infant’s race, the sampling errors on the IV estimates for black infants were too large for a reliable conclusion.
38
   These specifications were chosen for two related reasons. First, while the estimates are insensitive to including
additional controls to these specifications, their sampling errors increase. Second, the decrease in precision is
exacerbated when the analysis is limited to the smaller numbers of counties with 1970 TSPs levels just above and
below the regulatory threshold.
39
   In each case, nonattainment counties account for about half of the sample. Picking different subsamples (e.g., 45-
105 µg/m3, 50-100 µg/m3, etc.) leads to nearly identical results.
40
   The unadjusted Wald IV estimate (sampling error) for this subsample is 12.8 (8.5). The corresponding IV

                                                         27
nonattainment status are significant at the one-percent level for the change in TSPs and at the five-percent

level for the change in infant mortality rates (results available from the authors). We conclude that TSPs

air pollution appears to have a causal impact on infant survival rates in the first year of life.



D. Evidence on the Pathophysiologic Mechanism

         We now attempt to shed light on the pathophysiologic mechanism that underlies the TSPs-infant

mortality relation. 41 In particular, we examine whether fetal exposure during pregnancy may account for

a portion of the harmful effects of TSPs air pollution. It is thought that most fatalities that occur during

the perinatal period – variously defined as beginning with completion of the 20th to 28th week of gestation

and ending 7 to 28 days after birth – can be attributed to poor fetal development. Thus, the estimated

effect of TSPs reductions on death rates within 28 days and 24 hours of birth may provide evidence on

this potential biological pathway. Moreover, there is strong evidence that maternal cigarette smoking can

retard fetal development and reduce the birth weight of infants (Sexton and Hebel 1984, Torelli 2000).

Consequently, we also examine the effects of TSPs changes on infant birth weight.42

         The second and third panels of Table 7 report the estimated effects of TSPs on the 28-day

(neonatal) and 1-day mortality rates, respectively, based on the same specifications as in the first panel.

The numbers in brackets are equal to the ratio of the panel’s estimated TSPs coefficient to the 1-year

mortality coefficient multiplied by 100. These represent the fraction of the overall infant mortality effect

of TSPs that can be attributed to deaths soon after birth.


estimates (sampling errors) for the 120 counties with 1970 geometric mean TSPs between 65-85 µg/m3 are 17.6
(15.2), 20.3 (17.1), and 28.6 (28.9). Although nonattainment counties had a 8-unit greater decline in TSPs than
attainment counties in the 65-85 µg/m3 subsample, the first-stage coefficient on the 1972 nonattainment variable is
not significant at conventional levels.
41
   There exists little evidence in the biological literature on the causal pathways through which air pollution impacts
human health (Utell and Samet 1996) and almost no evidence on how it might affect infant health. Controlled
experiments on animals ranging from guinea pigs to monkeys provide the strongest evidence on a potential
mechanism. These studies find that air pollution exposure can cause a constriction of the bronchial system that
impairs lung functioning (Amdur 1996). Although consistent with some non-experimental evidence for humans, it
is not clear that these findings can be extrapolated to human adults or infants.
42
   With daily TSPs data and linked individual-level natality and mortality data, in principle one might examine
whether abrupt changes in TSPs concentrations in particular months of a pregnancy have differential impacts on
birth weight and mortality. Unfortunately, such data are not available for the years covered in this study. Machine-
readable data on fetal deaths are also unavailable for this period.

                                                          28
        For neonatal mortality, the estimates in the first two columns, based on all counties, imply that a

1-µg/m3 decline in TSPs results in 4.2-6.6 fewer deaths within one month of birth (per 100,000 births).

Though the estimates are only significant at the 15-percent level, they suggest that 50-60 percent of the

effect of TSPs on infant mortality is due to reductions in neonatal mortality. As the analysis focuses on

the subsets of counties with 1970 TSPs levels near the regulatory ceiling, however, the estimated effects

on neonatal mortality increase monotonically. Among counties with 1970 TSPs levels between 60-90

µg/m3, the estimated neonatal mortality effect rises to 12.5, and is significant at the 8-percent level though

based on many fewer counties. Further, the estimate is insensitive to adjustment for unrestricted state-

time effects, and its standard error increases by relatively little given the small sample size.

        The estimates in the final two columns imply that 73-82 percent of the effect of regulation-

induced declines in TSPs near the nonattainment discontinuity can be attributed to reductions in neonatal

deaths. This result corresponds with the finding of Chay and Greenstone (2003) that roughly 80 percent

of the overall effect of recession-induced TSPs changes is due to neonatal mortality reductions. It is also

consistent with the possibility that maternal exposure to TSPs during the gestation period may affect fetal

development and health.

        On the other hand, the third panel of the table shows that 24-hour mortality rates have little

statistical association with regulation-induced changes in TSPs. The point estimates are smaller in

magnitude than the sampling errors and imply that reductions in one-day mortality account for, at most,

22 percent of the overall improvement in infant mortality. This result differs somewhat from Chay and

Greenstone (2003), who find significant one-day mortality effects that account for roughly 60 percent of

the overall decline in infant mortality. While not significant, the point estimates for the counties

bordering the regulatory discontinuity in the final two columns are similar to those in Chay and

Greenstone (2003). On net, however, these results leave open the possibility that infant exposure to

particulates pollution in the days immediately after birth may partially drive our estimated effects.

        A criticism of research on air pollution and adult mortality is that temporarily elevated pollution

levels may just hasten the death of adults who are already dying, implying minimal loss in life

expectancy. If this phenomenon, also known as “harvesting”, is important in our context, then the

                                                      29
association between TSPs reductions and infant death should disappear as one examines longer periods

after birth. Table 7 shows, however, that the estimated effects of TSPs increase as the period since birth

lengthens. This is inconsistent with harvesting driving our findings and suggests that the regulation-

induced decline in TSPs had long-run effects on life expectancy.

         To further address the possibility that the pathophysiologic mechanism is related to fetal

exposure, we estimated the association between the regulation-induced TSPs changes and infant birth

weight using the same specifications as in Tables 6 and 7 (results available from the authors). We found

little systematic association between TSPs and the incidences of either low (less than 2500 grams) or very

low (less than 1500 grams) birth weights. The estimates were small in magnitude and insignificant at

conventional levels.

         These findings, which are very similar to those documented in Chay and Greenstone (2003),

imply that TSPs pollution has a much larger impact on infant mortality than on birth weight. 43 To the

extent that birth weight is a perfect index of health at birth, this would suggest that postnatal exposure,

and not fetal exposure, to TSPs has the most harmful effects on infants. However, Almond, Chay, and

Lee (2002) provide evidence that birth weight may not be as reliable a proxy for health at birth as

previously thought.44 Since “conditions arising in the perinatal period” are the leading cause of infant

death during our time frame, we conclude that fetal exposure may still be a plausible biological pathway.

Further, these results contrast sharply with the documented effects of maternal cigarette smoking on

infant health and suggest that TSPs pollution works through a different causal mechanism. 45




43
   The estimated effect of TSPs on infant mortality falls very little when controls for average birth weight and eight
birth weight category dummies are included in the specifications in Table 7. This implies that most of the effect of
TSPs on infant mortality is independent of their effect on birth weight.
44
   Almond, Chay, and Lee (2002) provide evidence that the 5-minute APGAR – a diagnostic test administered
immediately after birth that scores newborn’s heart rate, respiratory effort, muscle tone, reflex irritability, and color
– may be a more reliable proxy for health at birth than birth weight. Unfortunately, the Natality files do not contain
data on APGAR scores until the 1978 survey year. Chay and Greenstone (2003) find that TSPs reductions during
the 1980-1982 recession have much larger impacts on APGAR scores than on birth weight.
45
   Torelli (2000) finds that while maternal smoking has a strong association with reduced birth weight, it is
uncorrelated with infant mortality after adjustment for confounding factors. Cigarette smoking during pregnancy is
thought to slow fetal growth by depriving the fetus of oxygen.

                                                           30
        Before proceeding, we note that our estimates of the birth weight effects of TSPs may be biased

down due to censoring. Specifically, if declines in TSPs also reduce the likelihood of a miscarriage or

stillbirth, then conditioning on fetuses that survive to birth will lead to selection bias. The birth weight

estimates will be understated if a disproportionate number of the marginal fetuses that survive are in the

low end of the birth weight distribution. Similarly, our estimates of the mortality effects may also be

understated, since the sample of live births could include a higher fraction of infants with low survival

probabilities.



E. Tests of the Internal Validity of the Findings

        This study has used comparisons between attainment and nonattainment counties to estimate the

causal effect of TSPs on infant mortality. However, as is always the case with a non-experimental design,

there is a form of unobserved heterogeneity that can explain the findings without a causal interpretation.

In addition to the efforts presented above, we probed the robustness of the estimates in a number of other

ways but found little evidence that undermines our basic conclusions. Table 8 presents the results of

some of these validity checks.

        First, there is no obvious causal pathway linking air pollution to external causes of infant death,

such as accidents and homicides. Thus, we use the estimated effects of TSPs changes on external infant

mortality rates to evaluate the internal consistency of the findings above. While a weak association does

not prove that the estimated effects of TSPs on infant mortality are causal, a significant, positive relation

would suggest that the analysis is biased by omitted factors that coincided with the regulation-induced

TSPs reductions from 1971-72.

        The first panel of Table 8 presents instrumental variables estimates of the impact of TSPs changes

on external infant mortality rates. The specifications and sample restrictions are identical to those in

Table 7. All six columns of the table show a small and insignificant negative correlation between

regulations-induced TSPs changes and external mortality rates. These results provide no evidence that

our estimates in Tables 6 and 7 are the result of spurious relations.



                                                      31
        Second, an alternative explanation for our findings is that the regulation-induced changes in TSPs

coincided with unobserved improvements in medical technologies specific to newborns. 46 This

explanation would only be valid if, for example, the supply of medical care facilities for neonates in

counties above the regulatory threshold was expanded or upgraded between 1971 and 1972 relative to the

supply in counties below the threshold. In an effort to control for this possibility, we collected data on the

number of hospitals with “premature nurseries” in 1971 and 1972 for each of the counties in our sample.

These data were hand-entered from the 1972 and 1973 editions of the American Hospital Association

Guides to the Health Care Field.47 To the best of our knowledge, these measures of neonatal medical

technology have not been previously collected for this period.

        The second panel of Table 8 contains the estimated effects of TSPs on infant mortality from

instrumental variables specifications that add the 1971-1972 change in the county-level number of

“premature nurseries” to the controls used in Table 7. The coefficient estimates and their standard errors

are nearly identical to those in Table 7. This finding is robust to also controlling for the 1971 and 1972

levels of “premature nurseries” separately. If the number of premature nurseries is a valid proxy for

neonatal medical technologies, then it is evident that this paper’s results are not due to changes in the

availability of these technologies.

        Third, our implementation of the regression discontinuity design in Table 7 relies on the

assumption that the omitted variables are “held constant” in the neighborhood of the regulatory threshold.

Another possibility is that the unobservables change “smoothly” in this neighborhood. In this case, it

may be possible to control for these unobservables by including smooth functions of the geometric mean

of TSPs in the regulation selection year as covariates. Here, the instrumental variables estimate of the

effect of TSPs is identified only by the discrete changes that occur at the nonattainment threshold.




46
   See Cutler and Meara (1999) on the importance of improvements in medical technology in reducing infant
mortality rates among low weight births.
47
   The 1972 (1973) guide reports information on the characteristics of hospitals during the 12-month period ending
September 30, 1971 (1972). The guides define a premature nursery as, “A separate facility used exclusively for the
care of infants whose birth weight is 2500 grams or less.”

                                                        32
        The third panel of Table 8 presents IV estimates from specifications that add the geometric mean

of TSPs in 1970 and its square to the controls used in Table 7. The estimates of the TSPs effects are

generally larger than the comparable estimates in Table 7. However, due to the large increase in the

sampling errors, none of the estimates would be judged to be statistically significant at conventional

levels. While the imprecision of the estimates precludes strong conclusions, it underscores that this

specification is very demanding of the data and may be too flexible. Nevertheless, these results are

consistent with our previous findings of a robust effect of regulation-induced TSPs changes. 48

        Fourth, we obtained a second measure of TSPs-specific regulatory pressure. In August 1973, the

EPA published a report containing the particulates “Priority Classifications” for Air Quality Control

Regions (AQCRs) in the United States (U.S. EPA 1973). The country was divided into 247 AQCRs,

implying an average of over 12 counties in each AQCR. A Priority Classification of I or IA for

particulate matter indicates that TSPs concentrations are “most severe.” It is likely that the I and IA areas

were subject to greater regulatory scrutiny than the remainder of the country. Consequently, we created

an alternative regulation variable that is equal to 1 if the county is located in a TSPs Priority I or IA

AQCR and 0 otherwise.49 It should be noted that this regulatory measure is less than ideal for our

purposes since it was published in 1973, the year after our 1971-1972 evaluation period. Nonetheless,

when this variable is used as an instrument, we find estimated TSPs effects that are greater than those in

Table 6 (results available from the authors). However, since there are nearly 3-times fewer AQCRs than

counties, the sampling errors increase substantially.

        We also performed several other robustness checks. These include: controlling for lagged values

of the infant mortality rate; controlling for the 1971 levels of the variables instead of the 1971-72 changes

in order to avoid adjusting for “post-treatment” factors; using TSPs measures that are based only on the

monitoring sites (defined by longitude and latitude) that were in operation in both 1971 and 1972; and




48
   The estimates from specifications that include a cubic in the geometric mean of 1970 TSPs are qualitatively
similar, but generally have much larger sampling errors.
49
   See the Data Appendix for more details on AQCRs and the determination of our measures of regulation.

                                                         33
adjusting for a full set of AQCR fixed effects. Our qualitative findings are robust to all of these

specification checks.

         Finally, it is still possible that the TSPs nonattainment regulations caused changes in unmeasured

determinants of infant mortality rates, such as other air quality indices.50 In this case, the instrumental

variables estimates will represent the combined effect of changes in TSPs and other air pollutants. Even

in this situation, however, our results may still provide the “true” reduced-form effect of nonattainment

status on infant mortality. In particular, any competing explanation must exhibit similar “trend breaks” to

those shown in Figures 5B and 6 in order to be viable. This would seem to rule out many alternative

hypotheses for the infant mortality reductions associated with 1972 nonattainment status.



                VI. Estimates of the Economic Benefits of the Clean Air Act Regulations

         Overall, it appears that the 1970 Clean Air Act Amendments resulted in substantial health

benefits for infants during the first year that it was in force. Here, we monetize these health

improvements and discuss their implications for the optimal design of particulates regulations.

         As discussed above, the results imply that roughly 1,300 fewer infants died in 1972 than would

have in the absence of the 1970 Act. When a statistical life is valued at $1.6 million to $8.5 million

($1997), this reduction in infant mortality is worth approximately $2.1-11.1 billion ($1997).51 To the

extent that this reduction in TSPs was permanent (recall Figure 1), these benefits would have accrued in

each of the 30 years since then. In this case and assuming a 5% discount rate, the present discounted

value of these health improvements ranged between $34-180 billion ($1997). Since this calculation

ignores the other health and aesthetic benefits associated with lower pollution levels, it is likely to



50
   In the process of abating TSPs, industrial polluters may also reduce their emissions of other forms of air pollution
that affect infant mortality. Data limitations preclude us from exploring this possibility rigorously. In 1971 and
1972 only 10 counties were monitored for all of the other pollutants regulated under the 1970 CAAAs. Further, the
numbers of counties monitored for TSPs and just one of the other regulated pollutants are 75 for carbon monoxide,
14 for ozone, 64 for sulfur dioxide, and 47 for nitrogen dioxide.
51
   Viscusi’s (1993) review of the literature suggests that the value of a statistical life ranges from $3.5 - $8.5 million
($1997), but recent research by Ashenfelter and Greenstone (2001) indicates that it may be less than $1.6 million
($1997). Notably, these estimates are based on the risk of death among adults. There is an active line of research on
how the value of a statistical life varies over the life-cycle.

                                                           34
understate the total economic value of the regulation-induced TSPs reductions.52 Further, it ignores the

benefits of any further reductions in TSPs caused by the Clean Air Act limits in later years. Of course, a

full cost-benefit analysis also requires precise information about the costs of these regulations.53

        This study’s results may also be informative about the form of the optimal particulates standard.

As discussed in the introduction, the EPA’s standard of 75 µg/m3 for annual geometric mean TSPs

concentrations was chosen to “protect the public health”. The optimality of this standard depends on how

the infant mortality-TSPs gradient and the marginal cost of abating TSPs vary with the ambient

concentration of TSPs. Here we discuss the former and leave the latter for future research.

        Taken literally, Figure 6 implies that although there are significant health benefits to a reduction

in TSPs at very high concentrations, the marginal benefit of a unit change is greater at TSPs levels below

100 µg/m3. Specifically, Table 7 shows that a unit reduction in TSPs results in about 15 fewer infant

deaths per 100,000 live births at TSPs concentrations slightly above 75 µg/m3. Although this paper’s

research design does not allow for identification of the infant mortality-TSPs gradient below this

threshold, Chay and Greenstone (2003) document that TSPs have substantial effects on infant health at

concentrations below 75 µg/m3. This suggests that a federal air quality standard below 75 µg/m3 could

have provided additional health benefits to the public.



                                                VII. Conclusion

        We use the air quality improvements induced by the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970 to

estimate the impact of particulates pollution on infant mortality. The federal air pollution regulations are

associated with sharp reductions in both TSPs pollution and infant mortality rates in the first year that the

1970 CAAAs were in force. We estimate that a one percent decline in TSPs results in a 0.5 percent

decline in the infant mortality rate. Most of the reduction in infant mortality is driven by a decline in

deaths occurring within one month of birth, suggesting that fetal exposure during pregnancy is a

52
   Chay and Greenstone (2000) use a hedonic analysis to value a similar reduction in mean TSPs associated with
nonattainment status in the mid-1970s. They calculated a $65 billion ($1997) willingness-to-pay for this change.

biological pathway. The results are robust to a battery of tests of the validity of the estimates. Most

importantly, there are discrete differences in TSPs and infant mortality changes between counties just

above and just below the legislated air quality standard, suggesting that the regulations are a causal factor.

        This study provides direct and easily interpreted estimates of the air quality and infant health

benefits of the 1970 Act. The results imply that TSPs have substantial effects on infant health at

concentrations near the EPA-mandated air quality standard and that roughly 1,300 fewer infants died in

1972 than would have in the absence of the Act. Further, this study’s findings cross-validate the findings

of our earlier work that utilized the recession-induced pollution reductions of the early 1980s (Chay and

Greenstone 2003).

        It has been hypothesized that fine particles have more pernicious effects on human health than

large particles. Due to its biological plausibility, in recent years the EPA has shifted its focus away from

the regulation of TSPs (defined as all particles with diameters less than 100 µm) and toward the

regulation of finer particles. Specifically, the particulate matter standard was changed to apply to

particles less than 10 µm in diameter (PM10) in 1987 and then to particles less than 2.5 µm in diameter

(PM2.5) in 1997. Since the EPA did not begin to monitor fine particles until the mid-1980s, this study

cannot determine the relative contributions of small and large particles to infant mortality rates.

        However, the CAAA regulations were focused on industrial and fuel-combustion related

emissions, which are disproportionately comprised of small particles (see U.S. EPA, 1983). Thus, the

design in this paper may be predominantly utilizing changes in fine particulates pollution, though this is

speculative at best. Direct evidence on this question would provide invaluable information on the likely

efficacy of current regulatory policy in the U.S. It may also be helpful in developing a credible theory of

the biological pathways through which air pollution impacts infant health (e.g., how airborne particulates

may affect fetal development before birth).

                                             DATA APPENDIX

Variables from 1969-1974 National Mortality Detail Files
        The 1969-1974 National Mortality Detail Files are an annual census of deaths in the U.S, derived
from the Standard Certificate of Death. The data contain the universe of deaths and information on the
deceased’s county of residence, race, gender, age at death, and cause of death. Since infant deaths cannot
be directly linked to individual births for this period, the microdata are aggregated into race-gender-age at
death by county of residence cells. The total number of infant deaths (deaths within 1-day, 28 days, and
1-year of birth) within a demographic-county cell is used as the numerator for the infant mortality rate.

Variables from 1969-1974 National Natality Detail Files
         The 1969-1974 National Natality Detail Files are an annual census of births in the U.S, derived
from the Standard Certificate of Live Birth. Each file contains the universe of births and information on
the county of residence of the mother, socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of the parents, the
mother’s usage of medical services, the health endowment and medical history of the mother, and the
infant health endowment. The microdata on births are aggregated into race-gender by maternal county of
residence cells. The total number of births within a demographic-county cell is used as the denominator
for the infant mortality rate.
         The following variables are included as controls in specifications labeled “Unrestricted Natality”

        3500-3999, 4000-4499, 4500+


Total Suspended Particulates (TSPs) Pollution Data
         The data on suspended particulates pollution levels in each county were obtained by filing a
Freedom of Information Act request with the EPA. This yielded the Quick Look Report data file, which is
derived from the EPA’s Air Quality Subsystem (AQS) database. This file contains the universe of
recordings of TSPs pollution concentrations from each of the EPA air monitors that were located
throughout the U.S. during the period of interest, as well as the location of each monitor. For each
county, the annual concentration of TSPs used in this study is the weighted average of the annual
arithmetic means of each monitor in the county, with the number of observations per monitor used as
weights. A monitor observation is the concentration recorded over a 24 hour period.
         Our analysis relies on the presumption that the TSPs concentration readings used accurately
reflect the “true” exposure of individuals to TSPs. To preclude the possibility that counties or states place
monitors to fabricate the appearance of favorable pollution concentrations, the Code of Federal
Regulations contains very precise criteria that govern the siting of a monitor.54 Among the most
important criteria is that the monitors capture representative pollution concentrations in high population
areas. Moreover, the EPA must approve the location of all monitors and requires documentation that the
monitors are actually placed in the approved locations.


Nonattainment Data
        We attempted to obtain a list of the counties where the EPA applied the TSPs nonattainment
designation (and the accompanying regulations) in the first year(s) that the 1970 CAAAs were in force.
Despite extensive examinations of publicly available documents and conversations with EPA personnel,
we were unable to locate such a list. Consequently, we developed a rule for assigning counties 1972
TSPs attainment-nonattainment designations based on our understanding of the EPA’s selection rule in
that year. This subsection describes why our primary measure of regulation is defined at the county-level
and then explains our assignment rule for 1972.


54
 This discussion results from the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) 1995, title 40, part 58 and a conversation with
Manny Aquilania and Bob Palorino of the EPA’s District 9 Regional Office.

                                                        38
A County-Based Definition of Nonattainment Status
          The determination of the geographic area at which the nonattainment regulations were applied is
the first step in the development of our nonattainment database. The CAAAs required the division of the
country into Air Quality Control Regions (AQCR). This led to the creation of 247 AQCRs, meaning that
on average there are roughly 12 counties in each AQCR. Statutorily, each state is required to submit to
the EPA a plan for the implementation and enforcement of the NAAQS within each AQCR or “portions
thereof” (Reitze Jr. 2001, p. 50). This language is ambiguous as to whether nonattainment designations
were applied at the AQCR level or a smaller geographic unit, such as the county.
          We chose to assign attainment-nonattainment status at the county level. This assumes that the
states designed their SIPs to reduce TSPs concentrations in the counties of an AQCR that exceeded the
NAAQS and considered the remaining counties in an AQCR as attainment areas. We believe that this is a
reasonable assumption, because it requires that states and the EPA attempted to achieve the NAAQS in
the most cost efficient manner—that is, they only applied the more costly nonattainment regulations in the
counties within an AQCR that exceeded the NAAQS. Further, the EPA began to annually publish the
attainment-nonattainment status of each U.S. county in 1978, making it apparent that nonattainment status
officially varied at the county-level in that year and all subsequent ones. We believe that it is reasonable
to presume that the nonattainment regulations were also applied at the county-level in earlier years.
          Interestingly, there is substantial variation in our 1972 county-level TSPs nonattainment
designations within AQCRs. The intra-AQCR correlation in 1972 TSPs nonattainment status is only
0.21. Despite this intra-AQCR variation, we find that our basic results are insensitive to the use of
AQCR-based definitions of nonattainment status. The “Tests of Internal Validity” subsection discusses
these results further.

The Assignment Rule for 1972 County-Level TSPs Attainment-Nonattainment Status
         The dates associated with the passage and enforcement of the 1970 CAAAs guided our
determination of the 1972 TSPs attainment-nonattainment designations. Richard Nixon signed the 1970
CAAAs on December 31, 1970. Four months later on April 30, 1971, the EPA announced the final
publication of the NAAQS that specified the national TSPs standards. On August 14, 1971, the EPA
published, “Requirements for Preparation, Adoption, and Submittal of Implementation Plans,” in the
Code of Federal Regulations (CFR). This set forth how states were to write their SIPs to achieve
compliance with the NAAQS by 1975. Finally, the SIPs were due to the EPA in January, 1972.
Appendix Table 1 summarizes these dates.
         These dates have two implications for our analysis. First, it is evident that the nonattainment
regulations could not be enforced until 1972 as they were not written until January, 1972. This is
supported by an EPA publication that states that any improvements in air quality through 1971 are “most
probably” not the result of the CAAAs (U.S. EPA 1973, p. 2-2). Second, we suspect that the states
ascertained the identity of the counties with TSPs concentrations above the NAAQS while writing their
SIPs during the second half of 1971. We assume that they must have relied on the available TSPs
concentrations data, which was from 1970. Consequently, we treat 1972 as the first year that the CAAAs
were in force and assume that 1970 TSPs concentrations were used to determine TSPs attainment-
nonattainment designations for 1972.
         To implement this selection rule, we use data from the same network of TSPs monitors used by
the states and the EPA in this period. We designate a county as 1972 TSPs nonattainment if the monitor
with the highest recorded 1970 concentration in that county exceeds either of the TSPs thresholds
specified in the NAAQS. All other monitored counties are attainment. We use the readings from the
monitor with the highest concentration, rather than an average across monitors, to provide a “liberal”
definition of nonattainment status. This is because we assume that the states and the EPA felt pressure to
meet the 1975 deadline for compliance with the NAAQS and wanted to have a margin for error. It is
noteworthy that the estimated effects of TSPs on infant mortality rates are generally smaller but still
statistically significant when the average across all monitors within a county is used to determine
nonattainment status.

                                                    39
County-Level Per-Capita Income Data
         Ideally, data would be available on the incomes of women giving birth in each county. In its
absence, the analysis uses the Bureau of Economic Analysis’ annual county-level series on per-capita
income (deflated to $1982-84). It is “the sum of wage and salary disbursements, other labor income,
proprietors’ income with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, rental income of
persons with capital consumption adjustment, personal dividend income, and transfer payments to
persons, less personal contribution for social insurance” (Bureau of Economic Analysis 1994). This is the
most comprehensive measure of income available at the county level and is superior to less broad
measures, such as labor income, which do not capture all of the resources available to individuals.
         We also have annual, county-level data on per-capita net earnings, the ratio of total employment
to the total population, and the ratio of total manufacturing employment to the total population.

County-Level Data on Transfer Payments
        From the Regional Economic Information System (REIS), we obtained county-level information
on medical transfer payments and payments for income maintenance and unemployment insurance. The
analysis controls for each of the following payment sub-categories, in terms of per-capita payments (in
$1982-84):

Total transfer payments per-capita
Total medical care payments per-capita
Public assistance medical care payments for low income individuals (primarily Medicaid and state and
         local government general assistance medical programs)
Income maintenance benefit payments per-capita
Family assistance payments per-capita (includes AFDC)
Food stamps payments per-capita
Unemployment Insurance (UI) benefit payments per-capita

Notes: Very low birth weight is defined as a birth weight less than 1,500 grams; low birth weight is less than
2,500 grams. The potential sample is limited to the 501 counties with TSPs data in 1970, 1971 and 1972. In
any given year, the sample is further restricted to counties with nonmissing TSPs and infant mortality values.
All sample means are weighted by the total number of births in the county. See the Data Appendix for
information on sources and more details on how the variables were calculated.

Notes: See notes to Table 1. Entries are the differences in the weighted means of the variables (where the weight is the total number of births) across two sets of counties. The
standard errors of the differences are in parentheses and allow for unequal variances between county groups. The first column contains the mean differences in 1971 levels
between counties with 1971 TSPs concentrations above and below the median 1971 county-level TSPs concentration. The next two columns contain the mean differences in 1971
levels and 1971-72 changes between counties with a 1971-72 change in TSPs that is below and above the median change in TSPs. The final four columns compare 1971 levels
and 1971-72 changes between nonattainment and attainment counties. The sample consists of the 501 counties with non-missing TSPs data in 1970, 1971 and 1972, except in the
final two columns where the sample is further restricted to the 176 counties with 1970 geometric mean TSPs concentrations between 60 and 90 micrograms-per-cubic meter.

Notes: See notes to Table 1. Numbers in brackets are the number of counties and R-squareds of the regressions, respectively.
The potential sample is limited to the 501 counties with TSPs data in 1970, 1971 and 1972. In a given year, the sample is further
restricted to counties with nonmissing covariates. Sampling errors are estimated using the Eicker-White formula to correct for
heteroskedasticity. The sampling errors in the “1969-1974 Pooled” row are also corrected for county-level clustering in the
residuals over time. Regressions are weighted by numbers of births in each county. Internal causes of death arise from common
health problems, such as respiratory and cardiopulmonary deaths. The control variables are listed in the Data Appendix and in
Table 1. State Effects are separate indicator variables for each state. Bold text indicates that the null hypothesis that the estimate
is equal to zero can be rejected at the 5% level.

Notes: In the first panel the regressions are based on pooled data and include county indicator variables as controls. In the second
panel the regressions are based on first-differenced data. Standard errors are estimated using the Eicker-White formula to correct
for heteroskedasticity. Regressions are weighted by numbers of births in each county and year in the first panel and the sum of
total births in 1971 and 1972 in the second panel. Bold text indicates that the null hypothesis that the estimate is equal to zero
can be rejected at the 5% level.

Notes: The dependent variables are the 1971-72 first-differences of mean TSPs pollution and 1971-72 first-differences in infant
deaths due to internal causes per 100,000 live births. Nonattainment in 1972 is an indicator variable equal to one if the county
had TSPs concentrations above the federal air quality standard for TSPs in 1970. Standard errors are estimated using the Eicker-
White formula to correct for heteroskedasticity. Regressions are weighted by numbers of births in each county and year.

Notes: The dependent variables are the 1971-72 first-differences in the number of infant deaths due to internal causes within one-
year, 28-days, and 24-hours of birth (per 100,000 live births). The columns correspond to subsamples of counties with annual
geometric mean readings of TSPs in 1970 in the specified range. Results are from two-stage least squares estimation, with 1971-
72 changes in mean TSPs instrumented by nonattainment status in 1972. Estimated standard errors allow for heteroskedasticity
and are in parentheses. In the second and third panels, the ratio of that panel’s estimated coefficient to the first panel’s coefficient
is reported in brackets. Regressions are weighted by numbers of births in each county and year.

Notes: In the first panel, the dependent variable is the 1971-72 first-differences in number of infant deaths due to external causes,
such as accidents and homicides, within one-year of birth (per 100,000 live births). In the second panel, each specification
includes a control for the change in the county-level number of “premature nurseries.” In the third panel, each specification
controls for the geometric mean of TSPs in 1970 and its square. The columns correspond to subsamples of counties with annual
geometric mean readings of TSPs in 1970 in the specified range. Results are from two-stage least squares estimation, with 1971-
72 changes in mean TSPs instrumented by nonattainment status in 1972. Estimated standard errors allow for heteroskedasticity.
Regressions are weighted by numbers of births in each county and year.
