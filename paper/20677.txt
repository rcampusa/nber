                                              ABSTRACT

Formal attribution provides a means of recognizing scientific contributions as well as allocating scientific
credit. This paper examines the processes by which attribution arises and its interaction with market
assessments of the relative contributions of members of scientific teams and communities – a topic
of interest organizational economics of science and in understanding scientific labor markets. We
demonstrate that a pioneer or senior scientist’s decision to co-author with a follower or junior scientist
depends critically on market attributions as well as the timing of the co-authoring decision. This results
in multiple equilibrium outcomes each with different implications for expected quality of research
projects. However, we demonstrate that the Pareto efficient organisational regime is for the follower
researcher to be granted co-authorship contingent on their own performance without any earlier pre-
commitment to formal attribution. We then compare this with the alternative for the pioneer of publishing
their contribution and being rewarded through citations to back to it. While in some equilibria (especially
where co-authoring commitments are possible) there is no advantage to interim publication, in others
this can increase expected research quality.

1      Introduction

       The reward structure in science is determined by a series of norms at the heart of

which is peer recognition:

       Recognition of what one has accomplished is thus largely a motive derived from
       institutional emphases. Recognition for originality becomes socially validated
       testimony that one has successfully lived up to the most exacting requirements of
       one’s role as scientist. The self-image of the individual scientist will also depend
       greatly on the appraisals by his scientific peers of the extent to which he has lived
       up to this exacting and critically important aspect of his role. As Darwin once
       phrased it, “My love of natural science … has been much aided by the ambition to
       be esteemed by my fellow naturalists.” (Merton, 1957)

At least in part, recognition incentives come from the notion of priority – being the

acknowledged pioneer of a piece of scientific knowledge. But evaluating the degree of

recognition requires that an additional assessment be made by one’s peers – an assessment

of impact. While relatively simple for a single scientist, such as Darwin seeking esteem

from his colleagues, as scientific production is (now) rarely an isolated individual

endeavour, the assessment of individual recognition today also involves drawing

inferences regarding the relative contribution of different scientists to a particular

pioneering body of knowledge. In this regard, recognition is more than just a currency of

reward but a currency of attribution. Put another way, recognition is not a reward that can

be conferred on individual scientists without constraint; rather, it is a reward that must be

allocated among colleagues and co-authors.
                                                                                                               3


         Scientists have developed a number of mechanisms that play a critical role in

determining the allocation of recognition amongst them. 1 One such mechanism is co-

authorship. This arises when two scientists each contribute a sufficient amount to a research

output that they include both of their names in the contribution. In the simplest case,

attribution is then equally shared. In some areas, norms beyond co-authorship – particularly

name ordering – potentially influence attribution of relative contribution. Another

mechanism comes in the form of formal acknowledgement of contribution. To the extent

that scientific work builds on the work of other scholars, that prior contribution is generally

acknowledged in the form of a citation. But, even in this context, a citation can take a

variety of forms; from the briefest mention of influence to a more extended discussion of

the significance of prior work (although these nuances are rarely considered in today’s

citation counting approaches).

         If actual contribution were observable, then such formal mechanisms – co-

authorship and citation – would not play a role in the allocation of scientific rewards. In

reality, actual attribution is typically imperfectly observed and consequently, the signal

provided by formal attribution assists the “peer market” in assessing contribution. This

suggests that attribution has a market value. Moreover, that value is determined by

expectations and, in equilibrium, the process by which formal attribution is allocated. To

take an extreme example, if it was customary to permit scientists’ authorship even for

extremely small contributions, the market could infer little of their relative contribution



1
  The origins of peer recognition as central to the reward structure in science have been documented by David
(2008). He demonstrates that peer review emerged from the desire of scientific patrons to assess that the work
produced by their sponsored scholars was actually of high quality. From this evolved a set of social norms
that tied scientific achievement to peer recognition. Stern (2004) provides evidence of this socialization;
demonstrating that scientists sacrifice monetary income in order to participate in scientific activities (notably
publication and presentations) that confer peer recognition.
                                                                                                         4


from a particular scientist’s inclusion in the authorship group. In this situation, authorship

would have little or no value as a currency for attribution.2

        The value of scientific attribution as determined by the interaction between

scientific practice and the peer market itself determines and can be influenced by

instrumental factors; namely, the allocation of rewards and the consequent impact on

incentives of scientists to provide effort and attention (Dasgupta and David, 1994). In that

regard, the allocation of scientific attribution is akin to a determination of ownership over

the stream of credit associated with a research output (thus playing a role similar to equity

allocation among founders). Such allocation will have an impact on scientific incentives

(in a manner akin to Hart and Moore, 1990). However, beyond this, there is an interaction

between those incentives and market assessments of what formal attribution signals. If

formal attribution has a limited impact on incentives, it will also send a limited signal to

the market as to actual effort expended by scientists and hence, of relative contribution. In

other words, formal attribution is potentially fragile and vulnerable to a vicious cycle of

devaluation.

        Given all of this, it is perhaps surprising that economists have not turned their

attention to an understanding of the equity aspects of scientific rewards and precisely how

the market for scientific attribution operates.3 While there is past research in economics

that examines the effect of scientific rewards on incentives to produce research (e.g.,

Dasgupta and David, 1994), there are no papers that take a comprehensive examination of

the markets for scientific attribution. The closest paper is that of Engers, Gans, Grant and


2
  This is perhaps also why “self-citations” tend to carry less weight than external citations. See Gans and
Murray (2014) for no real discussion of this issue beyond the mention of the word “citation.”

  There is a literature on the allocation of credit as a managerial tool for incentivizing team performance
(Tumlinson, 2012), but this has been focused on issues of discrimination.
                                                                                              5


King (1999) whose model we build upon here. They examine the incentives of co-authors

with regard to name ordering on papers modelling a situation where co-authors can choose

to send a signal of relative contribution or alternatively to choose alphabetical ordering (as

is the norm in economics and much of the social sciences). They demonstrate that the signal

of relative contribution is muted when the market places some weight on alphabetical

ordering; something that damages the author with a “higher” name (such as Acemoglu)

relative to one with a “lower” name (such as Zuckerman). The end result could be a drive

towards alphabetical ordering and no market signal coming from name ordering. Here, we

consider a broader set of instruments for scientific attribution with a consequent set of

predictions for the production of most scientific knowledge (well beyond the social

sciences).

           The goal of the present paper is to provide an analysis that considers a market for

attribution that interacts with various organisational regimes for assigning formal

attribution (such as co-authorship and, later, citation). Our approach, motivated by the

general structure of scientific labs,4 is based on the interactions between a pioneer and

follower scientist. As Stephan (2012) documents, labs are often “owned” by a faculty

principal investigator (or PI) and employ a variety of other scientists and staff including

those formally in training such as PhD students as well as those engaged in staff-type

employment such as post-doctoral fellows. Importantly, output from the lab, whether

formally co-authored by the PI or not, is typically known as being undertaken in the PI’s

lab. Hence, here we consider a pioneer scientist as akin to the PI of a lab and a follower as

one of the employed scientists in the lab (such as a postdoc or graduate student).

    As opposed to narrower conceptions of collaboration considered by Engers et al. (1999).
                                                                                             6


Importantly, as Stephan (2012) notes, scientists might collaborate and contribute to a

project but not be listed as a co-author. This has raised concerns about exploitation, but

also this may impact on the incentives for different scientists in their collaborative efforts.

       In our setup, both the pioneer and follower scientists contribute effort that improves

the quality of research with a signal received as to their relative contributions. We explore

two mechanisms as to how that private signal is potentially translated into a market signal.

In the baseline model, the pioneer and follower scientists negotiate over whether both are

included as co-authors or not in the follow-on research. In an extension, the scientists

operate at arm’s length with a choice made by an editor as to formal attribution of the

pioneer in the form of a citation in the follower’s paper. The difference between the two

models is the weight each places on private factors versus social or efficiency factors in

determining attribution, and the environments modelled are ones where we expect private

(rather than social) factors to dominate.

       Our principal findings are as follows. First, a pioneer scientist’s choice of

committing to co-authorship prior to a project beginning depends on whether each

scientist’s efforts are complements in producing high quality research. When they are

substitutes, the pioneer chooses not to collaborate. Second, the set of outcomes whereby

fruitful collaboration can be facilitated is expanded when the pioneer can choose to

formally assign co-authorship at later stages. Indeed, by leaving the follower scientist

without formal co-authorship unless they contribute to a significant degree, the follower

(a) receives high-powered incentives to expend research effort and (b) can actually realise

a higher payoff than other organisational regimes. The latter effect comes from the fact that

when outsiders in the market know that follower co-authorship is assigned ex post in this
                                                                                          7


manner, they receive a perfect signal of the follower’s contribution if they are, in fact, a

co-author. However, this outcome is only possible if, in fact, the pioneer scientist can

commit to ex post co-authorship conditional on effort. Without that commitment, the

pioneer has an incentive to renege on their promises. Third, we demonstrate that, when

such commitment is not possible, an organisational mode whereby the pioneer publishes

their research contribution and the follower cites them in subsequent work can lead to the

same high-powered incentives so long as the editorial process is able to distil relative

contributions. Consequently, our results demonstrate that while practices of assigning co-

authorship later in the research production process can be optimal, when such regimes

cannot be committed to, a process that divides research outputs into readily identified and

solely “owned” constituent parts (or ‘slice’s as they are often known) can also generate

more efficient outcomes.

       The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section, we set up the model and our key

assumptions. Section 3 then examines equilibrium outcomes when the pioneer scientist is

choosing their co-authoring regime. Citations as an organization regime and reward

structure are considered in Section 4. Section 5 considers extensions while section 6 offers

conclusions.



2      Model Setup

       The production of research involves two sequential stages, t  {1, 2} where

scientists can generate either a routine or an exceptional contribution. Those contributions

then determine the overall quality of the research produced and both stages must be

performed for any useful research output to be generated.
                                                                                                           8


         In each stage, by expending effort, ei  [0,1] , a scientist, i, generates a contribution

to knowledge. The quality of the contribution at stage t, denoted St, can either be (H) or

(L). St = L, which arises with probability 1  ei , means that the stage 1 research was routine

whereas St = H, which arises with probability ei , means that it was exceptional. It is

assumed here that the costs incurred by a scientist at each stage are identical, specifically,

c(ei), with c (0)  0 , c, c  0 for all ei. Below we will rely upon the specific functional

form, c(ei )  12 ei2 , to derive closed form solutions, but all results here would hold for the

more general cost function specification.

         For simplicity, we assume that the significance of the stage 1 contribution does not

impact on the costs at stage 2. Instead, the contributions impact on the overall outcome that

may arise at the end of stage 2. Specifically, it assumed that research output can be of high

quality (V < 1), low quality (v < V) or no value (0). If (S1, S2) = (H, H), then research

output is V with certainty. If (S1, S2) = (H, L) or (L, H), then research output is v. Finally,

if (S1, S2) = (L, L), then research output has quality 0.5 The key feature of this specification

for the production of research is that the market does not receive a perfect signal of the

contribution at each stage from an observation of paper quality. Specifically, an

observation of paper quality, v, does not provide a signal, in itself, of whether an

exceptional contribution was produced in stage 1 or 2. Of course, one can imagine other

forms of signal obfuscation, and these will be explored below.

         Two asymmetries are introduced with respect to the two research stages. First, there

are two types of scientists: pioneers (P) and followers (F). Each is distinguished by their


5
  This specification involves a significant departure from Engers et al. (1999) who made the strong
assumption that the level of research quality was independent of the relative contribution of each scientist.
                                                                                                          9


skill competencies for a research stage. Followers can only engage in research for stage 2.6

Pioneers can engage in research in both stages but they have a diminished competency with

regards to stage 2. This is captured by assuming that a pioneer scientist cannot generate an

outcome where S2 = H. As a consequence, a pioneer scientist engages in no effort in stage

2 even for the case where they are the sole contributor to a project. The second asymmetry

is that the scientist conducting research at the second stage knows the quality of the

contribution made at the initial research stage. This is a standard assumption in models of

cumulative knowledge (Scotchmer, 2004).

         We focus on several critical decisions. First, as a pioneer scientist has the option to

collaborate with a follower, we consider P’s decision to collaborate or not. This mirrors

the authority relationship in a laboratory that is our motivation in this paper. Second, a

collaboration can result in a formal acknowledgement of that in the form of co-authorship.

This is a choice, as many collaborations in a lab environment involve some discretion as

to whether a follower is acknowledged as a co-author or not. Third, the timing and nature

of the co-authoring contract may be discretionary. For instance, the collaboration and co-

authoring decisions may be made ex ante, interim or ex post. An ex ante co-authoring

commitment is a contract to include both scientists as authors prior to effort being expended

by either. An interim commitment occurs after the pioneer scientist’s contribution has been

resolved. Finally, an ex post commitment occurs after both scientists’ contributions have

been resolved. The latter may take the form of an incentive commitment to the follower

who, say, receives co-authorship only if S2 = H and not otherwise. These decisions may

not all be feasible (i.e., capable of the required commitments) and will depend on the


6
 It could only add a little descriptive complexity to allow followers to conduct research at stage 1 without
any changes to the results that follow.
                                                                                              10


scientists involved, but they span a wide range of the options available. To build

understanding, we will focus on particular cases where different decisions are feasible.


2.1     Market Attribution

        What drives the incentives of scientists is, of course, attribution “awarded” to them

by the “market.” Following Engers et al. (1999), this is something that we assume enters

directly into a scientist’s utility function. That is, a scientist can infer, through interactions

with other scientists, what their assessment is of them. Thus, we need not model any active

assessment by the market for some purpose but only the impact of such an assessment. Of

course, one can imagine microfoundations for this process, including assessment of career

concerns of junior scientists, the salary determination of all scientists or some sociological

model of acknowledgement and peer recognition. However, the important feature here is

that the scientists’ themselves care about attribution from the market and so we assume

that is a component of their utility.

        In making an assessment, it is assumed that the market (a) knows the roles (or

competencies) of each scientist in a team and (b) assesses both the quality of a project and

also forms beliefs over each scientist’s relative contribution. The rationale for (a) is that

the project is coming out of P’s lab and so P’s status, role and competency are broadly

understood. In an extension below, we consider what happens when the market does not

have knowledge of the roles or competencies of each scientist.

        With regard to (b), we assume that, if the market observes a paper of quality V, it

correctly infers that the contribution of both scientists was H and, more critically, equal.

Thus, the market will assign each an equal share of the paper’s “award.” In contrast, if the

market observes a paper of quality, v, that was the output of a collaboration, it faces a more
                                                                                                               11


difficult inference problem. We will examine the outcome of that below. However, here

we assume that if the market knew with certainty that (S1,S2) = (H,L), then it would

attribute the entire value of the paper to P and, similarly, if it knew that (S1,S2) = (L,H), it

would attribute the entire value of the paper to F. The rationale here is that without the H

contribution, the paper’s value would be 0 and so the “marginal” contribution of the H

contributing scientist is v. It should be noted that these attribution rules are assumptions

but that the results below still apply for variations of those rules.

         Of course, market assessments of the contribution of each scientist in a

collaboration will depend on the nature of decisions open to them. Thus, like scientist roles,

we will make different assumptions of the market’s understanding of the nature of

attribution decisions scientists can feasibly choose. The modelling challenge, outlined

below, is to match these with assessments of contribution. It is assumed that the market

never observes (S1, S2) but can observe research quality and whether formal attribution of

a co-authoring relationship is given. Based on this information, the market attributes a share

of research value, V or  v as the case may be, to the pioneer and a share 1  V or 1   v

to the follower.7

         Given this, if the scientists knew they would be co-authoring ex ante, they would

choose their effort levels to maximize the following payoffs:

               P  eP  eF ( H )ˆVV  (1  eF ( H ))ˆvv   (1  eP )eF ( L)ˆvv  c(eP ) and

        F  eP  eF ( H )(1  ˆV )V  (1  eF ( H ))(1  ˆv )v   (1  eP )eF ( L)(1  ˆv )v  c(eF ) .




7
 One might ask why these shares should sum to one. A rationale is presented by Gans and Murray (2014)
based on generating the joint efficiency of choices to collaborate or not. Additional evidence is contained in
Bikard, Murray and Gans (2014).
                                                                                                    12


Here ˆV and ˆ v are the scientist’s expectations of market attribution shares. Importantly,

F is able to choose effort, eF ( S1) , following an observation of P’s S1 contribution, and P

anticipates this. Given this, using the quadratic specification for effort costs, the effort

choices of each scientist are:

                                   eF* ( H )  (1  ˆV )V  (1  ˆ v )v                           (1)

                                           eF* ( L)  (1  ˆ v )v                                  (2)

                eP*   (1  ˆV )V  (1  ˆv )v ˆVV  ˆvv   1  (1  ˆv )v ˆvv .        (3)

Below we search for full market equilibrium outcomes where each scientist’s expectations

of market weightings correspond to the actual market weightings.


2.2    Optimal Attribution

       At this point, it is instructive to consider what attribution shares would generate an

optimal outcome – such as maximizing expected paper quality – given the resulting effort

choices of scientists. This will assist us in comparing various market outcomes to potential

benchmark performance.

       To this end, assume that shares can be related directly to contribution; that is, there

is perfect information on contribution. In this case, P’s share is a function  S1S 2 and the

resulting effort choices are given by:

                                 eF* ( H )  (1   HH )V  (1   HL )v                            (4)

                                          eF* ( L)  (1   LH )v                                   (5)

          eP*   (1   HH )V  (1   HL )v  ( HHV   HLv)   HL  (1   LH ) LH v  v .   (6)
                                                                                                        13


Notice that a higher  HL and a lower  LH increase both P and F effort. Thus, it is optimal

to set  HL  1 and  LH  0 in order to maximize expected paper quality. Given this,

eF* ( H )  (1   HH )V , eF* ( L)  v and eP*  (1   HH )V ( HH V  v)  v yielding expected

paper quality of:

 (1   HH )V ( HHV  v)  v  (1   HH )V (V  v)  v   1  (1   HH )V ( HHV  v)  v  v2    .

                                                    (7)

The setting of  HH involves a trade-off between P’s and F’s incentives. When v  V , it

can readily be seen that  HH  1 is optimal while if v  0 , expected paper quality is

(1   HH ) 2  HH V 4 , which is maximized at  HH  13 . Of course, given our assumptions, the

market will always set  HH        1
                                    2   and, thus, will not achieve this optimal level.



3       Co-Authorship Equilibria

        Having set up the research and market attribution environments, we first consider

the pioneer scientist’s decision to co-author or work on their own. We will start by

examining ex ante co-authorship before adding timing options of interim and ex post co-

authorship to consider the equilibria that arise with a full set of options available.


3.1     Market Assessment

        As noted above, when paper quality is v, the market cannot easily determine

whether P or F had the exceptional contribution. In this situation, the market forms

expectations of the effort levels of each scientist, eˆP , eˆF ( H ) and eˆF ( L) , respectively.

Thus, the probability that (S1,S2) = (H,L) is eˆP (1  eˆF ( H )) while the probability that
                                                                                                                               14


(S1,S2) = (L,H) is (1  eˆP )eˆF ( L) . Therefore, conditional on its observation of a paper of

quality, v, the market’s assessment of P’s relative contribution is:

                  eˆP (1  eˆF ( H )) 1  (1  eˆP )eˆF ( L)  0               eˆP (1  eˆF ( H ))
         ˆ v                                                                                                 .              (8)
                       eˆP (1  eˆF ( H ))  (1  eˆP )eˆF ( L)        eˆP (1  eˆF ( H ))  (1  eˆP )eˆF ( L)

Note that this specification for market beliefs easily encompasses other situations other

than ex ante co-authorship. For instance, under single authorship, eˆF ( H )  eˆF ( L)  0 and

so ˆv  1 , whereas, in a situation that will be analysed below, it may be that co-authorship

is only granted when S1 = L. In this case, the probability that paper quality is v and there

is co-authorship (rather than sole authorship) is (1  eˆP )eˆF ( L) while the probability that

(S1,S2) = (H,L) is 0, so that, in this case, ˆ v  0 .



3.2     P’s Decision to Co-Author

        Given the setting here, we assume that P makes the decision to co-author and does

so with regard to their expected payoff. Of course, that payoff is constrained by market

expectations that are not influenced by P’s decision. Several issues arise in this regard.

        First, what is P’s alternative option? Given the setup here, P can choose not

collaborate with F. We denote this choice as (S) for “sole” authorship. In this case, S2

always equals L, ruling out a paper quality of V. On the other hand, P appropriates all of

the paper’s value. Hence, by sole authoring, P chooses effort to maximize eP v  c(eP )

which yields eP*  v , expected paper quality of v 2 and an expected payoff to P of                                 1
                                                                                                                    2   v2 .

        Second, when can P make a decision to bring F on as a co-author? P could make

the decision ex ante (prior to any effort being expended), at an interim stage (following the

revelation of S1) or ex post (after the revelation of S2). Let us denote these choices as (C0),
                                                                                                         15


(C1) and (C2), respectively, where “C” indicates co-authorship and {0, 1, 2} indicate the

stage co-authorship is given. We examine cases where some or all of these choices are

feasible options for P.

         Third, when P can choose the timing of co-authorship, is P able to commit to a co-

authoring offer? In some situations, we can imagine that a co-authoring offer is a binding

commitment. In others, there may be some contractual incompleteness that means that P’s

decision must be self-enforcing ex post. We will examine varying assumptions with regard

to commitment to better understand the mechanisms of co-authorship.


3.3      Ex Ante Co-Authorship (C0)

         To consider the possible equilibrium outcomes, it is instructive to consider, first, a

situation where the decision to co-author can only be made ex ante (prior to effort choices).

In this situation, it is assumed that both P and F will be listed as co-authors on the paper

and that the market understands that this is the process. Thus, the market assessment will

be as described in (8).

         Given this, the following proposition lists the pure strategy equilibrium outcomes

of the full game under an assumption of rational expectations where eˆP  eP* ,

eˆF ( H )  eF* ( H ) and eˆF ( L)  eF* ( L) .

Proposition 1. The following are pure strategy rational expectations equilibrium of the full
game when only (C0) is feasible.
      (i) (all attribution to P): for all (V , v ) , (ˆV , ˆ v )  ( 12 ,1) , eP*  14 V 2  (1  12 V )v ,
              eF* ( H )  12 V and eF* ( L)  0 ;
         (ii) (all attribution to F): for V  2v (ˆV , ˆv )  ( 12 ,0) , eP*  0 , eF* ( H )  0 and
              eF* ( L)  v ;
         (iii) (mixed attribution): for V  2v , (ˆV , ˆ v )  ( 12 , V (242vv V ) ) , eP*  12 V ,
              eF* ( L)  14 (2v  V )(2  V ) , eF* ( H )  V (1  14 V )  v(1  12 V ) .
                                                                                                 16



To find the equilibrium outcomes, we take the effort subgame outcomes, (4) – (6), and

impose the requirement that expectations regarding market weights are met and look for

the resulting fixed point(s). The third equilibrium in Proposition 1 is listed for completeness

but can be readily demonstrated to be unstable, and so it will not be considered in the

discussion that follows. The equilibrium (i) where all “equity” in a paper of quality v is

assigned to P (i.e., (ˆV , ˆ v )  ( 12 ,1) ) exists for any range of paper quality values. In this

equilibrium, F only receives a positive return if V arises. Thus, F will only expend effort

when S1 = H and so will only end up being a co-author of a paper of quality v if S2 = L.

This reinforces the market assignment to P as, in equilibrium, it is always the case that

quality, v, signals that P’s contribution is H. In this situation, the equilibrium expected

paper quality is      1
                      8    v(2  V )  V  2v(2  V )  V  , which increases with V.
                                       2                 2




          There also exists an equilibrium where all equity in a paper of quality v is assigned

to F (i.e., (ˆV , ˆv )  ( 12 ,0) ). In this situation, S1 = H does not arise in equilibrium. Thus,

expected paper quality is v 2 . This is the same paper quality that would arise if P were a

sole author. To see that this is an equilibrium, note that, if S1 = H did arise, then

eF* ( H )  max[ 12 V  v, 0] . If V  2v , this effort would be positive and it would be easy to

see that P would have an incentive to expend positive effort, deviating from the equilibrium.

However, when V  2v , F’s effort remains at 0, reinforcing the equilibrium outcome. It is

important to note that when V  2v , this equilibrium outcome co-exists with the outcome

where (ˆV , ˆ v )  ( 12 ,1) .

          Proposition 1 assumes that the co-authoring decision has been made. When P can

choose whether to co-author or not, what survives? Note first, that P does not earn any
                                                                                                   17


value in the equilibrium where (ˆV , ˆv )  ( 12 ,0) and thus, under these market expectations,

P would choose to single author. This would result in a paper of the same quality as would

result under co-authorship in that case. Second, when (ˆV , ˆ v )  ( 12 ,1) , P earns

1
32   (V 2  2v(2  V )) 2 . Comparing this to P’s sole authorship payoff of     1
                                                                                2   v 2 , it is easy to

demonstrate that P prefers to co-author if V  2v .

Proposition 2. The only pure strategy rational expectations equilibrium of the full game,
when only (C0) and (S) are feasible, are (i) if V  2v , co-authorship with (ˆV , ˆ v )  ( 12 ,1)
and (ii) if V  2v , sole authorship.

The intuition is fairly straightforward. Under co-authorship, the most that P can receive is

1
2   V but under single authorship the most P can achieve is v. As it always appropriates the

full value of v should it arise in either case, P loses nothing by ceding co-authorship for

this scenario. However, co-authorship reduces the probability of this scenario by the same

amount that it increases the probability of the scenario where P receives half of V. Thus,

the marginal value of co-authorship is driven by whether 12 V is greater than v or not.

          Note, however, that in terms of maximizing expected paper quality or joint surplus,

P’s decision to co-author is socially suboptimal and should occur for a threshold value of

V lower than 2v. The reason for this is that it would be preferable to allow F some equity

when v arises with (S1,S2) = (L,H) but, instead, the equity the market attributes is the same

regardless of how v arises.


3.4       Interim Co-Authorship (C1)

          The above analysis assumed that the only time a co-authoring decision could be

made is ex ante (prior to effort being expended). Here, we consider what happens when the

decision by P can be made after the resolution of S1. As before, we begin by considering
                                                                                                        18


what happens when interim co-authorship is the only option (with a decision of sole

authorship being only available after the realization of S1) before considering what

happens when ex ante co-authorship or sole authorship is possible.

        Note, first, that if S1 = L, then it is always (weakly) optimal for P to offer co-

authorship to F. In this situation, sole authorship nets P a payoff of 0 whereas co-authorship

could net P more if ˆ v  0 . Second, as before, a paper quality of V is only observed if there

is interim co-authorship and, in this case, (S1,S2) = (H,H) so that ˆV                       1
                                                                                               2   always.

Otherwise the following proposition characterises the possible equilibrium outcomes:

Proposition 3. The following are pure strategy rational expectations equilibrium of the full
game when only (C1) is feasible.
      (i) for V  2v , (ˆV , ˆ v )  ( 12 ,1) , with co-authorship both when S1 = L and H and
             with eP*  14 V 2  (1  12 V )v , eF* ( H )  12 V and eF* ( L)  0 ;
        (ii) for (V  2v)V  4v (ˆV , ˆv )  ( 12 ,0) , with co-authorship only arising when S1
             = L with eP*  v and eF* ( L)  v .

The first equilibrium involves the same outcome as equilibrium (i) in Proposition 1 but

only exists over a limited domain. The reason is that when S1 = H, sole authorship earns

P, v from that point on whereas co-authorship nets P, 12 V ( 12 V  v)  v . Thus, co-authorship

is only preferable if V  2v . The second equilibrium involves no co-authorship when S1 =

H. If the market expects that this is the case then, when a paper quality of v arises, the

market assesses with certainty that S2 = H and so sets ˆ v  0 . In this case, expected paper

quality is v 2  (1  v)v 2 ; higher than the level that arises under sole authorship. The only

possible deviation is that P chooses to co-author when S1 = H. If it did this then, given that

(ˆV , ˆv )  ( 12 ,0) , eF* ( H )  max[ 12 V  v, 0] and, from that point, P would earn ( 12 V  v) 12 V
                                                                                                19


rather than v. This deviation is not profitable if V  2v  4 Vv . Thus, for 0  V  2v  4 Vv ,

equilibria (i) and (ii) in Proposition 3 co-exist.

          Proposition 3 considers situations where P could not commit upfront to ex ante co-

authorship or sole authorship. It can be easily seen that when V  2v , then P would be

indifferent between ex ante co-authorship and interim co-authorship under equilibrium (i).

However, what if (ˆV , ˆv )  ( 12 ,0) (as consistent with equilibrium (ii))? In this case, we

know that for V  2v  4 Vv , (ˆV , ˆv )  ( 12 ,0) is an equilibrium and could earn P an ex ante

payoff of v 2 , the same as sole authorship. If P committed to F to allow co-authorship when

S1 = H, P’s ex ante payoff would be 14 V 2 ( 12 V  v  12 ) as P would choose an effort level of

1
2   V in this case. Note that this payoff is non-positive. Hence, P would not find it optimal

to commit to ex ante co-authorship. Interestingly, this occurs despite the fact that P would,

for V  2v , prefer the ex ante co-authorship as in Proposition 1 (i). However, given the

market expectations of an interim co-authorship decision, P cannot achieve that outcome.

          What are the efficiency implications of having an option to choose interim co-

authorship? To examine this, observe that when V  2v , expected paper quality is the same

under both ex ante and interim co-authorship when (ˆV , ˆ v )  ( 12 ,1) ; i.e.,

1
8    v(2  V )  V  2v(2  V )  V  . For V  2v , equilibrium (ii) of Proposition 3 involves a
                  2                2




higher expected paper quality of v 2 (2  V ) than the expected paper quality of v 2 that can

be achieved under P’s sole authorship (the expected outcome from Proposition 2). In this

situation, interim co-authorship as an option improves efficiency.

          It is less straightforward to rank outcomes based on expected paper quality when

0  V  2v  4 Vv and, under interim co-authorship, (ˆV , ˆv )  ( 12 ,0) . In this case, expected
                                                                                                 20


paper quality in equilibrium (i) of Propositions 2 and 3 and that for equilibrium (ii) in

Proposition 3 cannot be easily ranked except to say that for v sufficiently low, interim co-

authorship involves expected paper quality no higher than ex ante co-authorship and for

V  23 , there exists v close to V where interim co-authorship with (ˆV , ˆv )  ( 12 ,0) results

in higher expected paper quality than the equilibria where (ˆV , ˆ v )  ( 12 ,1) . In effect, P

ends up expending more effort to ensure that it does not lose attribution to F; thus, raising

expected paper quality.


3.5      Ex Post Co-Authorship

         We now consider what happens when P can offer F an “option” contract contingent

on F’s contribution in stage 2. Specifically, what if co-authorship is granted if S2 = H while

it is not granted if S2 = L? The following proposition characterises the equilibrium outcome

contingent upon this contract being offered and committed to.

Proposition 4. Suppose that only (C2) is feasible. Then, if V  2v , a pure strategy rational
expectations equilibrium of the full game with a contingent contract exists and involves
(aˆV , aˆv )  ( 12 ,0) , with eP*  14 V 2  (1  12 V )v , eF* ( H )  12 V and eF* ( L)  v .

Before explaining why this is an equilibrium, it is useful to note that this involves both P

and F choosing the highest levels of effort associated with any organisational regime

considered         this    far.         Consequently,    expected       paper        quality      is

1
8    v  2  V   4v(2  v)  3V   V  , which is higher than any other equilibrium outcome
                                2       4




where V  2v .

         Recall that, in our earlier analysis of optimal attribution, it was optimal to set

 HL  1     and      LH  0       .   This   would    maximize,      eF* ( L)  (1   LH )v   and

eF* ( H )  (1   HH )V  (1   HL )v . What prevented this outcome under ex ante and interim
                                                                                                        21


co-authorship was that either  HL   LH or, under one equilibrium in interim co-authorship,

co-authorship would not arise when S1 = H. Under ex post co-authorship, co-authorship is

contingent upon the realisation of S2 allowing both  HL to differ from  LH and for co-

authorship to arise when S1 = H. This combines the good features of both ex ante and

interim co-authorship. Thus, if S2 = L, no co-authored paper arises and P receives full

attribution; that is,  HL  1 . By contrast, if S2 = H then a co-authored paper arises and, if it

is of quality v, then F receives full attribution; that is,  LH  0 . Thus, both  HL and  LH

end up being at their optimal levels.


3.6      Equilibria under Commitment

         We now turn to consider which organizational regimes survive as equilibrium

outcomes when all options considered thus far can be chosen and agreed upon ex ante. That

is, when each option can be committed to by P.

         To build intuition, suppose that the market assumes, consistent with the ex post co-

authorship equilibrium in Proposition 4, that when a paper of quality v is co-authored then

S2 = H with certainty; hence, they set the attribution share at  v  0 . The chosen effort

levels are consistent with this expectation. In this case, it can be demonstrated that P

receives the same ex ante expected payoff as equilibrium (i) in Proposition 1 for ex ante

co-authorship and will be indifferent between these. Suppose, however, that ex ante, P

offers co-authorship given expectations (ˆV , ˆv )  ( 12 ,0) . Then eF* ( H )  12 V  v ,

eF* ( L)  v and eP*  max[eF* ( H ) 12 V , 0] . If V  2v , P’s payoff would be 0 while if V  2v ,

it would be ( 12 V  v) 2 14 V 2  81 ( 12 V  v) 2V 2  ( 12 V  v) 2 81 V 2 which is a lower payoff. Thus,

a deviation to ex ante co-authorship is not profitable. What about a deviation to interim co-
                                                                                                  22


authorship? When S1 = L, offering P co-authorship at that stage with market expectations

of (ˆV , ˆv )  ( 12 ,0) is equivalent to what would arise under ex post co-authorship. At S1 =

H, denying P co-authorship would net P v instead of 14 V 2  (1  12 V )v . This deviation is not

profitable if V  2v . Finally, note that P’s payoff under the contingent contract equilibrium

in Proposition 4 is the same as under equilibrium (i) in Proposition 1. Therefore, P will not

prefer to commit to sole authorship so long as V  2v .

        What other equilibria are possible when ex post contingent contracting is feasible?

Note, first, that when (ˆV , ˆv )  ( 12 ,0) and V  2v , P will find it optimal to offer an ex post

contingent contract. Thus, the parameter range allowing the interim contract (ii) in

Proposition 3 narrows to V  2v . Second, when (ˆV , ˆ v )  ( 12 ,1) , offering a contingent

contract does not change F’s incentives. Thus, ex ante co-authorship (equilibrium (i) of

Proposition 1) and its ex post variant (equilibrium (ii) of Proposition 3) continue as possible

equilibrium outcomes. Summarizing we have:

Proposition 5. The following are pure strategy rational expectations equilibria of the full
game when P can commit to (S), (C0), (C1) or (C2).
      (i)      for V  2v , (ˆV , ˆ v )  ( 12 ,1) , with ex ante and interim co-authorship both
                 when S1 = L and H and with eP*  14 V 2  (1  12 V )v , eF* ( H )  12 V and
                 eF* ( L)  0 ;
        (ii)     for V  2v , (ˆV , ˆv )  ( 12 ,0) with ex post contingent co-authorship when
                 S2 = H with eP*  14 V 2  (1  12 V )v , eF* ( H )  12 V and eF* ( L)  v ;
        (iii)    for V  2v (ˆV , ˆv )  ( 12 ,0) , with interim co-authorship only arising when
                 S1 = L with eP*  v and eF* ( L)  v ;
        (iv)     for V  2v sole authorship with eP*  v .

Proposition 5 demonstrates that when there is a full range of co-authoring timing choices

that can be committed to by P that there are multiple equilibrium outcomes for each

parameter range. Specifically, when V  2v , ex ante, interim and ex post co-authorship are
                                                                                         23


all equilibrium outcomes. However, as already noted, the equilibrium (ii) with ex post

contingent co-authorship involves the highest expected paper quality and joint surplus for

P and F. Interestingly, the equilibrium with ex post co-authorship also involves the highest

expected payoff for F. This is because it involves F receiving the highest equity when S2

= H. Importantly, this equilibrium is (weakly) Pareto superior to equilibrium (i) as P’s

expected payoff is the same as ex ante co-authorship.

       In contrast, when V  2v , both interim co-authorship and sole authorship are

equilibrium outcomes. Each of these involves the same expected payoff to P while interim

co-authorship involves a higher expected payoff to F, and so Pareto is superior. However,

because of its efficiency, the equilibrium with interim co-authorship results in a higher

expected paper quality and joint surplus than what is expected with sole authorship by P.


3.7    No Commitment to Co-Authorship

       The above analysis assumes that P commits to a co-authoring agreement and that

the market understands that this commitment is possible. But what happens when P cannot

commit to a co-authoring agreement? Specifically, what happens if co-authorship is an

incomplete contract meaning that P can ask for collaboration but ex post not offer formal

co-authorship?

       First, note that for equilibria where ˆv  1 , then P has no reason not to offer co-

authorship if paper quality is v. In contrast, for equilibria where ˆ v  0 , then P can

appropriate more by not having F formally listed as a co-author. This might arise under

contingent ex post co-authorship or interim co-authorship when S1 = L. In each of these

cases, a single authored paper of quality v is achievable on the equilibrium path and so P

can appropriate v as a payoff by not co-authoring, regardless of F’s contribution. As P
                                                                                              24


cannot commit to co-author in this situation equilibria (ii) and (iii) in Proposition 5 are not

feasible under any commitment.

        Second, what happens when (S1, S2) = (H, H)? In this situation, P could omit F as

a co-author. However, in that scenario, the market still understands that P could not have

achieved a paper with a quality of V without assistance. Thus, the attribution to V remains

at V    1
          2   even if the market is not able to attribute the remaining share to a particular

scientist. Thus, as single authorship with a paper quality, V is not on the equilibrium path,

P has no incentive to renege on co-authorship under this scenario. Thus, the equilibrium

outcomes (i) and (iv) in Proposition 5 remain feasible.

        In summary, an inability to commit to co-authorship removes the Pareto superior

equilibria from Proposition 5 as possible outcomes. This suggests that mechanisms that

allow P to commit to co-authoring contracts will be welfare enhancing. This might be

achieved by a relational contracting outcome (in a broader multi-agent setting), but the

establishment of that relies on market expectations – namely, (ˆV , ˆv )  ( 12 ,0) , consistent

with such outcomes. If those expectations are not present in the market, it may be difficult

for an individual research team to establish them. However, in the next section, we focus

on a situation whereby a third party (journal editors) may play a commitment role.



4       Citations

        Both sole authorship and co-authorship are “integrated” solutions to the

organization of collaborative research. They are integrated in the sense that the entire

output of research is owned by one or both scientists. This stands in contrast to a “non-

integrated” solution to organizing collaborative research whereby both scientists produce
                                                                                            25


separate outputs that are “owned” by separate parties. Such a solution would arise if P

published their stage 1 research as a separate publication with F publishing their stage 2

research as a follow-on publication. The linkage between them would then be described by

a citation contained in F’s publication. Here we consider this “publish and cite back”

alternative and compare it to the various forms of co-authorship considered above.

         To keep the model here consistent with the model thus far, we assume that, should

P publish their research prior to stage 2, that research has no intrinsic value. Instead, it is

only after F completes stage 2 and publishes their research that the entire body of research

can be ascribed a value of V, v or 0 as the case may be. Admittedly, this assumption is

contrary to what is usually assumed about publications per se, but it does capture the notion

that what is valuable are “bodies” of works rather than individual works themselves. In

addition, it has the second effect of providing no reason for P to publish other than to

receive a citation and receive some attribution from the entire body of work. To be sure, in

reality, there are other reasons to publish, but this specification allows us to abstract away

from those.

         Another reason for publication of interim results is that P may not know who might

be able to carry on follow-on research. To rule this out, we assume that only F has the

ability to complete the body of work for valuable research. Again, the purpose of this is to

provide the pioneer with a stark choice between publishing interim results and co-authoring

with the (already identified) follow-on researcher. To the extent that searching for follower-

on researchers is of productive value, this will increase the motivation for publishing

interim results above and beyond the reasons explored here (Jiang, Thursby and Thursby,

2012).
                                                                                               26


        This setup allows us to preserve the structure of the model – including effort to

research relationships and market assessment assumptions. What changes is how formal

attribution of contribution occurs. Formal attribution in the form of co-authorship came

from internal processes – in this case, the choice of P whether to allow a formal attribution

or not. Formal attribution in the form of citation could arise in a similar way (via agreement

between the scientists), but here we consider a more natural alternative that it is determined

by a journal editor. The process we have in mind is that all research is published in a journal

with the editor of that journal being interested in maximizing expected paper quality for

the journal. In setting citation policy, the editor is (potentially) constrained by market

expectations as to what a citation means for the allocation of credit between P and F. What

the editor could do is receive, through referees, a perfect signal of (S1, S2) and offer a

citation as a mapping from (S1, S2) outcomes. For instance, an editor may choose to request

a citation by F to P’s work whenever S1 = H. Or, instead, an editor may choose to request

a citation in all instances or none at all.

        We assume that, if a research body of quality, v, involves a paper by F that cites

P’s work, then the market attributes a share,  v , for that body of research to P and the

remainder to F. If there is no citation, then F appropriates the entire value, v, in this instance.

On the other hand, if the research body is of quality, V, then regardless of whether there is

a citation or not, the market attributes a share, 1  V , to F. If there is a citation, the

remainder is attributed to P; otherwise, that share is “lost.”

        The journal editor’s citation policy and market expectations (ˆV , ˆ v ) are known

prior to either P or F beginning research. Thus, if P were to pursue an interim publication
                                                                                                                  27


of their results, then, I S1S 2 is an indicator function that takes on a value of 1 if a citation

occurs under outcome (S1, S2), the optimal effort choices are as follows:

                                      eF* ( H )  (1  ˆV )V  (1  I HLˆ v )v                                  (9)

                                              eF* ( L)  (1  I LH ˆ v )v                                       (10)

eP*   (1  I HHˆV )V  (1  I HLˆv )v  ( I HHˆVV  I HLˆv v)   I HLˆv  (1  I LHˆv ) I LHˆv v  v      .

                                                         (11)

Note that by setting I LH equal to 0 and I HL equal to 1, the journal editor can raise all effort

levels. Thus, to maximize journal quality, it is always optimal for the editor to require a

citation if (S1, S2) = (H, L), but not if (S1, S2) = (L, H). Similarly, note that setting I HH

equal to 1 boosts P’s effort while not reducing F’s (as the market will not change its

attribution to F for a paper of quality V). Thus, it is clear that, regardless of expectations of

market attribution, the journal editor will maximize expected paper quality that commits to

a policy of requiring a citation of F by P whenever S1 = H.

         Given this, noting that ˆV  12 , the optimal efforts will become:

                                                   eF* ( H )  12 V                                              (12)

                                                     eF* ( L)  v                                                (13)

                                             eP*  14 V 2  (1  12 V )v .                                       (14)

Setting eˆP  eP* , eˆF ( H )  eF* ( H ) and eˆF ( L)  eF* ( L) , it is clear that, if a citation is observed

for paper quality, v, then ˆv  1 . Notice that this is equivalent to the equilibrium outcome

that can be achieved under ex post contingent co-authorship. Recall that for V  2v , this
                                                                                                28


generated the highest expected paper quality and joint surplus and for all parameter values,

this was preferable to sole authorship.


4.1     The interim publication choice

        Given this expected outcome from citation, when will P choose to have an interim

publication? The following proposition states the equilibrium outcomes:

Proposition 6. The following are pure strategy rational expectations equilibria of the full
game when P can commit to (S), (C0), (C1), (C2) or publish after stage 1:
      (i)      for V  2v , (ˆV , ˆ v )  ( 12 ,1) , with ex ante and interim co-authorship both
                 when S1 = L and H and with eP*  14 V 2  (1  12 V )v , eF* ( H )  12 V and
                 eF* ( L)  0 ;
        (ii)     for V  2v , (ˆV , ˆv )  ( 12 ,0) with ex post contingent co-authorship when
                 S2 = H or interim publication when S1 = L (ˆV , ˆv )  ( 12 ,0) with
                  eP*  14 V 2  (1  12 V )v , eF* ( H )  12 V and eF* ( L)  v ;
        (iii)    for V  2v (ˆV , ˆv )  ( 12 ,0) , with interim co-authorship only arising when
                 S1 = L with eP*  v and eF* ( L)  v ;
        (iv)  for V  2v sole authorship with eP*  v .
The following are pure strategy rational expectations equilibria of the full game when P
cannot commit to co-authorship but can publish after stage 1:
        (v)   for V  2v , (ˆV , ˆ v )  ( 12 ,1) , with ex ante and interim co-authorship both
                 when S1 = L and H and with eP*  14 V 2  (1  12 V )v , eF* ( H )  12 V and
                 eF* ( L)  0 ;
        (vi)     for    V  2v    ,   (ˆV , ˆv )  ( 12 ,0)   with   interim   publication   with
                  e  14 V  (1  12 V )v , e ( H )  12 V and e ( L)  v ;
                  *
                  P
                           2                *
                                            F
                                                                   *
                                                                   F

        (vii)    for V  2v (ˆV , ˆv )  ( 12 ,0) , with interim co-authorship only arising when
                 S1 = L with eP*  v and eF* ( L)  v ;
        (viii)   for V  2v sole authorship with eP*  v .

Importantly, interim publication is always an equilibrium when V  2v now just as sole

authorship is when V  2v , regardless of whether P can commit to co-authorship or not

and regardless of market expectations under co-authorship. Basically, interim publication

allows P to commit to evaluation by a journal editor motivated to maximize expected paper
                                                                                             29


quality. However, when V  2v , this leaves P worse off than sole authoring both stages of

research.

        This analysis presumes that the journal editor does not take into account P’s

incentives to sole author or engage in interim co-authorship when setting the journal’s

citation policy. At the moment, no citation to P is given when (S1, S2) = (L, H). Could

granting a citation in this situation increase P’s incentive to engage in interim publication

and increase expected paper quality?

        This option is only relevant when V  2v , for it is here that P might not choose

interim publication. When S1 = H, the only possible outcomes with interim publication are

that P receives v or V/2 whereas with sole authorship, P receives v with certainty and so

prefers this. There is no instrument available to the journal editor to ensure P receives more

under interim publication. In contrast, when S1 = L, the journal editor can ensure P receives

more by offering a citation with some probability, p, in this instance. This is only valuable

if ˆ v ( p)  0 is sustainable as a set of equilibrium market beliefs. However, given that

when S1 = H, there is no interim publication, and when S1 = L, there is interim publication,

the market can correctly infer that S1 = L and so will set ˆ v ( p)  0 , regardless of whether

there is a citation or not. Consequently, the journal editor is not able to use an increased

citation rate as a means of inducing P to engage in interim publication.

        In recent times, there has been a push amongst some scientists to encourage or even

require publication of interim results (Nielsen, 2012). Proposition 6 demonstrates that

while interim publication might arise as an equilibrium outcome when V  2v , when

V  2v , this does not occur. Thus, what if interim publication was mandated? If V  2v ,

there would be a citation issued if S1 = H and none if S1 = L. Thus, the market receives an
                                                                                          30


accurate signal of P’s contribution and so will set  v  1 if a citation is observed. As has

already been noted, this involves a higher expected paper quality than other outcomes and

so compulsory publication can improve efficiency. The reason it does this is because it

ensures that, for marginal improvements, there is a way of dividing up “equity” between P

and F that otherwise P would want to avoid. However, it should be stressed that this

outcome is a result of the “editorial review” system being able to make assessments of

individual contributions in the first place. If such assessments can be made, even if signals

are imperfect (i.e., to cite or not), the market can properly infer attribution.



5       Extensions

        We now turn to consider extensions that will be useful in identifying exogenous

variation that may assist future empirical researchers in understanding the organisation of

science and choices for attribution in more depth.


5.1     No market knowledge of roles

        The model here assumes that the “market” (or, more specifically, scientists’

understanding of the market) has somewhat detailed knowledge about the roles of P and F

in co-authored outcomes. This may come from actual knowledge of the roles (e.g., the

paper came out of “P’s Lab”) or from signals embedded in the ordering of names (or other

details elaborating contributions) on a paper. However, because of the aggregation of

results and statistics through online platforms such as a Google Scholar, it is arguable that

metrics (such as the H-Index or paper counts) may have more weight for scientists than the

more “personalized” market feedback assumed thus far. Moreover, it is the rise of such
                                                                                                                31


metrics that may have potentially altered the choices of scientists regarding the

organisation of collaborative activities.

          To explore this, here we consider a situation where the market (a), if it observes a

formal collaboration (with co-authorship acknowledge), has no knowledge of which

scientist performed which role, and (b), if it does not observe a formal collaboration,

presumes that the sole author is responsible for all of the contributions in the project. Thus,

if there is formal co-authorship, the market places equal weight on each scientist being the

stage 1 researcher regardless of the quality of the resulting output. Thus, the market weight

assignment problem is trivial, and it sets V   v  12 .

          In this situation, it is clear that the efforts under ex ante co-authorship would be

(from (1) – (3)): eF* ( H )  12 (V  v) , eF* ( L)  12 v and eP*  14 (V  v)2  1  12 v  12 v resulting

in a payoff to P of          1
                             32    4v(1  V )V   2
                                                       V 4  4v 2  3  (2  V )V   and expected paper quality of

1
8    4v(1  V )V   2
                         V 4  4v 2  2  (2  V )V   . It is straightforward to show that both P’s payoff

and the expected paper quality are lower in this equilibrium than the equivalent equilibrium

(Proposition 1(i)) where the market has knowledge of scientists’ roles. This is because

when the market has more knowledge, P appropriates more ex post surplus and engages in

higher effort, while F engages in higher effort as they are not insured if a paper of high

quality is not produced. This also means that P would be less inclined to co-author with F

when the market does not have knowledge of their roles.

          From this it naturally follows that under ex post co-authorship, P earns even less

when market roles are obscured, but what happens under interim co-authorship is subtler.

In this situation, suppose that V < 2v and so, when market roles are observed, the
                                                                                             32


equilibrium where there is co-authorship only when S1 = L is relevant (Proposition 3 (ii)).

In this case, P appropriates a share of any resulting co-authored paper (where previously

they appropriated none). Thus, P is not indifferent between sole and interim co-authorship

and will favour the latter.

       This implies that, if the market moves towards metrics that do not easily identify

scientists’ roles, then for projects where the marginal contribution of each scientist is likely

to be very high, fewer co-authored projects will be observed. By contrast, where the

marginal contribution of the follow-on researcher is relatively low, such changes would

result in more co-authored projects.


5.2    Larger Research Teams

       The model considered in this paper is very simple in that there are only two

scientists. When there are more scientists who might be part of a collaborative project,

more complexity is introduced, but it is likely that the same issues will arise. In particular,

when P chooses whether to give formal attribution to another, it must consider both the

dilution of their own “equity” and the impact that will have on incentives. When there is

only one other scientist to consider, that latter impact is likely to be smaller. Hence,

considerations here might tend to suggest that there is a natural tendency for scientists to

limit the number of formal collaborators.

       That said, the organisational regimes that involved higher powered incentives, such

as ex post co-authorship and interim publication, would become relatively more important

as they solved some of the free-riding issues that may arise. Thus, if larger research teams

are warranted, we expect to see an evolution in organisational forms alongside them that
                                                                                                          33


allow for more substantial interim publication as well as different modes of ex post co-

authorship.

         Of course, larger research teams might also be associated with a dilution of the

market’s ability to identify the individual roles of scientists. In this case, the considerations

identified in the previous subsection may come into play. However, this is likely to be

associated with the visibility of individual scientists; something that we leave to a future

paper to consider in more detail.8


5.3      Alternative Reasons for Citations

         Thus far, we have considered citations as a formal mechanism to signal attribution

amongst a body of work. However, citations also play another role. They can direct

scientists to the cited work and, so long as it is relevant, improve the productivity of future

research.

         The first of these involves directing readers to the sources of knowledge that have
         been drawn upon in one's work. This enables research-oriented readers, if they are
         so minded, to assess for themselves the knowledge claims (the ideas and findings)
         in the cited source; to draw upon other pertinent materials in that source that may
         not have been utilized by the citing intermediary publication; and to be directed in
         turn by the cited work to other, prior sources that may have been obliterated by
         their incorporation in the intermediary publication. (Merton, 1988, p. 621)

How does the instrumental or productivity value of a “relevant” citation affect the role of

interim publication discussed so far? In particular, what happens when editors request

citations for instrumental value and, hence, include some citations even when S1 = L?


8
  Merton (1988, p. 448) documented discussions by famous scientists that they sometimes agree to be a co-
author of a junior researcher to increase their visibility. The model here could be interpreted as applying to
that situation as well. Simcoe and Waguespack (2011) studied the effect of author visibility by examining
the changes in publication rates of papers were some authors became obscured in the “et al.” of multi-
authored papers. On the Internet Engineering Task Force, a publication platform for engineers and computer
scientists, a change in policy led to some authors’ names being concealed as ”et al.” This permitted a study
of the effects of obscuring a relatively well-known authors on the publication chances of a paper they have
co-authored. That obscurity explained three-quarters of the differences in publication rates of known versus
relatively unknown scientists.

        Earlier we demonstrated that when V < 2v, increasing the citation rate when S1 =

L, would not change market assessments of P’s and F’s contribution. This is because P

would not choose interim publication if S1 = H and thus, the market would correctly assess

S1 = L, whether there was a citation or not. What about when V > 2v? In this case, if the

editor requires a citation when S1 = L as well, the citation is no longer a pure signal. Indeed,

if citations always occur, this is akin to there being no signal when paper quality is v, and

so it is the same outcome as ex ante co-authorship. This will reduce expected paper quality.



6       Conclusion

        The goal of this paper has been to embed an organisational economics approach

(namely, how ownership determines incentives for non-contractible actions) into the

economics of science. The bridge between those two literatures is provided by considering

the non-pecuniary motivations of scientists to receive favorable market assessments of their

relative contribution to collaborative projects. Our modelling innovation was to embed that

market not only in the processes by which formal attribution is allocated – in our model,

by a pioneer scientist – but also in a broader environment for attribution that involves third-

party editors or referees.

        The contributions arising from this were threefold. First, there is a difference

between formal attribution and equilibrium attribution. This is because formal attribution

provides an imperfect signal of real attribution and, in equilibrium, these differences must

resolve themselves. Second, as a consequence, it is not within the power of scientists, by

merely choosing their processes of formal attribution, to implement any desired real

attribution. The market constrains those outcomes in equilibrium. Third, as a consequence
                                                                                             35


of this, different organisational regimes have different incentive implications. Most notably,

delaying the formal assignment of co-authorship until later in the research production

process can enhance incentives in a Pareto improving manner.

        This model, we believe, is a starting point for further analyses of the organisational

economics of science. While we have not explored some additional dimensions in this

paper, our model could be expanded to consider issues of the supply of scientists in a

context where there are career hierarchies and career concerns (Stephan, 2012). It could,

therefore, be used to both study those labor markets and also inform policies designed to

change the supply of scientists. In addition, our model could provide a framework for

considering the efficacy of certain measures of contribution utilised by public funding

agencies and how these impact incentives and, also, career paths. Finally, here we have

dealt with a fairly abstract and utility-grounded approach to scientist preferences. In reality,

there are many more instruments that assist in the acknowledgement of scientific

contributions and these themselves interact with market assessments and incentives.

Consider, for instance, the recent issues raised in economics over the Nobel Prizes for

contributions to general equilibrium theory (Duppe and Weintraub, 2014) as well as the

long-standing concerns regarding the presence of a Matthew effect in science (Merton,

1968; Azoulay, Stuart and Wang, 2014).
