                                              ABSTRACT


        This study investigates whether models of forward-looking behavior explain the observed patterns
of heavy drinking and smoking of men in late middle age in the Health and Retirement Study better than
myopic models. We develop and estimate a sequence of nested models which differ by their degree of
forward-looking behavior. We also study models which allow for heterogeneity in discounting, and thus
test whether certain types of individuals are more likely to show forward-looking behavior than other
types. Our empirical findings suggest that forward-looking models with an annual discount factor of
approximately 0.78 fit the data the best. These models also dominate other behavioral models based on
out-of-sample predictions using data of men aged 70 and over. Myopic models predict rates of smoking
and drinking for old individuals which are significantly larger than those found in the data on elderly men.

1        Introduction


Two competing theories have been proposed for explaining the consumption of potentially

harmful and addictive goods. Early approaches typically attributed consumption of these

goods to irrational or myopic behavior (Winston, 1980; Thaler and Sheffrin, 1981).1 More

recently, Stigler and Becker (1977) and Becker and Murphy (1988) have forcefully argued

that addiction can be modeled as an outcome of rational behavior of forward-looking indi-

viduals with stable preferences.2 These two theories primarily differ in their assumptions

regarding the length of the planning horizon which is attributed to individuals. The myopic

model assumes that the planning horizon is short and consists – in the limiting case – of

only one time period. Individuals care about today, but ignore tomorrow and hence do not

internalize the negative effects of smoking and drinking on health in the future. In contrast,

rational addiction theory relies on the notion that individuals are forward-looking. Thus,

individuals take into consideration the risks associated with heavy smoking or drinking.


        Most prior empirical studies of the rational addiction theory follow Becker and Murphy

(1988) and analyze first order conditions that prices and quantities need to satisfy, given

individuals’ (quadratic) utility functions.3 . Chaloupka (1991) and Becker, Grossman, and

Murphy (1991, 1994) apply this methodology and find that tobacco consumption typically

      One of most fascinating early analyses of alcohol abuse is due to Lowry (1947), which was published in
its original version with a 17 year delay in the Prairie Schooner, XXXVII, 4, Winter 1963/64.
    2
      An alternative to both approaches are models based on recent work by Laibson (1997), Harris and
Laibson (2001) using hyperbolic discounting. In these models, individuals are forward-looking, but put less
weight on future events than in standard forward-looking models which can give rise to time inconsistent
consumption paths. See also Gruber and Koeszegi (2000).
    3
      Exceptions are recent work by Gilleskie and Strumpf (2000) who use linear approximation of decision
rules in a discrete choice model and Choo (2000) and Khwaja (2000) who estimate models using full-solution
dynamic programming techniques.

responds to lagged, current and future price changes as predicted by rational addiction

theory.4


       This study differs from previous empirical studies in a number of important ways. Pre-

vious research has largely focused on young adults who are subject to experimentation,

habit formation, and reinforcement (Orphanides and Zervos, 1995). However, an important

characteristic of tobacco consumption, in particular consumption of cigarettes, is the long

latency period between time of initiation and onset of adverse events.5 Relatively few ad-

verse health events occur in the first half of life. To illustrate, at age 35, the cumulative

probability of survival is the same for males who have never smoked and smokers. At age

45 (65, 85), the corresponding ratio is 1.02 (1.18, 2.11) (Hodgson, 1992). Perfectly forward-

looking individuals may therefore engage in heavy consumption of harmful substances at

young ages because events in the distant future are heavily discounted. It is therefore

difficult to distinguish between the two theories using data of young adults.


       We focus our analysis on a sample of men in late middle age from the Health and

Retirement Study (HRS). Persons over the age of 50 start to experience negative health

shocks which are, at least partially, due to smoking and heavy drinking in the past. Much

of the uncertainty about future health and the link between smoking or drinking and health

outcomes is resolved during later years in life. We can thus study whether individuals

rationally update their consumption behavior as they experience negative health shocks

   4
     Chaloupka and Warner (2000) provide an overview of the existing empirical literature of the rational
addiction model.
   5
     The latency period for alcohol can be substantially less than for smoking, for example, due to accidents
while being intoxicated.




                                                     2
and provide a new test of the rational addiction hypothesis.6


       Earlier studies have typically assumed that individuals are either myopic or forward-

looking. In contrast, we provide an empirical framework which allows us to control for

varying degrees of forward-looking behavior of individuals. We adapt a dynamic discrete

choice framework.7 The myopic model is a special case of forward-looking models. Our

framework thus nests the competing behavioral theories. Instead of assuming that individ-

uals are rational, we compare a sequence of nested models which differ by their degree of

forward-looking behavior. Moreover, we allow for heterogeneity in planning horizons, and

test whether certain types of individuals are more likely to show forward-looking behavior

than others.


       Our empirical findings suggest that forward-looking models with annual discount factors

less than 0.8 fit the data the best. To gain additional insights in the fit of the different model

specifications, we predict the behavior for a sample of elderly individuals from the Asset and

Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD) data. We find that the out-of-sample

predictions of our preferred forward-looking model clearly dominate those of the myopic

model. We thus conclude that forward-looking models with an annual discount factor of

approximately 0.78 provide better within sample and out-of-sample predictions than their

myopic counterparts.

   6
      Previous tests of the rational addiction model have been based on Euler equations, which rest on the
implicit assumption that individuals must consume strictly positive amounts of alcohol or cigarettes. This
is problematic if a large number of individuals do not consume tobacco or alcohol in each time period.
    7
      Dynamic discrete choice estimation was first used by Wolpin (1984), Miller (1984), Pakes (1986) and
Rust (1987). Recent applications include Hotz and Miller (1993), Keane and Wolpin (1994, 1997), Rust and
Phelan (1997), Gilleskie (1998), Eckstein and Wolpin (1999) and Brien, Lillard, and Stern (2000).




                                                    3
   Comparing myopic models to forward-looking models yields substantial differences in

the consumption patterns of alcohol and tobacco over time. Larger discount factors imply

larger declines in consumption with age. In forward-looking models, individuals take into

account that the marginal adverse health effects of heavy drinking and smoking are higher

later in life. The main drawback of the myopic model is that it predicts rates of smoking

and heavy drinking for old individuals which are significantly larger than those found in

the AHEAD. Myopic and forward-looking models also have very different behavioral inter-

pretations. Estimates of the myopic model make alcohol and tobacco appear unattractive,

particularly for the unhealthy. However, in forward-looking models, alcohol and tobacco are

more attractive, but are not consumed because of losses in future utility caused by adverse

health effects. This is particularly true for the unhealthy as the marginal adverse health

effects of heavy drinking and smoking increase as the health of the individual deteriorates.


   The rest of the study is organized as follows. Section 2 discusses the data used in

this paper which is based on the Health and Retirement Study. In Section 3, we develop

a sequence of forward-looking models of decision making under uncertainty and discuss

identification and estimation of these models. Sections 4 and 5 present the empirical results

of this study. In Section 6, we analyze the fit of the models using within sample and

out-of-sample predictions. Section 7 offers some concluding remarks.

2    Data


The data used in this study come from the Health and Retirement Study. The HRS is

a national panel study of birth cohorts 1931 through 1941 and their spouses, if married.

Participants in the HRS have been interviewed every two years since 1992. To date, four

waves of the survey have been completed and released. Individuals in the first wave of

the HRS range from 51 to 61 years of age with some spouses being younger or older than

this. The average age in wave 1 of individuals in our sample is 58.2. We analyze smoking

and heavy drinking behavior of males. We exclude women because they differ significantly

from males in preferences for alcohol and tobacco, in their attitudes towards risk, and their

willingness to engage in harmful consumption. Furthermore, women live longer and have

different tolerance levels for alcohol and tobacco than males. Hence, transitions for health

status and mortality differ significantly between males and females. Controlling for these

differences using additive dummy variables is likely to be insufficient.


    We use the panel structure of the data and include only persons who were not lost due

to attrition and had complete information for the most relevant variables of this study.

Our initial sample consists of 5,735 males. 1,281 men are lost due to attrition. We also

remove those who abstained from any alcohol consumption throughout the period. This,

and missing values, gives us 2,784 males on average in each wave, a total number of 8,352

male person-waves.


    Drinking behavior questions in the HRS allow us to categorize wave 1 respondents as

current drinkers or non-drinkers, and for drinkers the average number of drinks per day.

Subsequent waves allow for tracking drinking status across time. For purposes of this study,

we categorize individuals as drinkers and non-drinkers, and, among drinkers, by drinks per

day: less than 1, 1-2, 3-4, and more than 4. We define heavy drinking as consuming three

or more drinks on average per day.8


      Table 1 shows that there is a steady decline in alcohol consumption, smoking, health

status, and total income9 during the four waves of the panel. For example, the percentage

of individuals who do not drink increases from 15.7 percent to 30.6 percent during the

observation period. Heavy drinking declines from 10.7 percent in wave 1 to 6.6 percent in

total household income as a sum of the respondent’s wage income, the spouse’s wage income, household
capital income and other household income. Income is measured in constant 1999 dollars.

       Additional information about alcohol and tobacco consumption is given in Table 2 which

reports the transitions between heavy drinking (no, a = 0 and yes, a = 1) and smoking

combinations. We find that the elements on the diagonal of the transition matrix are larger

in magnitude than the elements on the off-diagonals, with the elements on the diagonal

  10
    There is an issue of whether alcoholics give valid self-reports regarding their alcohol consumption. While
there is some evidence in the literature that alcohol consumption is measured with error, there do not seem
to be any systematic trends of over- or underreporting. See, for example, Watson, Tilleskjor, Hoodecheck-
Schow, Purcel, and Jacobs (1984).



                                                      7
ranging from 54 and 91 percent. Thus, in spite of the general trend of reducing alcohol

and tobacco consumption evident in the sample means, many men have relatively stable

drinking and smoking patterns which is likely due to habit formation. However, there is

still a fair amount of transitions between the different heavy drinking and smoking states,

as reflected by the off-diagonal elements of the matrix.


   The HRS also contains some qualitative information about past problem drinking and

smoking behavior. This information is used in the empirical analysis to control for past

habit formation. The first questionnaire of the HRS includes the CAGE instrument for

clinical assessment of alcohol disorders. The acronym CAGE represents four questions that

comprise the instrument: Have you ever felt you should Cut down on your drinking (32.7

percent)? Have people Annoyed you by criticizing your drinking (16.9 percent)? Have you

ever felt bad or Guilty about drinking (21.1 percent)? Have you ever had a drink first thing

in the morning (Eye-opener) to calm your nerves or to get over a hang-over (8.7 percent)?

Item responses on the CAGE are scored 0 or 1, with a high score indicating the presence

of an alcohol problem. We define “problem drinkers” as those persons with a score of 2

or more on the CAGE scale. This is a conservative measure since most of the difference is

between 0 and 1. Edwards, Marshall, and Cook (1997) conclude that “these tests (describes

another test–MAST as well as CAGE) generally tend to pick up the more extreme rather

than the early cases ... they show remarkably good sensitivity and specificity (refers to type

1 and type 2 errors in doctor talk) for ’excessive drinking’ as well as ’alcoholism’ and may

be superior to laboratory tests when used as screening instruments” (p. 197), 23.6 percent




                                              8
of the males in our sample are classified as problem drinkers.11


    With regard to past smoking behavior, the HRS asks when former smokers quit. To

capture past smoking behavior, we construct a time invariant dummy variable which equals

one if the individual quit less than 10 years ago or smoked at wave 1 and is zero otherwise.

34.5 percent of the individuals in the sample are classified as “problem smokers,” people

who entered the survey with smoking in their recent history.


    High levels of alcohol use and smoking are highly correlated in our data and in other

samples.12 Thus, many of the same men who were at risk of poor health because of their

alcohol consumption patterns were also at high risk because of their smoking. Although use

of each substance carries its own risk when used independently of each other, some joint

effects are appreciable.


    Self-reported health status is measured on a 5-point Likert scale ranging from excellent

(1) to poor (5). Table 1 shows the sample means for each of the five categories as they

evolve over time. Self-reported health status declines throughout most of the observational

period. However, the sample means do not decline monotonically as one may have expected,

especially for adjacent response categories, which may be due to measurement error in the

variable. We therefore investigate whether we can aggregate the information in self-reported

health status to a simple bivariate health indicator. We find that a health status variable

which is equal to one if the individual is in good health (self-reported health status less

health and bad health.13


         We also control for a number of demographic characteristics. Educational attainment

is measured by an indicator variable equal to one if the individual has a college education

and is zero otherwise. 25.9 percent of men in our sample have a college degree. We also

create a variable for the person’s expected longevity. We experimented with different family

background variables and chose an indicator based on the life span of the mother. 23.8

percent of the sample report that their mothers died by age 70.


         We supplement the HRS data with price information for cigarettes, liquor, beer and

wine collected by American Chamber of Commerce Researchers’ Association (ACCRA) for

a large number different localities. A price index for alcohol is constructed by weighting the

prices for liquor, beer and wine using the expenditure shares in the Consumer Price Index.

We assign alcohol and cigarette prices to individuals in the HRS sample using prices of the

nearest locality for which we have ACCRA data.14




3         The Framework


Previous analysis of the rational addiction hypothesis has been typically based on versions

of the Becker-Murphy (1988) model which rests on the assumption that individuals make

continuous choices. As discussed above, the HRS only contains discrete measures of smoking

    13
    For a discussion of self-reported versus objective measures of health see Bound (1991).
    14
    For computational reasons, we need to discretized prices for alcohol and tobacco. We split the sample
into 16 subsamples and use the mean prices in the subsamples as points in the grid.



                                                   10
and heavy drinking. We, therefore, adapt an alternative modelling framework based on the

dynamic discrete choice literature.



3.1    A Model of Forward-Looking Behavior


Consider the following model of individual decision making. Let J denote the number of

alternatives in the choice set (Dt ) available to an individual in a given period. In the our

model, individuals can engage in heavy drinking or not. They also choose whether or not to

smoke.15 Hence there are four mutually exclusive elements in the choice set. Let djt ∈ {0, 1}

denote an indicator variable which equals one if the individual chooses alternative j at time

t and is zero otherwise. Let the vector dt = (d1t , ..., dJt ) characterize choices of an individual

at t. Since the alternatives are mutually exclusive,


                                              J
                                              X
                                                    djt = 1                                            (3.1)
                                              j=1



Besides the control variables, dt , there is a vector of state variables, st . State variables

can be decomposed into an unobserved component, t , and an observed component, xt .

Observed state variables in our model are the following:


    • y: income in 25 states ranging from $4,000 to $100,000.


    • pa : price of alcohol in 4 states.

  15
     As noted in the previous section, heavy drinking and smoking is strongly correlated. Failing to control
for either heavy alcohol use or smoking is likely to bias the findings, both regarding the effects of alcohol
and tobacco consumption on health, earnings and other outcomes.




                                                     11
   • pc : price of tobacco in 4 states.


   • t: age in 20 states ranging from 50-90 years of age.


   • h: health status good, bad or dead.


   • la: lagged decision to consume 3 or more drinks of alcohol daily.


   • lc: lagged decision to consume tobacco.


   • as: indicator for problem drinking.


   • cs: indicator for problem smoking.


   • l: indicator for expected longevity.


   • ed: educational status: college education or not.


The construction of the state variables thus mimics the definition of the main variables in

the data set discussed in the previous section.


   Individuals have beliefs about uncertain future states of the world. These beliefs are

captured by a Markov transition density of the state variables ft (st+1 |st , dt ). Let ut (dt , st )

denote the single period utility function which depends on the state and control variables in

t. We assume that individuals have preferences which can be represented by a time separable

(expected) utility function with constant discount factor β. Individuals are rational and

forward-looking and behave according to an optimal decision rule δt (st ) = dt which solves




                                                 12
the following maximization problem:

                                                    ( T                           )
                                                     X
                                 max           Eδ          β t ut (dt , st ) s0 = s              (3.2)
                             δ=(δ1 ,...,δT )
                                                     t=0



where Eδ denotes the expectation with respect to the controlled stochastic process {st , dt }

induced by the decision rule, δ.



3.2    A Parameterization of the Model

                      PJ
Let ut (dt , xt ) =    j=1 djt uj (xt )   denote the single period utility function which depends on

the state and control variables in t. We use the following specification:16



           uj (xt ) = θ0j + θ1j ln(yt − e(ajt , cjt )) + θ2j ht + θ3j ast + θ4j cst

                           + θ5 1{quit drinking} + θ6 1{quit smoking}                            (3.3)



where 1{·} denotes an indicator function which is equal to one if the event inside the

brackets happens and is zero otherwise. This specification implies that each choice has a

fixed effect denoted θ0j . The utility derived from income, θ1j , and health, θ2j , varies across

choices. Utility depends on net income. Unfortunately, the HRS does not contain data on

expenditures on alcohol and tobacco; we therefore impute expenditures using the following

expression e(ajt , cjt ) = min{ajt pat + cjt pct , αyt }.17 Using the minimum of mean expenditures

and a fraction of income, αyt , guarantees that imputed expenditures on alcohol and tobacco

  16
    For a discussion of utility functions that depend on health status, see Viscusi and Evans (1990).
  17
    ajt (cjt ) are the mean quantity of alcohol (tobacco) consumption in the sample for individuals who
consume alcohol given choice j. It is zero if choice j is abstaining.


                                                             13
are not excessively high for low income people who are likely to consume cheaper products

than the average individual in our sample. Utility also varies systematically among observed

types of individuals. Problem drinkers and smokers may have different preferences than

other individuals. These differences in utility are captured by θ3j and θ4j .


       The last two parameters, θ5 and θ6 , are designed to capture habit persistence of smoking

and heavy drinking. We expect that θ5 (θ6 ) is positive indicating that quitting heavy

drinking (smoking) is costly to individuals because of withdrawal effects. Since it is hard

to assign quitting costs to the choices, we prefer to think of these parameters of the utility

function as measures of habit persistence and estimate them as part of the parameters of

the utility function.18


       Furthermore we assume that the transition probabilities are given by:



          ft (st+1 |st , dt ) = f1t (yt+1 |yt , ht , ast , cst , edt , dt ) × f2t (ht+1 |ht , ast , cst , lt , dt )

                                    × f3t (pat+1 , pct+1 |pat , pct )                                                 (3.4)



The transitions for income are implicitly given by a log-normal regression model. The

transition probabilities for health and mortality are logit models. These specifications are

implicitly based on a number of plausible, but admittedly ad hoc exclusion restrictions. We

assume that income does not affect health transitions after controlling for lagged health.

Expected longevity affects the health status transitions, but is excluded from the utility and

  18
     Since discrete choices only depend on relative utility levels, we can normalize a set of coefficients. We
set θ11 = 1 and θi1 = 0 for i 6= 1.




                                                               14
earnings functions. Education only affects earnings. These exclusions give rise to variation

in the choice probabilities which helps in estimating some of the structural parameters.

Identification is also aided by the inherent nonlinearities of the model. To simplify the

analysis, we assume that prices evolve deterministically and that individuals have correct

point expectations about current and future prices.19



3.3      Estimation


The parameters of our model consist of the parameters of the utility function and the tran-

sition probabilities. Let θ denote the parameter vector to be estimated. Since a Markov

decision process yields deterministic decision rules, we need to rely on unobserved state

variables to generate a properly defined econometric model. Rust (1987) shows that if the

unobserved state variables satisfy the assumptions of additive separability (AS) and condi-

tional independence (CI), conditional choice probabilities are well defined. If we additionally

assume that the unobservables follow a Type I extreme value distribution, we obtain Rust’s

multinomial dynamic logit specification:


                                                           exp(vjt (xt , θ))
                              Pt (djt = 1 | xt ) =     PJ                                              (3.5)
                                                          i=1 exp(vit (xt , θ))



where the conditional value function vjt (x, θ) is recursively defined as:



       vjT (xT , θ) = ujT (xT , θ)                                                                     (3.6)

  19
    This assumption is implicitly made in most previous studies. For a time series analysis of tobacco prices
and an investigation of decision making in the presence of price uncertainty, see Coppejans and Sieg (2001).



                                                     15
                                                                              
                                        Z             J
                                                      X
      vjt (xt , θ) = ujt (xt , θ) + β       log          exp{vjt+1 (xt+1 , θ)} p(dxt+1 |xt , dt , θ)
                                                    j=1



Substituting these value functions into equation (3.5) yields the conditional choice proba-

bilities of the dynamic logit model. We observe a panel of N individuals over T periods.

The model can be estimated using a Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE):


                                   N Y
                                   Y T
                  θ̂ = argmax                Pt (dnt | xnt , θ) ft (xnt |xn,t−1 , dnt−1 , θ)           (3.7)
                                   n=1 t=1



To compute the conditional choice probabilities, we need to know the optimal decision rules

and hence must solve the decision problem for each individual in the sample repeatedly.

To implement the estimator, we can use a two-step procedure: (1) estimate the transition

densities for the state variables; and (2) estimate the remaining structural parameters using

the conditional choice probabilities.



3.4    Myopic Behavior


As discussed above, heavy drinking and smoking can also stem from myopic behavior which

implies that individuals ignore future risks of harmful consumption goods. The myopic

model is nested in the forward-looking model described above. In the limiting case of the

myopic model, individuals ignore the future.20 We can obtain this version of the myopic

model by setting the discount factor β equal to zero. The choice probabilities are then given

  20
     We condition our analysis on behavior prior to age 50. Hence, our analysis does not allow us to make
statements about behavior of younger adults who may be more likely to engage in myopic behavior. See
Gruber and Koeszegi (2000).




                                                      16
by the simple (static) logit model:


                                                          exp(ujt (xt , θ))
                             Pt (djt = 1 | xt ) =     PJ                                              (3.8)
                                                         i=1 exp(uit (xt , θ))



More generally, we can thus distinguish between myopic and forward-looking models based

on the value of β. Low estimated values of β suggest myopia; large values of the two-period

discount factor β in the magnitude of 0.9 are an indication of “fully rational” behavior.

Alternatively, we could vary the planning horizon T and obtain different versions of our

model. If T exceeds t by a few time periods, the planning horizon is short. If T is set

equal to the maximum life expectancy, we obtain the fully rational model which is typically

considered in the rational addiction theory.21



3.5      Heterogeneity in Discount Factors


Thus far, we have assumed that individuals are either myopic or forward-looking. A more

general framework should control for the fact that individuals differ in their degree of

forward-looking behavior. These differences may be due to observable characteristics.


       We can extend our framework to allow for observed differences in the planning horizon

of individuals. The basic idea is to make the discount factor a function of observables,

phn , with good predictive power regarding the length of the planning horizon. The HRS

contains questions about attitudes toward risk and the length of the planning horizon in

  21
     The utility function in the simple logit model can also be interpreted as a linear approximation of the
conditional value function. Following that line of reasoning, we are then comparing dynamic models based
on full solution algorithms with those based on linear approximations of value functions. It is hard to
distinguish between the two alternative interpretations of the simple logit model.


                                                    17
wave 1. We use these variables to construct a discrete time-invariant random variable,

phn , which classifies our sample into two subsamples. It is be reasonable to expect that

individuals who differ in their answers to these types of questions, will also differ in their

degree of forward-looking behavior. More generally, we assume that the discount factor is

a function of observable characteristics, phn , and that:


                               exp(γ1 + γ2 phn )
                      βn =                                     n = 1, ...N                    (3.9)
                             1 + exp(γ1 + γ2 phn )


The logit specification for the discount factor constrains the discount factor to be between 0

and 1. Testing for significance of γ2 allows us to analyze whether individuals have different

planning horizons.


       Alternatively, differences in planning horizons may be due to unobserved factors. It is

common practice in econometrics to account for unobserved state variables using a non-

parametric approach which allows for a finite mixture of types, each comprising a fixed

proportion of the population.22 Following this approach, we assume that there are M

discrete types of individuals that differ in their discount factor:


                                      exp(γi )
                             βi =                        i = 1, ...M                         (3.10)
                                    1 + exp(γi )


We then need to solve the model conditional on a discount factor and compute the expected

  22
    This approach was introduced into the econometric literature by Heckman and Singer (1984). Keane
and Wolpin (1997) discuss how to use this approach in a dynamic discrete choice framework. See also
Arcidiacono and Jones (2000).

                                           n=1 m=1        t=1



where πm denotes the probability of type m and superscript m in Ptm (·) indicates that

choices depend on the unobserved type m.23




4         Estimation Results: Transition Probabilities


In the previous section, we saw that the behavior predicted by the forward-looking model

depends on beliefs that individuals hold about the evolution of the main state variables. In

our model, individuals have beliefs about transitions of their health status, mortality, and

income. Estimating these beliefs for reasonably parametrized dynamic programming models

is a daunting task since beliefs are likely to depend on a number of variables which may

only be partially observed by the econometrician. They may also vary among individuals.

We must therefore rely on a number of simplifying assumptions to implement our approach.


         The main assumption is that individuals subjective beliefs correspond to probability

measures that can be estimated based on observed data. Furthermore, we impose additional

structure on the functional forms of the transition probabilities to reduce the “curse of

dimensionality” encountered in the analysis. In this section, we discuss the main findings

of the estimation of the transition probabilities.

    23
    We can use the same approach to control for unobserved heterogeneity in the transition probabilities.
While there are many other ways proposed in the econometric literature to control for unobserved hetero-
geneity, the procedure adapted in this study is powerful for the types of models estimated here.

by mother’s age of death) are significantly different from zero in all models and have the

expected signs. Heavy drinking in the past and smoking have more important negative

effects on health than does current heavy drinking.


       Previous medical studies have documented the potential negative health effects of heavy

drinking among the elderly. Equal doses of alcohol produce higher blood alcohol levels

among the elderly compared to the young. Heavy alcohol use increase the risks of injuries

and illnesses, including falls, depression, and cognitive impairment, and mortality (Andreas-

son, 1998). The elderly are also more susceptible to the ill effects of alcoholism because of

medication and drug-alcohol interactions (Adams, Gary, Rhyne, Hunt, and Goodwin, 1990).

We may not pick up these effects as strongly as do studies based on clinical tests. Our find-

ings are also consistent with the large medical literature documenting adverse effects of

smoking on health.


       We also estimate logit regressions with survival as the dependent variable. The de-

pendent variable is equal to zero if the individual died in the two years between adjacent

waves of the panel and one otherwise. Estimating these transitions is important because

smoking and heavy drinking are likely to reduce the life span of an individual, and thus

  24
    We have estimated a large number of transition model sand only report the findings for those models
that we use to estimate preferences.




                                                  21
reduce lifetime utility. Out-of-sample predictions of survival rates are needed to solve the

computational dynamic programming model. Accurate estimation of these transitions is

therefore an important component of the overall modelling strategy.25


    Our main findings are quite plausible. Past health and age are significant and have

the expected sign. Heavy current drinking has, at best, small effects on the probability of

death in the next period. In contrast, past heavy drinking indicated by the coefficient of the

problem drinking variable as well as smoking, both currently and in the past, significantly

increase the probability of dying in the subsequent period.


    Estimating beliefs that individuals hold about income transitions is also complex. Cur-

rent income of individuals obviously is largely affected by current and past labor market par-

ticipation, retirement and saving decisions. Modelling these decisions within a well-defined

dynamic programming model is exceedingly complicated as documented, for example, by

Rust and Phelan (1997). We do not seek to improve upon these efforts. Instead, we an-

alyze interactions between consumption of various harmful goods and their health effects.

We therefore adapt a reduced form approach for modelling the income process. The main

approach for modelling income transitions is based on log-normal income regressions.


    In general, our findings are quite reasonable. The parameters have the expected sign

in almost all cases and are often estimated precisely. Not surprisingly, income follows a

strong autoregressive process.26 Past health and age are significant in all three models

  25
     The main problem encountered in estimating conditional survival rates is that there are only a small
number of individuals in the HRS that die during the length of the panel. Brown and Sieg (2001) ex-
plore methods based on Imbens and Lancaster (1994) to estimate mortality models more efficiently using a
combination of micro data from the HRS and aggregate data form life-tables.
  26
     Income is measured as total household income and therefore one would expect a lower coefficient than



                                                   22
and have the expected negative sign. College education is positive and significant. Both

past and current drinking, as well as past and current smoking, negatively affect future

income. Smoking interacted with college had a particularly strong negative effect on future

household income.


    In summary, we have shown how to estimate beliefs of individuals based on observed

outcomes using a variety of different techniques. Despite the inherent problems of estimating

beliefs, our results are quite reasonable. Most of the parameters have the correct sign and

are often significantly different from zero. Current and past smoking and heavy drinking

affect health status, mortality rates and income even after controlling for lagged dependent

variables in the analysis. Given these findings, we assess different behavioral models of high

levels of alcohol consumption and smoking.




5     Estimation Results: Preferences


5.1    Myopic and Forward-looking Models


We estimate the preference parameters of the utility function specified in equation (3.3)

using myopic and forward-looking model specifications. The myopic model is obtained by

setting the discount factor equal to 0.0. The fully rational model uses a two-period discount

rate of 0.9. We also estimate an unconstrained dynamic model by searching over a grid for

β. Our models control for habit formation in two different ways. We use time invariant

measures of problem drinking and smoking. We also control for switching cost by including

estimates typically found for labor income.


                                              23
lagged choices.


       Most of the coefficients in the utility functions have the expected sign and are statistically

significant. Our results suggest that, on average, lower income individuals are more likely

to engage in smoking and heavy drinking. Including variables for habit formation improves

the fit of the model considerably. There are substantial costs for quitting smoking or heavy

drinking. Quitting smoking, however, is much harder than quitting heavy drinking. The

effect of health on the decisions to drink or smoke point to problems in the fully rational

model. Heavy drinking and smoking is more attractive for those in bad health which is

counterintuitive.


       The values of the likelihood functions indicate that the myopic model (β = 0) fits the

data better than the fully rational model (β = 0.9). The unconstrained estimate of the

model yields a point estimate for the two-period discount factor β of approximately 0.62,

which translates into an annual discount factor of approximately 0.78.27 We also estimate

a number of models excluding any measure of habit formation. These models are clearly

rejected by the data. Even the fully rational model fits the data much better than these

specifications.


       To further illustrate the findings, we trace out the likelihood function as a function

of β. The results are shown in Figure 1. The likelihood function is relatively flat for a

large number of β’s, but drastically decreases once the two-year discount factor exceeds

0.65. Thus it appears that a class of models with annual discount factors less than 0.8

  27
   Discount rates both higher and lower have been reported in the literature. These studies use different
approaches for estimating discount rates than we do. See Hausman (1979), Dreyfus and Viscusi (1995),
Moore and Viscusi (1988, 1990), and Warner and Pleeter (2001).

FIGURE 1



5.2   Unobserved Heterogeneity and Heterogeneity in Discount Factors


The above models did not account for unobserved heterogeneity among individuals. Failure

to account for unobserved heterogeneity may seriously bias the estimates of the parameters

of the model. Adding mixture distributions allows for the errors in the transitions to be

correlated and also correlated with the errors in the preferences. Further, the mixture

distributions allow the errors in the preferences to be correlated over time.


   We estimated a mixture distribution with two types and allowed the types to be corre-

lated across all stages of the model. From a variety of starting values, the model consistently

converged to a place where over 99% of the observations were of one type. We surmise that

this occurs because of the combination of using lagged variables and a short (6-year) panel.

Lagged income and health, with the other explanatory variables, account for much of the

variation in the transitions. Lagged smoking and excess alcohol use, with variables char-

acterizing problem smoking or drinking, absorbs most the variation in preferences. With

a short panel, there is apparently little scope for unobserved heterogeneity. As seen be-

low, even without controlling for unobserved heterogeneity, the model with an estimated

discount factor fits the data very well.


   We also examined models with observed and unobserved heterogeneity in the discount



                                              26
factor. Estimating the model with two types where types only differed in the discount

factor yielded no change in the estimates. We also tested whether individuals with different

cognitive skills, financial planning horizons, and education had different discount factors. In

each case, we split the sample into groups: one with high values for the variable (cognitive

skills, etc.) and one with low values. Coefficients across the groups were constrained

to be equal except for the discount factor. The differences in the discount factors were

at most a quarter of a percentage point and not statistically different from one another.

Large differences in the discount factor would produce large differences in the drinking and

smoking profiles which is inconsistent with the data.




6    Goodness of Fit and Out-of-Sample Predictions


In this section, we investigate the predictive power of the different models that we estimated

in the previous sections. Table 5 reports statistics which are commonly used to evaluate

the within sample predictions of models.


    Table 5 suggests that there are only small differences in the models’ predictions. All of

the models match the overall trend in the data well. However, heavy drinking and smoking

behavior start at higher rates and drop off more quickly, the higher the discount factor.

However, we conclude that all four models fit the proportion of individuals heavy drinking

and smoking reasonably well.


    A more interesting comparison of the different models examines out-of sample predic-

tions. In this study, we focus on predicted heavy drinking and smoking profiles as a function

of age. We run the following experiment. Take the set of individuals in our data and fore-

cast out the probabilities of heavy drinking and smoking at each age. We condition on

being alive by dividing the unconditional probabilities of smoking and heavy drinking by

the mean probability of being alive at a particular age. That is, individuals with a high

probability of dying are weighted less in later years than those who have a low probability

of dying. The main results are shown in Figures 2 and 3.


   On these same figures, we also plot the profiles for HRS data as well as data from the

Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old (AHEAD). AHEAD is a companion

data set to HRS which contains individuals that were aged 70 or over in 1993, and their

spouses who could be any age. In particular, the HRS data are used for ages 52 to 72, and

then the wave 1 AHEAD data are attached for ages 72 to 90. One caution is necessary

when examining the AHEAD data: the model was estimated with permanent abstainers

removed; this was not possible for the AHEAD data.



                                            28
FIGURES 2 and 3


   Vast differences across the models are apparent when examining the age-smoking pro-

files. The myopic model predicts very flat profiles and even slightly increasing smoking rates

between the ages of 55 and 76. As individuals age, they become more unhealthy which makes

smoking less attractive. However, they also become poorer which makes smoking more at-

tractive. This latter effect appears to be slightly stronger until age 76 in the myopic model.

The drop off after 76 occurs because those people who find smoking most attractive are

dying off rapidly.


   In contrast, the fully rational model predicts sharp declines in smoking rates. Here,

individuals smoke more than in the myopic model up until the age of 57. The decline

in smoking rates occurs because the marginal adverse health effects of smoking increase

as individuals age. Individuals in the fully rational model know when, and when not, to

smoke. At about the same point as the myopic model shows decreases in smoking rates,

the fully rational model shows increases in smoking rates. This occurs because individuals

know they are going to die soon so they might as well enjoy the little time they have left.


   The model in which the discount factor is estimated yields profiles in between the fully

rational and myopic model until age 83. After age 83, the model predicts lower smoking

rates than either of the myopic or the fully rational model. This model clearly matches

the trends in the data best, both in and out of sample. That some sort of forward-looking

behavior is present is clear from the upward trend in the smoking behavior at the end of




                                             29
the life cycle.28 This holds despite the fact that those who were most attracted to smoking

had most likely died at this point. Indeed, an upward trend is not necessary for a model

with forward-looking behavior to be correct. Those who have a propensity to smoke die at

a higher rate than those who do not.


         Although the model with an estimated discount factor predicts smoking behavior well

both in and out of sample, this is not true for heavy drinking. In fact, both the myopic

and the estimated discount factor model predict very flat age-drinking profiles. The fully

rational has individuals engaging in heavy drinking at a much higher rate late in the life

cycle which is the exact opposite of what occurs in the data. The data show sharp declines

in alcohol consumption later in the life-cycle. However, a deficiency in the construction of

the data is important: AHEAD did not have the information needed to remove permanent

abstainers. This would obviously affect the profiles for heavy drinking much more than for

smoking.




7         Conclusions


This study has analyzed smoking and heavy drinking in a sample of elderly individuals

drawn from the HRS. The main objective of the analysis has been to investigate whether

models of forward-looking behavior explain the main regularities found in the data better

than myopic models. Earlier studies have typically assumed that individuals are either

myopic or forward-looking. In contrast, we provide an empirical framework which allows

    28
         However, only twenty observations were available for the age 90 category.



                                                        30
us to control for varying degrees of forward-looking behavior of individuals and, therefore,

nest the competing theories. Estimating the discount factor is clearly desirable and helps

us to distinguish between the competing hypothesis which have been put forward to explain

the consumption of harmful and addictive goods. Our analysis suggests that models with

moderate discount factors above the myopic but below the level commonly used in modelling

forward-looking behavior and which control for observed habit formation fit the data the

best. They also have the best predictive power for a sample of mean above age 70. Our

analysis thus provides strong evidence for the hypothesis that older individuals are forward-

looking and take future risks associated with smoking and heavy drinking into consideration

when determining their choices. However, events outside a planning horizon of five years

are heavily discounted and receive little weight in current decision making.


   Our analysis relies on a number of simplifying assumptions. Most of the exclusion

restrictions reflect computational considerations. Models based on hyperbolic discounting

present an alternative to the two types of models considered here. Our framework could also

be used to estimate a behavioral model with hyperbolic discount factors. Future research,

with longer panels, should investigate whether these hybrid models provide better fits of

the data than models we analyzed. Although estimating hyperbolic-discounting models

is feasible, in principle, additional problems arise because of the need to estimate two

separate discount factors. Given the availability of only short panels, it may prove to be

quite challenging to precisely estimate these types of models. Nevertheless, our results

are quite promising for further work which combines formal decision-theoretic analysis and

estimation to address questions regarding the degree of forward-looking behavior imposed
