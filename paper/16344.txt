When, Where, and Why? Early Industrialization in the Poor Periphery 1870-1940

                                            ABSTRACT

This paper documents industrial output and labor productivity growth around the poor periphery 1870-1940
(Latin America, the European periphery, the Middle East, South Asia, Southeast Asia and East Asia).
Intensive and extensive industrial growth accelerated there over these seven critical decades. There
was an acceleration by the precocious leaders and more poor countries joined their club. Furthermore,
many were actually catching up on Germany, the US and the UK. The paper then reports an early
effort to identify the sources underlying the spread of the industrial revolution to the poor periphery.
Productivity growth certainly made their industries more competitive in home and foreign markets,
but other forces may have mattered more. Ever-cheaper labor gave them an edge in labor-intensive
industries, increasingly cheap fuel and non-fuel intermediates from globally integrating markets appear
to have taken resource advantages away from the European and North American leaders, and real
exchange rate depreciation raised the price of import-competing manufactured goods at home. Tariffs
helped protect the home market, but more modestly. All of this took place long before the popular
post-WWII ISI strategies, especially in Latin America and Russia, where they had their origin.

                                       1. Motivation



       There are some parts of Africa and Asia where modern factories are rare even

today, where most local manufactures are still produced by artisans in small shops, and

where only the minority live in cities. But in some parts of the poor periphery modern

industrialization started more than a century ago. Latin America had two emerging

industrial leaders in the late 19th and early 20th century – Brazil and Mexico, East Asia

had two – Japan and Shanghai, and the European periphery had at least three – Catalonia,

the north Italian triangle and Russia. This paper will show that some of these periphery

industrializers were growing fast enough to have started catching up on the established

industrial leaders (Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom). It will also

show that the pace greatly accelerated in the interwar decades: many more joined the

catching up club – Argentina, Colombia, Greece, India, Italy, Korea, Manchuria, Peru,

the Philippines, Taiwan, and Turkey; and the overall rates of industrial output growth

accelerated even for the leading periphery industrializers – most notably, Brazil, Japan,

Mexico and Russia. Why did industrialization in the poor periphery start in the half

century 1870-1913 (long before the Third World growth miracles of the late 20th century)

and why in these places? Why did the spread of the industrial revolution to the poor

periphery accelerate so dramatically in the interwar years? What were the main forces

driving the diffusion of modern industry?

       No doubt the answers are as complex as any question dealing more generally with

the causes of modern economic growth, and no doubt any answer should include

fundamentals like culture, geography, institutions and good government. But there is, in

addition, a simpler explanation that would appeal to the growth theorist: As the Great


                                             3
Divergence took place, labor became increasingly expensive in the industrial core relative

to the poor periphery. Thus, the poor periphery became increasingly competitive in labor-

intensive manufacturing. Here’s another simpler explanation to add to the list: after a

dramatic rise in the poor periphery’s terms of trade up to its late 19th century peak

(Williamson 2008, 2011), it then fell almost as dramatically to the 1930s (Prebisch 1950;

Singer 1950), thus producing a sharp rise in the relative price of manufactures, favoring

home industry. Here’s yet a third simple explanation to add to the growing list: trade and

exchange rate policy changed dramatically in favor of import-competing manufactures.

And here’s still a fourth simple explanation to add: those poor countries scarce in

manufacturing intermediates (cotton, minerals) and the coal or petroleum to run their

steam engines, found these disadvantages vis a vis well endowed industrial powers

evaporating as world markets delivered those intermediates at ever-cheaper prices. In all

four cases, global forces had a chance to shine.

        But why do I care so much about industrialization when the rest of the recent

development/history literature has been content with GDP per capita and proxies for

same?1 The answer is that I believe that industry and cities are carriers of growth, not just

proxies for the same. There are at least six decades of theory that strongly supports my

belief. Certainly the new endogenous growth theories (e.g. Krugman 1981, 1991a, 1991b;

Krugman and Venables 1995; Romer 1986, 1990; Lucas 2009: see also the summary in

Baldwin and Martin 2006) imply that urban-industrial activities contain far more cost-

reducing and productivity-enhancing forces than do traditional agriculture and traditional

 I refer here to the spectacular contributions of the economists Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, James
Robinson and their followers, as well as economic historians exploring the great divergence, like Robert
Allen and Kenneth Pomeranz, and all the many scholars who have used Angus Maddison’s famous data.


                                                    4
services.2 This notion is so embedded in mainstream economic thinking that it gets

important exposure in modern surveys of growth theory (e.g. Helpman 2004: Chp. 5).

Indeed, how else can industrialization – that is, an increase in the share of economic

activity based in industry – take place without more rapid rates of total factor productivity

growth there? After all, it is relatively rapid productivity advance in industry that lowers

its relative costs and prices, raises demand for its output, pulls resources from other less

dynamic sectors to augment its capacity to meet that increased demand, and makes it

expand in relative size. Thus, given that industry achieves much higher growth rates

during the industrial revolution than do other sectors, GDP growth rates quicken as the

dynamic sector pulls up the average. And as industry grows in relative importance, its

impact on overall GDP growth rates rises as well. The explanations offered for this

asymmetric effect favoring rapid productivity growth in urban industry are many. Here

are just five: urban clusters foster agglomeration economies; denser urban product and

factor markets imply more efficient markets; a more skill-intensive industry and its

modern support services fosters the demand for and accumulation of skills; a denser

urban-industrial complex tends to generate a more extensive productivity-enhancing

knowledge transfer between firms; and industrial firms are more able to draw on

technological best practice used by world leaders.

        The historical evidence certainly confirms the theory. Figure 1 plots the

correlation, both in logs, between GDP per capita observed between 1820 and 1950

(Maddison 2001), and the level of industrialization per capita 50 or 70 years earlier

 Although modern endogenous growth rarely cites them, they were anticipated in the 1950s and 1960s by
two-sector models.

(Bairoch 1982). The correlation is steep and strongly significant implying that faster

future growth is correlated with current levels of industrialization.

        This paper measures industrial or manufacturing output growth in the poor

periphery over the short century 1870-1940. It does it in three parts, roughly two decades

each: 1870-1890, 1890-1913 and 1920-1940. It also compares the growth performance

with that of the industrial leaders -- Germany, the United States and the United Kingdom

-- to identify who was catching up, who was just keeping even, and who was falling

behind.3 It then reports industrial labor productivity growth to see who was catching up

or falling behind in that dimension as well. To the extent that productivity advance was

most directly affected by culture and institutions, we have a chance to see whether it was

productivity or per input costs and output prices driving profitability in industry and thus

the timing and location of early industrialization in the poor periphery.4



        2. Industrial Catching Up in the Poor Periphery: When and Where?



The Data

        Secondary sources have allowed me to document constant price ‘industrial’

output for 26 members of the poor periphery for 1920-1940, the last of my three periods:

Argentina, Austria, Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, China, Colombia, Egypt, Greece, Hungary,

India, Indonesia, Italy, Japan, Korea, Mexico, Peru, the Philippines, Portugal, Romania,

Spain, Taiwan, Turkey, Uruguay, the USSR, and Yugoslavia. Of course, the same

3
  This, of course, is the language of my mentor Moses Abramovitz (1986). Note, however, that Table 1 (p.
391) of his oft-cited EHA Presidential Address is based on 15 countries, only one of which – Japan – is not
western European or an English-speaking European offshoot.
4
  Gregory Clark (1987) asked a similar question some time ago, but his focus was on between-country
differences in 1910, while my focus is on within-country changes 1870-1940.


                                                     6
definition of ‘industry’ is not always used in all country studies: based on their primary

sources, some scholars restrict the industry definition to manufacturing alone (12); some

add construction to the total (2); some add in addition mining (2); some add in addition

some combination of transportation and utilities (9); and one was forced to use non-

agriculture (Turkey). Thus, heterogeneity exists in the data, but where the alternative

series are available for any given country, the growth rates rarely if ever differ much

across the industry definition. In addition, although some sources report net value added,

some report gross value added and some report production or output indices, when a

country source offers more than one such time series, the resulting growth rates differ

very little.5

        Not surprisingly, the sample shrinks a bit as we move back in time: while there

are 26 countries in the 1920-1940 sample, seven disappear when moving back to 1890-

1913, leaving 19; and the sample shrinks still further in 1870-1890 to 13. While I am still

looking to expand the sample for the pre-1913 period, I doubt that many more will be

added to the list any time soon.

        Documenting manufacturing output growth in the poor periphery was hard

enough, but finding the employment data to convert output to labor productivity growth

was even harder. The somewhat smaller country samples for industrial labor productivity

growth are 24 for 1920-1940, 16 for 1890-1913, and 10 for 1870-1890.

        Appendix 1 reports the sources of the output growth rate estimates and Appendix

2 does the same for labor productivity.


5
 What matters far more is the importance of artisan non-factory manufactures production and its demise
over time. Factory manufactures production grows faster than total manufactures production, and factory
manufacturing labor productivity grows more slowly than total manufacturing productivity, as high
productivity factories displace low productivity cottage industry.


                                                    7
Industrial Catching Up

         Table 1 reports industrial output growth – always in constant prices – for the three

leaders (again, Germany, the US, and the UK) and the sample of 26 in the poor periphery

(there are two for China, the whole Mainland – including Manchuria -- and Shanghai

alone). Between 1870 and 1890, the fastest industrializing region by far was Latin

America, led by Argentina, Chile and Mexico. The two other industrialization hot spots

were Russia in the European periphery and Japan in Asia, but even these two did not

reach the rates of industrial output growth that Latin America achieved. Between 1890

and 1913, the poor periphery industrializing club widen and deepened: Serbia joined

Russia in the European periphery; Brazil and Peru joined the Latin American club (but

Chile dropped out); and China and colonial India joined Japan in Asian club. Between

1920 and 1940, the club got much bigger with the addition of Colombia, Greece, Italy,

colonial Korea, colonial Manchuria, colonial Philippines, newly republican Turkey, and

colonial Taiwan.

         Two morals follow. First, colonial status and or lack of policy autonomy did not

necessarily suppress industrialization. True, it did suppress it 1870-1890, confirming the

conventional view: Table 2 shows that those with autonomy recorded much faster

industrial output growth (relative to the leaders) than did those without autonomy, 1.03

versus -1.06 percent per annum, a 2.09 percent point spread favoring those with

autonomy. However, this was not true over the half century thereafter: indeed, industrial

output growth (relative to the leaders) favored those without autonomy 1890-1913, by

0.78 percentage points, and 1920-1940, by 0.50 percentage points.6 Second, the spread of


6
 Thus, the evidence from this sample is not always consistent with the conventional wisdom: “The
imperialist powers of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries generally tried to use their colonies as


                                                      8
the industrial revolution to the poor periphery gained speed, depth and breadth as the

short century unfolded, reaching an impressive crescendo in the two interwar decades.

         What about catching up on the industrial leaders, Germany, the US and the UK?

Table 3 reports the answer. Between 1870 and 1890, only Latin American industry was

growing fast enough to start catching up to the industrial leaders (at a very hefty 2.75

percentage points per annum). Apart from precocious Latin America, only Russia in the

European periphery and Japan in Asia could report any catching up in the first period.

While Spain and Uruguay were holding their own, the rest were falling behind, especially

India and Indonesia. Between 1890 and 1913, Latin America was still catching up on the

leaders (now at 1.2 percentage points per annum), and Peru had joined the Latin

American club (replacing Chile, which now had fallen behind7). Between 1920 and 1940,

more than two thirds (an impressive 18 out of 268) of our poor periphery sample were

catching up on the leaders. Six of the eight falling behind were in the European periphery

-- Austria, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Serbia and Spain – joined by Chile and Egypt.

Part of this impressive surge in catching up in the interwar can be traced, of course, to the

slowdown in output growth among the three leaders due to the great depression (a 0.67

percentage point drop in their average industrial growth rates from 3.84 in 1890-1913 to

3.17 in 1920-1940). But in the Middle East and Asia, most of the catch up surge was due

to an acceleration in the poor periphery itself. And in the European periphery and Latin

America, the depression-induced fall in manufacturing growth rates was much less than

markets for their manufactured goods and as stable sources of raw materials for their industrial production.
Combined with their colonies’ initial poverty, these imperial policies deterred the growth of manufacturing
in most colonies” (Kim and Park 2008: p. 26). See, for example, Fieldhouse (1983) and Austin (2003).
However, it must be said that our sample excludes Africa, much of western Asia, and most of Southeast
Asia.
7
  Chile, which fell from rapid catching up 1870-1890 (+3.60) to rapid falling behind 1890-1913 (-2.10),
underwent by far the biggest reversal in our time series.

  Or 19 out of 27, if Manchuria is added as a separate observation.

with the three leaders. In any case, the biggest industrial growth rate surge between the

two periods 1890-1913 and 1920-1940 took place in the following six (where the figures

are changes in annual growth rates between the two periods, and where the rates are

relative to the three leaders: from Table 3): Brazil 0.93, India 1.57, Mexico 2.51, Japan

2.99, USSR 4.71, and Turkey 4.89.



                   3. How to Identify the Sources of Industrialization



       Figure 2 shows that manufacturing output growth (relative to the three leaders)

was not correlated with GDP per capita between 1870 and 1940 (R2 = 0.002). Whatever

were the fundamentals that determined GDP per capita – culture, geography or

institutions, they did not spill over in to rates of industrialization. So, what does explain

where and when manufacturing growth was fastest in the poor periphery?

       For me, the best way to attack this question is first to lay out explicitly the

determinants of manufacturing profitability and competitiveness. To state the obvious,

profits per unit of output equal revenue less costs per unit of output, and a rise in

manufacturing output growth should be driven by an increase in those profits. Consider

the following statement, with t = time period (1870-1890, 1890-1913, 1920-1940) and j =

country, both subscripts suppressed in the notation:

       π = p – {wl + uk + pm m + pff}                                          (1)

where p = domestic output price (world price + shipping cost + tariff)

       pm = domestic non-fuel intermediate price (world price + shipping cost + tariff)

       pf = domestic fuel price (world price + shipping cost + tariff)




                                              10
         w = domestic wage cost per unit of labor

         u = domestic user cost per unit of capital = ipk

         i = domestic real interest rate

         pk = domestic capital goods price (world price + shipping costs + tariff)

and l, k, m, and f are the labor, capital, non-fuel intermediate and fuel inputs per unit of

output (all variable over time and place).

         To the extent that I am mainly interested in the timing of industry growth between

each of the three periods 1870-1890, 1890-1913 and 1920-1940, it is the first difference

in prices and costs (c) driving changes in profits that mattered. Thus,

         dπ = dp – dc = dp - d{wl + uk + pm m + pff}                                                 (2)

In rates of change (*),

         dπ/π = dp/p– dc/c = dp/p – {φlw* + φku* + φmpm* + φfpf*} –

                                              {φll* + φkk* + φmm* + φff*}.                           (3)

The last term of expression (3) measures total factor productivity growth, where falling

input coefficients (l, k, m, f) imply positive total factor productivity growth rates which

reduce costs, raise competitiveness, and improve profitability. Since very few countries in

the poor periphery 1870-1940 offer estimates of manufacturing or industrial total factor

productivity growth, I use industry labor productivity growth as a proxy in what follows.

         How do I drape interpretive economic history on equation (3)? Here’s the list:

dp/p: I assume all poor periphery countries in my sample were much too small to have

influenced world manufacturing prices, and thus that they were price takers for those

products.9 Three forces would have served to raise the domestic price of manufactures: a


9
 I am referring here to the price of their imported manufactures, not to their export price, since many in my
sample had a profound influence on their export prices, like Chile with its copper, Brazil with its coffee, or


                                                     11
fall in the terms of trade facing these primary product exporters and manufactures

importers; a depreciation in their real exchange rates; and a rise in their tariffs (and non-

tariff barriers) on manufactures.

φlw*: Any fall in the home wage, compared with foreign competitors, would have

lowered relative costs and raised relative profitability. As the great divergence between

the industrial leaders and the poor periphery widened, it was manifested by bigger wage

and living standard gaps. Those countries whose GDP per capita was falling behind

fastest, at least had the increasing advantage of cheaper labor. This was especially true, of

course, in labor-intensive manufacturing where φl was high.

φku*: Since the user cost of capital has a financial and a real component, ipk, both might

have mattered. As their financial capital markets integrated with world markets, and as

these ‘emerging markets’ underwent a fall in the premium they had to pay for external

finance, their interest rates should have fallen compared to their foreign competitors.

Furthermore, if tariff policy was used to favor the import of capital goods relative to final

manufactured products, the relative price of capital goods should have fallen compared

with the leaders.

φmpm* and φfpf*: Textile manufacturing needs cotton, wool, flax and silk intermediates,

but many countries do not grow some or any of them. Metal manufacturing needs ores,

but many countries do not mine them. Since these are high bulk, low value products, they

were expensive to ship long distance in 1870, but transport revolutions had lowered those

costs dramatically by 1940. Manufacturing in natural resource scarce countries in the

poor periphery benefited by global market integration much more than did the resource-


Egypt with its cotton. To repeat, none of them were large enough to influence the world price of
manufactures.


                                                    12
abundant industrial leaders. In addition, modern steam-driven power in industry needed

cheap fuel. Those without coal to mine or oil to pump, suffered severe competitive

disadvantage in 1870, but that disadvantage had almost evaporated for any poor

periphery country without coal or oil reserves in the more global world of 1940 when

they could import the stuff cheaply.

tfpg = {φll* + φkk* + φmm* + φff*}: Fast total factor productivity growth (tfpg),

compared with the industrial leaders, would have improved competitiveness and

profitability. Part of any relatively fast productivity advance would have been driven by

the demise of low-productivity, small-scale cottage industry, and the relative rise in high-

productivity large-scale factories. Part of it would have taken place by improvements on

the factory floor. Part of it would have been due to between-industry and between-factory

technology transfer associated with urban agglomeration, better and denser factor

markets, and easier knowledge transfer. It also seems likely that this would be one

channel through which better institutions and better government would shine. The other

forces listed above deal instead with exogenous world forces and domestic policy, even

though the latter was surely endogenous to local political power.

       Before we press on to the empirical analysis, I need to make a qualifying

comment about equation (3). The theory there implies that I should correlate changes in

output growth between the three periods (driven by changes in profitability) with changes

in the explanatory variables. It might be argued, however, that changes in output growth

should be correlated with levels of the explanatory variables, and such correlations would

augment the sample. We will try both in what follows.




                                             13
                       4. What Mattered Most? An Early Exploration



         This section is labeled ‘an early exploration’ since it consists of a simple bi-

variate approach rather than a more complex multivariate assessment, and it is based on

an very incomplete data set documenting competing explanatory variables. A more

complete version will have to await additional documentation of some of the explanatory

variables, and a completely new documentation of others.



Productivity Growth?

         Let me start with the role of productivity growth and the reminder that labor

productivity growth is being used as a proxy for tfpg. Figure 3a reports the correlation

between manufacturing output growth less that of the three leaders (MOG-3) and

manufacturing labor productivity growth less that of the three leaders (MLPG-3), both in

percent per annum and averaged over each of the three periods. While the correlation is

certainly positive and significant (R2 =0.256), it still leaves a lot to be explained, namely

the role of world markets, world transport costs, local labor costs, domestic trade policy,

and domestic exchange rate policy.10 This is even more true when changing MOG-3

between any two periods is correlated with changing MLPG-3, as in Figure 3b (R2 =

0.147). Productivity growth catch-up contributed to output growth catch-up between

1870 and 1940, but other forces affecting output price and input costs did too.




10
  Of course, industrial productivity growth itself was not exogenous, but at least in part endogenous with
respect to world markets, world transport costs and domestic policy, especially if across-border
technological transfer rises with openness (Parente and Prescott 2002; Lucas 1993, 2009). But this is only
an early exploration.


                                                    14
Cheaper Labor?

       Many forces were at work over these three periods, but we should see some

positive correlation between rising industrial growth rates relative to the leaders, d(MOG-

3), and falling labor costs per unit of output relative to the leaders, or, as we see in Figure

4a, a negative correlation with the first differences in the GDP per capita proxy,

d(GDPpc/3). The correlation is R2 = 0.174, about the same as the correlation with

changing productivity growth. However, when levels are correlated with levels in Figure

4b, the R2 drops, suggesting that the next phase the analysis should use country fixed

effects to the extent that the focus is timing, in which case ever-cheaper labor is likely to

play a part in any explanation of the timing of industrialization in the poor periphery

before 1940.



Tariff Protection?

       Over the past two decades, the literature exploring the openness-growth

connection has boomed (typically using tariffs as the measure of openness), no doubt

because the results are very relevant to current policy formation in the Third World. The

vast majority of the literature, however, has simply looked at the correlation with GDP

per capita growth, and the result has been mixed, to say the least. The historical arm of

that literature started with Bairoch’s (1989) report of a positive (negative) correlation

between tariff heights (openness) and GDP per capita growth for pre-1914 Europe,

confirmed with better data by O’Rourke (2000), then challenged as spurious by Irwin

(2002). However, Vamvakidis (2002) showed that this was specific to the pre-1914

period since the correlation switched sign and became negative (positive) thereafter, a




                                              15
result confirmed by Clemens and Williamson (2004) on a world data base 1870-2000 and

with lots of controls. Most recently, Astorga (2010) reports a negative openness-growth

correlation for Latin America 1900-2004, also with controls.

         What’s missing from this confusing literature is, of course, an explicit assessment

of the channel of causation leading to the macro GDP per capita growth effects and an

assessment of the alleged recipient of the protection in poor countries – industry.11

         High average tariffs meant even higher tariffs on finished manufactures in the

poor periphery, perhaps two or three times higher.12 And as Figure 5 shows they were

very high indeed in autonomous Latin America and the European Periphery (see also

Coatsworth and Williamson 2004; Williamson 2006). But the impact of tariff policy on

industrialization in the poor periphery between 1870 and 1940 must have been mixed.

While tariffs in Latin America and the European Periphery between 1870-1890 and 1890-

1913 were very high and even rose, they changed hardly at all in Asia, where they

remained low. And between 1890-1913 and 1920-1940, on average tariffs fell or

remained the same everywhere in the poor periphery except Asia late in the interwar

decades. Thus, if domestic policy mattered, it probably wasn’t tariffs, as Figures 6a and

6b suggest.



Terms of Trade?

11
   There are some important recent exceptions, like Federico and Tena (1999) on Italy, Lains (2006) on
Portugal, Tena (2006) on Spain, Nunn and Trefler (2010) on the 20th century Third World, and Gómez
Galvarriato and Williamson (2009) on Latin America.
12
   See, for example, Bairoch (1993) and Williamson (2011: Chp. 13). Antonio Teña (personal
correspondence) has estimated ad valorem tariffs on British manufacturing exports for four Latin American
republics in 1914 (Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Mexico): while the tariff for all imports averaged 21.5
percent, the average tariff on British manufactures averaged 45 percent, more than twice as high. Similarly,
for the European periphery (Greece, Italy, Portugal, Russia, Spain): while the average tariff on all imports
in 1914 was 18.4 percent, the tariff on British manufactures was 46.2 percent, almost three times higher.



                                                    16
       The seminal papers by Raul Prebisch (1950), Hans Singer (1950) and W. Arthur

Lewis (1952) pointed out that the relative price of primary products had fallen

dramatically for almost a century before their date of writing. Figure 7 replicates the

Lewis-Prebisch-Singer finding. The papers by Prebisch and Singer offered support for

more than two decades of anti-global policy, stressing how a short and medium term

decline in the terms of trade would damage GDP performance. However, they did not

mention what the terms of trade decline implied for local industry: a fall in the relative

price of primary products implies, of course, a rise in the relative price of manufactures,

and thus a stimulus to manufacturing in the poor periphery. Some of the 26 countries in

our sample had steeper declines in their terms of trade than others, so the stimulus must

have varied. But in general there must have been a ubiquitous industrialization stimulus:

if the poor periphery underwent de-industrialization and Dutch disease during their

spectacular terms of trade boom from the 1800s to the 1870s (Williamson 2008; 2011:

Chp. 12), symmetry argues that they must have undergone ‘re-industrialization’ and

‘Dutch recovery’ during the terms of trade bust from the 1870s to the 1930s. We shall see

whether the data confirm this hypothesis in the next version of this paper.



Real Exchange Rates?

       Did real exchange rate depreciation give an added stimulus to industrialization in

the poor periphery over the seven decades before 1940? Depreciations do, of course,

make imported manufactures more expensive, thus stimulating local industry. But how

would nominal exchange rates be correlated with big terms of trade shocks? If exchange

rates are fixed, and change only with policy, a terms of trade collapse and a policy-




                                             17
induced exchange rate depreciation will give a mutually reinforcing stimulus to local

manufacturing in the poor periphery. But even if the exchange rate is flexible, the effect

is reinforcing: a terms of trade slump should cause a real exchange rate depreciation.

Modern evidence from commodity exporters Australia, Canada and New Zealand, all

with flexible exchange rates in recent years, confirm these predictions (Chen and Rogoff

2003). What about 1870-1940?

          The standard view is that real exchange rates were stable during the gold standard

era up to World War I. Although this standard view is based on Euro-centric evidence,

Table 4 confirms it for the poor periphery as well. True, there are many empty cells in

Table 4, and many in my 26 country sample are missing from the table. Yet, there was a

28 percent real local currency depreciation between 1890-1913 and 1920-1940, and the

figure is about 37 percent relative to 1913. The real exchange rate depreciation in the

poor periphery made manufacturing imports more expensive there and fostered some part

of the local industrialization surge.13 Just how much awaits more real exchange rate

data.14



Relative Prices of Manufacturing Intermediates and Fuel?

          There is, of course, an active debate among economic historians regarding the

importance of coal and ore deposits in giving the industrial leaders their initial advantage.

Still, the question needs to be posed in an open economy way since favorable

endowments of manufacturing intermediates and fuel may lose their importance if free

13
   Some time ago, José Campa (1990) found this effect for Latin American industrial production in the
1930s by using the Eichengreen and Sachs (1985) approach. See also Edwards (1989).
14
   As Appendix 3 notes, the real exchange rate data available for the poor periphery is limited, especially
for the interwar decades. However, much has been documented recently by Solomou and Catão (2000),
Catão and Solomou (2005), and [add cites].


                                                     18
trade and transport revolutions make these inputs available cheaply to late-comers who

don’t have the endowments. Some time ago, Gavin Wright (1990) showed us that while

its natural resource base was important in explaining the American leap to industrial

leadership from 1870 to 1890, that advantage disappeared in the more global economy of

1940. One can only expect to find a similar switch – but of opposite sign -- for those parts

of the poor periphery without a favorable natural resource endowment.

        I have no data yet documenting the relative price of fuel and manufacturing

intermediates (that is, relative to the output price), so their role will have to await the

data. Much rides, of course, on φm and φf , the shares of intermediates and fuels in total

manufacturing costs. But the intermediates cannot be in doubt: for example, in 1870s raw

cotton accounted for 70 percent of total costs of Lancashire cotton textiles (Ellison 1886:

p. 46), and one can only suppose the share was even higher where the stuff was more

expensive, like Mexico.15 Fuels, however, are a little less obvious: again in cotton

textiles, the percent of coal costs in total costs varied between 2.2 for England, 5.5 for

Alsace, 5-7 for India, and 9-16 for Catalonia (Balderston 2010: p. 571). While the cost

shares were smaller for fuels compared to intermediates, the price variance is likely to

have been higher: in 1882 Lancashire, the price of one ton delivered at the mill averaged

$1.38; in 1882 Poland $4.48; in 1886 Russia $5.34; in 1882 Italy $6.35; and in 1882

Spain $7.13. We know coal prices converged between the 1870s and the 1930s, so this

wide price spread must have diminished over time.



The User Cost of Capital?


15
 In the 1870s, Mexico had a tariff on raw cotton to protect local producers (Gómez Galvarriato and
Williamson 2009).


                                                   19
         We know that the premium attached to poor periphery interest rates fell as a

global capital market developed from the mid-19th century to 1929 (Obstfeld and Taylor

2004; Mauro, Sussman, and Yafeh 2006), and thus that their financial capital

disadvantage diminished. We also know that capital formation was greatly suppressed in

countries where the relative price of capital goods was high (De Long and Summers

1991; Lee 1994; Taylor 1998; Collins and Williamson 2001). Presumably, therefore, the

user cost of capital must have influenced industrial growth in the poor periphery 1870-

1940.16 How much awaits the data.



                                               The Agenda



         The agenda is clear. We have established where and when industrialization spread

to the poor periphery in the seven decades after 1870: We know whose industry was

catching up, whose was just holding its own, and whose was falling behind. Furthermore,

we know that the spread deepened and widened over time, and that the intensive and

extensive industrialization was positively correlated. The paper then offers a way to

decompose the sources of this performance, and lists the external (e.g. global) and

internal (e.g. local) factors which, in combination, will explain the timing and location of

industrialization in the poor periphery. The next step is to accumulate the missing

explanatory variables to complete the decomposition.




16
  There is, of course, no shortage of theoretical literature making the price of capital goods and
accumulation connection. See, for example, Jones (1994).

Egypt: Bent Hansen and Girgis A. Marzouk, Development and Economic Policy in the
UAR (Egypt) (Amsterdam: North-Holland, 1965) estimate GDP growth 1928-1939 (1954
prices, Chart 1.1, p. 3) at 1.60% per annum. However, Charles P. Issawi, Egypt in
Revolution: An Economic Analysis (London: Oxford University Press, 1963, Table 7, p.
87) shows a decline in the manufacturing (including handicrafts) employment share
1927-1937 from 8.1 to 6.3%. Since there is no qualitative evidence of relatively fast (or
even significant) growth in manufacturing labor productivity 1927/8-1937/9,
manufacturing output is unlikely to have grown much faster than GDP. Thus, we assume
manufacturing output growth 1920-1940 to have been about 1.60% per annum.

                  Appendix 3: (Incomplete) Data Sources for
 Explanatory Variables in the Poor Periphery Industrialization 1870-1940 Project

The explanatory variables used thus far in the project are: average tariffs rates, the net
barter terms of trade, relative wage costs, the real exchange rate and policy autonomy.
The data base for some of these are incomplete, and for others, completely absent. The
rest are taken from my earlier projects.

Average tariff rates (%): Calculated as import customs duties relative to total import
values. These data have been used in Coatsworth and Williamson (2004), Clemens and
Williamson (2004, 2010), and Williamson (2006). They are available from the author in
the Blattman-Clemens-Williamson 1870-1940 data base. The BCW data base is missing
many East European countries which are used in this new project. They will be collected
soon.

Net Barter Terms of Trade (1913=100): These data have been used in Blattman,
Hwang and Williamson (2007) and Williamson (2008). They are available from the
author in the Blattman-Clemens-Williamson 1870-1940 data base. The BCW data base is
missing many East European countries which are used in this new project. They will be
collected soon.

Policy Autonomy (dummy variable): See Table 2, although the source (Clemens and
Williamson 2010: Table 1, p. 28) offers far more detail.

Relative Wage Costs: As the text makes clear, we use a proxy, GDP per capita
relative to the three leaders (Germany, the UK and the USA), and the GDP per
capita data are from http://www.ggdc.net/Maddison/content.shtml (last accessed
June 10, 2010).

Real Exchange Rates (1913=100): These are taken from many sources to be
elaborated in another draft (when the many absent period/country observations
are collected), and I have been greatly aided in the process by Pablo Astorga, Luis
Bértola, Michael Bordo, Luis Catão, Kalina Dimitrova, Sophia Lazaretou,
Matthias Morys, and Solomus Solomou.

Relative Capital Goods Prices (1913=100): Not collected thus far, but hope to
retrieve them from the France-Germany-UK-US export (by destination) data base
being collected in collaboration with Aurora Gómez Galvarriato. These will be
used relative to local manufacturing prices.

Real Interest Rates: Not collected thus far.

Relative Manufacturing Intermediate Goods’ Prices (1913=100): Not
collected thus far, but hope to retrieve from the France-Germany-UK-US export
(by destination) data base being collected in collaboration with Aurora Gómez

autonomous 1920-1940; and Japan 1900, taken as autonomous 1890-1913. Those without autonomy were
either colonies or had signed 'unequal' treaties tying their policy hands, at least regards tariffs.
