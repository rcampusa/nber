                                           ABSTRACT

This paper examines the impact of a gifted program on retention in an urban school district using a
regression discontinuity design. Gifted programs often employ IQ thresholds for admission, with those
above the threshold being admitted. One common problem with the RD design arises if the forcing
variable (the IQ score) is manipulated, thus invalidating the standard research design. We proposed
a modified RD estimator that deals with manipulation in the forcing variable. Once we properly correct
for manipulation of test scores around the cut-off points, we find evidence that the gifted program
offered by the district has a positive effect on retention of higher income students.

1         Introduction

Gifted and talented programs have a long history in the U.S., dating back to
the late 19th century. However, gifted programs did not receive federal support
until 1958 when the federal government established the National Defense Educa-
tion Act. This act initiated federal support for specialized programs for math,
science, and foreign languages (Bhatt, 2009). More recently, the federal govern-
ment expanded its support to gifted programs through the Jacob Javits Gifted
and Talented Educational Act in 1988 and the No Child Left Behind Act in 2002.
Through these initiatives, gifted programs have gained popularity, especially in
urban districts.

        For urban districts, these programs have the dual objective of engaging and
challenging gifted students to reach advanced levels of achievement as well as at-
tracting and retaining students who might otherwise leave for suburban or private
schools. Despite receiving federal support, gifted programs are not mandated by
the federal government. Individual states or districts decide if and how to use
gifted programs, including how students are identified (Shaunessy, 2003). While
there is much interest in gifted education outside of economics, few economists
have directly addressed this topic.1

        The first purpose of this paper is to evaluate the admission procedures and
    1
        A meta-analysis of nine papers by Vaughn, Feldhusen, and Asher (1991) found that partici-
pation in pull-out gifted programs led to improved achievement, critical thinking, and creativity,
but student’s self-concepts were not affected. However, these studies often had difficulties dealing
with thorny endogeneity issues and were not all peer-reviewed. Bhatt (2009) finds that partici-
pation in gifted programs leads to strong initial effects in math that dissipate over time and an
increase in the long run in the probability that a child takes Advanced Placement classes. How-
ever, the results provide little evidence that gifted education increases interest and participation
in academics or affects a student’s peer group.



                                                  1
to estimate the treatment effect of admittance into a gifted program on retention
in a mid-size urban school district. Student retention has increasingly become
an important issue for large urban districts, especially in the Midwest and East
Coast. Districts such as Buffalo, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Detroit, Kansas City,
Milwaukee, Pittsburgh, and Philadelphia have lost thousands of students over the
last several decades. In many cases, these districts’ enrollments have been cut
in half over the last 40 to 50 years (Zimmer, Guarino and Buddin, 2010). State
funding, which is allocated on a per-pupil basis, has therefore shrunk dramatically.
The declining urban population has also led to a lower local tax base. However,
these districts have buildings, staffing, and pension systems designed for a much
larger enrollment base. Together, the pressure both on the cost and revenue side
have caused districts to search for ways to help retain students, including gifted
programs. In searching for a school, families may consider not only the quality of
facilities, curriculum, and instruction, but also consider the quality of educational
opportunities and peers. Gifted programs may create opportunities for students
to be stimulated and challenged and have positive peer influences. Often, smaller
suburban districts may not have the scale to offer such programs and as a result,
gifted programs may be a mechanism for retaining strong students within the
district.

       Many gifted programs, including the one studied in this paper, employ IQ
thresholds for admission, with those above the threshold being admitted. Psy-
chologists administering IQ tests may “give the benefit of the doubt” in assessing
performance of students who are near the threshold for admission to a gifted pro-
gram. These types of activities imply that the observed IQ scores are at best
noisy measures of the underlying ability of the students. In many cases, the test
scores appear to be manipulated.2 One consequence of this manipulation is that
   2
       The IQ tests are oral rather than written, with the examiner scoring the students responses.



                                                  2
IQ scores at the cut-off point cannot be used as instruments for program participa-
tion, which invalidates the key identifying assumption of the standard regression
discontinuity design.3 The second purpose of the paper is then to show how to
deal with manipulation in the forcing variable in a RD design.

    A distinctive feature of educational environments is that sub-scores and alter-
native composite scores are often available and may be considered along with the
overall IQ score in determining admission. Some of these sub-scores or compos-
ites are directly referenced in admission guidelines and are therefore also likely to
be manipulated. Other sub-scores are not directly referenced and are therefore
less likely to be manipulated. It is likely that even though all sub-scores are re-
ported to parents, they would pay most attention to the scores that are directly
referenced in the admission guidelines.

    As a consequence, it is plausible to assume that the sub-tests not directly
referenced are uncorrelated with unobservable components in parental decisions
such as retention. However, they are clearly correlated with the overall IQ score
used to determine access to the program.

    We can use these sub-scores to predict an IQ. The basic idea behind our mod-
ified regression discontinuity estimator is then to use the exogenous part of the
discontinuous change in program participation at the threshold that is predicted
by the sub-scores as an instrument for program participation. We discuss the
conditions under which such additional testing information can overcome the dif-
Hence, there is some scope for exercise of discretion by the examiner.
  3
    Similar issues arise in other educational settings. Concerns for transparency typically lead
to promulgation of the criteria for admission. Knowing the criteria for admission, participants
may then undertake activities that alter the reported outcome on the variable that determines
admission. For example, students who fall below the threshold on a test determining whether
they will be subject to remediation may retake the test to attempt to obtain a score above the
threshold (Calcagno and Long, 2008).

ficulties that the manipulation of the key forcing variable creates for the regression
discontinuity design.4

       Our application focuses on a gifted program operated by a mid-sized urban
school district that prefers not to be identified. We implement our estimation
strategy for a sample of students tested for the gifted program while attending
a district school in school years 2003 to 2007. Our findings suggest that our
modified RD approach works well in this application. Using the predicted scores
yields plausible estimates of the admission probabilities around the discontinuity.
The relatively large positive point estimates suggest that there is a favorable effect
on retention for higher income students (i.e., those not on subsidized lunch). The
estimated standard errors are also relatively large, however, so these effects are
imprecisely estimated.

       Our research is closely related to two well-established lines of literature – on
tracking and peer effects. Tracking is the practice of assigning students to classes
based on the ability of students. Previous research has focused on the effect
tracking programs have on test scores.5 . Those who advocate for tracking argue
that a teacher can tailor the curriculum to the ability level of the students, thus
creating the optimal level of educational gains for all students. Opponents argue
against tracking for three primary reasons. First, tracking leads to a different set of
resources being allocated to high-tracked versus low-tracked classes (Oakes, 1990).
   4
       Since the late 1990s there have been a number of studies in educational economics and
education science that apply regression discontinuity design (RD) methods. The RD design was
first used by Thistlethwaite and D.Cambell (1960). Recent applications of the RD design in
education include Angrist and Lavy (1999), van der Klaauw (2002), Jacob and Lefgren (2004),
and Chay, McEwan, and Urquiola (2005).
   5
     See, for example,Duflo, Dupas, and Kremer (2008), Zimmer (2003), Figlio and Page (0002),
Argys, Rees, and Brewer (1996), Hoffer (1992), and Kerckhoff (1986). See Epple, Newlon, and
Romano (2002) for a theoretical analysis



                                              4
Second, tracking breeds social inequities as minority and low-income groups are
over-represented in low-track and under-represented in high-track classes.6 . Third,
tracking creates homogeneous classes according to ability, therefore reducing the
positive spillover effect, referred to as a peer effect (Betts and Shkolnik, 2000).
Gifted programs, however, are often pull-out programs in which students spend
time outside of their regular classroom to gain specialized instruction and therefore
do not always fit into the tracking framework. While ability grouping and peer
effects may contribute to the effects of a gifted program on test scores, our focus
is on examining the impact that gifted programs have on student retention.

        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides information
about our data set and describes the testing and admission procedures used in
the gifted program studied in our application. Section 3 develops the modified
regression discontinuity design estimator that accounts for manipulation in the
criterion variable. Section 4 presents the empirical findings of our paper. It
documents the extent of manipulation of IQ scores and discusses the role that
additional sub-scores play in the first stage of the RDD estimator. We then study
the effectiveness of the gifted program in retaining students in district schools.
Section 5 offers some conclusions and discusses future research.



2         Data

2.1        Institutional Background

The school district that we study in this paper operates a gifted program that is
quite large in scope. Gifted students in grades 1 to 8 participate in a one-day-
per-week pull out program at a designated location away from the student’s home
    6
        See Braddock and Dawkins (1993), Gorman (1987), Oakes (1990).

school. Students enroll in programs designed to enhance creative problem solving
and leadership skills and are offered specially designed instruction in math, science,
literature, and a variety of other fields. For high school students, gifted education
is available within the school and involves the annual design of an individualized
education program, full-time curricula, and a number of other enhancements.

   The district adheres to state regulations concerning gifted students and ser-
vices. The state regulations outline a multifaceted approach used to identify
whether a student is gifted and whether gifted education is needed. A mentally
gifted student is defined as someone with an IQ of at least 130 points or someone
who shows outstanding intellectual and creative ability using other educational
criteria. Further, to qualify for gifted services, the district must show that the
student requires services or programs not available in regular education.

   The state guidelines stress that IQ cannot be the only factor used in deter-
mining gifted ability. Specifically, low scores in memory or processing speed tests
cannot be used alone to disqualify a student. Also, even if a student has an IQ
below 130, she may be deemed gifted based on above grade level achievement on
standardized tests, a superior rate of acquisition or retention of new academic
content or skills, excellence in specific academic areas, or other factors that indi-
cate superior functioning. Additionally, the guidelines specifically note that the
gifted decision must account for any potential masking of gifted abilities because
of disability, socio/cultural deprivation, gender or race bias, or English as a second
language. Further, it is emphasized that the gifted decision may not be based on
a single test or type of test. For limited English proficiency or students of racial-,
linguistic-, or ethnic-minority background, it is specifically noted that an IQ score
may not be used as the only measure to show low aptitude.

   The evaluation process begins when a parent, teacher, administrator, or stu-
dent requests a gifted evaluation. Once the student’s parents are notified and give

                                          6
consent for the evaluation, a team consisting of parents, a certified school psychol-
ogist, teachers, and others familiar with the student’s educational experience and
performance or cultural background conducts the evaluation. The evaluation must
include information on academic functioning, learning strengths, and educational
needs. The information and findings from the evaluation of the student’s educa-
tional needs and strengths is combined by the team into a written report. This
report includes the team’s recommendation as to whether the student is gifted
and in need of specially designed instruction. Finally, the report is evaluated in
a team meeting where the decision is made regarding the student’s eligibility for
gifted education.

       The district adheres to the preceding guidelines for evaluating potential gifted
students. As noted, one way to support a claim of giftedness is to show supe-
rior performance (above 130 points) on an intelligence test. In our district, every
student considered for the gifted program is given some type of intelligence test.
During the time-frame of our analysis (school years 2004-2005 to 2007-2008) dis-
trict psychologists mainly used the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children, 4th
edition (WISC4) test instrument.7 The WISC4 gives four index scores measur-
   7
       The WISC was updated from the 3rd edition to the 4th edition in 2003. During the 2004-
2005 school year, the district phased out use of the WISC3 and phased in use of the WISC4.
By the 2005-2006 school year, the WISC3 was no longer used by district psychologists. The
WISC4 test instrument is designed for students 6 years to 16 years 11 months old. For younger
students, the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence, 3rd edition (WPPSI-III)
(ages 2 years 6 months to 7 years 3 months) was mainly used. The Stanford Binet Intelligence
Scale, 5th edition (SB-V) (ages 2 to 85 years) was also sometimes used for younger students. For
older students, psychologists used the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale, 3rd edition (WAIS-III)
(ages 16 to 89) or the Woodcock-Johnson III Tests of Cognitive Abilities (WJ-III) (ages 2 to
90+ years).
  Additionally, for culturally or linguistically diverse students, a comprehensive non-verbal mea-
sure may have been used in place of or alongside the scores from the above tests. Acceptable



                                                7
ing verbal comprehension (VCI), perceptual reasoning (PRI), working memory
(WMI), and processing speed (PSI). It also gives a “Full Scale IQ” (FSIQ) which
combines the results from the four indexes and a “Generalized Ability Index”
(GAI) which combines the results from the VCI and PRI. The FSIQ, indexes,
and GAI are normed, by age, to be representative of the current population of
children in the United State and have a mean of 100 and a standard deviation of
15. Thus, a score of 130 is two standard deviations above the mean.8

    In the district, each student takes an intelligence test and is then categorized
as meeting the IQ criteria if the FSIQ or GAI is 130 or above.9 Students with
a FSIQ or GAI of 125 to 129 or a VCI or PRI of 130 or above do not meet the
IQ criteria but do qualify for special further consideration through a “portfolio
evaluation”. Additionally, students eligible for subsidized lunch with an FSIQ or
GAI of 115 to 124 also receive a portfolio evaluation. Students who score below
these cutoffs may still be considered gifted based on a further review of other
factors. In practice, the probability of a student being admitted into the gifted
non-verbal tests or tests with non-verbal measures included the Naglieri Non-Verbal Ability Test,
Individual edition (NNAT-I), the Comprehensive Test of Nonverbal Intelligence (C-TONI), the
Universal Nonverbal Intelligence Test (UNIT), the Leiter International Performance Scale, Re-
vised edition (Leiter-R), the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children, 2nd edition (K-ABC-II),
the Differential Ability Scales (DAS), and the SB-V.
   8
     For more information on the WISC4 test instrument, see the publisher’s web page at
http://www.pearsonassessments.com. The various testing instruments (and editions thereof)
measure different aspects of functioning, report different test composites, are separately normed,
and may focus on different subsets of the population. Therefore, one must use caution in com-
paring results from one test to another. Since the district uses the WISC4 unless the student
is too young, too old, or is culturally or linguistically diverse, we focus on students who were
given the WISC4 test.
   9
     Note that the GAI excludes processing speed and working memory sub-tests. Hence, the
GAI offers a way to address the state requirement pertaining to not excluding students based
solely on low scores in memory and processing speed.

program increases most at the portfolio cutoff of 125 points for regular lunch
students and 115 points for subsidized lunch students.



2.2        The Sample

We have student level data for all students attending district schools in school
years 2004 to 2007 including information about race, gender, standardized test
scores, subsidized lunch status, school attended, home census tract, etc. Tables
1 and 2 summarize a variety of student characteristics. Column 2 of these ta-
bles reports averages for students in kindergarten through 12th grade enrolled in
the district at some time between 2004 and 2007, with standard deviations in
parentheses.

       In Table 1 we see that 51% of district students are male, 56% are African
American, and 77% receive subsidized lunch.10 For the students’ census tracts,
the average median income is $28,868 and 18.5% of adults have earned at least a
bachelor’s degree. Table Further, in Table 2, we see that the average scores on a
5th grade state wide standardized test were 1308 points for math and 1246 points
for reading and that there was an average of 0.877 recorded disciplinary offenses
per student per school year.




  10
       Throughout our analysis, a designation of subsidized lunch means that the student was
tagged as receiving subsidized lunch at some point in the district’s data from school years 1999
to 2009. Thus, it is a constant variable by student (as are race and sex).

       To look specifically at the gifted program, we begin with a sample of 1389
students who were first tested for the gifted program in school years 2004-2005
to 2007-2008, were tested by a district psychologist, were attending a district
school in the year they were tested, and were not tested multiple times for the
gifted program.11 Column 2 of Tables 1 and 2 report the characteristics of these
students and Column 3 reports characteristics of those in this sample who were
admitted into the gifted program.

       We see that only 32 % of tested students are African American, compared
to 56 % of district students, and the percent admitted is even lower at 17 %.
Similarly, the proportion of subsidized lunch students that is tested is lower than
the district proportion, and the proportion admitted is lower still. On average,
compared to the district, tested students come from neighborhoods with a higher
median income and a larger percentage of adults with at least a bachelor’s degree,
they score higher on a 5th grade standardized test in both math and reading,
and they have fewer offenses. Admitted students come from even richer and more
educated neighborhoods, score even higher on the standardized tests, and have
fewer offenses.
                                                                                                 12
       From this sample, we exclude 72 students who were given a nonverbal test
  11
       We restrict our attention to students tested by district psychologists since a private psy-
chologist hired by a student’s parent may have incentives to inflate scores and scores would
likely only be reported to the district if the score is above the admission cutoffs. Additionally,
parents who hire a private psychologist may differ on unobservables. We focus on students who
were attending a district school when tested in order to isolate retention effects of the program.
While attraction effects are also of interest, they are beyond the scope of this paper. Finally, we
do not consider students who were observed to have more than one set of test results for gifted
consideration reported at any point up until summer 2009. Dropping observations with multiple
tests removes potential manipulation of the type uncovered by Calcagno and Long (2008).
  12
     Recall that nonverbal tests are given to students who are culturally or linguistically diverse.
Thus, these students likely differ from the rest of the sample on unobservables.


                                                 12
and 1 student who took the test in 12th grade and therefore has no future retention
outcomes available. Next we drop 138 students administered a test instrument
                            13
other than the WISC4             who consequently do not have the necessary sub-scores
available for our modified RD analysis. Finally we drop one student who did take
the WISC4 but does not have the necessary sub-scores available. Thus we we
have a sample of 1177 students with 504 receiving regular lunch and 673 receiving
subsidized lunch. Columns 4 and 5 of Tables 1 and 2 report the characteristics
of the regular lunch sample and Columns 6 and 7 report the characteristics of
the subsidized lunch sample. Since the admission criteria differ for students who
receive subsidized lunch, we separately analyze these samples.

      At the bottom of Table 2 we see that for the main sample, the unconditional
mean of one and two year retention for tested students is 0.027 lower than that
for admitted students. For the regular lunch sample the difference is .032 for one
year retention and .046 for two year retention. For the subsidized lunch sample
the differences are .021 and .022 for one and two year retention respectively. Thus,
admittance into the gifted program does have some unconditional positive impact
on retention.



3       Identification and Estimation

The starting point of our approach to identification and estimation is the fuzzy
regression discontinuity (FRD) design. We discuss the consequences of manipula-
tion of IQ scores and propose a modified estimator for the FRD design that deals
with the potential manipulation of the forcing variable.

      Following Fisher (1935), we adopt standard notation in the program evaluation
 13
      104 students took the WISC3 before the district had fully phased in the WISC4, 2 took the
WJ-III, and 32 took the WPPSI


                                               13
literature and consider a model with two potential outcomes.14 Let D denote an
indicator variable that is equal to one if a person receives treatment and zero
otherwise. In this case, treatment is participation in the gifted program. Let Y1
denote the outcome with treatment and Y0 the outcome without treatment, where
the outcome of interest is retention in the district. The researcher observes:

                                  Y    = D Y1 + (1 − D)Y0                                     (1)

The gain from receiving the treatment is defined as

                                       ∆ = Y1 − Y0                                            (2)

and note that this gain is unobserved for every single person in the sample. In
terms of the treatment effect, the model can be written as

                                       Y   = Y0 + D ∆                                         (3)

       The defining characteristic of the regression discontinuity design is that the
treatment variables change discontinuously as a function of one or more variables.
Here we focus on the “fuzzy” design” in which the probability of receiving the
treatment changes discontinuously at certain points in the support of a forcing
variable.15 In our application the forcing variable is ability measured by an IQ
score. Let Z denote the observed IQ score. Under the fuzzy design D is a random
variable given Z. The propensity score defined as:

                                 E[D|Z] = P r{D = 1|Z}                                        (4)
  14
       This approach shares many similarities with the “switching regression” model introduced
into economics by Quandt (1972), Heckman (1978, 1979) and Lee (1979). Heckman and Robb
(1985) and Bjorklund and Moffitt (1987) treated heterogeneity in treatment as random coeffi-
cients model. It is also known in the statistical literature as the Rubin Model developed in Rubin
(1974, 1978). See also Heckman and Vytlacil (2007) for an overview of the program evaluation
literature.
   15
      The “sharp” design is just a special case of the “fuzzy” design in which the probability of
participation is either zero or one.


                                               14
is known to be discontinuous at Z0 .

   Following Hahn, Todd, and van der Klaauw (2001), identification of the treat-
ment effect can be established using the following argument. Assume, for simplic-
ity, that the treatment effect is constant. Let e > 0 denote an arbitrarily small
positive number. Then

                        E[Y |Z = Z0 + e] − E[Y |Z = Z0 − e]                     (5)

                    =    ∆ (E[D|Z = Z0 + e] − E[D|Z = Z0 − e])

                        + E[Y0 |Z = Z0 + e] − E[Y0 |Z = Z0 − e]

The key assumption is then that E[Y0 |Z] is continuous at Z0 . In that case, we
have

              lim E[Y0 |Z = Z0 + e] − E[Y0 |Z = Z0 − e] = 0                     (6)
              e→0


As a consequence, the treatment effect is identified from the following equation:

                                E[Y |Z = Z0 + e] − E[Y |Z = Z0 − e]
               ∆ =       lim                                                    (7)
                         e→0+   E[D|Z = Z0 + e] − E[D|Z = Z0 − e]

Note that the denominator is nonzero because the fuzzy design guarantees that
the propensity score is discontinuous at Z = Z0 .

   The treatment effect can therefore be estimated as the ratio of two differences.
Imbens (2007) discusses a simple computational approach for implementing this
estimator that is based on local linear regression techniques. Using a uniform
kernel with the same bandwidth for both the treatment and the outcome equation,
he shows that one can characterize the estimator for ∆ as a two stage least squares
estimator. Using this approach, we can write the outcome equation as:

    Yi = β0 + β1 1{Zi < Z0 }(Zi − Z0 ) + β2 1{Zi ≥ Z0 }(Zi − Z0 ) + ∆Di + vi (8)

where Zi is the observed IQ score.

                                          15
   Program participation is endogenous in the sense that E[vi |Zi , Di ] 6= 0. The
selection equation for program participation is given by:

Di = α0 + α1 1{Zi < Z0 }(Zi − Z0 ) + α2 1{Zi ≥ Z0 }(Zi − Z0 ) + α3 1{Zi ≥ Z0 } + ui (9)

The key identification assumption in the RD design is then that 1{Zi ≥ Z0 } is a
valid instrument for Di .

   Now if the IQ score is manipulated it is easy to see why the RD estimator
fails. Consider the case in which households with positive shocks vi >> 0 are
more likely to manipulate the test score to make sure that their children get a test
score above the threshold. In that case E[vi 1{Zi ≥ Z0 }] 6= 0. As a consequences,
the key identifying assumption of the RD estimator is not valid.

   We argue that with additional information, we can develop a solution to ad-
dress the manipulation of the forcing variable. In our case, we have access to
additional intelligence measures, denoted by Xi . These measures consist of a
set of sub-scores that are reported along will the full scale IQ score. While we
find evidence for manipulation for the overall IQ score, we find that a set of the
sub-scores which are not directly referenced in admission guidelines are not ma-
nipulated. The basic idea is to use these additional measures to predict an IQ
score that is free of manipulation. Since parents are less likely to focus on sub-
scores that are not directly relevant for admission, it may be reasonable to assume
that such sub-scores are orthogonal to the error in the outcome equation.

   To formalize these ideas, let Ẑi denote the IQ score predicted by Xi , i.e. Ẑi
is a consistent estimator of E[Zi | Xi ]. Moreover, let us assume that the modified
propensity score defined as:

                            E[D| Ẑ] = P r{D = 1|Ẑ}                           (10)

is discontinuous at Z0 . Note that this assumption needs to be tested. A discon-
tinuity in P r{D = 1|Z} at Z0 does not necessarily imply that P r{D = 1|Ẑ} also

                                        16
has a discontinuity at Z0 . But in some cases the discontinuity will persist. These
cases give rise to our modified RD estimator and the treatment effect is identified
from the following equation:

                            E[Y |Ẑ = Z0 + e] − E[Y |Ẑ = Z0 − e]
               ∆ =      lim                                                      (11)
                       e→0+ E[D|Ẑ = Z + e] − E[D|Ẑ = Z − e]
                                       0                   0

Again, we can implement this estimator using a 2SLS estimator. We only need
to replace the observed IQ score with the predicted IQ score as the main forcing
variable.

    Summarizing the discussion, we have shown how to extend the RD estimator
to allow for manipulation in the key forcing variable. Manipulation arises in our
application because parents and administrators may have incentives to manipulate
the test scores of students to help them obtain access to the gifted program. If
there are additional sub-scores which are not directly referenced in the admission
criteria, it is plausible to assume that these additional scores are uncorrelated with
the error term in the main outcome equation. These sub-scores are correlated with
the comprehensive IQ measures used to determine access to the program. Hence
we can use the additional scores to predict IQ. We then use the exogenous part
of the discontinuous change in program participation at the threshold that is
predicted by the sub-scores as an instrument for program participation.



4     Empirical Results

4.1    IQ Testing and Admission

Since the district’s regulations are in terms of both FSIQ and GAI, a natural
starting point for the analysis is to consider the maximum of these two scores as
the forcing variable that determines access to the gifted program. Figure 1 shows,

                                         17
for the Regular and Subsidized Lunch samples, the proportion of students who
are gifted as a function of the maximum of the FSIQ and GAI score.16

                     Figure 1: Proportion Gifted by Max(FSIQ,GAI)




       Although there is some variability in both sample, we find that higher scores
generally correspond to a higher proportion of students admitted into the gifted
program. The cutoff of 125 for the regular lunch students and 115 for the sub-
sidized lunch students is where there is the largest jump in proportion gifted, as
expected.17 Both our samples, therefore, meet the requirement that the probabil-
ity of receiving treatment changes discontinuously at certain points in the support
of the forcing variable (max(FSIQ,GAI)).

       For a traditional fuzzy RDD approach to be valid, the distributions of any
  16
       In this and subsequent figures, the running variable is truncated in order to focus on the
area around the cutoff.
  17
     Note that there are some students who are admitted into the program without meeting the
IQ requirements. This is consistent with the requirement that students not be rejected based
solely on not meeting the IQ thresholds.


                                                18
covariates, including the forcing variable, should not show a discontinuity at the
cutoff. Here we encounter a puzzling feature of the distribution of the main forcing
variable. The maximum of FSIQ and GAI does not exhibit a smooth frequency
distribution, especially for the Regular Lunch Sample. Figure 2 plots the two
distribution that are heavily skewed to the right around the cut-off points for the
two samples.18 These spikes are robust to a number of sensitivity checks. For
example, the patterns are not driven by any one administering psychologist or by
testing in one particular grade or school year.19 We view the above distribution
as strong evidence of a concurrent discontinuity which potentially invalidates the
use of the standard RD estimator as discussed in the previous section.20

       We, therefore, collected additional information to address this manipulation of
the forcing variable. Specifically, in our samples, we have each student’s Processing
Speed Index (PSI) and Working Memory Index (WMI) scores along with their
FSIQ and GAI scores. Recall that the PSI and WMI are not directly referenced
in the admission guidelines and they are not used to calculate the GAI score.
Table 3 reports descriptive statistics for the composite and index scores for the
regular and subsidized lunch samples. For both samples, the PSI and WMI have
  18
       The distributions are similarly spiked for FSIQ and GAI scores alone.
  19
       Instead of relying purely on graphical evidence, one can also use a battery of formal tests.
McCrary (2007), for example, has formalized the graphical procedure discussed above. He
provides a framework for testing the null hypothesis of continuity of the underlying density
function at the program cut-off points. In our application the visual evidence of manipulation in
Figure 2 is sufficiently strong that that we clearly must address the likelihood that the running
variable is manipulated.
  20
     Martorell and McFarlin (2008) use RD to explore the effects of academic remediation which
is required if a student scores below some cutoff value on a subject test. They find that the
RD approach is valid when the score is based on a multiple choice test graded by a computer
but not for a score based on a test graded by hand where the graders knew the necessary cutoff
value. Our application is most similar to the latter case.

   We utilize the PSI and WMI to predict a score to use as the forcing variable.
We predict the maximum of FSIQ and GAI using a linear and a quadratic ap-
proximation with PSI and WMI. Estimates from the regressions for these models
are reported in Table 4. We find that PSI and WMI have predictive power in

   Figure 3 plots the distributions of the predicted scores from the linear model.
We find that these distributions do not exhibit the anomalous behavior seen in
Figure 2. The distribution for the Regular Lunch Sample is much smoother around
the cutoff of 125 points and the distribution for the Subsidized Lunch Sample is
smoother in general. Any discontinuities that remain are due to chance since there
is no evidence of manipulation of the PSI and WMI scores. In the next section,


                                       22
we show that there is still a cutoff value at which the probability of admittance
changes discontinuously. Figure 4 shows the proportion of students gifted by pre-
dicted IQ from the linear model. We see that there is still an increasing probability
of being gifted as the score increases.

4.2    First Stage Estimates

Tables 5 and 6 present the results from the first stage of the RD estimator for the
regular and subsidized lunch samples, respectively. For the first row of these tables
the forcing variable is the maximum of FSIQ and GAI, for the second row the
forcing variable is the predicted IQ from the linear model, and for the third row
the forcing variable is the predicted IQ from the quadratic model. For each forcing

                             24
variable, we report the number of observations within the given bandwidth21 , the
difference between the right-hand side limit and the left-hand side limit of the
conditional expectation of the probability of being gifted at the cut-off point, and
the standard error of the difference. We find the difference using both local linear
and local constant regressions. We consider the cutoff value of 125 points for the
Regular Lunch Sample and 115 points for the Subsidized Lunch Sample. Note
that the difference measures the degree of the discontinuity at the cut-off point.
To make sure that our results are robust, we implement the estimators for different
bandwidth choices.

       Using the maximum of FSIQ and GAI as the forcing variable, we see that in
the Regular Lunch Sample the estimates of the discontinuity at the cutoff of 125
points are positive, very large (about 0.6), and significant when we use the local
constant estimator and smaller (0.2 to 0.4) but still positive and significant when
                                          22
we use the local linear estimator.

       Similarly, for the Subsidized Lunch Sample at the cutoff of 115 points, the
estimates of the discontinuity are also positive, large(0.4 to 0.5), and significant
with the local constant estimator and smaller (0.21 to 0.24) but still positive and
significant with the local linear estimator.




  21
       We include the cut-off point when we estimate the limit from above. Therefore, for a
bandwidth of 4 points around the cutoff value of 125, the left hand side will include students
with scores 121 to 124 (inclusive) and the right-hand side will include students with scores 125
to 128 (inclusive).
  22
     Note that the forcing variable is measured in discrete increments of one which may partially
explain the variability in the results using local linear regressions.

       Turning now to the second and third rows of Tables 5 and 6, we see that in
both samples the first stage results are very similar between the two prediction
models. In the Regular Lunch Sample, the estimates of the discontinuity are
significant and positive (about 0.2) with the local constant estimator and smaller
but still significant and positive (0.04 to 0.13) with the local linear estimator at
bandwidths 5 and 6. In the Subsidized Lunch Sample, the estimates are significant
and positive (0.19 to 0.29) with the local constant estimator. However, with the
local linear estimator, the estimates of the discontinuity are small, negative, and
mostly not significant.Thus, we have shown that for both samples and with each
of the forcing variables, there is a significant discontinuity in the probability of
being gifted at the cutoff score, at least in the local constant case.



4.3        Retention Effects

Next we investigate whether admittance into the gifted program helps the district
retain students. We use one and two year retention (whether a student is in a
district school one year or two years after being tested) as the outcome variables.23
First, we implement OLS and IV estimators, with and without controls. Table 7
reports the estimated effects of gifted admittance on one and two year retention
for both the Regular Lunch and Subsidized Lunch Samples. The instruments for
the IV estimators are PSI and WMI.

       For the Regular Lunch Sample, the OLS results show a positive and significant
impact of being gifted ranging from 0.07 to 0.13. The IV results are also positive
and significant and are slightly larger (0.12 to 0.15).



  23
       A student is considered in the district two years after testing if s/he graduated from a
district school one year after testing.

   For the Subsidized Lunch Sample, the OLS results indicate a positive but
not significant impact of 0.03 to 0.05. The IV results are positive and mostly
significant with impacts of 0.11 to 0.16. These results suggest that IQ scores are
more likely to be manipulated for households that are more motivated to stay in
the district.

   Next, we present the RD estimates of the effect of gifted admission on retention.
We focus on the results from the local constant specification since it gave the most
consistent first stage results. As the forcing variable, we use the maximum of
FSIQ and GAI and the predicated IQ’s from the linear and quadratic prediction
models. Recall that the density of the maximum of FSIQ and GAI shows a
discontinuity at the cutoff and therefore violates the RD assumptions. We include
it for comparison.

   Tables 8 and 9 report the estimated effects for the Regular and Subsidized
Lunch Samples, respectively. For the Regular Lunch Sample, using the maximum
of FSIQ and GAI as the forcing variable, we find positive, though not significant,
retention effects of 0.05 to 0.12. Using the predicted IQ’s as the forcing variable
gives positive and sometimes significant estimates of 0.18 to 0.41.

   For the Subsidized Lunch Sample, using the maximum of FSIQ and GAI as
the forcing variable, the retention effects are usually positive but never significant
and range from -0.02 to .15. For Bandwidths 4 and 5, using the predicted IQ’s as
the forcing variable gives positive estimates of 0.1 to 0.3. Using the Bandwidth of
6, the estimates are smaller and sometimes negative, but not significant.

   Thus, we find evidence that the gifted program does help the district retain
students such as those in our samples, particularly in the case of regular lunch
students. These findings suggest that the OLS and IV estimates reported in Table
7 may actually underestimate the effect of being admitted into the gifted program


                                         30
for regular-lunch students, at least for those near the IQ cutoff. By contrast, we
find overall smaller and relatively insignificant retention effects for the subsidized
lunch students. This is to be expected. Relative to their wealthier counterparts,
these poor households are less likely to have the resources to exit the district if
their children fail to gain admission to the gifted program.

5     Conclusions

We have studied the admissions procedures and retention effects of a gifted pro-
gram in an urban school district. Gifted programs have the dual objective of
engaging and challenging gifted students to reach advanced levels of achievement
as well as attracting and retaining students who might otherwise leave for subur-
ban or private schools. Many gifted programs, including the one studied in this
paper, employ IQ thresholds for admission, with those above the threshold being
admitted. However, a concern for transparency typically leads to promulgation of
criteria for admission. Moreover, psychologists administering IQ tests may “give
the benefit of the doubt” in assessing performance of students who are near the
threshold for admission to a gifted program. These types of activities imply that
the observed IQ scores are at best noisy measures of the underlying ability of the
students. In many cases, the test scores appear to be manipulated. One conse-
quence of this manipulation is that IQ scores at the cut-off point cannot be used
as instruments for program participation, which invalidates the key identifying
assumption of the standard regression discontinuity design.

    We have shown in this paper how to extend the RD estimator allowing for
manipulation in the key forcing variable. Manipulation arises in our application
because parents and administrators have incentives to manipulate the IQ scores
of students to help them obtain access to the gifted program. We have access
to additional sub-scores that are not directly referenced in the admission guide-
lines. It is plausible to assume that these additional scores are uncorrelated with
unobservable components in parental decisions to keep their children in district
schools which is the main outcome variable of interest. We can use the additional
test scores to predict the IQ. We then use the exogenous part of the discontinuous

instrument for program participation. Our findings suggest this approach works
well in our application. Using the predicted scores yields plausible estimates of the
propensity scores around the discontinuity. The results provide evidence that the
program has a positive effect on retention for regular-lunch students. The district
has recently revamped its gifted program and admissions procedures which may
lead to less manipulation of IQ scores and even more positive retention effects in
the future.

   We view the results reported in this paper as promising for future research.
Given the wide variety of potential applications of the regression discontinuity
design in educational settings and the prevalence of potential manipulation of
the forcing variable, the methods discussed in this paper may be of substantial
importance for future research.
