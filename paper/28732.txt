                                          ABSTRACT

The literature on the optimal harvest of fisheries has concentrated on a single fishing area with
biomass uncertainty and to a lesser degree also with price uncertainty. We develop and
implement a stochastic optimal control approach to determine the harvest that maximizes the
value of a fishery participating in a global market, where all the considered harvesting zones sell
their production. This market is characterized by an inverse demand function, which combines an
exogenous demand shock and the aggregate harvesting of all zones. Accordingly, a fishery's
harvest will be affected by the global demand shocks and the harvesting in all the competing
zones through the global selling price. In addition, we decompose the biomass uncertainty into
local and global biomass shocks. Through global biomass shocks, the model provides enough
flexibility to acknowledge for correlation in the biomass shocks faced by the multiple perhaps
adjacent areas. When we compare our global framework with an alternative where the individual
zones are aggregated into a single optimizing fishery we find that competition will increase the
global harvest and consequently reduced the resource price.

1 Introduction
The rapid integration of natural resource markets that has occurred in the last few decades has

changed the landscape for sheries. International trade has continuously expanded fueled by

trade liberalization and technological changes. Fisheries have also experienced these changes.

   We can now consider the sh market as a global market. Products harvested in South

America, Africa or Europe are widely available across the world for consumption. This supply

expansion, driven by globalization, has intensied the competition faced by local sheries.

Consequently, it is reasonable to think that a value-maximizing shery will be concerned

about global conditions when deciding its optimal harvest.

   In this paper, we propose a novel framework to nd the optimal harvest of a shery oper-

ating in a global market. We develop and implement a stochastic optimal control framework

to determine the optimal harvest that maximizes the value of a shery participating in a

global market, where all the considered harvesting zones sell their production. This market

is characterized by an inverse demand function, which combines a stochastic exogenous de-

mand factor and the aggregate harvesting of all zones. Accordingly, a shery's harvest will be

aected by the global demand shocks and the harvesting in all the competing zones through

the global selling price. In essence, each shery optimizes its harvest taking into account the

optimal harvest of all the other zones. When no shery has an incentive to deviate from its

optimal strategy a Nash equilibrium is obtained.

   A shery operating in a particular zone will also face uncertainty on the dynamics of its

biomass. In particular, we decompose the biomass uncertainty into local and global biomass

shocks. Through global biomass shocks, the model provides enough exibility to acknowledge

for correlation in the biomass shocks faced by the multiple perhaps adjacent areas.

   In summary, our model includes global and local uncertainty.         That is, market-wide

shocks that will aect all the considered sheries and local shocks that will only aect a

single shery. This consideration will allow us to understand how each uncertainty source

aects the shery's optimal policy.

   Since the model considers multiple zones competing on the amount of harvest they will

extract, and the price is determined by the aggregate harvest, the global price and its dy-

namics are an endogenous result of the model, intertwined with the harvesting policies of the

modeled zones and the multiple sources of uncertainty.

   To the best of our knowledge, our paper is the rst to propose a global market setting

with various zones and multiple sources of uncertainty. Several papers, including Nøstbakken

(2006), Poudel et al. (2013), Kvamsdal et al. (2016) and Pizarro and Schwartz (2021) consider

a single shery facing multiple sources of uncertainty, including price uncertainty, but do




                                              2
not expand to a setting that allows understanding the eects of competition and global

uncertainty. Pindyck (1984) presented a model with a similar inverse demand function, but

without global demand uncertainty or multiple zones competing.

   A key contribution of the paper is that we apply the framework to a real group of sheries

in dened geographical zones. We obtain data for the Alaska and British Columbia halibut

shery. The data includes time series for the halibut biomass, total harvest (landings) and

price. We use this data to estimate all the required parameters of the model. We select these

areas because of data availability.   We collected data from several sources, including the

International Pacic Halibut Commission (IPHC), the National Oceanic and Atmospheric

Administration (NOAA) and Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO).

   The model and the solution algorithm are developed with an arbitrary number of zones.

But to illustrate its implementation we consider a setting with only two zones. Many of the

interesting features of the model can be observed in this setting. We focus on two particular

cases, the rst is denoted Symmetric Case and the second is denoted Asymmetric Case. In

the Symmetric Case, we consider two zones with comparable biomass, South Alaska (2C) and

British Columbia (2B). In the Asymmetric Case, we consider two zones with very dierent

biomass, Alaska (2C, 3 and 4) and British Columbia (2B). We believe that these two cases

will allow us to illustrate the key economic and nancial trade-os of the model.

   Another contribution of our paper is to show that global competition is indeed a funda-

mental force driving a shery's optimal harvest choices. To reach this conclusion we compare

our global framework with an alternative where the individual zones are aggregated into a

single optimizing shery, thus abstracting from all competition eects.      We obtain signif-

icantly dierent results.   In particular, we show that competition will increase the global

harvest and consequently reduced the resource price, overall beneting consumers.

   The model is solved using a value-function iteration algorithm. The solution approach

solves for the optimal dynamic harvesting policy of the representative shery in each zone

separately.   This shery will take the optimal harvesting policy of the competing zones as

given and decide its optimal policy as the best response to this set of functions.     Once

the problem is solved for all zones, the optimal policies are updated, and the problem is

solved again for each shery with the updated set of policies. The algorithm stops when no

signicant changes are made to the policy of any of the studied zones.

   The model allows us to study how the optimal harvest relates to the multiple state

variables in our model, which are, the biomass in each zone and the exogenous demand

factor. The model also shows how the harvest will optimally evolve with stochastic changes

in the state variables. Based on the optimal policy, it is possible to simulate the dynamics

of the biomass, subject to global and local stochastic shocks and optimal harvesting. This

analysis illustrates how the biomass in each zone will evolve over a specic time horizon.

     The paper proceeds as follows.                 The general valuation model is presented in Section

2.    Section 3 provides a detailed estimation of the model parameters for the Alaska and

the British Columbia halibut shery.                     Section 4 presents the model results for both the

symmetric and asymmetric cases. Section 5 shows the impact of global competition on the

optimal harvesting policy.            Finally, Section 6 provides our concluding remarks.                       Details on

the solution algorithm are provided in the Appendix.




2 A Valuation Model of Marine Fisheries Rights with
  Global Uncertainty
In this section, we present an economic model to study sheries valuation in a global frame-

work. We consider multiple geographical zones on which the sh specie of interest is available.

In each zone, a representative shery maximizes the value of the resource by choosing the

optimal annual harvest, taking into account that in the other zones representative sheries

will also be doing the same.

     We consider      N      dierent zones where the resource is harvested independently by the local

representative shery. The dynamic of the biomass for the zone                             i  {1, 2, ..., N }   is:



                                 Ii,t+1 = Gi (Ii,t ) - qi,t + Ii,t (i         i,t+1   + i t+1 )                        (1)


where     Ii,t   is the biomass at year      t    in zone   i, Gi (Ii,t )    is the annual expected rate of growth

of the biomass,       qi,t   is the annual harvesting rate,             i,t is the local biomass shocks, which are

assumed to be i.i.d. standard normal,               i   is the volatility of the unanticipated local shocks to

the resource stock.

     We also introduce global shocks to the biomass                     t+1 ,   which are common to all the zones

and assumed to be i.i.d. standard normal.                   i   is the sensitivity of zone        i to the unanticipated
global shocks to the resource stock. The local and global shocks are assumed to be mutually

orthogonal, although the existence of the global shocks will induce correlation in the unex-

pected changes in the biomass across zones. The covariance between the shocks in zone                                    i
and   j   is:



                                 Cov [i   i,t+1   + i t+1 , j       j,t+1   + j t+1 ] = i j                            (2)


as a result, the correlation coecient between the shocks in zone                           i   and   j   is:




                                                                4
                                                                       i j
                                           i,j =                                                                                    (3)
                                                            2        2             2            2
                                                        i + i ×                 j + j

      Note that when the      {1 , 2 , ..., N }         are equal to 0, the correlation is equal to 1 and when

the   {1 , 2 , ..., N }   are equal to zero the correlation is 0. As in Kvamsdal et al. (2016), Sims

et al. (2018) and Pizarro and Schwartz (2021), the growth rate of the biomass is assumed to

follow a logistic function:


                                                                                  Ii,t
                                               Gi (Ii,t ) = i Ii,t 1 -                                                              (4)
                                                                                 Iimax
      Combining the dynamics of the biomass and harvest of each zone, the dynamics of global
                    N
biomass      It =   i=1 Ii,t is:


                                           N
                          It+1 =                 Gi (Ii,t ) - qi,t + Ii,t (i            i,t+1   + i t+1 )                           (5)
                                          i=1

re-writing Equation (5) as:

                    It+1 =               Gi (Ii,t ) -           qi,t +         Ii,t i   i,t+1 +           Ii,t i t+1

                                                                                                I

                                                 i=1 Gi (Ii,t ), i,t = It , t^
                                                                             +1 =
                                                                                                                 N
                                                                                                                 i=1   i,t i   i,t+1 and
             N
t^
 +1 =        i=1 i,t i t+1 , thus the global biomass dynamics can be written                                    as:



                                         It+1 = G (It ) - qt + It (^t+1 + ^t+1 )                                                    (6)


where    ^t+1   is an i.i.d. normal with mean zero and volatility:

      The annual harvest of each zone is sold in a global market at the global market price.

This price is determined by the aggregate harvest from the                                N     zones,    qt , and the global inverse
demand curve:



                                                                   5

                                                               i=1

wherePt is the unit sh price at year t, Xt is                               an exogenous stochastic demand factor and

  (0, 1) is the demand slope. The exogenous                                 stochastic component of the demand follows

the process:



                                                        ln Xt = µX + X t                                                 (10)


where     µX   is the annual expected in the logarithm of                        Xt . t is assumed to be an i.i.d.   standard

normal and       X   is the demand shocks volatility. Demand and biomass shocks are assumed to

be orthogonal.

   Note that the global price at which each representative shery can sell its harvest depends

on the harvest of all sheries. Hence, when each shery optimizes its harvest, it has to take

into account the optimal harvest of all the other sheries and its eect on the global price.

   We now focus on the problem solved by an innitely-lived value-maximizing shery, with

enough installed capacity for the range of harvests considered, and the right to harvest in a
                                                                                                1
particular zone      i.   The shery's annual cash ow from harvesting                                is equal to:



                                               i (Ii,t , Pt , qi,t ) = Pt × qi,t - ci (qi,t )                            (11)


   Using the price denition presented in Equation (9), we can re-write the representative

shery's prot as:

                                                                        6

                           i (Ii,t , Xt , q1,t , ..., qN,t ) = Xt                qi,t           × qi,t - ci (qi,t )                    (12)
                                                                           i=1

      The operating cost function of harvesting                        qi,t , c (qi,t ),   is:



                                                          ci (qi,t ) = ci    i
                                                                        0 + c1 × qi,t                                                  (13)


where     ci
           0    is the xed cost and            ci
                                                1   is the variable cost. All these parameters correspond to the

shery operating in area              i.   The cost function parameter                      ci
                                                                                            0    captures also the xed cost paid

by the shery to remain open in years without harvest.

      Equation (12) shows a key economic mechanism of our model, the interdependence of the

dierent zones, specically, how the choices made in other zones impact the prots of the

shery operating in zone               i   through their eect on the global price. Hence, when the shery

in area     i   decides its optimal harvest, it will take into account the harvest from other areas

being sold in the global market.

      This interconnection between the dierent harvesting zones will require the shery in zone

i   to consider the harvesting policies in all the alternative areas when deciding its optimal

policy, and consequently, the state variables of each zone will need to be considered in the

shery's problem besides the aggregate exogenous demand shock.

      For the innitely lived representative shery in area i, the present value of future expected

cash ows, for the space state                   {I1,t , ..., IN,t , Xt }   and a given set of harvesting policies                     qi,t =
qi (I1,t , ..., IN,t , Xt ), i  1, .., N ,      is:



    Hi (I1,t , ..., IN,t , Xt , qi (I1,t , ..., IN,t , Xt )) =

where      r    is the shery's risk-adjusted cost of capital.                           As all considered sheries harvest a

common specie and compete in the same market we assume that their cost of capital is the

same.

                                                                                                                   
      A value-maximizing shery will choose the optimal harvesting policy                                          qi (I1,t , ..., IN,t , Xt ),
that is, the harvesting policy that maximizes the value of the shery for the current state

space.

      As mentioned, the revenues of a shery operating in zone                                    i directly depend on the harvest-
ing policies of the sheries operating in the rest of the zones. Hence, each shery anticipates

the optimal harvests for all the other sheries and chooses its optimal harvest to maximize

its value. This is, when maximizing the rm's value, the shery in zone                                                 i   takes the set of


                                                                      7

      The shery in area i, taking the set of optimal policies             q  /qi

Bellman equation:



  Vi (I1,t , ..., IN,t , Xt ) =
                                                                   1
                           max i (I1,t , ..., IN,t , Xt , qi )+       Et Vi (I1,t+1 , ..., IN,t+1 , Xt+1 )    (15)

where   Vi (I1,t , ..., IN,t , Xt ) is the value of the   shery in area     i,   under the optimal policy    qi   for

the   current state space {I1,t , ..., IN,t , Xt }.

      As   q  /qi
                
                    is the set of optimal policies, the optimal policy for the shery in zone            i becomes
the best response to the optimal strategy of the sheries in the other zones, therefore, the set

of harvesting policies represents a Nash Equilibrium, as any unilateral deviation from this

harvesting policy will be sub-optimal.

      Second, the model will allow us to incorporate competition in global markets, thus we

can understand how a shery operating in dierent levels of competition will change its

behavior when facing demand, local biomass or global biomass shocks. This model allow us

to understand how a shery with a positive inuence in the price will dier from a small zone

that operates as a pure price taker as its inuence in the price is overall marginal.

      The proposed model has positive policy potential as it will help regulators understand

how to tackle global shocks and local shocks, and if it is optimal to regulate zone by zone or

to have a global approach. All these potential contributions are discussed in the remainder

of this paper. In Section 3 we estimate all the parameters of the model using real data of the

Pacic halibut shery. Section 4 shows the results for the harvesting policy and the shery's

value for a global market.           Section 5 present several applications of our model in dierent

settings to address the previously presented contributions. Finally, Section 6 concludes. A

description of the approach taken to solve the model is included in the Appendix.




3 Parameter Estimation for the Pacic Halibut Fishery
To illustrate the implementation of the methodology presented in the previous section, we

calibrate and solve the model for the Pacic halibut. This area is ideal to test our model as its

setting is consistent with our assumptions, multiple geographical zones that harvest a unique

specie and the proximity of the multiple selling points allow us to consider the existence of

a unique global market for the resource on this geographical area.




                                                           8
    We consider the regulatory areas determined by the International Pacic Halibut Com-

mission (IPHC). The IPHC was established in 1923 by a convention between Canada and

the U.S. for the preservation of the Pacic halibut shery, and monitors the resource over the

regulatory areas presented in Figure 2. The IPHC is our rst source of data, as we obtain

the biomass assessments from its annual reports.

    Our second source of data is the Department of Fisheries and Oceans of Canada (DFO),

specically, we use the British Columbia halibut landings, price data and nancial reports
                         2
published on its site .      Our third source of data is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric

Administration (NOAA), we use the Alaska halibut landings and price data published on its
    3
site .

    Although our model is designed to deal with any number of zones, for illustrative purposes

we will focus on     N = 2.    In particular, we consider two cases. First, when two zones have

similar levels of their biomass, which we call Symmetric Case. Second, when the two zones

have very dierent levels of their biomass, which we call Asymmetric Case. These cases en-

compass most of the potential applications of the model and will facilitate the understanding

of the key economic and nancial mechanisms.

    In the following subsections, we present the estimations for the parameters for the specied

cases of the halibut biomass dynamics for each considered zone, the price dynamics and the

cost function.




3.1     Symmetric Case: South Alaska and British Columbia

For the symmetric case, we consider two zones of similar size: the South Alaska zone (2C)

and the British Columbia zone (2B).



3.1.1 South Alaska (2C) and British Columbia (2B) Halibut Biomass Dynamics
      Parameters
To estimate the biomass dynamics we use the stock assessments provided by Stewart and

Hicks (2017) and Stewart and Webster (2017), which although approximate, is the closest

proxy to its true magnitude. The symmetric case biomass assessment of each zone is presented

in Panel A of Figure 3. Panel B shows the share of the total biomass of each zone.

partment of Fisheries and Oceans of Canada (DFO) and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

   For each zone   i  {1, 2}   the biomass dynamic follows the process presented in Equation

(1) and Equation(4):


                                          Ii,t
                   Ii,t+1 = i Ii,t 1 -           - qi,t + Ii,t i   i,t+1   + Ii,t i t+1
                                         Iimax

   Therefore, for each zone we estimate:


                         Ii,t+1 + qi,t         Ii,t
                                       = i - i max + i          i,t+1   + i t+1                   (16)
                             Ii,t             Ii
where i,t+1 is an idiosyncratic biomass shock aecting area i, while           t+1 is an aggregate shock
that aects all zones simultaneously. Both shocks are assumed to be independent standard

normal.

   To estimate, we dene the full shock for zone       i   as   i,t+1    a normally distributed random

shock, so Equation (16) can be re-written as:


                             Ii,t+1 + qi,t         Ii,t
                                           = i - i max + i i,t+1                                  (17)
                                 Ii,t             Ii

   Since in the regression presented in Equation (17) the shocks to the biomass in each

zone may be correlated, we estimate both areas simultaneously using seemingly unrelated

regressions (SUR).

    Table 1 shows that although the zones are similar, their biomass dynamics are dierent.

In particular, the intrinsic growth rate     i   is statistically signicant for both zones but larger

for British Columbia. This parameter reects specic characteristics of the zone's biomass

that aect the expected biomass growth rate, as biological or economic factors.                   Figure 5

shows the logistic growth rate of the biomass for the two considered zones, South Alaska and

British Columbia. For the estimated parameters, British Columbia has a greater expected

biomass growth rate for most biomass levels, which will have implications for the optimal

harvest in each one of the zones.

   To test the signicance of the correlation between the shocks to the biomass of each zone,

we perform a Breusch-Pagan test of independence. For the Symmetric Case, the                2   statistic

is 6.32, with a p-value of 0.01, consequently, for this case, the correlation is positive and

statistically signicant.

versus the data:

   From the estimated parameters, we can disentangle the volatility of the unexpected shocks

to each zone into the volatility of the idiosyncratic shocks and the aggregate shocks. Since

we have estimated three shock parameters and we have four biomass shock parameters to

compute, we need to make an additional assumption. In particular, we assume that                   i =
  i  {1, 2}.

                                                   13
   First, the variance of the estimated shocks is:



                               Var (i i,t+1 ) = Var (i     i,t+1   + t+1 )

therefore:
                                             2   2
                                             i = i + 2                                                    (18)


   Second, the covariance of the estimated shocks in dierent zones                   i  {1, 2}   is:



                Cov (1 1,t+1 , 2 2,t+1 ) = Cov (1       1,t+1   + t+1 , 2    2,t+1   + t+1 )

then:

                                              1 2  = 2                                                    (19)


   Combining Equations (18) and Equations (19) we can solve for                 {1 , 2 , }:

   Using Equation (20) and the results presented in Tables 1, we can calculate the biomass

shocks parameters. These parameters are presented in Table 2.

3.1.2 South Alaska (2C) and British Columbia (2B) Halibut Price Dynamics
      Parameters
As shown in Equation (9), the price is modeled as a function of the aggregate harvest sold in

the global market, which is represented by an inverse demand function. We use halibut prices

of Alaska and British Columbia, and their aggregate harvest to identify the price parameters.

   To make both prices comparable we express all of them in 2018 U.S. dollars.                         For the

Halibut prices in British Columbia, we use the price in Canadian dollars, then we convert


                                                   14
them into U.S. dollars using the corresponding year's exchange rate, and the Alaska price

and the British Columbia converted prices are inated using the U.S. CPI.

    Using the size of the harvest in each zone as the weight, we calculate the weighted average

price. We use it for the estimation of the price dynamics. This price and the aggregate harvest
                                             6
of the two zones are shown in Figure 7 .

and Harvest, 1996 to 2018. Source: Department of Fisheries and Oceans of Canada (DFO) and National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

    Combining Equation (9) and Equation (10), we can re-write the the price dynamics as:



                     ln Pt = - ln Qt +  ln Xt = - ln Qt + µX + X t                                     (21)


    For the time-series presented in Figure 7 we estimate the regression presented in Equation

(21) to obtain the parameters of the price dynamics.

The parameters are estimated using maximum likelihood. We estimated the mean and volatility obtained for
the estimation of an ARIMA(0,1,0) model for the Logarithm of the Halibut Ex-Vessel Price of South Alaska
(2C) and British Columbia (2B). Data covers from 1996 to 2018 and is obtained from the Department of
Fisheries and Oceans of Canada (DFO) website and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration

that there is one aggregate market for the product.

3.1.3 South Alaska (2C) and British Columbia (2B) Halibut Fishery Costs Pa-
      rameters
The estimation of the model's cost function, as presented in Equation (13), is one of the main

challenges of the parameter estimation, as time series of harvesting costs are not available

for the studied zones.

   To our knowledge, few sources of real cost data are available for the studied sheries. We

focus on two surveys performed by Nelson Bros Fisheries Ltd. for the Department of Fisheries

and Oceans of Canada (DFO) (Nelson (2009) and Nelson (2011)). These surveys include an

estimation of the operating income for vessels harvesting halibut in British Columbia.

   From these surveys, we notice that in the two years available the xed costs constitute

approximately 10% of the annual revenue, while the annual prot is approximately 20% of

the annual revenue. We use these ratios to extrapolate the xed and variables cost for each

one of the studied zones.    Using the available price and harvesting data, we calculate the

annual revenue for each zone and construct a time series of xed costs as:



                                       Fti = 10% × Pti × qt
                                                          i
                                                                                                   (22)


   Then, we estimate the xed cost parameter for zone             i   as the average for the time series,

rounded down to the nearest dollar:


                                                      T
                                                 1
                                        ci
                                         0   =             Fti                                     (23)
                                                 T   t=1



                                                 16
    After the xed cost is estimated, we estimate the variable cost as:



                                        Cti = 80% × Pti × qt
                                                           i
                                                             - ci
                                                                0                                       (24)


    The variable cost parameter for zone       i is calculated as the average of the estimated variable
cost divided by the annual harvest:


                                                          T
                                                     1         Cti
                                              ci
                                               1   =                                                    (25)
                                                     T   t=1
                                                               qt

    The estimated cost parameters are presented in Table 4.


              Table 4: Estimated Parameters for the Cost Function, Symmetric Case
The parameters are estimated using the assumption that the xed costs constitute approximately 10% of the
annual revenue, while the annual prot is approximately 20% of the annual revenue. The xed cost parameter
for zone i is the average for the time series rounded down to the nearest dollar. The variable cost parameter
for zone i is calculated as the average of the estimated variable cost divided by the annual harvest.

3.2     Asymmetric Case: Alaska and British Columbia

For the asymmetric case, we consider two zones of very dierent sizes: the whole of Alaska

(zone 2C, 3 and 4) and the much smaller British Columbia zone (2B).

   To test the signicance of the correlation between the shocks to the biomass of each zone,

we perform a Breusch-Pagan test of independence. For the Asymmetric Case, the              2   statistic

is 1.30, with a p-value of 0.25, consequently for this case although the correlation is positive,

it is not statistically signicant.

3.2.2 Pacic Halibut Price Dynamics Parameters
As in the symmetric case, we use the annual harvest of each zone as the weight to calculate

a unique aggregate price for this case. Figure 12 presents the aggregate price and harvest we

will use to estimate the price dynamics:

The parameters are estimated using the assumption that the xed costs constitute approximately 10% of the
annual revenue, while the annual prot is approximately 20% of the annual revenue. The xed cost parameter
for zone i is the average for the time series rounded down to the nearest dollar. The variable cost parameter
for zone i is calculated as the average of the estimated variable cost divided by the annual harvest.

4 Model Results for the Pacic Halibut Fishery
4.1    Symmetric Case: South Alaska and British Columbia

To illustrate the implication of the model we rst consider two zones of similar size and we

now solve the model for the parameters estimated in the previous section.               We solve the

model with the estimated parameters. We denote South Alaska (2C) Zone 1 and British

Columbia (2B) Zone 2. The only parameter that has not been estimated is the real risk-

adjusted discount rate. For this parameter, we follow Pizarro and Schwartz (2021) and use

a value of 2.9% for both zones.

   Table 9 summarizes the parameters used for solving the model. Since the data used to

estimate the required parameters is annual, we solve the model using a one-year time step.

We construct the biomass, policies, and random shocks grids dividing the sets into equally-

spaced discrete points. For the exogenous demand factor, we use a log-linear grid to better

capture its distribution.

   The biomass grid boundaries are 0.1 and carrying capacity             I max .   For the exogenous

demand factor, the boundaries are the       90%   condence interval, for a 10-year time horizon,
                                                                                                     7
constructed using its estimated distribution.       For the policy grid, the boundaries are 0.1

to 45 million pounds per year. This upper boundary ensures that the optimal harvesting is

always an interior value on the constructed grid.

  7 Given
        that the inverse demand function is undened if the harvest is zero, we choose this small as the
minimum harvest.

4.1.1 Value Functions and Harvesting Policies. Symmetric Case
Figure 14 shows the value of the Zone 1: South Alaska (2C) and Zone 2: British Columbia

halibut shery, for dierent values of the biomass in each zone, under the optimal harvesting
                                                                         8
policy, for a xed exogenous demand factor               Xt = 11.45   .

   8 The solution algorithm takes approximately 10 global iterations across both zones, while it takes approx-
imately 300 iterations to fulll the stopping criteria in each zone (absolute change of 1.0 × 10e-3 in the value
function). The iteration errors and changes in the optimal policy converge smoothly in all global iterations.

Demand Xt = 11.45. Source: Own Elaboration Based on Model Results.

   Figure 14 shows how the resource value is aected by the interaction between the zones.

The value of the biomass in a specic zone is more valuable when the biomass is lower in the

other zone, that is, the resource is more valuable when the competing zone has less biomass

and consequently produces less. This can also be seen more clearly in Table 10 which shows

the value in both zones for three dierent biomass levels in each one of the zones.

observed only in states where the zone's biomass is almost depleted. The highest harvestings

are observed in states where the biomass is high in both zones. Table 11 illustrates this eect

for three dierent levels of biomass in each zone.

   Figure 16 shows that the aggregate annual optimal harvesting goes from values close to

zero to 24 million pounds per year in states of high biomass in both zones.            This gure

helps us illustrate part of the interactions between both zones, in particular, that if a zone

has available biomass, while the second is depleted, the total production increases, but it is

still lower than in the case that both zones have high biomass. This occurs because when a

zone produces without competing with the second zone, it will select a level of harvest that

balances selling a higher harvest with selling at a lower price.

   Recall that the global price is determined by an exogenous demand factor           Xt   and the

aggregate harvest of the two zones. Figure 17 shows the global market price for the aggregate

harvest presented in Figure 16 for dierent levels of the biomass for both zones.           Here we

notice that the price is highest when the resource is not available in both zones, and as the

biomass increases the price decreases.     This is explained by the increase in the harvest in

those states. Table 12 shows this for three dierent levels of the biomass in both zones.

4.1.2 Harvesting, Biomass and Price Simulations. Symmetric Case
To study the halibut biomass and global price dynamics if the optimal harvesting policy is

implemented in both zones, we generate multiple shocks for the biomass and the exogenous

demand factor. With these shocks, the current state of global demand factor and the biomass,

the estimated dynamics and the optimal policy, we simulate                            10, 000   dierent paths over a

horizon of   10 years for the biomass,       the harvest and the halibut global price. All simulations

start from the current state of the exogenous demand factor                           X0 = 11.45 and the biomass:
I1,0 = 81.18   million pounds in Zone 1 (South Alaska (2C))                         and I2,0 = 55.04 million pounds

in Zone 2 (British Columbia (2B)).

   Figure 18 presents the median,            10th   and     90th       percentiles of the 10,000 simulated paths

over a 10-year horizon for the biomass in each zone.

   Panel A of Figure 18 shows that the biomass is expected to decrease in Zone 1: South

Alaska (2C), while Panel B shows that the biomass is expected to slightly decrease in Zone

2: British Columbia (2B). This gure also shows the biomass remains away from depletion

with   90% probability.   The   90th   percent percentile shows that in paths of biomass growth will

   Panel A of Figure 19 shows the simulated harvesting in Zone 1: South Alaska (2C), Panel

B shows the simulated harvest in Zone 2: British Columbia (2B). The gures show the median

harvest in British Columbia (2B) increases over the simulated period, whereas the median

harvest decreases in South Alaska (2C). As both zones face similar global uncertainty, this

is, global biomass and exogenous demand factor shocks, these dierences are mostly driven

by the dierences in the biomass dynamics.           As shown in Figure 5, the expected biomass

growth is greater, for most biomass levels, in British Columbia, this faster growth increases

the incentives to harvest today, as the resource will recover faster in the following periods,

in comparison to South Alaska.

   Figure 20 presents the median,     10th   and   90th   percentiles of the simulated aggregate har-

vesting and global price.

   Panel A of Figure 20 shows that the global harvesting is expected to decrease over time,

it will not be less than 5 million pounds with    90% probability, while it may be slightly higher
than 30 million pounds per year.        Panel B shows the global price.        Overall, the price is

expected to increase, while presenting an asymmetric distribution. The increase in the price

is related to the expected growth in the demand factor and the decrease in the harvesting.

This occurs because there is a limit to the benets of harvesting due to the negative slope of

the demand function, therefore, the sheries will not harvest excessively high quantities, as

this policy will push the price down, reducing their revenues. On the other hand, simulated

high prices are related to low biomass states in both zones.




4.2     Asymmetric Case: Alaska and British Columbia

We now consider two zones of signicantly dierent sizes and solve the model with the

parameters estimated in Section 3 for the Asymmetric Case. We denote Alaska (2C, 3 and

4) Zone 1 and British Columbia (2B) Zone 2. As in the Symmetric Case, we use a real

risk-adjusted discount rate of 2.9% for both zones.

   Table 13 summarizes the parameters used for solving the model.                We follow the grid

construction procedure for most of the required grids, except for the policy grid in Alaska.
                                                    10
For this zone, the policy grid boundaries are 0.1        to 250 million pounds per year. This upper

boundary ensures that the optimal harvesting is always an interior value on the constructed

grid for this larger zone.

  10 Given
        that the inverse demand function is undened if the harvest is zero, we choose this small as the
minimum harvest.

4.2.1 Value Functions and Harvesting Policies. Asymmetric Case.
Figure 21 shows the value of the Zone 1: Alaska (2C, 3 and 4) and Zone 2: British Columbia

(2B) halibut shery, for dierent values of the biomass in each zone, under the optimal

harvesting policy, for a xed exogenous demand factor               Xt = 9.41.

Exogenous Demand Xt = 9.41. Source: Own Elaboration Based on Model Results.

   Figure 21 shows how dierent the interaction between the zones is in this case. The value

of the larger biomass zone (Alaska) is almost not aected by the other zone, that is, the

value of the resource is not aected by a signicantly smaller competing zone.                       Therefore,

this indicates that Zone 1 (Alaska) will maximize its value almost as if it was the only shery

in the market. On the other hand, the smaller zone (British Columbia) value will be aected

by the biomass level of the larger zone, thus its value will uctuate according to the biomass

of the larger zone. This can also be seen in Table 14.

    Figure 22 shows that the optimal harvesting goes from values close to zero in states of

low biomass to over 40 million pounds per year in states of high biomass in Zone 1. In Zone 2

harvest also starts at values close to zero in states of low biomass but increases to 25 million

pounds per year in states of high biomass in Zone 2 and Zone 1. Table 15 complements these

results for multiple levels of the biomass in each zone.

by the biomass in Zone 2, the harvest is, especially if the biomass in Zone 1 is small                        . In

scenarios of small biomass in Zone 1, an additional unit of the resource becomes extremely

valuable for the shery, as its biomass annual growth is considerably low, particularly in

comparison to Zone 2, thus enhancing the incentives to preserve the biomass and consequently

increase the continuation value of the shery.

    Table 15 shows that, for Zone 2, the harvest is almost unaected by the biomass in Zone 1.

That is an interesting feature of the model, as it points that when facing a large competitor, a

shery will act like a price-taker, focusing on the exogenous demand factor and local biomass

to determine the annual harvest.

   Figure 23 shows that the aggregate annual optimal harvesting goes from values close to

zero to 60 million pounds per year in states of high biomass in both zones.            From both

policies and their combination, is possible to notice that most of the interaction is driven

by the optimal harvesting policy in Zone 2. This is consistent with the notion that Zone 1

maximizes its value almost independently from Zone 2, while Zone 2 does take into account

the optimal policy in Zone 1.

   Figure 24 shows the global market price, in the asymmetric case, for the aggregate harvest

presented in Figure 23 for dierent levels of the biomass for both zones.          Here, as in the

symmetric case, we notice that the price is highest when the resource is not available in both

zones and as the biomass increases the price decreases. Table 16 shows this for three dierent

levels of the biomass in both zones.

4.2.2 Harvesting, Biomass and Price Simulations. Asymmetric Case
As in the Symmetric Case, we simulate          10, 000       dierent paths over a horizon of       10   years for

the biomass, the harvest and the global price. All simulations start from the current state of

the exogenous demand factor       X0 = 9.41 and biomass: I1,0 = 493.73 million pounds in Zone
1 (Alaska (2C, 3 and 4)) and     I2,0 = 55.04 million pounds in Zone 2 (British Columbia (2B)).
   Figure 25 presents the median,      10th   and   90th     percentile of the 10,000 simulated paths over

the 10-year horizon for the biomass in each zone.




Figure 25: Zone 1: Alaska (2C, 3 and 4) and Zone 2: British Columbia (2B) Simulated Biomass. Source:
Own Elaboration Based on Model Simulations.

   Panel A of Figure 25 shows that the biomass is expected to increase in Zone 1: Alaska

(2C, 3 and 4), while Panel B shows that the biomass is expected to decrease in Zone 2:

British Columbia (2B). As in the Symmetric Case, the biomass will not approach depletion

with 90% probability, but in contrast to the Symmetric Case, the                     90th   percentile will not

reach the carrying capacity (Imax ) for neither zone.

   Figure 26 presents the median,       10th   and      90th       percentile of the simulated paths over the

10-year horizon for the harvesting policy in each zone.

Figure 26: Zone 1: Alaska (2C, 3 and 4) and Zone 2: British Columbia (2B) Simulated Harvesting. Source:
Own Elaboration Based on Model Simulations.

   Panel A of Figure 26 shows that the simulated harvest in Zone 1: Alaska (2C, 3 and

4) is expected to increase signicantly over the 10-year horizon. This increase is interesting

considering that the biomass is expected to grow over the same period. In particular, this

shows that the shery will optimally allow the biomass to increase over the rst years, to be

able to optimally increase harvest in the future. Panel B of Figure 26 shows the simulated

harvest in Zone 2: British Columbia (2B). In this zone, the harvest will start at a higher

level and is expected to decrease over time. This high level of harvesting in Zone 2 explains

the observed reduction in biomass.

   We notice that the initial simulated harvest in Zone 1: Alaska (2C, 3 and 4) is lower than

in Zone 2: British Columbia (2B), although its biomass level is signicantly higher. Several

characteristics of Zone 1 may help us explain this result.            First, the biomass in that zone

although greater than the biomass in British Columbia, is relatively small in comparison to
                               max
the zone's carrying capacity (I1      = 1, 146), therefore, it will be optimal to allow the biomass
to grow given the zone's available capacity. Second, the intrinsic growth rate in this zone is

small (1   = 0.08) in comparison to the growth rate in British Columbia ((2 = 0.77).         Thus, to

induce biomass growth, the harvesting in Zone 1 must be drastically reduced. Finally, we can

also point that the harvesting is only smaller in Alaska at the start of the simulation. As the

biomass starts to grow in future simulated periods, the harvesting in the zone also increases,

surpassing the harvest in British Columbia. This increment in the harvest is limited though,

due to the negative slope of the global demand, as more harvest negatively aects the global

prices.

   Figure 27 presents the median,      10th   and   90th   percentile of the simulated aggregated har-

vesting and global price over the 10-year horizon simulated.

and Global Market Price. Source: Own Elaboration Based on Model Simulations.

   Panel A of Figure 27 shows that the simulated aggregate harvesting is expected to increase,

due specically to the increment in the harvesting of Zone 1. Beyond the increment in the

harvest, prices are also expected to increase over time. This is due to the expected growth

in the exogenous demand factor      Xt .   An interesting feature of the simulated price dynamics

of the Asymmetric case is that prices appear to be more volatile in this case than in the

Symmetric Case. This feature may be explained by the asymmetry in the biomass, as Zone 1

will change its production reecting shocks to its biomass, while not giving signicant weight

to the harvesting in Zone 2, therefore transferring part of its biomass uncertainty to the

global price.




5 The Impact of a Global Competition
Our model provides an ideal setting to compare a global framework with an alternative where

the individual zones are aggregated into a single optimizing shery, thus abstracting from all

competition eects.

   To formulate this comparison, we start by adding the biomass and harvest of South Alaska

(2C) and British Columbia (2B). With these time series, we estimate the aggregate biomass

dynamics parameters. As we consider both zones simultaneously, the price dynamics will be

the same as in the symmetric case. We also update the cost function parameters to reect

the new representative shery, for this, we consider the total revenue and harvest of South

Alaska (2C) and British Columbia (2B) and followed the approach described in Section 3.

We denote the aggregate model as the Single Fishery Case. This model is solved following

Pizarro and Schwartz (2021) while incorporating the presented global market. We use the

obtained optimal policies to simulate the dynamics of the aggregate harvesting and biomass



                                                  36
for this case.

   All simulations start from the current state of the exogenous demand factor     X0 = 11.45
and the biomass:   I1,0   = 81.18 million pounds in Zone 1 (South Alaska (2C)) and I2,0 = 55.04
million pounds in Zone 2 (British Columbia (2B)).

   Figure 28 shows the median,        10th   and    90th   percentile of 10,000 simulated paths, over a

10-year horizon, for the aggregate biomass in the Symmetric Case and the Single Fishery

Case.

Own Elaboration Based on Model Results.

   Figure 28 shows that the biomass is expected to decrease in both cases, but it will be

higher in the Single Fishery Case. This gure also shows the biomass in the Single Fishery

Case will have a higher      10th   and   90th   percentiles.   The   90th   percent percentile shows that

in paths of biomass growth will approach its carrying capacity (for the Single Fishery Case

I max = 185   million pounds).

   Figure 29 shows the median,       10th and 90th percentile of the simulated aggregate harvesting
for the Symmetric Case and the Single Fishery Case.

Figure 29: Simulated Aggregate Harvesting for the Single Fishery Case and the Symmetric Case. Source:
Own Elaboration Based on Model Results.

   Figure 29 shows that the harvest is expected to increase in the Single Fishery Case and

decrease in the Symmetric Case, but the harvest in the Single Fishery Case is always lower

than in the Symmetric Case.       Thus, if each shery solves the problem individually, it will

harvest less over the simulated horizon. This policy is consistent with the higher biomass

observed in Figure 29 and will induce also higher global prices, as presented in Figure 30.




Figure 30: Simulated Global Price for the Single Fishery Case and the Symmetric Case. Source: Own
Elaboration Based on Model Results.

   Figure 30 shows that the global price is expected to increase in both cases, but it will be

higher in the Single Fishery Case for the whole simulated period. This result is consistent

with the observed harvesting policy, as the Single Fishery Case harvests less, causing the

price to increase.




                                                 38
   Overall, the simulated dynamics are signicantly dierent for the considered cases.      In

particular, we can conclude that competition will increase the global harvest, and conse-

quently reduced the resource price, overall beneting consumers. We also notice that this

benet to the consumer will not take a signicant toll on the biomass of the aggregate area.




6 Conclusions
This article develops and implements a stochastic optimal control approach to a real group

of sheries in dened geographical zones, facing local and global sources of uncertainty. The

solution of the model is obtained by solving for the optimal value of the sheries using

a value-function iteration approach.   Overall, the results highlight the strong interaction

between zones when considering competition in a global market.

   The solution is implemented using estimated parameters for the Alaska and British

Columbia halibut shery. We illustrate the model considering a setting with only two zones.

In particular, we focus on a Symmetric Case and an Asymmetric Case.

   In the Symmetric Case, we consider two zones with comparable biomass, South Alaska

(2C) and British Columbia (2B). We nd that the optimal harvesting policy, the biomass

dynamics and the global prices are signicantly inuenced by the interaction between the

two zones. We also show that specic characteristics of the biomass dynamics in each zone

will have an impact on the results.

   In the Asymmetric Case, we consider two zones with very dierent biomass, Alaska (2C,

3 and 4) and British Columbia (2B). We nd that the harvesting policy in the larger zone

will not be greatly aected by the harvesting policy of the smaller zone. In this setting, the

interaction between zones is mostly driven by the policy in the smaller zone.

   We use our model to show that global competition is a fundamental force driving a

shery's optimal harvest choices. To reach this conclusion, we compare our Symmetric Case

with an alternative where the individual zones are aggregated into a single optimizing shery

(Single Fishery Case), thus abstracting from all competition eects. We show that results

are signicantly dierent in each case. We conclude that competition will increase the global

harvest and consequently reduced the resource price, overall beneting consumers.

   This paper contributes to the literature by proposing a novel framework to study the

interactions of multiple sheries in a global setting. The model allows us to answer funda-

mental economic questions, such as how signicant is the interaction between sheries and

what is the impact of global competition in the optimal policy. These results have relevant

policy implications, as regulators could use the model to determine the total annual catch

(TAC) in a multiple zones setting, properly accounting for the interactions shown in our


                                             39
results.

   In this paper we have concentrated on a single sh specie, abstracting from the interaction

in the demand and the supply of dierent species. These interactions considerably increase

the complexity of the problem but look promising topics for future research.

where    qi (I1,t , ..., IN,t , Xt ) is the harvesting policy and {I1,t+1 , ..., IN,t+1 , Xt+1 } is the state at
year   t + 1 of the stochastic variables in our model, the resource biomass for each zones and
the exogenous demand factor.

     We solve Equation (26) assuming that the shery in zone                              i   maximizes taking the set of
                                                                               
optimal policies for the rest of the considered zones,                q      /qi , as known. This set of functions is

fundamental to solve the Bellman equation as it allows the calculation of the period's prots

and the expected state of all the zones' biomass in the following period, and consequently,

the continuation value.

     The model implementation starts by dening a discrete state space for the biomass of

each zone in the set         i  {1, 2, .., N } and the exogenous demand factor, {I1,m1 , ..., IN,mN , Xj },
where     Ii,mi    {Ii,1 , Ii,2 , ..., Ii,M = Iimax } and Xj  {X1 , X2 , ..., XJ }.
                                                                                      min
     The optimal control for each zone is also discretized to the set qi,ki  {qi,1 = qi   , ..., qi,K =
 max                                        i      i                   M
qi }. Over the state space the function V = Vm1 ,...,mN ,j is a N × J matrix representing
the value of the shery in zone i for the state {I1,m1 , ..., IN,mN , Xj }.

     The shocks to the biomass of each zone and the exogenous demand factor are denoted

by   Z i i  {1, ..., N }     and   ZX    respectively. The global biomass shock is denoted                        Z G.   These

shocks are assumed to be i.i.d. standard normal random variables. The shocks discretization

       Using the discretization of the state space, value function, harvesting policies and shocks,

set of optimal policies              q 0 , .   First, for each zone        i  {1, 2, ..., N }     individually, the algorithm

iterates over each point of the state space                         {I1,m1 , ..., IN,mN , Xj }.   In each of these states, the

right-hand-side of Equation (27) is maximized using the stochastic optimal control                                             qi,ki .   If

the optimized value of the current iteration is greater than the current value function for the

state, then the old value function is replaced by the newly maximized value and the optimal

policy of the zone             i   is replaced by the respective harvest. The process is repeated until no

signicant changes are made to the value function in the latter iteration.

       After the value-maximization procedure is nished for all the zones, the set                                 q 0, is updated
with the newly computed optimal policies. Using this updated set of policies                                       q 1, , the value-
maximization procedure is repeated for all zones. This method is repeated until no signicant
