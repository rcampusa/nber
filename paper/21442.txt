                                             ABSTRACT

This paper investigates whether compulsory licensing – which allows governments to license patents
without the consent of patent-owners – discourages invention. Our analysis exploits new historical
data on German patents to examine the effects of compulsory licensing under the US Trading-with-the-Enemy
Act on invention in Germany. We find that compulsory licensing was associated with a 28 percent
increase in invention. Historical evidence indicates that, as a result of war-related demands, fields
with licensing were negatively selected, so OLS estimates may underestimate the positive effects of
compulsory licensing on future inventions.

Whether policies that weaken intellectual property rights discourage invention is a subject of

intense debate. Basic models indicate that weakening intellectual property rights discourages

invention by reducing inventors’ ability to recoup investments in R&D (Scotchmer 2004, pp. 35-

36). But weaker intellectual property rights can also encourage cumulative (or follow-on)

invention (Green and Scotchmer 1990, Scotchmer 1991, Murray et al. 2009) by enabling future

inventors to build on patented ideas.1

       A key mechanism to weaken intellectual property rights is compulsory licensing, which

allows developing country governments to license foreign-owned patents to local firms without

the consent of foreign patent owners.2 Article 31 of the Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual

Property Rights Agreement (TRIPS) allows compulsory licensing as a way to mitigate the

potential welfare losses from TRIPS provisions that strengthen the patent rights of foreign firms

(Bond and Saggi 2014).3 Countries, such as India, Thailand, and Brazil, have used it to provide

affordable medicines for HIV and other life-threatening diseases.

       Pharmaceutical firms, however, argue that compulsory licensing hurts consumers in the

long run by discouraging invention due to “the risk of receiving only a drastically reduced

royalty for the use of their intellectual property, imperiling in turn their ability to develop



1
  Historical analyses of innovations that were exhibited at world’s fairs (as an alternative, non-
patent measure of innovation), indicate that most innovations were not patented (Moser 2012),
and that countries without patent laws produced many important inventions (Moser 2013).
Instead, the availability of patent protection appears to have influenced the direction of
innovation (Moser 2005), and it may have encouraged the diffusion of ideas (Moser 2011).
2
  Compulsory licensing is also used as an instrument of antitrust policy (e.g., Chien 2003). In
2013, for example, the US Department of Justice and the US Patent and Trademark Office issued
a joint statement to call for compulsory licenses on thousands of “standard-essential” patents
(Policy Statement on Remedies for Standards-Essential Patents Subject to Voluntary F/RAND
Commitments, January 8, 2013).

  In a stylized model of two agents (a developing country and a foreign patent-owner), in which
the developing country is obligated to offer strong patents, the developing country’s ability to
issue a compulsory license makes both parties better off (Bond and Saggi 2014).

                                                                                                    1
profitably new treatments and molecules.”4 In May 2015, for example, the pharmaceutical trade

group Alafarbe warned that a compulsory license for Bristol Meyer’s HIV drug Reyataz in Peru

may cause “serious damage to the country and discourage investment.”5

       This paper exploits new individual-level data on German patents and a historical episode

of compulsory licensing during World War I to examine the effects of compulsory licensing on

inventors whose patents are licensed. As a source of quasi-experimental variation, it exploits the

US decision in 1918 to make all enemy-owned US patents available for compulsory licensing.

US authorities confiscated a total of 4,706 German-owned US patents under the TWEA; 1,246 of

these patents were licensed to US firms. Licenses were non-exclusive and issued “upon equal

terms and a royalty basis, to any bona fide American individual or corporation” (Haynes 1945, p.

260). Although the exact timing of licensing is unknown, most licenses were issued between

1919 and 1922 (Steen 2001). Moser and Voena (2012) have shown that compulsory licensing

under the TWEA helped trigger an increase in US invention; in fields with licensing, US patents

by domestic inventors increased by an additional 20 percent after 1918. Previous work has,

however, been unable to identify the effects on inventors whose patents are licensed, which is

essential for understanding the welfare effects of this policy.

       To perform this analysis, we have collected new historical data on all German patents for

chemicals between 1900 and 1930.6 These data cover 79,591 patents issued by the German

Patent Office (GPO) across 212 research fields of chemical inventions; 101 of these fields

  We focus on chemicals and pharmaceuticals because these industries are important targets for
compulsory licensing, and patents are exceptionally effective as a mechanism to protect
chemicals and pharmaceuticals (Levin et al. 1987, Harhoff et al. 1999, Cohen, Nelson, and
Walsh 2000), so that patent data are a useful proxy for invention.

                                                                                                 2
include at least one licensed patent. To investigate firm-level changes in patenting, we match

GPO patents with information on German firms. 30,499 patents were assigned to 4,814 firms; 50

of them saw at least one of their patents licensed under the US TWEA.

       Baseline specifications compare changes in German patents after 1918 across research

fields that were differentially affected by compulsory licensing in the United States. This

difference-in-differences approach allows us to examine the effects of compulsory licensing

controlling for unobservable factors, such as reparations and punitive tariffs, which also may

have influenced German invention. We also control for patents by foreign inventors as a proxy

for changes in demand, scientific breakthroughs, or other factors that may have encouraged

patenting in Germany, irrespective of compulsory licensing. This analysis indicates that German

inventors began to patent more after 1918 in research fields in which their patents had been

licensed. German inventors applied for 2.97 additional patents per year after 1918 in fields with

licensing compared with other fields of chemical invention. Relative to a pre-1918 average of

10.77 this implies a 28 percent increase.

       A concern with the baseline OLS regressions is that US firms may have been more likely

to license German-owned US patents in fields in which US demand for invention was high, and

German demand for invention may have increased in the same fields. Then, OLS estimates

overstate the increase in invention that is due to licensing. Historical evidence, however,

indicates that US firms were most likely to license German-owned patents in war-related

research fields, such as dyestuffs and explosives, which faced severe problems of excess capacity

after the war (Haber 1971, p. 251). Then, OLS under- rather than overestimates the increase in

patenting that is due to licensing. To address this issue, we exploit the fact that the US Alien

Property Custodian confiscated all German-owned patents - irrespective of variation in demand -




                                                                                                    3
and that only confiscated patents were available for licensing. Instrumental variable regressions

with confiscated patents indicate that OLS estimates are downward biased.

       As an additional test, we use inventors’ decisions to pay renewal fees to capture variation

in the valuation of patents (following Schankerman and Pakes 1986). This analysis suggests that

some of the observed increase in patenting may have been due to an increase in lower-quality,

strategic patents. Even for high-quality patents, however, our estimates indicate an additional 17

percent increase in invention in fields with licensing after 1918.

       Finally, inventor-level analyses of patenting suggest that firms whose patents had been

licensed applied for an additional 0.42 patents per year after 1918 in fields with licensing

compared with other German firms. Relative to an average of 0.46 patents per firm, field, and

year until 1918, this implies a 91-percent increase. Inventor-level analyses also reveal a

substantial differential increase in the number of active patentees in fields with licensing, which

indicates an increase in entry. Consistent with theoretical predictions about the link between

competition and innovation (Arrow 1962, Aghion et al. 2005) we find that the observed increase

in patenting was strongest for fields in which pre-existing levels of competition were low. Taken

together, these results suggest that compulsory licensing may be particularly effective in

promoting invention by increasing the threat of competition in fields with low pre-existing levels

of competition.



                                              I. DATA
       This paper examines a new historical data set of 79,591 patents for chemicals in Germany

between 1900 and 1930. Our data expand on existing aggregate-level data on German patents

(for example, Richter and Streb 2011) by including data on inventors’ countries of residence,




                                                                                                      4
renewal decisions, and firm-level identifiers. This section presents a brief overview of the data; a

data appendix provides more detail.



A. Patents across Research Fields, 1900-1930
       Our data start with patent applications in 1900, the first year in which the GPO

systematically assigned all patents to fine-grained subclasses, which allow us to define research

fields.7 Data include patent applications until 1930, the last cohort of patent applications that

were issued before 1933, when the Nazi government dismissed Jewish scientists from

universities and other types of public sector jobs.8

       Among 212 subclasses of chemical invention, 167 include at least one confiscated

patents, and 101 include at least one licensed patent.9 The average subclass with at least one

licensed patent includes 18 licensed and 5 confiscated patents (with a standard deviation of 53.65

and 64.33, respectively, Appendix Table A2). Five subclasses include more than 100 licensed

patents: 22a azo dyes (436 licensed patents), 12o hydrocarbons (242), 12i metalloids (146), 12q

aminophenol (110), and 12k ammonia (108).

       To assign inventor nationalities to all German patents, we extract text strings with the

inventor’s city of origin from each patent. 58,691 of 79,591 German patents are by German

inventors. The other 20,900 German patents are by foreign inventors, including 4,133 by



7
  An 1891 reform introduced product patents for chemicals; until 1891 Germany only granted
process patents for chemicals (Haber 1971, p. 218). Until 1900, patents were assigned to 89
numerical classes; in 1900 the German Patent Office reformed this classification to create 513
alphanumeric subclasses.
8
  The April 7, 1933 Law for the Restoration of Public Service dismissed all professors with a
Jewish grandparent. Analyses of US patents indicate that dismissed German-Jewish scientists
who moved to the United States created substantial benefits for US invention (Moser, Voena,
and Waldinger 2014).

                                                                                                    5
inventors from the United States, 3,162 from Great Britain, 3,041 from France, 2,984 from

Switzerland, and 1,458 from Austria.10

       Data on German patents by US inventors allow us to check whether compulsory licensing

led to an increase in US invention (Moser and Voena 2012, pp. 404-5). These data confirm that

US invention increased significantly more in fields with licensing (Figure 1). Between 1900 and

1918, US firms applied for 0.67 patents per year in fields with licensing, compared with 0.56 in

other fields. After 1918, US firms applied for 0.91 additional patents per year in fields with

licensing compared with 0.37 in other fields.



B. Renewal Decisions to Proxy Patent Value

      Griliches (1990, p. 1669) observes that patents “differ greatly in ‘quality,’ in the

magnitude of inventive output associated with them.” To measure such variation, Schankerman

and Pakes (1986) propose to use inventors’ decisions to pay renewal fees to capture variation in

the private value of patents. Harhoff et al. (1999) document a positive correlation between

inventors’ reported valuation of patents and the number of years for which inventors renewed

their patents. Lanjouw et al. (1998), however, caution that researchers cannot observe the true

valuation of patents that are renewed for the full term, if renewal fees are low.11



10
   A small number of Austrian-owned US patents, 32 patents, were subject to compulsory
licensing under the TWEA. To be conservative, we exclude these patents from the treatment
variable, and assign German patents by Austrian inventors to the control variable patents by
other foreign inventors.
11
   Patent citations, as an alternative measure of patent quality, are not available for German
patents because references to prior art were not recorded. Trajtenberg (1990) shows that counts
of citation are correlated with the estimated social surplus of 456 patented improvements in CT
scanners. Moser, Ohmstedt, and Rhode (2014) link patents with field trial data for hybrid corn,
and show that citations are correlated with improvements in yields, as an objective measure for
the size of patented inventions. They do, however, also find that citation counts for early patents
may overstate their value because these patents are cited to establish patentability.

                                                                                                      6
       In Germany, renewal fees were high, so that renewal decisions were economically

meaningful. In the first two years, renewal fees were 50ℳ per year (Appendix Figure A2); this is

equivalent to $243 in 2012 using purchasing power (the most conservative conversion) and

$1,340 using income value (the largest estimate, Williamson 2014).12 After the second year,

renewal fees increased by 50ℳ each year, reaching 700ℳ in the 15th year, which was the end of

the statutory term. To renew a patent for 5 years inventors had to pay 550ℳ, between $2,670

and $14,700 in 2012.13

       To construct renewal data, we followed all 79,591 GPO patents for chemicals through

renewal records in the Annual Reports of the German Patent Office, 1901-1942. Half of all

patents - 39,682 (49.86 percent) - were renewed for 5 years or more; we use these patents as a

proxy for high-value patents.14 14,605 patents were not renewed in the first year (18.35 percent),

18,319 (23.02 percent) were renewed for 10 years or more, and 6,089 (7.65 percent) were

renewed for the full 15-year term (Appendix Figure A3).



C. Inventor-level Changes in Patenting

       To investigate inventor-level changes in patenting, we match patents with German firms;

this process matches 30,499 GPO patents with application years between 1900 and 1930 to 4,814

unique German firms. The remaining 49,092 German-owned patents were issued to individual

12
   In 1915, 50ℳ were equal to $10.31 (Bidwell, 1970).
13
   By comparison, US renewal fees were only $1,600 in 2012 and 2014, due 3.5 years after the
issue date. http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/ac/qs/ope/fee010114.htm; accessed March 2, 2014.
14
   Another benefit of using five years as a cut-off is that our quality measure is unlikely to be
affected by a September 19, 1914 decision of Germany’s Federal Council (Bundesrat) to suspend
renewal fees; this suspension lasted nine months. In 1918, the German Patent Office announced
that patentees had to pay fees for the last four years to keep their patents active (Blatt 1918, p.
98). As a result, any patent that was renewed for five years or more has been subject to the full
fees. In the main analysis we address the issue of this suspension and other war-related
disruptions through robustness checks that exclude the war years (1914-1919) from the sample.

                                                                                                 7
inventors; in firm-level regressions, we use these patents as a control for scientific

breakthroughs, changes in demand, or other unobservable factors that may influence changes in

patenting across fields.

       Firm-level patent data allow us to investigate changes in patenting for firms that were

differentially affected by compulsory licensing. 1,017 of 1,246 licensed patents were owned by a

total of 50 German firms (using records from Haynes 1945 and the Alien Property Custodian

1919, see Data Appendix). Another 229 licensed patents list the US Chemical Foundation as an

assignee owner. The remaining 208 patents are owned by individuals, including 53 patents by

co-inventors of a German firm. For example, Dr. Richard Herz from Frankfurt is listed as an

inventor for US patents 956348, 960919, and 966092 of the German firm Cassella, and we assign

one remaining US patent by Dr. Herz (US patent 1243171) to the same firm.

       The firms that were most affected by licensing were the German Bayer AG (551 licensed

patents), the Badische Anilin und Soda Fabrik (BASF, 308 licensed patents), Meister Lucius

(104 licensed patents), Griesheim-Elektron (57), AGFA (38), Cassella (22), and the Berlin-

Anhaltische Maschinenbau AG (BAMAG, 17). Another 43 firms saw between 1 and 12 of their

US patents licensed under the TWEA. 12,531 patents by these 50 German firms cover 123

subclasses in the German patent system, and 17,968 patents by 4,764 firms without licensed

patents cover 202 subclasses.15

       Data on firm size, which we draw from a registry of publicly traded joint stock

companies (Handbuch der Deutschen Aktiengesellschaften 1911 and 1912) indicate that firms

with licensed patents were large compared with other German firms. A total of 4,814 firms

15
  Another 28,192 patents by individual inventors cover 208 research fields. Although individual
inventors were less likely to patent in the United States than German firms, some individual
inventors may have been affected by compulsory licensing. Analyses at the firm level exclude
these data.

                                                                                                 8
applied for at least one chemical patent in Germany between 1900 and 1930; 175 of them (3.6

percent) are listed in the registries of Aktiengesellschaften (AGs). Thirty of 50 firms with

licensed patents were AGs, compared with 145 of 4,764 other firms (Appendix Table A3). On

average, 30 AGs with licensed patents had a nominal capital stock of $108,343, compared with

$40,755 for 145 other AGs in our sample (from Handbuch 1911 and 1912, in year 2012

dollars).16 Data on employees are available for 13 AGs with licensed patents and 50 other AGs.

On average, AGs with licensed patents had 6,197 employees in 1911 and 1912 (with a median of

1,060, and a standard error of 4,867), compared with 2,466 employees for other 50 German AGs

(with a median of 881, and a standard error of 963).

       In terms of firm age, firms with and without licensed patents are roughly comparable:

The average AG with licensed patents had been incorporated as a joint-stock company in 1893

(with a standard error of 2.6 years). By comparison, the average AG without licensed patents had

been incorporated as a joint-stock company in 1892 (with a standard error of 1.3 years).



                                            II. RESULTS

       Comparisons of means indicate that German inventors began to patent more in research

fields with licensing after 1918. In 101 fields with licensing, patent applications by German

inventors increased by 53 percent from 10.77 per year until 1918 to 16.49 afterwards (Table 1,



16
   Firms with and without licensed US patents report comparable valuations of patents on their
balance sheets. Haber (1971, p. 254), however, warns, “…when we look at the finance of
chemical companies just before and just after the war, we have a woefully small sample, the
information is inadequate and the conclusions must necessarily be tentative.” Fourteen of 30
firms with licensed patents reported patents among the assets on their balance sheets; four (13.3
percent) of them listed a positive value; eight (26.7 percent) reported a symbolic 1 Mark for
devalued patented assets. By comparison, 63 of 145 firms without licensed patents reported
patents among their assets; 19 (13.1 percent) of them listed a positive value, 43 (29.7 percent)
listed a symbolic value of 1 Mark.

                                                                                                    9
Panel A). By comparison, in 111 fields without licensing, patenting increased by less than 10

percent from 5.05 until 1918 to 5.54 afterwards.

       Annual patent data show fields with licensing produced more patents per year in the pre-

war period (until 1918, Appendix Figure A4, Panel A). These data also suggest that patenting

may have begun to increase at a slightly higher rate for fields with licensing before 1918. In the

regressions, we will address this issue through alternative controls for pre-trends; results are

robust to controlling for these trends.

       Most notably, German inventors began to patent significantly more in fields with

licensing after 1919, while patenting stayed flat in other fields. To investigate these changes

systematically with controls, we estimate:

(1) patentsct = β0 + β1 • field with licensed patentsc • postt
               + β2 • patents by US inventorsct + β3 • patents by other foreign inventorsct
               + δt + θc +εct
where the dependent variable patentsct measures the number of successful applications for

German patents by German inventors in field c and year t between 1900 and 1930. The variable

field with licensed patentsc equals 1 for research fields in which at least one German-owned

patent was licensed under the US TWEA. The variable postt indicates years after 1918. Under

the assumption that – in the absence of compulsory licensing - changes in patenting would have

been comparable in fields with and without licensing, the coefficient β1 measures the effect of

compulsory licensing on German invention.

       Three variables control for idiosyncratic variation in patenting across research fields and

over time. The variables patents by US inventorsct and patents by other foreign inventorsct

control for variation in German patents by US and other foreign inventors across fields and over

time. Field fixed effects θc control for variation across fields that is constant over time. Year



                                                                                                    10
fixed effects δt control for variation in patenting over time that affects all fields. Standard errors

are clustered at the level of research fields.

        OLS estimates indicate that German inventors applied for 2.97 additional patents per year

after 1918 in research fields with licensing (Table 2, column 1, p-value 0.001). Compared with

an average of 10.77 patents per year until 1918 for these fields, this implies a 28 percent

increase. Excluding controls for GPO patents by foreign inventors increases the coefficient to

5.22 (Table 2, column 2, p-value 0.001).

        Comparisons across fields indicate that research fields with 10 or more licensed patents

experienced the largest increase in invention (Appendix Figure A4, Panel B). Until 1918,

changes in patenting were similar in fields with small and large numbers of licensed patents.

After 1918, patenting accelerated disproportionately in research fields with 10 or more licensed

patents. In 1928, inventors applied for an average of 38.4 patents per year in fields with 10 or

more licenses, compared with 17.41 in fields with 3 to 10 licenses, 11.92 in fields with 2 licenses

and 6.17 patents in fields with fewer than 2 licenses.

        Intensity regressions with the number of licensed patentsc indicate that German inventors

applied for 0.20 additional patents per year after 1918 for each additional patent that was

licensed in field c (Table 2, column 5, p-value 0.005). For the average field with at least one

licensed patent, which includes 18.04 licensed patents, this implies a 33.5 percent increase.



A. Controlling for Differential Pre-Trends

        As a robustness check, we re-estimate the baseline specification allowing for separate

linear pre-trends in patenting for each research field:

(2) patentsct = β0 + β1 • field with licensed patentsc • postt
                + β2 • patents by US inventorsct + β3 • patents by other foreign inventorsct


                                                                                                     11
                  + Σc ϕc • fieldc • preTWEAt • t + δt + θc +εct
where fieldc is a vector that distinguishes 212 research fields within chemicals, the indicator

variable preTWEAt equals 1 for years before 1919, and the variable t denotes a linear time trend.

Estimates with these field-specific pre-trends indicate that German inventors applied for 5.32

additional patents per year after 1918 in fields with licensing (Table 2, column 3, p-value

<0.001), which implies a 49 percent increase.

          We also estimate β1 separately for each year with 1918 to 1921 as the omitted category

(Appendix Figure A5). Until 1917, effects are negative and statistically significant only for 4 of

18 years. After 1918 effects are positive and statistically significant for 5 of 12 years. Estimates

increase after 1923, with 3.58 additional patents in 1924 and 3.68 in 1925, implying a 33 and 34

percent increase, respectively (with p-values of 0.006 and 0.013).

          An alternative test allows for a separate linear pre-trend for fields with licensing:

(3) patentsct = β0 + β1 • field with licensed patentsc • postt

                  + β2 • patents by US inventorsct + β3 • patents by other foreign inventorsct

                  + β4 • field with licensed patentsc • preTWEAt • t + δt + θc + εfct

These regressions indicate an increase by 5.02 additional patents per year after 1918 (Table 2,

column 4, p-value <0.001), which is larger than the baseline estimate of 2.97.17



B. Excluding the War Years

          An additional robustness check excludes the war years (1915-1918). For example,

patenting during these years may have been influenced by changes in the demand for war-related

chemicals, such as explosives and dyes. These estimates are slightly larger than the baseline

estimate of 2.97 additional patents (Table 2, column 1). OLS estimates indicate that German

17
     The coefficient of the linear trend for fields with licensing is small (0.204, p-value 0.007).

                                                                                                      12
inventors applied for 3.22 additional patents in fields with licensing per year after 1918

(Appendix Table A4, column 1, p-value 0.001). Excluding controls for patents by foreign

inventors increases the size of this estimate to 5.36 (Appendix Table A4, column 2, p-value

0.001). Intensity specifications indicate that German inventors applied for 0.19 additional patents

per year after 1918 for each additional licensed patentc (Appendix Table A4, column 5, p-value

0.007), which implies a 32 percent increase for the average field with at least 1 licensed patent.



C. Instrumental Variable Regressions

       We also examine the potential influence of selection into compulsory licensing. As a

response to Germany’s military aggression, the confiscation of German-owned property and the

timing of the TWEA were exogenous to changes in patenting after 1918. The fields in which US

firms chose to license confiscated US patents by German inventors may, however, not have been

exogenous. Most importantly, US firms may have been more likely to license German-owned

US patents in fields in which US demand for invention was high, and German demand may have

increased in the same fields after 1918, resulting in an increase in invention. Then, OLS

estimates overstate the increase in invention that is due to licensing.

       Historical accounts, however, indicate that US firms were more likely to license German-

owned patents for war-related chemicals, such as dyes or explosives. In these fields, German

firms were affected by a dramatic decline in demand after 1919. Haber (1971, p. 251), for

example, explains that: “Without demand for war-related chemicals, the worst problem that

German dye producers…faced turned out to be excess capacity.” Thus, the historical records

suggest that selection into licensing may have been negative in the case of German patents.

Consistent with negative selection as a result of war-related research demands, the field with the




                                                                                                 13
largest number of licensed patents was subclass 22a for azo dyes, with 436 licensed patents

(Appendix Table A5). In this field, patents by German inventors declined from 28.79 per year

until 1918 to 24.17 afterwards.

        To investigate these issues, we estimate intent-to-treat (ITT) and instrumental variable

(IV) regressions with fields with confiscated patents as an instrument for fields with licensed

patents. These regressions exploit the fact that only confiscated patents were available for

licensing (so that fields with confiscated patents were more likely to become fields with

licensing), and that changes in patenting after 1918 did not influence the choice of confiscated

fields (because all German-owned US patents were confiscated in 1918.) ITT (or reduced form)

regressions estimate

(4) patentsct = β0 + β1 • field with confiscated patentsc • postt
                + β2 • patents by US inventorsct + β3 • patents by other foreign inventorsct
                + δt + θc +εct
where field with confiscated patentsc equals 1 if field c includes at least 1 confiscated German-

owned US patent. Among 212 research fields of chemical inventions, 167 fields include at least

1 confiscated patent; 101 of these 167 fields with confiscated patents include at least 1 licensed

patent (60 percent). ITT estimates imply that German inventors applied for 2.36 additional

patents per year after 1918 in fields with confiscated patents (Table 3, column 1, p-value 0.004).

Compared with an average of 10.77 patents per field and year until 1918, this implies a 22

percent increase.

      Consistent with historical evidence of negative selection (e.g., Haber 1971, p. 251), ITT

estimates suggest that OLS may underestimate the effects of compulsory licensing. At 2.36

(Table 3, column 1), ITT estimates are 33 percent larger than 1.78, the product of the OLS




                                                                                                    14
estimate of 2.97 (Table 2, column 1) and 0.60, the probability that at least one patent in a field

with confiscated patents was licensed.18

       IV regressions that use fields with confiscated patentsc as an instrument for fields with

licensed patentsc confirm that OLS is downward biased. First stage regressions indicate that a

field with confiscated patents is 58 percent more likely to be a field with licensed patents (Table

3, column 4, p-value < 0.001). IV estimates indicate that German inventors applied for 4.05

additional patents per year after 1918 in fields with licensing (Table 3, column 6, p-value <

0.001), compared with 2.97 for OLS (Table 2, column 1).

       The local average treatment effect (LATE) of 4.05 measures the effect of making

German-owned US patents available for compulsory licensing by US firms in fields in which

German inventors applied for US patents between 1900 and 1918. Inventions in these fields are

geared towards the US market, and (due to the costs of patenting abroad) they are more likely to

be owned by larger German firms.19



D. Renewals as a Control for Patent Value

       We also examine whether the observed increase in patenting may be due to lower quality,

strategic patents. Following Schankerman and Pakes (1986), we use information that we collect

on inventors’ decisions to pay renewal fees as a measure of variation in inventors’ valuation of

patents. Patents that inventors renewed for at least 5 years (the median renewal year) serve as a

proxy for high-value patents. Estimates with renewed patents imply a large and statistically




18
   ITT estimates with patents that were renewed for at least 5 years imply a 19 percent increase in
patenting in GPO research fields with confiscated patents (Appendix Table A6, column 1).
19
   See the description of the firm characteristics in the data section and Appendix Table A.3.

                                                                                                     15
significant increase in high-value patents.20 Renewed patents follow a similar trend for fields

with and without licensing until 1918 (Appendix Figure A6, Panel A). After 1918, renewed

patents increased in fields with licensing but not in other fields. In 1927, German inventors

applied for 9.63 renewed patents in fields with licensing, more than three times compared with

2.29 in other fields. In fields with licensing, counts of renewed patents increased by 28 percent

from 6.28 per year until 1918 to 8.05 after 1918 (Table 1, Panel A). In fields without licensing,

renewed patents declined by 12 percent from 2.56 per year until 1918 to 2.28 afterwards.

       Estimating the baseline specification (equation 1) with renewed patents as an outcome

variable indicates that German inventors applied for 1.09 additional renewed patents per year

after 1918 in fields with licensing (Table 2, column 7, p-value 0.02). Compared with an average

of 6.28 renewed patents per field and year until 1918, this implies a 17 percent increase.

Estimates with field-specific pre-trends indicate that German inventors applied for 2.35

additional renewed patents (Table 2, column 8, p-value 0.001), implying a 37 percent increase.

Regressions with a separate trend in patenting for fields with licensing indicate that German

inventors applied for 2.26 additional renewed patents per field and year, implying a 36 percent

increase (not reported). Intensity regressions indicate that German inventors applied for 0.08

additional renewed patents per year after 1918 for each additional licensed patentc; this implies a

23 percent increase for the average field with at least one licensed patent.




20
   For example, inventors may have responded to the loss of their US patents by building a
“patent thicket,” which Shapiro (2001, p. 120) defines as a “dense web of overlapping
intellectual property rights that a company must hack its way through in order to actually
commercialize a new technology.” For a sample of 95 semiconductor firms between 1979 and
1995, Hall and Ziedonis (2001) show that firms build portfolios of strategic patents to use against
each other in case of litigation.

                                                                                                    16
                           IV. INVENTOR-LEVEL CHANGES IN PATENTING

        In this section we investigate the claim that firms will reduce their spending on R&D in

research fields with compulsory licensing. Specifically, we estimate triple difference regressions

of the form:

(5) patentsfct = γ0 + γ1 • field w licensed patentsc • firm w licensed patentf • postt

        + γ2 • field w licensed patentsc • postt + γ3 • firm w licensed patentf • postt

        + γ4 • field w licensed patentsc • firm w licensed patentf

        + γ5 • patents by US inventorsct + γ6 • patents by other foreign inventorsct

        + γ7 • patents by individualsct + δt + θc + λ f + εfct

where the outcome variable patentsfct counts patents by firm f in field c and application year t.

The variable firm w licensed patentf equals 1 if at least one of firm f’s patents was licensed. The

variable patents by individualsct counts patents in field c and year t by individual German

inventors; all other control variables are as defined above. The triple difference coefficient γ1

measures the effect of compulsory licensing on firms whose patents were licensed, compared

with other German firms. It is an unbiased estimate of the effect of compulsory licensing on

firms whose patents were licensed if changes in patenting in field c after 1918 would have been

comparable for firms with and without licensed patents in the absence of compulsory licensing.

        OLS estimates indicate that firms whose patents had been licensed began to patent more

in fields with licensing after 1918. German firms with licensed patents applied for 0.42

additional patents per year after 1918 in fields with licensing (Table 4, column 1, p-value 0.002).

Compared with a mean of 0.46 patents per field and year until 1918 for firms with licensed

patents, this implies a 91 percent increase. These results are robust to the inclusion of field-

specific pre-trends (Table 4, column 2).




                                                                                                    17
A. Excluding Years after the Creation of IG Farben

         An additional robustness check excludes application years after 1924, the last year before

the creation of the IG Farben. The cartel-like “community of interest” (in German

Interessengemeinschaft, or IG) formed on December 25, 1924. It included the largest firms in the

German chemical industry: AGFA, Bayer, BASF, Hoechst, Griesheim-Elektron, and Chemische

Fabrik (vorm. Weiler Ter Meer). Haber (1971, pp. 290-91) explains: “In the latter half of the

1920s, the German chemical industry employed nearly 0.3 million people, and on this reckoning

IG Farben accounted for over a third.”21 To mitigate competition, members of the IG Farben

specialized in specific chemicals. After the creation of IG Farben,

     “the Leverkusen works of Bayer increased their make of dyes by over a quarter, …Hoechst
     was assigned responsibility for all chemicals from acetylene, and in this connexion (sic)
     took over the Griesheim patents and technique for polyvinyl acetate manufacture… Bayer
     became the concern’s principal manufacturer of the azo-group of dyes…Badische became
     the specialist in high–pressure synthesis in all its aspects” (Haber 1971, pp. 285-86).22

         Estimates with the restricted sample of patents until 1924 confirm that firms whose

patents had been licensed patented more in fields with licensing after 1918. Baseline estimates

indicate that firms whose patents had been licensed applied for 0.16 additional patents after 1918

in fields with licensing (Table 4, column 3, p-value 0.002). Compared with an average of 0.46

patents per field and year until 1918 for firms with licensed patents, this implies a 35 percent

increase. Regressions with field-specific pre-trends indicate a slightly larger increase of 0.17




21
   Also see Aftalion (2001, p. 138): “The new giant had a workforce of 67,000 people including
1,000 chemists, and accounted for one third of Germany's chemical industry sales.”
22
   In the main specifications, we assign patents by IG Farben to the original six firms according
to the pre-existing distribution of patents between 1910 and 1914 across firms and technology
fields (Appendix Table A7). This approach allows us to include IG Farben in the inventor-level
analysis but it assumes that the distribution of patenting remained stable after the 1924.

                                                                                                   18
additional patents per year after 1918 (Table 4, column 4, p-value 0.002), which implies a 37

percent increase.

       Excluding data after 1924 may, however, lead us to underestimate firms’ response to

compulsory licensing, if compulsory licensing influences invention with some delay. For US

inventors, the strongest increase in patenting occurred six years after the first licenses were

issued, which is consistent with a prolonged period of learning (Moser and Voena 2012, p. 409).

For example, Du Pont’s early runs of indigo blue turned out green (Hounshell and Smith 1988,

p.90). If German inventors also responded to compulsory licensing with some delay, regressions

that drop years after 1924 underestimate the effects of compulsory licensing.



B. Renewal Decisions to Proxy for Patent Quality

       Regressions with renewal data imply a smaller, albeit substantial increase. German firms

applied for 0.29 additional renewed patents after 1918 in fields in which their patents had been

licensed (Table 4, column 5, p-value < 0.001). Relative to an average of 0.39 renewed patents

per field and year until 1918 for firms with licensed patents, this implies a 74 percent increase.

Estimates with field-specific pre-trends indicate that German firms applied for 0.30 additional

renewed patents in fields with licensing (Table 4, column 6, p-value < 0.001), which implies a 77

percent increase. Regressions with a separate trend for firms with licensing indicate that German

firms applied for 0.29 additional renewed patents per year in fields with licensing; this implies a

74 percent increase (not reported).

       In sum, individual-level patent data indicate that compulsory licensing led firms whose

patents had been licensed to patent more in fields with licensing. One potential mechanism for




                                                                                                     19
this change is an increase in the threat of competition in fields in which competition was weak

before licensing. We examine this mechanism in the following section.



                                  IV. CHANGES IN COMPETITION

       As an antitrust remedy, compulsory licensing is used as a mechanism to increase

competition and encourage innovation (e.g., Chien 2003). The relationship between competition

and innovation, however, is theoretically ambiguous, and depends on the specific circumstances

under which government policies encourage or discourage innovation.



A. Theoretical Predictions on Competition and Innovation

       Arrow (1962) shows that, if patents create exclusive monopoly rights to inventions,

incentives to innovate are smaller for a monopolist who faces no (actual or potential)

competition, compared with a competitive firm. For the monopolist, the stream of rents from an

invention replaces an existing stream of rents. For a competitive firm, there are no existing

streams of rents, so that incentives to innovate are higher for the competitive firm than for the

monopolist.23 In contrast with these predictions, Schumpeter (1934 and 1942) argues that large

firms and a relatively concentrated market structure can promote invention by improving the




23
   Consistent with these predictions, Acs and Audretsch (1988) have documented a positive
correlation between industries with lower levels of concentration and invention, using data on
8,074 US manufacturing inventions listed in 1982 trade journals. Nickell (1996) presents
evidence on 670 UK manufacturing firms between 1972 and 1986, which suggests that
competition (measured by the number of competitors or by lower levels of rents) is associated
with significantly higher rates of total factor productivity growth. Blundell et al.’s (1999)
analysis of 340 manufacturing firms listed on the London Stock Exchange between 1972 and
1982 indicates that industries with lower levels of concentration produced more "technologically
significant and commercially important" inventions.

                                                                                                    20
ability of innovators to capture the returns from R&D.24 In the context of intellectual property,

Schumpeter’s hypothesis implies that patents can encourage invention by granting temporary

monopoly rights to inventors, which enable them to recover costly investments in R&D

(Scotchmer 2004, pp. 36-39). This suggests that compulsory licensing can discourage invention

by weakening the effectiveness of intellectual property and by reducing inventors’ ability to

recover investments in R&D.

       Aghion et al. (2001, 2005) reconcile these predictions through an inverted U-shaped

relationship between competition and invention.25 At low levels of competition, an increase in

competition can encourage invention by encouraging incumbents to invest in R&D to “escape”

competition. At high levels of competition, an increase in (“neck-and-neck”) competition

discourages invention by further reducing post-invention rents.26 In the following paragraphs we

use data on German patents to examine these predictions in the context of compulsory licensing.



B. Increased Entry into Fields with Licensing

       Patent data confirm a significant differential increase of US invention in research fields

with licensing (Data Section II.D, Figure 1). These results are consistent with US patent data,

which indicate that US inventors begun to patent more in fields with licensing after 1918 (Moser



24
   Goettler and Gordon (2011) confirm these predictions with estimates of a dynamic oligopoly
model for the durable goods microprocessor industry; their estimates imply that the rate of
innovation in product quality would be 4.2 percent higher if IBM was a monopolist.
25
   Schmidt (1997) predicts an inverted U by incorporating bankruptcy: Competition increases the
risk of bankruptcy, which encourages managers to innovate to preserve their jobs, but also
reduces returns from cost-saving inventions by reducing demand for each firm. At high levels of
competition, the latter effect dominates so that investments in R&D peak at an intermediate level
of competition.
26
   These predictions are confirmed in a data set of UK patents issued to 311 firms between 1973
and 1994. Patenting increases in response to shifts towards competition at low levels of
competition, but declines when pre-existing levels of competition are high (Aghion et al. 2005).

                                                                                                    21
and Voena 2012). This increased presence of US inventors created a threat of competition, which

– according to Arrow (1962) – may have encouraged incumbent patentees to invent more.

       Moreover, inventor-level analyses of changes in patenting reveal a large increase after

1918 in the number of German firms that were active in fields with licensing. Until 1918, an

average of 2.29 German firms without licensed patents produced patents in fields with licensing;

after 1918 this number increased by 70 percent to 3.90 firms (Table 5). By comparison, the

average number of German firms without licensed patents that patented in fields without licensed

patents increased by 23 percent, from 1.22 to 1.50. After 1918, entrants without previous patents

in fields with licensing accounted for 5,065 of 12,852 German-owned (39 percent) in fields with

licensing.

       One example of a firm that entered fields with licensing is the Deutsche Gold und Silber-

Scheide-Anstalt (Degussa). Until 1918, Degussa applied for a total of 58 patents across 10 fields

of chemical inventions, including 54 patents in 8 fields with licensing. After 1918, Degussa

applied for a total of 147 patents, including 83 patents in the same 8 fields with licensing, 24 in

fields without licensing, and 50 patents in 12 fields with licensing, in which Degussa had not

patented until 1918.

       To investigate whether the observed increase in patenting in fields with licensing was

driven by firms that switched into fields with licensing from other fields of chemical research, we

measure the share of patents in fields with licensing by firms with previous patents in other fields

of chemicals (switchers) and firms without previous patents (entrants into chemical research).

This analysis shows that the increase in patenting by entrants in fields with licensing was driven




                                                                                                  22
primarily by entrants without previous patents for chemicals. Entrants without previous patents

in any field of chemical research account for 2,898 of 5,065 patents (57 percent).27



B. Differential Effects Across Low and High Levels of Competition

       Individual-level patent data also enable us to perform a basic test of the inverse-U-shaped

relationship between competition and invention (Aghion et al. 2005). Although market share

data are not available at the fine-grained level of 212 research fields that we use in our analysis,

we can create an alternative measure of competition through a Herfindahl-Hirshman index (HHI)

of patents per technology field and year:
                                                           !
                                                      ( ! !!"# )!! !
                                                                    !"
                                            HHIct =
                                                          !!! !
                                                                !"


where pict is firm i’s share of total patents in field c and year t, and Fct measures the number of

patent-active firms in field c and year t. Comparisons of patent counts for 3,265 field-year pairs

show that most research fields are relatively competitive: Two-thirds of all field-year pairs have

an HHI of 0.1 or less (Figure 2). Similar to plots of patent counts across UK industries in Aghion

et al. (2005), the data are also broadly consistent with an inverted U-shaped relationship between

competition and invention.28



27
   Patents per year by firms without pre-1919 patents in other fields of chemical research
increased from 1.45 in 1919 to 2.96 in 1924 and 2.91 in 1929 (Appendix Figure A7). By
comparison, the average number of patents by entrants with pre-1919 patents increased from
1.28 in 1919 to 1.85 in 1924 and 1.82 in 1929.
28
   Figure 2 is most similar to Figure 1 in Aghion et al. 2005, which plots patents per industry and
year against (1-) the Lerner index as a measure for the intensity of competition. Estimates with
the HHI and the concentration ratio (C4, not reported) are also consistent with Levin, Cohen, and
Mowery’s (1985) findings that competition and invention are positively correlated up to the 5th
and 6th decile of the C4 in FTC line of business data. Levin et al. (1985) find that this correlation
disappears with controls for variation across industries in the effectiveness of mechanisms to
appropriate the returns from R&D. Our analysis investigates variation in competition within

                                                                                                      23
        To compare the effect of compulsory licensing across fields with low and high levels of

pre-existing competition, we re-estimate the baseline specification (equation 2) with an

additional interaction term between the difference-in-differences estimator and a set of indicator

variables for deciles of the HHI across all years until 1918:

(6) patentsct = α + Σd βd • field w licensed patentsc • pre-1919 HHI deciled • postt

                + Σd γd • pre-1919 HHI deciled • postt + ζ1 • field w licensed patentsc • postt

                + ζ2 • patents by US inventorsct + ζ3 • patents by other foreign inventorsct + δt

                + θc + Σc ϕc • fieldc • preTWEAt • t + εct

where the 5th and 6th decile of the HHI are the omitted categories. Estimates increase from 8.22

fewer patents for the 10th decile (Appendix Figure A8, p-value of 0.26) to 14.74 additional

patents for the 7th decile (p-value of 0.11). Estimates are close to zero for the 4th to the 1st decile

of the HHI. These estimates suggest that the observed increase in patenting was driven by

technologies in which patenting was relatively concentrated before 1919.



                                          IV. CONCLUSIONS

        This paper has used a new data set of 79,591 chemical patents in Germany between 1900

and 1930 to examine the effects of compulsory licensing under the WWI Trading with the

Enemy Act on German invention. Under the TWEA, all German-owned US patents became

subject to compulsory licensing in 1919. We find that compulsory licensing encouraged, rather

than discouraged invention in Germany. German inventors produced 28 percent more patents

after 1918 in research fields with licensing. Intent-to-treat regressions and instrumental variable




chemicals in the early 20th century, when patents had become an effective mechanism to
appropriate the returns from R&D in chemicals (Moser 2012).


                                                                                                      24
regressions, which use fields with confiscations as an instrument for fields with licensing,

suggest that OLS estimates underestimate the effect of compulsory licensing on German patents.

       An analysis of high-quality patents indicates a slightly smaller increase in patenting. This

suggests that some of the observed increase in patenting may have been due to an increase in

lower quality strategic patents. Estimates, however, remain large and statistically significant, and

imply a 17 percent increase in high-quality patents.

       Inventor-level analyses of patent data reveal a significant increase in the number of

research-active firms in research fields with licensing. Nearly 40 percent of all patents after 1918

in fields with licensing were by firms without pre-1918 patents in these fields. Among entrants

into fields with licensing, firms without previous patents in any other fields of chemicals

produced more patents in fields with licensing after 1918 compared with firms that had been

active in other fields of chemical research before 1918. We also find that German firms whose

patents had been licensed produced more patents after 1918 in fields in which their patents had

been licensed. Taken together, these results indicate that compulsory licensing can promote

invention by encouraging competitors to enter fields with licensing, which increases the threat of

competition for incumbent inventors and motivates them to invest more in R&D.

       In the early 20th century and today, industries that are most affected by compulsory

licensing tend to be relatively concentrated. In 2013, for example, therapies by Gilead, Johnson

& Johnson, and Brystol Myers dominated the market for HIV drugs. Gilead’s Truvada and

related drugs accounted for $9 billion in sales, Brystol-Myers Sustiva generated $3.6 billion, and

Ruveda, which combines Gilead’s drug Viread and Emtriva, recorded $3.1 billion in sales, while

other drugs sold substantially less (Campbell 2014). Our findings suggest that compulsory

licensing can encourage invention in these industries. In fact, we find that compulsory licensing




                                                                                                  25
was particularly effective at promoting invention in fields that were ex ante more concentrated,

and less effective in fields that were competitive already.

         It is, however, important to note that the benefits of compulsory licensing depend on the

credibility with which national governments can commit to invoke it exclusively in cases of

emergencies. Triggered by Germany’s military aggression, the 1919 Trading-with-the-Enemy

Act was at the time perceived as a one-shot event. We find that incumbent inventors responded

by investing heavily in R&D to escape competition with new entrants. Similar to other types of

public policies, such as flood control measures, monetary policy, and capital taxation (Kydland

and Prescott 1977, Fischer 1980), compulsory licensing is subject to dynamic inconsistency, and

firms may invest less in R&D if they expect repeated episodes of compulsory licensing.29 We

conclude that compulsory licensing can promote innovation - if governments can credibly

commit to using it only in exceptional cases of emergencies.

   In fact, Kydland and Prescott (1977, p. 477) cite patent policy as an example for dynamic
inconsistency: “Given that resources have been allocated to inventive activity which resulted in a
new product or process, the efficient policy is not to permit patent protection. For this example,
few would consider this optimal-control theory solution as being reasonable. Rather, the question
would be posed in terms of the optimal patent life (see, e.g., Nordhaus 1969), which takes into
consideration both the incentive for inventive activity provided by patent protection and the loss
in consumer surplus that results when someone realizes monopoly rents.”

Notes: Data include all 79,591 patents on chemicals with application years between 1900 and 1930. Data on renewal decisions are
collected from the Annual Reports of the German Patent Office between 1901 and 1942. The indicator variable field with licensed
patents equals 1 for 101 research fields, in which at least 1 US patent was licensed. The indicator variable post equals 1 for all years
after 1918. The variable licensed patents measures the number of patents that became subject to licensing. Patents by US inventors
controls for the number of patents issued to residents of the United States in field c and year t; patents by other foreign inventors
controls for patents issued to residents of other foreign countries.

                                               DATA APPENDIX

To examine changes in invention, we collected information on all patents issued in Germany
between 1900 and 1932 across 212 research fields of chemical inventions. To digitize these
data, we first trained a group of typists to read German Fraktur with 99 percent accuracy, at less
than one misspelled letter per page. They then collected the complete records of patent issues for
chemicals from the Annual Reports of the German Patent Office (Kaiserliches Patentamt, 1900-
1932). We then checked all entries to correct typographical errors in the description of
inventions, inventors’ names and cities. By this process we were able to collect information on
79,591 German patents issued for chemical processes and products between 1900 and 1932.
These patents have application years between 1900 and 1930.

A. Licenses to US Firms
        US authorities confiscated a total of 4,706 German-owned US patents under the TWEA;
1,246 of these patents were licensed to US firms. On December 12, 1918, US authorities
auctioned off 551 US patents by the German Bayer AG to the US Sterling Company (Alien
Property Custodian 1919, p. 440-53). Sterling sold Bayer’s dye business to Grasselli Chemical
and used Bayer’s dye patents to produce pharmaceuticals through its division, Winthrop
Chemical. Critics of the auction argued that the Custodian had destroyed the German dye cartel
merely “to build an American dye trust,” and demanded the creation of an independent
organization to distribute patents more broadly; this criticism led to the creation of the Chemical
Foundation. Beginning in 1919, the US Chemical Foundation licensed another 695 German-
owned US patents to US firms (Alien Property Custodian 1919, p. 439 and Appendix 6 schedule
2; Hounshell and Smith 1988, p. 92.)
        Licenses were non-exclusive; the average German-owned US patent was licensed to 2.5
firms, but the median patent was licensed to a single firm. Haynes (1945) reports licensees for
587 of 695 patents licensed by the Chemical Foundation. Although most German-owned patents
were licensed to one or two US firms, in some cases a large number of US firms requested the
same patent. For example, two patents by Krupp’s metallurgist Benno Strauss (1873-1844) for
stainless steel (1,316,817, “Articles which require high resistance against corrosion” and
1,339,378 “Objects having great strength and great resistance against the action of acids”) were
each licensed to 91 US firms. Both patents are in the USPTO subclass class 420/34 and German
patent class 40b “alloys.” Patent data (below) indicate that German patents for alloys nearly
tripled after 1918 (from 4.95 patents per year to 16.92).

B. Matching Technologies Across the US and German Patent System
        To identify research fields in which German inventors were affected by compulsory
licensing, we created a new concordance between research fields in the US and German system.
First, we used an existing USPTO concordance to match all 7,699 USPTO fields with 7,010
fields in the International Patent Classification (IPC).1 We then match IPC fields with all 513
fields in German patent system, using a corresponding classification by the German Patent
Office (Appendix Table A1 and Figure A1). The USPTO, however, cautions that its USPTO-
IPC concordance “should be treated merely as suggestive of classification places in the two

systems that may be similar,” and warns that not all US and German fields can be matched with
an IPC subclass.
        To improve on the USPTO-IPC-GPO concordance, we exploit a reporting requirement as
a result of the 1883 Paris Convention to identify US and German patents that were granted for
the same invention. The Paris Convention’s Right of Priority allows inventors to apply for
patents in other member countries within 12 months of the original application.2 Germany
ratified the Paris Convention in 1903, allowing inventors to apply for patents in Germany within
12 months of an application for the same invention in the United States. We exploit this rule to
augment the USPTO-IPC-GPO concordance with information on fields that cover the same
invention in the US and German system. Specifically, we search for references to US patent
applications among the 71,770 German patents with application years after 1903.3 This search
yields 1,343 pairs of German and US patents for the same invention, which we use to identify
fields that cover the same invention in the US and in the German patent systems. With this
additional information, we are able to match 3,533 licensed US patents with 167 fields in the
GPO’s classification system (Appendix Table A1).4

Notes: Licensed patents are 1,246 German-owned patents, which the US Alien Property
Custodian made available for licensing; confiscated patents are 4,706 German-owned US
patents, which were available for licensing (from Haynes 1945, p. 498 and Alien Property
Custodian 1919, p. 437). The USPTO-IPC concordance matches 7,699 USPTO fields with 7,010
fields in the International Patent Classification (IPC).

  We first performed an automated search to match German with US patents (http://patft.uspto.gov/, accessed
October 2012), using the title of the invention, the name of the inventor, and the application date. We hand-checked
a random 10 percent sample of 46 patents; in this sample, 45 patents can be uniquely matched. 23 of 1,343 German
patents with US application dates are for chemicals; 505 are by US nationals, 69 are by Germans, and 49 by
nationals from 8 other countries.

patent is assigned to one single primary field and may be assigned to one or more additional cross-reference fields,
which patent examiners use to identify related technology fields. See Lampe and Moser (2014) for a detailed
discussion.

Notes: In the first two years, renewal fees were 50ℳ per year, roughly $243 2012 dollars using
purchasing power conversions, and $1,340 using income value (Williamson 2014). Beginning in
the third year, renewal fees per year increased by 50ℳ each year, reaching a total of 700ℳ in
the final 15th year of patent life. Patents that were renewed for 5 years or more required
inventors to pay a minimum of 550ℳ in renewal fees, $2,670 year 2012 dollars using
purchasing power conversions, and $14,700 using income conversions.

Notes: Years renewed are measured at the last year in which a patentee pays the renewal fee
that the GPO required to keep a patent active. Fifty percent of all patents were renewed for 5
years or more; the average patent was renewed for 6 years. Data include the complete renewal
history of 79,591 German patents for chemical inventions with application years between 1900
and 1930. We have collected these data from German-language copies of the Annual Reports of
the GPO between 1901 and 1942.

licensing without patents before 1919. This includes patents by firms that never patented before
and by firms that have patented only after 1919 in other technology fields. Entrants with
previous patents before 1919 are patents by new entrants in fields with licensing that patented in
other chemical fields before 1919.

Notes: Data include all 71,963 applications for patents on chemical inventions between 1900 and 1930, excluding the war
years 1915 to 1918. Subclass with licensed patents is an indicator variable that equals 1 for 101 German fields, in which at
least one US patent became subject to compulsory licensing. The indicator variable post equals 1 for all years after 1918.
The variable licensed patents measures the number of patents that became subject to licensing. Patents by US inventors
controls for the number of patents that the GPO issued to residents of the United States in subclass c and year t; patents by
other foreign inventors controls for the number of patents that the GPO issued to residents of other foreign countries.

Notes: Data include all 39,682 applications for patents on chemical inventions between 1900 and 1930 that were renewed
for a minimum of 5 years. Data on renewal decisions come from archival records of renewed patents from the Annual
Reports of the German patent office between 1901 and 1942. Subclass with confiscated patents is an indicator variable
that equals 1 for 171 German fields in which at least one US patent was confiscated after the TWEA. The indicator
variable post equals 1 for all years after 1918. Confiscated patents measures the number of patents that were seized by US
authorities after the Trading With the Enemy Act in subclass c. Patents by US inventors controls for the number of patents
that the German Patent Office issued to residents of the United States in subclass c and year t; patents by other foreign
inventors controls for the number of patents that the German Patent Office issued to residents of other foreign countries.
