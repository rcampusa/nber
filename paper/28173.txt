                                          ABSTRACT

Tobacco 21 (T-21) laws prohibit the sale of tobacco products to individuals under age 21. This
study is the first to comprehensively examine the impacts of statewide T-21 laws on youth
tobacco consumption, including spillovers to minor teens. Using data from the 2009-2019
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) and a difference-in-differences approach,
we find that the enactment of a statewide T-21 law was associated with a 2.5 to 4.0 percentage-
point decline in smoking participation among 18-to-20-year-olds. A causal interpretation of our
estimates is supported by event-study analyses and falsification tests for young adults ages 21 and
older. Next, using data from the 2009-2019 State Youth Risky Behavior Surveys (YRBS), we
find that statewide T-21 laws reduced tobacco cigarette and electronic cigarette (e-cigarette)
consumption among 18-year-old high school students. We also find that the public health
benefits of T-21 laws extend to 16-to-17-year-olds, a group that relies heavily on the "social
market" -- including 18-year-old peers -- to access tobacco. We conclude increasing the
minimum legal purchasing age for tobacco to 21 appears to be a more effective current policy
strategy to deter youth smoking than raising cigarette taxes.

     "We should do everything we can to prevent young people from smoking and save lives.
     Increasing the tobacco age to 21 will help achieve these goals... Increasing the tobacco
     age to 21 [will also] reduce the likelihood that a high school student will be able to legally
     purchase tobacco products for other students and underage friends."

                                                            -   Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids (2020)


        Tobacco use is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, responsible

for over 480,000 deaths each year (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2019). Its

consumption has been linked to increased risk of heart disease, cancers of the lung, liver, head,

and colon, diminished respiratory function, and stroke (U.S. Department of Health and Human

Services 2014). The social costs of tobacco consumption are substantial, with estimates of the

annual health care costs of treating tobacco-related illnesses totaling $199 billion (2019$) (Hall

and Doran 2016), and estimates of the external costs of smoking -- driven by exposure to

secondhand, or even thirdhand, tobacco smoke -- exceeding $7 billion (USDHHS 2014). 1

        The vast majority of adult smokers initiate tobacco use as minors (Everett 1999; Gilliland

2006), with the mean age of smoking initiation at 15.3 (CDC 2014). Given that youth smokers (i)

may have time-inconsistent preferences that cause them to give insufficient weight to future

costs of addiction (Crettez and Deloche 2020), (ii) often fail to account for the external costs of

smoking when choosing current consumption (O'Donoghue and Rabin 2001), and (iii) typically

obtain tobacco products via the informal social market (Hansen et al. 2013), policymakers have

often targeted anti-smoking campaigns at youths (Lantz et al 2000).

  The Department of Health and Human Services (2014) reports an estimate of $5.6B in 2006$, which we adjust
with the CPI to $7.1B in 2019$. The Hall and Doran (2016) report tobacco-related illness treatment costs of $170B
in 2010$, which we adjust to $199B in 2019$.

                                                        1
         Anti-smoking efforts of the 1990s and 2000s typically included increases in state

cigarette excise taxes (Hansen et al. 2017, Carpenter and Cook 2008), enactment of clean indoor

air laws (Chaloupka and Eriksen 2008), and restrictions or bans on tobacco advertising

(Schroeder 2004). While these policies were largely successful in achieving their intended ends

(CDC 2012), there is growing evidence that policy instruments may be less effective than they

once were. For example, post-2007 increases in state excise taxes on cigarettes have had very

little effect on adult and youth tobacco use (Anderson et al. 2020; Callison and Kaestner 2014;

Carpenter and Simone 2020; Hansen et al. 2017). 2 This may be because today's marginal

smoker is less price sensitive than the marginal smoker of prior decades, in part due to the

success of prior tobacco control efforts (Hansen et al. 2017). Younger smokers may also be

partially insulated from tobacco control policies because they rely on older peers for access to

cigarettes via third-party purchases or bumming cigarettes (Hansen et al. 2013).

         Finally, electronic cigarettes (e-cigarette) have rapidly emerged as an alternative nicotine

source to traditional cigarettes for an increasing number of teenagers (Creamer et al. 2019;

Cullen et al. 2019; Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; 2019). The wide availability of

e-cigarettes has caused policymakers to play "catch-up" in regulating this fast-emerging market

(Huang et al. 2019: Jankowski et al. 2017) through enactment of minimum legal purchasing ages

for e-cigarettes (Friedman 2015; Abouk and Adams 2017), e-cigarette taxes (Cotti et al. 2020;

Pesko et al. 2019), and bans on e-cigarette advertising (Dave et al. 2019). However, by changing

relative prices of e-cigarettes and "traditional" tobacco cigarettes, such strategies may also have




2
 This is despite the increase variation in cigarette taxes in later years which should make identifying cigarette tax
elasticities easier than before (Lillard et al. 2013). This may be because anti-smoking policies of prior decades were
effective at removing those with relatively elastic cigarette demand for from the market, leaving only "hard core
smokers" whose smoking behavior is far more difficult to change through tax increases (Courtemanche and Feng
2019; Hansen et al. 2017).

                                                          2
unintended consequences, including substitution toward cigarettes (Dave et al. 2019; Pesko et al.

2020; Friedman 2015), which may generate worse health outcomes (Viscusi 2016).

        In an attempt to more comprehensively limit youth access to tobacco -- which could

generate large health benefits by preventing long-run nicotine addiction -- tobacco control

advocates prioritized advancing Tobacco 21 (T-21) laws. T-21 laws raise the minimum legal

purchasing age (MLPA) for all tobacco products, including e-cigarettes, to 21. 3 These laws

enjoy the support of the American Medical Association (Parks 2016), the American Academy of

Pediatrics (AAP 2015), the American Public Health Association (Lowry 2019), the Institutes of

Medicine (National Academy of Medicine 2015), the American Heart Association (AHA 2019),

the American Cancer Society (ACS 2020), and the American Lung Association (ALA 2020). T-

21 laws also enjoy support among the vast majority of the American public, including smokers.

Seventy-four percent of U.S. adults, including 64 percent of current smokers and 74 percent of

former smokers, support raising the MLPA for all tobacco products to 21 (Gallup 2019).

        Most adult smokers began experimenting with cigarettes prior to age 14 (Centers for

Disease Control and Prevention 2020). However, the period between age 18 and 20 appears to

be a critical window on the path of addiction. While only 46 percent of adult smokers become

everyday smokers prior to age 18, nearly 80 percent do so prior to age 21 (USDHHS 2014).

Delaying the age at which a youth transitions from experimental or sporadic tobacco

consumption to more frequent use may reduce the risk of everyday use and increase successful

quitting attempts (Khudar et al. 1999). Thus, statewide T-21 laws may postpone tobacco




3
 The 1992 Synar Amendment set the Federal minimum legal age of access to 18 years. By 1993, all states had
changed their minimum legal sales age to 18 or 19 years (Alabama, Alaska, and Utah; New Jersey raised their
MLPA to 19 in 2005).

                                                       3
exposure to age groups that are particularly vulnerable to the addictive effects of nicotine

(Bonnie 2015).

        While a number of municipalities have experimented with minimum legal purchasing

ages for tobacco of 19 and 21 (American Non-Smokers' Rights Foundation 2020), the localized

nature of these mandates allows young adults a relatively low cost means of circumventing these

laws by traveling to a nearby jurisdiction without such mandates (Friedman and Wu 2019).

Statewide mandates were introduced, in part, to reduce such spillovers. Hawaii became the first

state to implement a statewide T-21 law on January 1, 2016. 4 California soon followed on July

9, 2016, followed by 15 additional states by December 19, 2019. 5 On December 20, 2019,

President Donald J. Trump signed the "Tobacco to 21 Act," which created an MLPA of 21 for all

tobacco products sold nationwide. While the Federal T-21 law was largely a triumph for tobacco

control policy, many public health experts remained alarmed that the legislation failed to regulate

the sale of flavored vaping products (Howard 2019).

        Proponents of T-21 laws have argued that these mandates will generate substantial public

health benefits. The National Academy of Medicine (2015) forecast that a national T-21 law

would result in "approximately 223,000 fewer premature deaths, 50,000 fewer deaths from lung

cancer, and 4.2 million fewer years of life lost for those born between 2000 and 2019." These

public health benefits may arise not only by reducing direct access to tobacco products among

18-20-year-olds, but also by drying up the informal "social market" on which minor teens

heavily rely for access to tobacco products. For instance, Hansen et al. (2013) document that 77




4
  Needham, Massachusetts was the first town to enact a T-21 law (Reynolds 2019), followed by over 540 cities and
counties (Preventing Teen Addiction 2020).
5
  New Jersey enacted a statewide Tobacco 21 law in 2017; Oregon, Maine, and Massachusetts enacted such laws in
2018, and Virginia, Illinois, Delaware, Arkansas, Washington, Maryland, Vermont, Texas, Connecticut, New York,
and Ohio enacted in 2019. The Federal law raising the MLPA to 21 was signed into law on December 20, 2019.

                                                       4
percent of 16-to-17-year-old smokers obtain their cigarettes via the social market (i.e., third-

party purchase, bumming or borrowing, stealing, or some other way). 6 Many third-party

purchasers and tobacco lenders (i.e., those who allow minors to "bum" a cigarette or "borrow" a

vaping pen) may be 18-year-old peers (Ahmad 2005; Chen 2014; Hansen et al. 2013). 7 Local,

state, and federal policymakers have explicitly argued that T-21 policy is an important tool to

reduce minor teenagers' access to tobacco, especially e-cigarettes. For instance, Senate Majority

Leader Mitch McConnell (R-KY) stated:



         "The most serious threat involves the use of vaping devices for teens under 18 years old.
         Far too often, 18-year-olds, who are still in high school and can legally buy vaping devices,
         are sharing them with their younger classmates and the problem isn't only high schoolers.
         In 2018, there was a nearly 50% increase of middle school students vaping throughout the
         country. Raising the age limit to 21 presents fewer opportunities for children to get their
         hands on vaping devices."
                                                                         -   Senator Mitch McConnell (2019)



In addition to reducing minors' access to the informal social market, T-21 laws are expected to

reduce the likelihood that minor teens who initiate smoking will be able to falsely identify

themselves as meeting the MLPA (Delnovo and Steinberg 2013). Finally, by requiring a

common MLPA for all tobacco products, T-21 laws avoid the unintended consequence of

inducing substitution between traditional cigarettes and e-cigarettes.

         On the other hand, opponents of T-21 laws argue that such mandates will be ineffective

in deterring youth tobacco use (Males 2016) and would impose limits on individuals'

 This number is reported from the 1995-2009 State Youth Risk Behavior Surveys (Hansen et al. 2013).
7
 Moreover, because many 18-year-olds attend high school with minors, reducing smoking among 18-year-olds
could generate positive spillover effects to minors via behavioral role-modeling (Everett, 1999; Azagba et al., 2015).

                                                          5
consumption freedoms (Bergal 2017). They argue that at age 18 an American can vote, go to

war, be responsible for contracts, and be tried as an adult in a court of law; thus, 18-to-20-year-

olds should be trusted to make tobacco consumption decisions (Stroud 2016). 8 In addition, some

opponents argue that T-21 laws would have adverse fiscal consequences by reducing state

tobacco tax revenues (Bergal 2015) and have adverse distributional effects by causing

disproportionate profit losses for locally owned small convenience stores (Mensik 2018). 9

         This study is the first to comprehensively examine the impact of statewide T-21 laws

adopted nationwide on youth and young adult smoking. First, using data from the 2009-2019

Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance Survey (BRFSS) and a difference-in-differences approach,

we find that the enactment of a T-21 law led to a 4.0 percentage-point decline in prior 30-day

smoking participation among 18-to-20-year-olds. A number of descriptive tests of the common

trends assumption -- including event-study analyses, falsification tests among young adults ages

21 and older, and difference-in-difference-and-differences models that control for full state-by-

year interactions -- provide support for a causal interpretation of these findings. Supplemental

evidence also suggests that T-21 laws have reduced electronic cigarette use among 18-to-20-

year-olds, suggesting that these laws reduce consumption of multiple types of tobacco products.

         Our results uncover substantial heterogeneity in the effects of T-21 laws by respondent's

demographic and socioeconomic characteristics. We find T-21 laws have a larger bite on

smoking behavior for (i) 18-year-olds as compared to 19-to-20-year-olds, (ii) males as compared




8
  Moreover, some opponents argue that because tobacco use does not generate cross-state travel-related externalities
of young adult alcohol use (i.e., drunk driving-related accidents), tobacco should be less regulated (Stroud 2016).
9
  In 1986, a Phillip Morris strategy brief stated "[R]aising the legal minimum age for cigarette purchaser to 21 could
gut our key young adult market (17-20) where we sell about 25 billion cigarettes and enjoy a 70 percent market
share" (Morris 1986). However, tobacco companies did support T-21 perhaps to avoid regulation of flavored
tobacoo products (Myers 2019).

                                                          6
to females, (iii) African Americans as compared to whites, and (iv) high school dropouts as

compared to with a high school degree or more (or who were still attending high school).

       Next, turning to the 2009-2019 State Youth Risky Behavior Surveys (YRBS), we find

that T-21 laws are associated with a 3.9 percentage-point reduction in tobacco cigarette use

among 18-year-old high school students, and a 13.7 percentage-point decline in electronic

cigarette use among 18-year-old high school students. Importantly, we find that T-21 laws

appear to reduce tobacco cigarette use among 16-to-17-year-old high school students, an age

group that often relies on 18-year-olds for "social sources" of tobacco (i.e. borrowing/bumming,

third-party purchase). Moreover, we also present early descriptive evidence on how T-21 laws

appear to disrupt the sources teens use for e-cigarettes, reducing access to social markets for 16-

17-year-old males and decreasing direct purchase for 18 year-olds (these questions on social

sources were only recently asked in 2017/2019). Finally, we find that 13-to-15-year-olds, who

have fewer social ties to 18-year-olds, are largely unaffected by T-21 laws. Together, our

findings suggest that statewide T-21 laws substantially reduce tobacco consumption among

young adults and older minor teenagers. Given mounting evidence that modern cigarette tax

increases have become less effective in curbing youth and young adult smoking (Hansen et al.

2017; Carpenter and Simone 2020), our findings point to a potentially more effective modern

tobacco control policy.



                                          2. Background

       Tobacco control legislation -- including tobacco taxes and minimum legal purchasing

ages -- has long been a subject of debate amongst U.S. policymakers, dating back well before

the Surgeon General's 1964 warning of the adverse health effects of tobacco consumption. The



                                                 7
first federal excise tax was proposed on "snuff" products in 1791 by Alexander Hamilton (Ali

and Koplan 2010), cigarette taxes were first levied in 1864 (Smith 1914). By 1921, 5 states had

completely banned the sale of cigarettes, beginning with South Dakota in 1895 (Alston et al.

2002). 10

        In 1883, New Jersey became the first state to enact a law that established a minimum

legal purchasing age for tobacco (MLPA), setting it at sixteen (16) years old (Appolonio and

Glants 2016). Three years later, New York followed suit and established an MLPA for tobacco

purchasing and consumption of 16 (Appolonio and Glants 2016). As concerns over children

smoking grew nationwide, 26 states established an MLPA for tobacco by 1890, with those

restrictions ranging between 14 to 24 years old. By 1920, all but two states had passed a law

enforcing a tobacco MLPA, with at least 14 states having set their age restriction at 21 years old

or greater. 11

        From the 1950s to the late 1960s, many states lowered their tobacco MLPA as a result of

lobbying efforts from the tobacco industry (Appolonio and Glants 2016). Massachusetts and

Oregon unsuccessfully attempted to raise their MLPA to 21-years-old in 1963, a year in which

five states had pending legislation to lower their MLPAs from 21- to 18-years-old. 12. By 1971,

only three states still had laws in place enforcing an MLPA of 21 years old (Tobacco Merchants

Association 1971), and none by the 1980s.

        In 1985, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services considered a nationwide

tobacco MLPA as a part of a broader tobacco control plan, with the American Medical

Association recommending an MLPA of 21-years-old (Appolonio and Glants 2016). Eventually



10
   By 1927, all of these laws had been repealed.
11
   Ohio and Rhode Island were the last two states to enact an MLA, establishing them in 1939.
12
   Utah lowered their MLA to 19 years old.

                                                        8
this effort led to the Synar Amendment. Adopted in 1992, this law mandated states enforce a

statewide MLPA of 18 years old in order to receive federal funding from the Substance Abuse

and Mental Health Services Administration (DiFranza and Dussalt, 2005). 13 While the Synar

Amendment has been credited with reductions in youth smoking nationwide (Ahmed et al.

2019), tobacco control advocates have suggested a further increase to age 21.

        In April 2005, the town of Needham, Massachusetts became the first municipality to

enact legislation raising the MLPA of tobacco to 21 years old, creating the first modern

"Tobacco 21" law. Several other municipalities enacted similar laws leading up to New York

City's adoption of a Tobacco 21 policy on May 18, 2014. The National Academy of Medicine

released a report in 2015 that estimated raising the MLPA of tobacco to 21 years old would

reduce adult smoking prevalence in the United States by 12 percent, a study cited by many state

policymakers as evidence in support of adopting a T-21 policy (Bergal 2017; Aliferes 2016).

        The motivation for T-21 mandates from the public health community stems from several

arguments. First, tobacco is significantly less addictive when first initiated at later ages (Azagba

et al. 2015; Laux 2000; Everett et al. 1999) and the 18-20 age window may be a particularly

precarious time for addiction onset (Hegmann et al. 1993; Khuder et al. 1999). 14 Second, e-

cigarette usage among teenagers has dramatically increased over the last decade (Centers for

Disease Control and Prevention 2019). While a number of policies aimed at reducing e-cigarette

consumption (i.e. minimum legal purchasing ages, e-cigarette taxes, and advertising bans) have



13
   Alabama and Utah kept their MLAs of 19, while Alaska chose to adopt an MLA of 19 following the passage of
the Synar Amendment.
14
   There is an extensive literature documenting tobacco consumption's propensity for physical and mental addiction
(Hatsukami et al. 2008; Jha et al. 2006; Addicott 2020), with a substantial number of studies finding that tobacco
may be more addictive the earlier in life that it is initiated (Laux 2000). For instance, Everett (1999) found that
among college students who reported daily smoking, 81 percent had first initiated smoking before they were 18
years old. In a study of high schoolers in Canada, Azagba et al. (2015) found that each year of delaying smoking
initiation lowered thse likelihood of developing a daily smoking habit by 24 percent.

been effective at deterring e-cigarette use (Abouk and Adams 2017; Dave et al 2019, Durta et al

2018), they also may have the unintended consequence of inducing substitution toward

"traditional cigarettes (Caponnetto et al. 2015; Friedman 2015; Pesko et al 2016; Dave et al.

2019; Pesko & Currie 2019). A comprehensive T-21 law might be expected to avoid this inter-

tobacco product substitution. Third, public health advocates argue that increasing the MLPA for

tobacco to 21 would dry up the social market through which many adolescent and teen smokers

have obtained tobacco (Hansen et al. 2013). 15

         The nascent literature on the effectiveness of T-21 laws falls into two categories: (i)

studies of local (i.e. municipal) T-21 laws (Schneider et al. 2016; Silver et al. 2016; Friedman et

al. 2019; Friedman and Wu 2020), and (ii) case studies of a single state's T-21 law (Schiff et al.

2016; Boettiger and White 2020). Many are descriptive case studies with pre-post comparisons

focused on particular cities (Schneider et al. 2016; Silver et al. 2016). 16

         A key insight from higher quality municipal-level studies of local T-21 policies (see, for

example, Friedman et al. 2019 and Friedman and Wu 2020) is that local T-21 policies are

accompanied with substantial "leakage" or spillovers. For instance, Friedman and Wu (2020)

conclude if a T-21 policy only partially covered a metropolitan/micropolitan statistical areas

(MMSs), the estimated decline in smoking attributed to local T-21 policies was approximately 60

percent smaller (in absolute magnitude) than that observed for a T-21 policy that covered the full

MMSA. This finding suggests that many young adult smokers avoid local MLPAs by traveling

   Following the passage of a Tobacco 21 mandate in Texas in September 2019, Rep. John Zerwas stated, "it's a very
powerful thing to move tobacco products and these e-cigarettes away from susceptible adolescents who can become
very quickly addicted." (Price 2019).
16
   These studies generally do not conduct appropriate statistical inference with one treated unit, such as placebo-type
tests (Buchmueller et al. 2011).

                                                          10
to neighboring jurisdictions without such laws, resulting in smaller city or county-level policy

effects relative to those enacted at the state or national level.

         A handful of other studies have focused on case studies of a particular state's T-21

policy. 17 Yan (2014) studies a T-21 policy adopted in Pennsylvania between June 1992 and July

2002 to explore the impact of this law on maternal smoking and infant health. 18 Using data from

the restricted Natality Detailed File from 1992 to 2002 and a regression discontinuity design

(RDD), he finds that Pennsylvania's Tobacco 21 law reduces smoking among pregnant mothers.

Yan's results also reveal that Pennsylvania's increase of the tobacco purchasing age lead to a 1.5

percent decline in the incidence of low birth weight of all mothers, and a 2.7 percent decline

among smoking mothers 19

         While suggestive that T-21 restrictions could be effective today, this study also has a

number of limitations. First, the T-21 policy for Pennsylvania was enacted prior to growth in the

market for e-cigarettes. Secondly, the external validity of their research is limited due to their

sample consisting entirely of pregnant mothers in Pennsylvania. Moreover, the first stage effects

identified might be biased based on incentives to report illegal maternal smoking. Lastly, the

first stage effects might be compromised as the regression discontinuity approach is essentially

asking whether pregnant mothers in the final days of their pregnancy disproportionately initiate

smoking at age 21.




17
   Schiff et al. (2020) uses a before-after estimator to study California's statewide T-21 law in southern California.
Boettiger and White (2020) use a synthetic control approach to study the joint effects of California's T-21 law and a
subsequently enacted cigarette tax hike and find evidence that cigarette prices rose and sales fell after both policies
were enacted.
18
   Pennsylvania's mandate stated it was illegal to sell or furnish a tobacco product to any minor below age 21, also
making it illegal to place a tobacco vending machine anywhere accessible by someone under the age of 21.
19
   In order to avoid confounding the effects of granting legal access to drinking with smoking at the cutoff age of 21
years old, the author conducts the analysis both before and after the policy change in order to establish a baseline
effect.

                                                          11
         This study offers the first evidence of the impact of statewide T-21 laws adopted

nationwide on young adult smoking. 20 Statewide T-21 laws are harder to avoid by cross-border

shopping (requiring out of state travel instead of within-state travel) and cover much larger

shares of the state population than municipal laws studied by prior authors. Second, this study is

the first to explore the impact of T-21 laws on minors, who are explicitly targeted by T-21

policies because 18-year-olds are viewed as an important "social source" for cigarettes. Third,

we are the first study to analyze how a statewide T-21 law affects electronic cigarette use, whose

use has exploded with JuuL's entry into the (e-cigarette) tobacco market (FDA 2018). Fourth,

this study is the first to study the impact of any T-21 law on frequent and everyday smoking,

which capture more addictive tobacco use. Fifth, this study is the first to descriptively explore

the mechanisms through which T-21 laws may operate, in particular through teens' use of the

social market for tobacco (i.e., third party purchase and borrowing). Finally, given that our study

considers a window close to the recent Federal "Tobacco to 21 Act" and considers statewide

policies rather than local ordinances, our estimates likely represent local average treatment

effects (LATEs) which are most relevant for considering the likely impact of the new Federal T-

21 law. 21




20
   While not specifically examining a T-21 policy, Yörük and Yörük (2016) use an RDD to study the effect of a
minimum legal purchasing age for tobacco of 18 on tobacco consumption. Using nationally representative data
from the 1998 to 2004 National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997, they find that granting legal access to tobacco
at age 18 nationwide increases the probability of smoking participation by 1.9 to 2.9 percentage points and an
increase on the number of cigarettes smoked per day of 3.7 to 6.5 percent. This study, while having important
findings, does have limitations, the primary one being the difficulty of disentangling the effect on smoking behavior
of granting legal tobacco access at 18 years old from the other significant "life changes" that occur at that age;
including the rights to vote, apply for credit, or sign a legal contract. Another significant change likely to be
happening in months leading up to or following an individual's 18th birthday is the completion of high school,
which often means individuals will start working full time or begin college in the bandwidth around the cutoff of
Yoruk & Yoruk's RDD.
21
   Moreover, evaluating the impact of the Federal T-21 law directly will be quite challenging given that its
implementation was coincidental to the onset of the COVID-19 epidemic in the United States.

                                                     3. Data

3.1 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS)

        The first dataset we employ for our analysis is the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance

System (BRFSS) survey. The BRFSS is a nationally representative telephone survey conducted

annually by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) since 1984. 22 Respondents,

aged 18 and older, are asked questions regarding their health and various health behaviors,

including tobacco consumption. Our analysis sample uses approximately 700,000 individuals

aged 18 to 28 years old from the repeated cross-sections of the BRFSS from 2009 to 2019.

        We use responses from two smoking-related survey items in the BRFSS to create our

three binary variables of interest (Smoking Participation, Everyday Smoking, and Quit):



         "Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your entire life?"

         "Do you now smoke cigarettes everyday, some days, or not at all?"



        Smoking Participation is set equal to 1 if the respondent reports having smoked at least

100 cigarettes in their lifetime and is currently either smoking "everyday" or "some days"; it is

set equal to 0 otherwise. 23 In our sample 12.3 percent of 18-to-20-year-olds were current

smokers (see Table 1A). Between 2009 and 2019, we observe smoking participation for this age

group has declined by 54.2 percent (see Figure 2). For 21-to-23-year-olds, the average smoking

participation rate was 19.3 percent, and for 24-to-28-year-olds, it is 22.7 percent.




22
   The BRFSS has been administered via both landline and cellular phones since 2011; the survey was conducted
only over landline up to that point. When we restrict our analysis sample to the 2011-2019 period, our findings are
quantitatively similar.
23
   One limitation is that we are unable to identify new current smokers who do not report having smoked at least 100
cigarettes in their lifetime, since they are not asked about their current smoking behavior.

                                                        13
        Everyday Smoking is set equal to 1 if a survey respondent reports having smoked at least

100 cigarettes in his/her lifetime and is currently smoking "everyday," and 0 otherwise. For 18-

to-20-year-olds, we find that 7.2 percent of individuals were everyday smokers as compared to

11.9 percent for 21-to-23-year-olds and 14.6 percent for 24-to-28-year-olds. The trends in

everyday smoking depicted in Figure 2 suggest a decline of 66.3 percent among 18-to-20-year-

olds.

        Finally, Quit is set equal to 1 if the survey respondent reports having smoked at least 100

cigarettes in their lifetime currently does not smoke. Quit equals zero if the respondent is

currently smoking either "everyday" or "some days." Thus, the sample for our Quit measure is

the sample of current and former smokers. We find that 24.9 percent of 18-to-20-year-olds had

quit smoking during the sample period. Between 2009 and 2019 (see Figure 2), we find that

quits among 18-to-20-year-olds increased 81.7 percent. Quit rates among 21-to-23-year-olds and

24-to-28-year-olds were higher at 30.3 and 36.9 percent, respectively.



3.2 State Youth Risky Behavior Survey (YRBS)

        The second source of data used for our analysis is the state-level YRBS, a biennial survey

coordinated by the CDC and administered by state education and health agencies, designed to be

representative of all students in grades 9 through 12 in each state. These data are used by

government agencies to follow trends in the behaviors of high school students including physical

activity, mental health, unhealthy eating, sexual activity, and the use of tobacco, alcohol, and

other illicit substances. Our analysis sample covers state YRBS survey waves from 2009 to 2019,

including high school students from 43 states.




                                                 14
         For a majority of the state YRBS surveys, trained data collectors travel to each

participating school to administer the questionnaires. 24 The data collection process is designed

keeping survey respondent privacy in mind by maintaining anonymity and allowing voluntary

participation. Students complete the questionnaire during one class period, recording their

answers in a computer-scannable booklet, while spread out throughout the classroom as much as

possible in order to keep students from seeing each other's answers. When finished with the

survey, student answers are sealed in an envelope and placed in a box.

         We use responses to one question in the YRBS to create three binary variables (Smoking

Participation, Frequent Smoking, and Everyday Smoking) pertaining to smoking status:



         "During the past 30 days, on how many days did you smoke cigarettes?"



Smoking Participation is set equal to 1 if the respondent reports having smoked a cigarette in the

last 30 days, and 0 otherwise; Frequent Smoking is set equal to 1 if the respondent reports having

smoked a cigarette in 20 or more of the last 30 days and 0 otherwise; and Everyday Smoking is

set equal to1 if the respondent has smoked a cigarette every day in the last 30 days and 0

otherwise.

         We find that 18.3 percent of 18-year-olds smoked cigarettes in the last 30 days (see Table

1B). This rate declined during the 2009 through 2019 period from 24.5 to 9.9 percent. For

minor teens ages 16-to-17, we estimate a mean smoking rate of 12.5 and 7.3 percent for 13-to-

15-year-olds.




24
   In some states, the questionnaires are sent directly to schools, and teachers administer the survey following a
standardized script (CDC 2013)

                                                          15
       One advantage of using the State YRBS survey, is that in 2015 they began asking survey

respondents about e-cigarette use. We use responses to one question in the YRBS to create three

binary variables (E-Cigarette Participation, Frequent E-Cigarette Use, and Everyday E-

Cigarette Use) pertaining to e-cigarette usage.



        "During the past 30 days, on how many days did you use an electronic vapor product?"



E-Cigarette Participation is set equal to 1 if the respondent reports having used an electronic

cigarette in the last 30 days, and 0 otherwise; Frequent E-Cigarette Use is set equal to 1 if the

respondent reports having used an electronic cigarette in 20 or more of the last 30 days, and 0

otherwise; Everyday E-Cigarette Use is set equal to 1 if the respondent has used an electronic

cigarette every day in the last 30 days, 0 otherwise.

       We find that 25.8 percent of 18-year-olds used e-cigarettes in the last 30 days (Table 1B),

compared to 21 percent of 16-to-17-year-olds and 20.8 percent of 13-to-15-year-olds. Similarly,

we find that 5 percent of 18-year-olds use e-cigarettes frequently, and 6.2 use them on a daily.

For 16-to-17-year-olds, we find a frequent e-cigarette use rate of 8.0 percent, and a daily use rate

of 3.5 percent.



                                      4. Empirical Methods

4.1 Difference-in-Differences Estimates

       We begin using data from the 2009-2019 BRFSS to estimate the impact of T-21 laws on

tobacco cigarette consumption among 18-to-20-year-olds. We estimate a standard binary logit

model in which an indicator of prior 30-day smoking participation, daily smoking or quit



                                                  16
behavior (among prior smokers), Y, is equal to 1 if an unobserved variable, Y*, is positive. Y* is

related to a set of observable variables and fixed effects by the following equation:



                    = 0 + 1T-21 Lawst + Xist + s + t + ist                                                  (1)



where i indexes survey respondents, s indexes states, t indexes month-by-years, and the

distribution of ist is logistic. 25 Our key right-hand side variable, T-21 Lawst is an indicator set

equal to 1 if a state has a statewide minimum legal purchasing age for tobacco of 21 years and 0

otherwise. In the estimates presented below, local T-21 laws are unaccounted, which is expected

to attenuate our estimate of 1. Our estimates should, therefore, be interpreted as the impact of a

statewide T-21 law over and above existing average state conditions, which could include a share

of local jurisdictions having a T-21 law. In alternate specifications discussed below, we (i) code

T-21 Lawst as the share of the population of state s covered by any T-21 law -- state or municipal

policy for municipalities with population size of at least 10,000 persons) -- in month-by-year t,

and (ii) generate a separate policy variable Local T-21 Lawst, defined as the share of the

population of state s covered by a local T-21 law in month-by-year t, and add this measure as an

additional covariate along with the original statewide-only T-21 Lawst variable.

         In all models, align policy effective dates with the relevant month of the interview (i.e.

tobacco cigarette use measured during the month prior to the interview date). Appendix Table 1

shows effective dates for state T-21 laws and Figure 1 shows the geographic and temporal

variation using a U.S. map.



25
  We explore the robustness of estimated policy impacts obtained from equation (1) to the use of a linear probability
model (LPM). The estimated marginal effects from an LPM are qualitatively similar to those produced with logistic
regression.

                                                         17
         The vector X includes a set of observable individual-level and state-level characteristics.

Among the individual controls are race/ethnicity, gender, age, and age-specific linear time trends

(to allow each aged individual to be on its own smoking trend). In addition, we control for

macroeconomic conditions via state per capita income and the state unemployment rate. To

disentangle the effects of Tobacco-21 laws from other tobacco-related policies, we control for

the state excise tax on cigarettes, clean indoor air laws, whether a state has implemented an

electronic cigarette tax (ad valorem or excise), and whether the state enacted a minimum legal

purchasing age for electronic cigarettes of 18. Finally, we control for policies related to alcohol

and marijuana, which may be substitutes or complements for tobacco: state beer taxes and

indicators for whether the state has implemented a medical marijuana law and a recreational

marijuana law. 26 Means of these descriptive statistics are shown in Table 1. In addition, s is a

time-invariant state effect, and t is a month-by-year effect. All regressions are weighted by

survey weights and standard errors are clustered at the state-level.

         The estimate of our key parameter of interest, 1, is identified from 17 states that enacted

T-21 laws over the sample period. Obtaining an unbiased estimate of 1 will require the

common trends assumption to be satisfied. This assumption will be violated in the presence of

time-varying unobservables correlated with the enactment of Tobacco-21 laws and smoking

behavior among young adults, or reverse causality. We take several tacks to address these

concerns and reduce the likelihood that our estimated policy effects are biased. First, we conduct

event-study analyses to ensure that pre-treatment trends in smoking participation are similar in




26
   Sources for control variables are as follows: state-level unemployment rates (Bureau of Labor Statistics) and
income per capita (Bureau of Economic Analysis), state-level cigarette taxes, e-cigarette MLSA laws and clean
indoor air laws (Centers for Disease Control), state-level e-cigarette taxes and beer taxes (Tax Foundation), state-
level recreational marijuana laws (Marijuana Policy Project), and state-level medical marijuana laws (National
Conference of State Legislatures).

treatment states as compared to control states in the period leading up to the enactment of T-21

laws:

                   j
                                                                                                         (2)



where the subscript j denotes the number of years before and after a state enacts a Tobacco-21

law ("event time"). Each j1 describes the change in smoking participation among 18-to-20-

year-olds in states that enacted T-21 laws compared to those that did not. Specifically, it

involves a differential change from year j relative to the event period j(s,t) = -1, one year prior to

enactment. If pre-treatment trends (up to 4 or more years prior to the enactment of T-21) are

common among "treatment" and "control" states, this would tend to lend support to the claim

that post-treatment breaks in smoking trends were caused by the policy. Out main post-treatment

period examines up to one or more years following adoption of a T-21 law to permit a more

balanced event study, but we also experiment with a less balanced event study that explores up to

two or more years following adoption. 27

        As a second approach to ensure that our estimate of 1 is unbiased, we explore the

sensitivity of our estimates to additional controls for spatial heterogeneity. These include region-

by-year fixed effects to control for common time shocks to states within census regions, thereby

restricting counterfactuals for T-21 states to be geographically proximate states. In addition, we

control for state-specific time trends (of second-order polynomial) to control for within-state

unobservables trends such as anti-smoking sentiment.



27
  A total of 17 states enacted T-21 laws between 2009 and 2019. Of the 17 states that have post-treatment smoking
participation data in the BRFSS, 6 have one or more years of post-treatment data and 3 have two or more years of
post-treatment data.

                                                       19
         Our third approach is to conduct placebo-type tests by estimating "difference-in-

differences" (DD) models identical to equation (1) for older young adults, who should be less

likely to be affected by T-21 laws. Specifically, we examine the impact of T-21 laws on

smoking behavior among 21-to-23-year-olds and 24-to-28-year-olds, each of whom should be

less directly affected by the statutes. We expect that the estimate of 1 for 21-through-28-year-

olds to be much smaller than for our "treatment age" of 18-to-20. However, we do note that

some 21-to-23-year-olds smoking behavior could be affected by T-21 laws with a lag, as

"current" 21-year-old's smoking behavior one year after the implementation of T-21 could have

been affected by T-21 laws when they were 20 years-old. If, for example, a 21-year old whose

state's T-21 law was enacted last year was induced to quit smoking a year ago, then his current

smoking behavior at age 21 may have been affected. Given that no treatment state in our sample

has more than 3 years of post-treatment data, no 24-to-28-year-old should have been impacted at

any point (except through indirect effects via younger peers). 28

         We also estimate a formal "difference-in-difference-in-differences" (DDD) logit model

by pooling a sample of 18-to-20-year-olds and 21-to-23-year-olds (or 24-to-28-year-olds) and

estimating:



         Y*ist = 0 + 1T-21 Lawst + 2Age1820ist + 3T-21 Lawst*Age1820ist + Xist4

                  + Xist*Age1820ist5 + vs + vs*Age1820ist + t + t*Age1820ist + ist.                             (2)



where our DDD estimate 3 is the differential effect of a T-21 laws for 18-to-20-year-olds as

compared to older young adults. Moreover, we also estimate a specification similar to equation


28
   As discussed below, we also attempt an alternate approach where we use state-specific birth cohort to identify
treated individuals and differentiate individuals by length of exposure to the T-21 policy at any point in their lives.

                                                           20
(2) where we include a full set of state-by-year fixed effect interactions, which will control for

any unmeasured common shocks that affected 18-to-20-year-olds and older young adults.

Together, we expect the above descriptive tests to lend support to the common trends

assumption.

        Next, we turn to the State YRBS survey data, where we estimate a model very similar to

equation (1) for 18-year-old U.S. high school students. The State YRBS sample from 2009

through 2019 is comprised of biennial waves (in odd numbered years). Thus, the time fixed

effect is a wave fixed effect for the survey years 2009, 2011, 2013, 2015, 2017, and 2019. In

addition, the State YRBS allows us to measure electronic cigarette consumption as well as

traditional cigarette consumption. As noted in Appendix Table 1 and Appendix Figure 1, 12

states identify our T-21 law effects in our YRBS-based analysis. 29

        Finally, while our YRBS-based difference-in-differences analysis does not permit an

examination of older young adults as a counterfactual (the data are comprised of U.S. high

school students), we are able to explore spillover effects to minor teens under the age of 18.

Thus, we also estimate equation (1) for 16-to-17-year-olds, who may rely on some 18-year-old

classmates for access to tobacco. We also examine effects of T-21 laws on 13-to-15-year-olds,

who are less likely to be able to access peers around age 18, and thus may be a more appropriate

"placebo" age group.



                                                   5. Results




29
   In the YRBS, our T-21 variable is coded as the share of the year the T-21 law is in effect. Some YRBS-based
studies assume that the school-based surveys are only distributed between January and June of the survey year,
though the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has offered mixed guidance on this point. If we
recode our T-21 variable based on only policies in effect during the first two quarters of the survey year, our
findings are qualitatively similar.

                                                        21
5.1 BRFSS Findings

           Our main BRFSS findings are shown in Tables 2 through 5. The tables report marginal

effects generated from logit models, with standard errors clustered at the state level. All

regressions are weighted using the sampling weight provided by the BRFSS survey.

           We begin in Table 2 by showing logit estimates of the relationship between Tobacco 21

(T-21) laws and tobacco cigarette use among young adults. The first three columns show

"difference-in-differences" estimates for adults ages 18-to-20. These are the individuals who are

directly bound by state T-21 law changes, which raise the minimum legal purchasing age

(MLPA) for tobacco from 18-to-20. Our baseline specification in column (1) includes individual

demographic characteristics (gender, race/ethnicity, age, age-specific time trends), state

macroeconomic conditions (unemployment rate, per capita income), and tobacco policy controls

(per pack excise tax on cigarettes, clean indoor air laws). In this model, we find that T-21 laws

are associated with a 2.5 percentage-point decline in prior 30-day tobacco cigarette use (Panel I).

Relative to the mean smoking participation rate in state-months without T-21 laws, this

represents a 19.7 percent decline in smoking participation among 18-to-20-year-olds. 30 The

addition of controls for electronic cigarette policies (the minimum legal purchasing age for e-

cigarettes and the presence of an e-cigarette tax) in column (2) has little effect on the estimated

effect of T-21 laws on smoking participation. In our fully specified model (column 3, Panel I),

which also includes controls for alcohol and marijuana policies (beer taxes, medical marijuana

laws, and recreational marijuana laws), we find that T-21 laws lead to a 4 percentage-point (31.5

percent relative to the mean) reduction in smoking participation among 18-to-20-year-olds.




30
     The pre-treatment mean is calculated as the weighted mean in treatment states prior to T-21 adoption.

                                                           22
         Information on electronic cigarette use is only available in the 2016-2019 BRFSS

surveys. Nonetheless, in Appendix Table 5 we examine the effect of T-21 laws e-cigarette use

reported in the BRFSS. While imprecisely estimated, we find that T-21 laws reduce e-cigarette

use among 18-to-20-year-olds by 1 to 2 percentage points. This finding is consistent with the

hypothesis that T-21 laws reduce consumption of multiple types of tobacco produces. 31

         What margins of smoking behavior are affected by T-21 laws? It appears that the

reduction in smoking participation likely comes from an increase in quitting behaviors (Panel

III), which is what we might expect given that the vast majority of 18-to-20-year-olds initiate

smoking between ages 13 and 14. While imprecisely estimated because the sample is

conditioned on "ever smokers," we find that T-21 laws are associated with a statistically

insignificant 4.3 to 5.5 percentage-point increase in the probability of quitting smoking (17.5 to

22.4 percent) for 18-to-20-year-olds. Finally, we find that the enactment of a T-21 law reduces

the (unconditional) probability of everyday smoking by 1.6 to 2.4 percentage-points (Panel II),

which could suggest some effect of T-21 laws in the intensive margin (days) of smoking. We

also find evidence T-21 laws reduce everyday smoking, the type of smoking behavior mostly

likely to develop addiction.

         To explore the credibility of the common trends assumption in columns (1) through (3),

we show the results of several diagnostic tests. First, panel (a) of Figure 4 shows results from

our event-study analysis for smoking participation. We find that in the five years prior to the

enactment of T-21 laws, trends in smoking participation in "treatment" and "control" states

appeared to be common, diverging only following with the enactment of T-21 laws.



31
  The BRFSS survey question on electronic cigarettes asks respondents: "Do you now use ecigarettes or other
electronic vaping products every day, some days, or not at all?" We set E-Cigarette Participation equal to 1 if
respondents report every day or some days and 0 otherwise.

                                                         23
        Because state T-21 laws are relatively new, we are limited in examining their long-run

impacts. 32 Moreover, the onset of COVID-19 in 2020 will make it very difficult to disentangle

the effect of the Federal T-21 law from the smoking impacts of COVID-19. With these

limitations in mind, difference-in-differences results suggest that T-21 laws had an immediate

negative effect on smoking participation. When we extend the event study to include two or

more years following enactment (4 states), the results are qualitatively similar (see Appendix

Figure 2).

        Our second test of the credibility of the common trends assumption is to explore the

robustness of our estimated policy impacts to additional controls for state-specific linear time

trends, and region-specific year effects. These controls capture geographic-specific time shocks

that may be related to T-21 enactment and adult smoking (i.e. anti-smoking sentiment), which

may ameliorate bias in our prior estimates. On the other hand, it is not obvious that states within

the same census region comprise better counterfactuals for states that enact T21 laws than non-

geographically proximate states. Moreover, controlling for state linear time trends may (i)

reduce precision in the estimated T-21 effect, and (ii) generate bias in the estimated policy

impact if there are heterogeneous treatment effects among early and later adopters.

Reassuringly, our findings in Appendix Table 6 show that the estimated impact of T-21 laws on

smoking participation is robust to controls for spatial heterogeneity.

        Our final approach to address the common trends assumption is to estimate the impact of

T-21 laws on individuals ages 21 and older who are less likely to be directly affected by these

statutes. In columns (4) through (6) of Table 2, we present logit estimates of the effect of T-21

laws on smoking behavior of 21-to-23-year-olds. While this is a credible placebo group, we note


32
  Of the 17 states enacting T-21 laws over our sample period, only 7 states have post-treatment data a year or more
following enactment. Ten (10) states have post-treatment data only for the year of enactment.

                                                        24
that some 21-to-23-year-olds in Tobacco-21 states were "bound" by the law when they were

younger. And current smoking behavior among 21-to-23-year-olds could have been affected by

prior exposure to a T-21 law. 33

        With these caveats in mind, our results in Panel I show no evidence that T-21 laws affect

smoking participation among 21-to-23-year-olds. The estimated policy impact for 21-to-23-year-

olds is 20 percent smaller than for 18-to-20-year-olds (0.1 to 0.8 percentage-points) and is

nowhere near statistically different from zero. An event-study analysis in panel (b) of Figure 4

also suggests a null result. This result suggests that our smoking participation findings for 18-to-

20-year-olds are not contaminated by unmeasured shocks that commonly affect 18-to-20 and 21-

to-23-year-olds. We also find no evidence that T-21 laws impact everyday smoking or quit

behavior for 21-to-23-year-olds.

        In columns (7) through (9) of Table 2, we examine smoking behavior of 24-to-28-year-

olds. This age group has the advantage that none were bound by any state's T-21 law when they

were younger (i.e., the first state T-21 law was adopted by Hawaii in 2016; thus, the oldest

individual in our sample who was bound by a T-21 law in 2019 was age 23). The main

disadvantage is that this age group is quite a bit older than "treated" individuals and hence may

be a poorer control group.

        Our results show no evidence that T-21 laws affect smoking participation, daily smoking,

or quit behavior among 24-to-28-year-olds. 34 The estimated policy impacts for this age group

are uniformly smaller (in absolute magnitude) as compared to 18-to-20-year-olds.




33
   For example, New Jersey enacted a T-21 law in 2017. Thus, 21-year-olds living in New Jersey in 2018 and 21-
and 22-year-olds living there in 2019 would have been bound by the T-21 law when they were younger.
34
   The event-study analysis in panel (c) of Figure 4 shows no evidence that T-21 laws affect smoking participation
among 24-to-28-year-olds.

                                                        25
         In Table 3, we show results from a "difference-in-difference-in-differences"

specification. This is a test of whether the estimated T-21 law impacts in columns (1)-(3) of

Table 2 are statistically different from the estimates in columns (4)-(6), and then (7)-(9). Our

results in Panel I of Table 3 show that T-21 laws are associated with a statistically significant 3.1

to 4.0 percentage-point (24.4 to 31.4 percent) reduction smoking participation of 18-to-20-year-

olds relative to 21-to-23-year-olds, and a statistically significant 3.4 to 5.0 percentage-point (27.5

to 39.4 percent) reduction smoking participation of 18-to-20-year-olds relative to 24-to-28-year-

olds.

         These logit estimates are comparable to those from linear probability models (Appendix

Table 7) and, importantly, when we augment our "triple-differences" specification with a full set

of state-by-year dummy interactions (to capture any common shocks that may have impacted

smoking behavior of 18-to-20 and 21-to-23-year-olds (Appendix Table 7), we continue to find

that T-21 laws reduce smoking among 18-to-20-year-olds.

         One concern with the above estimates is that some individuals ages 21-to-23-years-old

may be impacted by T-21 laws with a lag. Thus, we attempt an alternate identification strategy

where we pool individuals ages 18-to-28 from 2009 through 2019 (representing birth years 1981

through 2001). Our key "treatment variable" is the interaction of T-21 Law and an indicator for

whether an individual was born in a year such that he/she was aged 18-to-20 (at any time) when

their state had a T-21 law. 35 The results from this exercise, shown in Appendix Table 8 reflect

that smoking participation decreased among 18-to-20-year-olds and individuals who were ages

18-20 when a T-21 law was implemented.


35
  This specification includes both birth cohort and age fixed effects as well as time trends for each, along with each
of our controls. Because the BRFSS do not include mobility data, we are forced to assume that state of residence at
the time of the survey was the same state of residence when they were of age to be affected by a T-21 law (and
similarly for "control" individuals).

                                                          26
         Taken together, the above results provide strong evidence that T-21 laws were effective

at reducing smoking participation among 18-to-20-year-olds. We next turn to an exploration of

heterogeneity in the impacts of T-21 laws by demographic and socioeconomic characteristics of

individuals ages 18-to-20.

         Table 4 explores whether the effects of T-21 laws differ for 18 as compared to 19-to-20-

year-olds. 19-to-20-year-olds are more likely to have 21-year-old peers from whom to access

cigarettes via the social market (i.e. bumming or borrowing, third-party purchase) than are 18-

year-olds, many of whom are still in high school. Our results in Table 4 provide strong evidence

that 18-year-olds see a much larger decline in smoking participation in response to T-21 laws

than 19-to-20-year-olds. We find that T-21 laws are associated with a 7.3 to 12.2 percentage-

point decline in smoking participation among 18-year-olds, and a 2.8 to 3.3 percentage-point

decline in smoking participation among 19-to-20-year-olds. This highlights the potential

differences in the social markets. 19-20 years old are likely either in college or the labor force,

providing them with social networks not subject to the T-21 law. This suggests it's possible that

much of the effective bite of a T-21 law, could potentially be achieved with a T-19 law.

         Together, the estimated effects of statewide T-21 laws presented above are somewhat

larger than have been detected in studies of local T-21 policies. Indeed, for 18-year-olds, we

find T-21 may reduce smoking by as much as 70 percent. This is consistent with higher travel

costs of avoidance associated with a statewide mandate. 36 Moreover, we find little evidence that




36
   In Appendix Tables 2 and 3 we report estimates where we control for local T-21 policies, either through
incorporating local policies (via the share of the state population covered by local policies) into the coding of our
main T-21 policy variable (columns 1-3) or via a separate control alongside our statewide T-21 policy. Our results
show that statewide policies have larger smoking reducing effects than local policies, consistent with more cross-
jurisdiction shopping for local laws.

                                                          27
border state T-21 laws significantly affect the marginal impact of own state T-21 laws on young

adult smoking (see Appendix Table 4). 37

        In Table 5, we explore heterogeneity across an additional set of individual and household

characteristics. The first five columns explore heterogeneity in the impacts of T-21 laws by

gender (columns 1-2) and race/ethnicity (columns 3-5). We find larger (in absolute magnitude)

T-21-induced decreases in smoking participation for males relative to females; moreover, there is

a much larger T-21-induced increase in successful quits for males as compared to females.

Turning to race, we find some evidence that African Americans may be more affected by T-21

laws, especially in percentage-point terms relative to mean smoking rates (which are much lower

for blacks than whites). This larger impact on African Americans could reflect that black

Americans are more likely to face differential race-based enforcement of these laws (i.e., ID

checks) than are others.

        Next in columns (6) and (7), we explore whether the effects of T-21 laws differ by

whether the 18-to-20-year-old has (i) dropped out of high school, or (ii) is currently attending

high school or has received a high school diploma. We find T-21 laws reduce smoking

participation for high school dropouts by 9.8 percentage points and by 3.2 percentage points for

individuals with a high school degree or currently in high school. This result is consistent with

the hypothesis that less-educated individuals are more affected by the policy.

        Finally, in columns (8) and (9), we explore whether T-21 laws differently affect 18-to-20-

year-olds from poor versus non-poor households. The results suggest that T-21 laws decrease




37
  In Appendix Table 4, we explore whether the effect of a statewide T-21 law depends on whether a border state
also has a T-21 law. While the coefficient on the interaction between own state and border state T-21 law is
negative for smoking participation and everyday smoking, it is economically small and never statistically
distinguishable from zero at conventional levels.

                                                       28
smoking participation relatively more poor households than non-poor households; however, for

everyday smoking, the pattern is reversed.



5.2 State YRBS Results

         Tables 6 through 8 show our main findings using the State YRBS data. As above,

standard errors are clustered at the state level, and regressions are weighted to be nationally

representative of 18-year-old high school students. 38

         In Table 6, we explore the effect of T-21 laws on tobacco use of 18-year-old high school

students using State YRBS data from 2009-2019. The first three panels show estimates of the

effect of T-21 laws on smoking participation, frequent smoking (20 or more days in the prior

month), and daily smoking, respectively. Consistent with the results from the BRFSS, we find

that T-21 laws are associated with a statistically significant 3.8 to 4.9 percentage-point (19.6 to

25.4 percent) reduction in smoking participation among 18-year-old high school students. 39 We

find little evidence that frequent or everyday smoking is affected, which again suggests that the

intensive margin of smoking behavior appears to be less affected by T-21 laws.

         In Panels IV through VI, we explore the effect of T-21 laws on electronic cigarette use

among 18-year-olds. As noted above, these data were collected over the 2015-2019 period,

covering the window over which T-21 laws were enacted. While imprecisely estimated, we find

consistent evidence that T-21 reduced e-cigarette use among 18-year-old high school students.

In our most saturated specification we find that T-21 laws are associated with a 13.7 percentage-


38
   We note that the age category available in the State YRBS survey is actually 18+, which does include a very small
share of 19-year-old high school students. Our weight variable is calculated as the product of (i) each state's YRBS-
provided weight (designed to make the state sample representative of the state population of 9th through 12th
graders), rescaled to sum to 1, and (ii) the state-by-year intercensal population estimate of 18-year-olds from the
Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program.
39
   In Appendix Table 9 we explore the evolution of our smoking participation results in event time. We find
decreases in smoking participation are largest 3 years or more after a state T-21 law.

                                                         29
point decline in prior 30-day e-cigarette consumption, a 6.7 percentage-point decline in frequent

(> 19 days) prior month consumption of e-cigarettes, and 6.8 percentage-point decline in daily e-

cigarette use. While estimated with a very limited panel (the 2015, 2017, and 2019 waves of the

YRBS), the findings in Appendix Figure 3 suggest little evidence that the decline in e-cigarette

use was driven by a differential pre-treatment trend. 40

         Are these results concentrated in particular demographic groups, as we say in the

BRFSS? In Table 7, we show results by gender (columns 1-2) and race/ethnicity (columns 3-

5). 41 In fact, our findings are generally consistent with our BRFSS-based results. The effect of

T-21 laws on smoking behavior is larger for males relative to females and to blacks relative to

whites (though this latter estimate is very imprecisely estimated).

         As discussed above, an important policy rationale for T-21 laws is to reduce minors' (<

18 years-old) tobacco use. Minor teenagers who wish to access cigarettes often rely on 18-year-

old peers to bum or borrow cigarettes or for third-party purchase (Hansen et al. 2013). By

making it more difficult for 18-year-olds to access tobacco, proponents of T-21 laws aim to

reduce minors' tobacco consumption.

         In Table 8, we explore the impact of T-21 laws on tobacco consumption among 16-to-17-

year-olds, an age group that is likely to have access to 18-year-old peers who may attend the

same grade. The first three panels show results for tobacco cigarette consumption and the final

three panels for e-cigarette use. We find evidence of decreased smoking behavior among 16-to-

17-year-olds across all 3 columns, though only column (3) is statistically distinguishable from



40
   In unreported results, we also explore the impact of T-21 laws on cigar use and any tobacco product use
(traditional cigarettes, e-cigarettes, or cigars). For 18-year-olds, we find that T-21 laws are associated with a
(statistically insignificant 7.3 percentage-point (standard error = 0.046) decline in cigar use (sample period = 2009-
2019), and a statistically significant 8.7 percentage-point decline (standard error = 0.036) in any tobacco product use
(sample period 2015-2019).
41
   The YRBS does not include information on household income or poverty.

                                                          30
zero. For e-cigarette behavior, we find evidence that T-21 laws decreased 16-to-17-year-old

participation however these results are not statistically distinguishable from zero by conventional

standards. Importantly, when we examine the effects of T-21 laws on 13-to-15-year-olds, who

have relatively less access to 18-year-old peers, we find little evidence that T-21 laws affect their

smoking behavior (Appendix Table 10).

        Taken together, our YRBS findings (i) are consistent with smoking participation effects

for 18-year-olds in the BRFSS, (ii) suggest that electronic cigarette consumption also declines

following the passage of T-21, and (iii) show that the benefits of T-21 laws extend to 16-to-17-

year-olds, who often rely on 18-year-old classmates for access to the "social market" for e-

cigarettes.



5.3 Descriptive Exploration of Mechanisms

        In our final descriptive analysis, we explore the mechanisms through which state T-21
laws reduce tobacco use among youths. Beginning in the 2017 State YRBS, states began asking
high school students about usual sources of e-cigarette use, the most common type of tobacco
cigarette use at this time. Respondents were asked:


        "During the past 30 days, how did you usually get your own electronic vapor products?"

Among possible responses to this question were:

        "I did not use any electronic vapor products during the past 30 days
        I bought them in a store such as a convenience store, supermarket, discount store, gas
        station, or vape store.
        I got them on the Internet.
        I gave someone else money to buy them for me.
        I borrowed them from someone else.
        A person 18 years old or older gave them to me.
        I took them from a store or another person.
        I got them some other way."



                                                 31
Using responses to this question, we descriptively explore how state T-21 laws affected how 18-

year-old youths obtained e-cigarettes. In panel (a) of Figure 6, we document that between 2017

and 2019, e-cigarette use rose both in states that implemented T-21 laws during this period (from

17.6 to 23.6 percent) and among those states where T-21 laws were not in effect (from 20.6 to

30.8 percent). However, rates rose 4.2 percentage-points more slowly in states that enacted T-21

laws, a difference statistically significantly different from zero at the 1 percent level. When we

decompose e-cigarette users by where they obtained their cigarettes, we find that the biggest

relative decline occurred via direct purchase of e-cigarettes, consistent with state bans on sales

(6.3 percentage point relative decline in treatment versus control states). 42 We find modest

evidence of substitution toward the social market, with T-21 laws associated with a 2.5

percentage-point higher probability of borrowing e-cigarettes. This suggests that some of the T-

21 law effect is offset by 18+ year-olds perhaps accessing older peers for e-cigarette use.

        When we examine males (panel b), who saw the largest e-cigarette declines in response

to T-21 laws (see Table 6), the results are even more stark. We find a larger decline in direct

purchase of e-cigarettes (7.7 percentage-points) for males in T-21 states as compared to control

states, as well as larger increases in borrowing 1.7 percentage-points) and third-party purchase

(1.0 percentage-points). Again, this suggests evidence that some 18-year-olds may turn to

informal social sources for e-cigarettes.

        In panel (c) of Figure 6, we condition the sample on e-cigarette users and examine usual

source of e-cigarettes among vapers. We find strong evidence that direct purchase of e-cigarettes




T
 We group those categories into 5 groups. Participation is defined by the first response. Direct own purchase from a
store is the second possible response. "Third party purchase" corresponds to "I gave someone else money to buy
them for me." "Bumming or borrowing" corresponds to "I borrowed them from some else" or "A person 18 years
old or older gave them to me." We combine internet, stealing, and other into the final category due to their overall
rarity.

                                                        32
fell more in T-21 states after enactment, but also that borrowing e-cigarettes and use of other

sources to obtain cigarettes (i.e., the internet) rose after T-21 laws were adopted. These findings

suggest that peers in the social market may mute the full impact of T-21 laws.

       In columns (1) and (3) of Appendix Table 11, we estimate a multinomial logit model of

the effect of statewide T-21 laws on the usual source by which 18-year-olds typically obtain e-

cigarettes (the omitted outcome category is "non-use"). Consistent with Figure 6, we find

consistent evidence that T-21 laws reduce direct purchase of e-cigarettes among 18-year-olds,

but do lead to some substitution toward borrowing e-cigarettes. For 16-to-17-year-olds (columns

2 and 4), we find that e-cigarette use declines occur for those who typically obtain their

cigarettes via third party purchase or borrowing, consistent with their losing access to 18-year-

old peers as a "social source" for tobacco, though these effects are not statistically

distinguishable from zero.

      The patterns described above is even stronger when we restrict the sample to males, the

demographic group whose e-cigarette was most affected by T-21 laws. In particular, T-21 laws

appear to have had stronger spillover effects on males ages 16-to-17. We find that T-21 laws

were associated with a statistically significant decline in e-cigarette consumption among males

who typically obtain their cigarettes via third-party purchase. This is consistent with T-21 laws

partially "drying up" the social market for tobacco among older minor teens.



                                            6. Conclusion

       This study provides the first national estimates of the effects of statewide T-21 laws on

young adult and minor smoking behavior. First, using data drawn from the 2019-2019 BRFSS

and 2009-2019 State YRBS, we find strong evidence that T-21 laws reduce tobacco use among



                                                 33
young adults. Difference-in-differences estimates from the BRFSS suggest that T-21 laws are

associated with an approximately 4 percentage-point reduction in smoking participation among

18-to-20-year-olds. Event study analyses and falsification tests among older individuals ages 21-

to-28 generate findings consistent with a causal interpretation of our results. Turning to the

YRBS, we find that T-21 laws are associated with reductions in smoking participation and an

even larger reduction in e-cigarette use. Importantly, some of the benefits of T-21 laws appear to

extend to minors ages 16-to-17, suggesting that T-21 laws may help to "dry up" the social

market for tobacco or may create better "role modeling" of healthy behaviors by 18-year-olds.

       Our results suggest that statewide T-21 laws have had important beneficial public health

effects, which could suggest that the Federal T-21 law, signed into law by President Trump in

late December 2019, will have important impacts in non-adopting states. Moreover, to the extent

young smokers are more likely to have time-inconsistent preferences (Gruber and Koszegi 2001)

or are more impacted by exogenous peer effects (Robalino and Macy 2018), T-21 restrictions

may enhance social welfare. However, providing direct evidence on the effects of the Federal T-

21 policy will be extremely challenging for future scholars given the coincident timing of the

Federal change with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have substantial effects

on tobacco use given the link between respiratory illness and COVID-19-related mortality

(Nowakowski 2020). Thus, the evidence provided in this study is likely to be far less

contaminated than studies trying to disentangle policy from the 2020 pandemic.

       At present, only a handful of other countries currently have T-21 laws: Ethiopia,

Honduras, Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Uganda (Tobacco Control Laws 2020). In considering the

external validity of our estimates, the United States has far lower smoking rates than other




                                                34
OECD countries (Greenhalg et al 2015). Thus, the comparative health benefits of effective T-21

laws in countries with higher rates of youth smoking may be larger.

       More generally, the effects of T-21 laws may also depend upon other policies which

interact with T-21 laws, including local tobacco prices. Moreover, most states and cities

routinely use auditing programs to verify compliance with age restrictions. The level of

compliance might vary depending on the size of local markets, the risk of audits, and the ensuing

fines. Avoidance may take other forms as well. Prior research has demonstrated cross-state

border shopping or using the internet to avoid local sales taxes (Merriman 2010; Goolsbee et al.

2010). With regard to T-21, we might expect youth to use technology and false IDs to avoid

laws that restrict access to tobacco. Indeed, while the "terms and conditions" of many tobacco-

selling websites state they expect people purchasing products to be over 21, most do not ask for

proof of age. This may reduce the effective shadow price of these laws in the United States, and

in other countries where T-21 laws may be implemented in the future.

       Finally, while T-21 laws may be perceived as a public health success, it appears to have

come at a cost. Many have argued that U.S.-based tobacco companies endorsed T-21 legislation

to avoid regulation of flavored tobacco products (Myers 2019). Revealed preference by such

firms would suggest the benefits of the high MLPA likely came at the expense of continued

unregulated flavored e-cigarettes. This even more apparent with the explosion of e-cigarette use

rates among youth, which some have attributed to JuuL products containing high nicotine

content, appealing flavors, and the ability to easily be concealed (FDA 2018).

       Tobacco companies may have been willing to lose sales from 18-to-20-year-old smokers

in the hope of retaining additional current and future smokers through flavored e-cigarettes. The

Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement (MSA) is over two decades old. Just as a dramatic shift



                                                35
from traditional cigarette sales to e-cigarette sales has occurred, advertising and targeting to

youth has evolved to incorporate social media and distribution has shifted to online markets.

With this in mind, for T-21 laws to have maximum benefits in the long run, public health experts

and policymakers will need to be better understand the types of new tobacco regulations or

restrictions that might complement these laws intended to limit access at the lowest social cost.
