                                              ABSTRACT


        We examine measures of environmental regulatory activity (inspections and enforcement

actions) and levels of air and water pollution at approximately 300 U.S. pulp and paper mills, using data

for 1985-1997. We find that levels of air and water pollution emissions are affected both by the benefits

from pollution abatement and by the characteristics of the people exposed to the pollution. The results

suggest substantial differences in the weights assigned to different types of people: the benefits received

by out-of-state people seem to count only half as much as benefits received in-state, although their

weight increases if the bordering state’s Congressional delegation is strongly pro-environment. Some

variables are also associated with greater regulatory activity being directed towards the plant, but those

results are less consistent with our hypotheses than the pollution emissions results. One set of results

was consistently contrary to expectations: plants with more nonwhites nearby emit less pollution. Some

of our results might be due to endogenous sorting of people based on pollution levels, but an attempt

to examine this using the local population turnover rate found evidence of sorting for only one of four

pollutants.

         ‘Optimal’ Pollution Abatement – Whose Benefits Matter, and How Much?




                                       1. INTRODUCTION



        In this paper we examine the optimal allocation of environmental regulation across pulp

and paper mills. The optimal allocation depends on the costs and benefits of pollution abatement

at the plant, as seen by the regulator. The direct costs of pollution abatement at a particular plant

are related to the plant’s age, size, and technology, while the benefits are related to the extent of

the pollution being generated and the number of people affected. Past studies comparing

benefits and costs have focused on fairly simple measures of abatement benefits. In this study

we develop more sophisticated measures of air and water benefits from pollution abatement

based on the SLIM-3 Air Dispersion Model and the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA)

National Water Pollution Control Assessment Model (NWPCAM) respectively. We expect that

regulators should impose stricter regulation on plants located in areas with greater benefits from

pollution abatement. However, we also consider political factors that may influence the

allocation of pollution abatement. The focus of our paper is on spatial differences across plants

in the distribution of benefits from pollution abatement and in the characteristics of the

population living nearby. Responding to some of these population measures may be socially

optimal if certain population groups are more sensitive to pollution, but in many cases these

measures suggest self-interested behavior by regulators seeking to maximize the political support

for their actions.

        We perform our analyses using a plant-level panel data set on approximately 300 pulp

and paper mills from 1985-1997. We find substantial supporting evidence for both benefits and

                                                  1
population characteristics affecting environmental outcomes. Plants with larger benefits to the

overall population emit less air and water pollution, and those with more kids and elders nearby

emit less air pollution. Plants located in poor neighborhoods get less regulatory attention and

emit more pollution. Plants located near state boundaries emit more pollution, with these effects

reduced if the nearby states have more pro-environment Congressmen. Not every result fits

those predicted by theory: the percentage nonwhite near the plant, expected to reduce regulatory

attention (assuming nonwhites have less political clout), is actually associated with lower

emissions. The results for our measures of regulatory activity tend to be less often significant,

and sometimes carry unexpected signs.

       One important caveat on our results is the cross-sectional nature of our demographic data.

Some of the results could be explained as reverse causation or sorting: poor people move

towards dirty neighborhoods because housing is cheaper there; families with sensitive

individuals such as kids and elders avoid dirty neighborhoods. It is difficult for us to control for

such endogeneity because most paper mills are very old, so we cannot include pre-siting

demographics in the analysis. Our attempt to test for sorting (using the degree of population

turnover near the plant) finds significant evidence in favor of sorting for only one of the four

pollutants (particulates), while the two water pollutants find significant evidence against sorting.



       Some of the differences in results for different regulatory measures pose further research

questions. There is a pattern of unexpected signs for regulatory actions, where factors associated

with fewer regulatory actions are often associated with less, not more, pollution. We would have

expected opposite signs on these coefficients, and do find opposite signs in some cases. Is this

an artifact of the data, or does it represent a real difference in the process by which regulatory


                                                  2
activity is allocated in different situations? Similarly, we find different effects on air and water

pollution of being near the Canadian border: do these reflect real differences across pollution

media in the mechanisms for ensuring international cooperation on pollution control?

       The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 provides a brief survey of

the relevant literature. In section 3 we provide some background on the pulp and paper industry.

Section 4 outlines our model of the regulator’s allocation of pollution abatement across plants.

In section 5 we present our empirical methodology and a description of our data. Section 6

contains our results and finally we present some concluding remarks and possible extensions in

section 7.



                                     2. PREVIOUS STUDIES

       A few studies have addressed the issues raised above, providing empirical estimates of

the impact of political boundaries, demographics, and political activism on exposure to pollution.

For example, Helland and Whitford (2001), using annual county-level data from the Toxic

Release Inventory (1987-1996), find that facilities located in counties on state borders (border

counties) have systematically higher air and water pollution releases than facilities located in

non-border counties: facilities in border counties emit 18 percent more air pollution and 10

percent more water pollution than facilities in non-border counties. Kahn (1999) also finds some

evidence of a transboundary externality problem with particulates. Kreisel et al (1996) find that

minorities are not disproportionately exposed to TRI emissions, but find some evidence that the

poor are disproportionately exposed to TRI emissions. Arora and Cason (1999) find evidence of

racial injustice only in the south. In particular, Arora and Cason find that race is a significantly

positive determinant of TRI releases in non-urban areas of the south.


                                                  3
        Hamilton (1993, 1995) examines whether exposure to environmental risk varies by

demographics and political activism. Using data at the ‘zip-code neighborhood level,’ he relates

the capacity expansion/contraction decisions of commercial hazardous waste facilities to race,

income, education, and level of political activity (voter turnout), finding that capacity expansions

are negatively correlated with voter turnout. Jenkins, Maguire, and Morgan (2002) show that

minority communities receive lower ‘host’ fees for the siting of land fills while richer

communities receive higher ‘host’ fees. Wolverton (2002) examines the issue of the location

decision of ‘polluting’ plants. Previous studies indicate that ‘polluting’ plants tend to locate in

poor and minority neighborhoods. However, Wolverton shows that once you consider the

characteristics of the community at the time the plant is sited that contrary to popular opinion

race no longer matters and that poor neighborhoods actually attract disproportionately less

‘polluting’ plants.1



                        3. PULP AND PAPER INDUSTRY BACKGROUND

        During the past 30 years environmental regulation has increased considerably both in

terms of stringency and levels of enforcement. In the late 1960s environmental rules were

primarily enacted at the state level, and were not vigorously enforced. Since the creation of the

Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the early 1970’s the federal government has been the

lead player in proposing and developing stricter regulations, and in encouraging greater

emphasis on enforcement (much of which is still performed by state agencies, following federal

guidelines). The expansion in environmental regulation has imposed large costs on traditional


1
  Been (1994) and Been and Gupta (1997) find mixed results for environmental injustice in the citing of hazardous
waste facilities when considering the characteristics of the neighborhood at the time of citing – however, their
results are based on data sets with only 4 and 10 observations respectively.

                                                        4
‘smokestack’ industries, like the pulp and paper industry, which is one of the most impacted

industries due to its sizable generation of both air and water pollution.

           The pulp and paper industry as a whole faces a high degree of environmental regulation.

However, plants within the industry can face very different impacts from regulation, depending

in part on the technology being used (pulp and integrated mills vs. non-integrated mills2), the

plant's age, the plant’s location, and the level of regulatory effort directed at the plant. The most

important determinant of the regulatory impact is whether or not the plant contains a pulping

process. Pulp mills begin with raw wood (chips or entire trees) and use a variety of techniques

to separate out the wood fibers, which are then used to produce paper. The most common form

of pulping in the U.S. is the Kraft technique, which separates the wood into fibers using

chemicals. A large number of plants also use mechanical pulping (giant grinders separating out

the fibers), while still others use some combination of heat, other chemicals, and mechanical

methods. Once the fibers are separated out, they can be bleached and combined with water to

produce a slurry. After the pulping stage is complete, residual matter remains which historically

was released directly into rivers (hence water pollution), but now must first be treated. The

pulping process is energy intensive, so most pulp mills have their own power plant, and thus are

significant sources of air pollution. The pulping processes may also involve hazardous

chemicals, such as the use of chlorine bleaching in Kraft pulp mills, which can create trace

amounts of dioxin, raising the concern over toxic releases.

           The paper-making process is not nearly as pollution intensive as pulping. Non-integrated

mills either purchase pulp from other mills or use recycled wastepaper. During the paper-

making process, the slurry (more than 90% water at the beginning) is laid on a rapidly-moving


2
    Integrated mills produce their own pulp and non-integrated mills purchase pulp or use recycled wastepaper.

                                                           5
wire mesh which progresses through a succession of dryers in order to remove the water, thereby

creating a continuous sheet of paper. The energy required during this stage is less than during

the pulping stage, but it can still cause air pollution concerns if the mill produces its own power.

Finally, during the drying process some residual water pollution is created. However, both of

these pollution concerns are much smaller than those created during the pulping process.

       The past 30 years has seen large reductions in pollution from the paper industry, with the

advent of secondary wastewater treatment, electrostatic precipitators, and scrubbers. In addition

to these end-of-pipe control technologies, some mills have altered their production process, more

closely monitoring material flows to lower emissions. Overall these alterations have been much

more prevalent at newer plants, which were at least partly designed with pollution controls in

mind – some old pulp mills were deliberately built on top of the river, so that any spills or leaks

could flow through holes in the floor for ‘easy disposal.’ These rigidities can be partially or

completely offset by the tendency for most regulations to include grandfather clauses exempting

existing plants from the most stringent requirements – e.g. until recent standards limiting NOx

emissions, most small existing boilers were exempt from air pollution regulations.



                 4. MODEL OF POLLUTION ABATEMENT REGULATION

       Why do profit-maximizing plants employ resources to abate pollution emissions? If

pollution were a pure externality, with all the burden falling on those who live downwind or

downstream, we would not expect to see any profit-maximizing plant spend money on pollution

abatement. Some market-based mechanisms like consumer demand for ‘green’ products or

managerial taste for ‘good citizenship’ may provide incentives for plants to abate pollution.

However, we believe that the main motivation for controlling pollution emissions in the U.S. is


                                                  6
government regulation of pollution, especially for the air and water pollutants being considered

in this paper, so we model the amount of pollution abatement as being determined by regulators

rather than by the polluting firms. One could instead employ other models, in which pressure

from regulators is supplemented by pressure from customers and community groups, or in which

the polluting firms are concerned about some groups of people but not others, affecting where

pollution levels are greater. These alternative models could lead to analyses similar to those

presented here (explaining why pollution levels from paper mills differ depending on which

groups of people are affected by the pollution). We are also assuming that differences in

regulatory pressures among U.S. paper mills are primarily determined at the state level, so we

view the state as the relevant jurisdiction for political concerns.

       A socially optimal government regulator maximizes social welfare by increasing the

stringency of environmental regulation (requiring greater pollution abatement) up to the point

where the marginal benefit from another unit of abatement is equal to the marginal cost of that

abatement. In equation (1), the regulator would choose different optimal abatement values Ai*

for each plant, based on differences in factors affecting their marginal benefits and marginal

costs of abatement. The marginal costs of abatement differ across plants based on their

production technology, size, and age. The marginal benefits of abatement also differ across

plants, driven especially by the number (and characteristics) of the people near the plant who are

being exposed to the pollution. Assuming that the marginal cost of pollution abatement

increases with stringency (or at least cuts the marginal benefit curve from below), an increase in

the marginal benefits curve (or decrease in the marginal costs curve) results in an increase in the

desired level of pollution abatement and more stringent environmental regulation. Therefore

dAi*/dPLANTi<0 for PLANT characteristics that raise marginal costs, and dAi*/dPEOPLEi>0


                                                  7
for PEOPLE characteristics that raise marginal benefits.



(1) MC (PLANTi, Ai*) = MB(PEOPLEi, Ai*)


       Our analysis focuses on the differences across plants in the marginal benefits of pollution

abatement (MBi), though we do include plant characteristics affecting abatement costs as control

variables. We model the regulator as adding up the marginal benefits from pollution reductions

for all people living around a plant, as shown in equation (2) below. The locations of the people

are indexed by x and y. The marginal benefits MBi for pollution reductions at a given plant will

depend heavily on the number of people in the area (measured by ρxy, the population density at a

given point) and the emissions that they are exposed to (Exy). People may also differ in their

susceptibility to pollution exposure (Sxy), which should affect MBi. The ‘base’ Sxy value would

be 1, with deviations from this affecting MBi. Finally, the regulator may choose αxy to value

certain people less than others when calculating benefits (in which case αxy would be less than 1).



( 2 ) MBi = ∫∫ αxySxyExyρxydxdy
            xy

       Why would αxy differ across people affected by pollution? One strand of the literature

raises concerns with “Environmental Justice”, suggesting that groups with less political

influence (e.g. the poor or minorities) are discriminated against by regulatory agencies (i.e. are

assigned a smaller value of αxy) which aim at maximizing political clout. Politically active

people who strongly favor environmental issues might put more pressure on regulators, and

hence get a larger value of αxy. For plants located near a state (or country) boundary, the benefits



                                                 8
from pollution reduction may accrue to people in other jurisdictions for whom αxy might be

expected to be zero (or at least less than one). However, some countervailing pressures may

arise to offset the latter transboundary effect on regulatory activity.

        The creation of a federal EPA in 1972 was at least in part designed to limit cross-state

pollution flows, and EPA oversight of state regulatory decisions may be stricter for plants near

state boundaries. In addition to a dummy for a plant being located near the border with another

state, we include a measure of the pro-environment stance of the neighboring state’s

Congressional delegation, since presumably the airing of the neighboring state’s objections to

any transboundary pollution is likely to occur in a national setting.

        In the case of Canada two agreements exist which are designed to limit the levels of

transboundary pollution: 1) Canada-United States Great Lakes Water Quality Agreement

(GLWQA) of 1972 and 2) Canada-United States Air Quality Agreement (AQA) of 1991.3 The

GLWQA establishes that the U.S. and Canada will act to restore and preserve the chemical,

physical and biological soundness of the Great Lakes Basin Ecosystem and it contains a number

of goals and guidelines to reach those goals. The AQA is the first bilateral pact between the U.S.

and Canada aimed at controlling transboundary air pollution caused by sulfur dioxide and

nitrogen oxide emissions.4 Given these two agreements it is possible that plants along the

Canadian border will face more stringent (or at least no less stringent) environmental regulation.

                        5. DATA AND EMPIRICAL METHODOLOGY

        Our study measures the relationship between regulatory activity and emissions, and

characteristics of the surrounding population, using data on the intensity of environmental

regulation faced by U.S. pulp and paper mills. We use data on both air and water pollution, to

measure the enforcement and monitoring activity directed towards each mill, along with the

relative stringency of the pollution limits faced by the mill. To measure actual outcomes from

regulation at the mill we use data on both air and water pollution emissions at the mill. Our

analysis controls for a variety of plant- and firm-specific characteristics, as well as the past

compliance status of the mill. We also include a number of other control variables designed to

capture characteristics of the location of the mill that could influence the level of regulatory

activity.

        We use models of the spread of pollution to estimate the relative impacts of the pollution

on people living near the plant. On the air pollution side, the model utilizes an air dispersion

model, SLIM-3, which calculates the total impacts of pollution on the surrounding population

separately at each plant. The air dispersion model incorporates information from the pollution

source (stack height and characteristics of the pollutants being emitted) and meteorological data

(mixing height, wind directions and speeds) to calculate the aggregate exposure at all points

within a wide circle around the plant. The exposure data is combined with measures of the

number of people living near the plant and estimates from the literature on the health impact of

pollutant exposures to quantify the overall dollar benefits from reducing air pollution at each

plant [see Shadbegian et al. (2000) for more details].

        On the water pollution side we use data from the EPA’s National Water Pollution Control

Assessment Model (NWPCAM). This model includes discharge data for over 50,000 industrial


                                                  10
and 13,000 municipal water polluters, combined with stream and river flow data to calculate the

transport of pollutants downstream and the resulting water quality on a mile-by-mile basis for

every affected stream. Of the paper mills in our dataset, 231 have data present in the NWPCAM

model. For each of these mills, we first calculate a baseline model using current discharges and

store the water quality results. We then estimate 5 scenario models, increasing the pollution

discharged from the mill by a wide range of amounts, and measuring how each scenario affects

water quality downstream of the plant. Our monetary measures of the benefits of pollution

abatement are based on an experimental version of the NWPCAM model being developed for

EPA at Research Triangle Institute, which uses a continuous water quality index (0-100) rather

than the traditional four-valued outcomes (unusuable, boatable, fishable, swimmable), allowing

for a more precise valuation of water quality changes. Changes in water quality in each stream

mile are evaluated in dollar terms using a formula based on the work of Carson and Mitchell

(1993). These dollar values are then combined with state population and river miles to estimate

the total dollar benefits of pollution reduction (in terms of improved usability) for each scenario.

These costs are divided by the amount of additional pollution being discharged in that scenario,

providing us with a per-unit benefit of pollution reduction. The largest per-unit value from the 5

scenarios is used to estimate the marginal benefits of pollution abatement at that mill.

       Detailed data on the characteristics of the population within a 50-mile radius of each

plant, including age distribution, racial composition, and within-jurisdiction residency, are based

on the 1990 U.S. Census of Population, as compiled in the Census-CD datasets prepared by

Geolytics, Inc. This provides information based on detailed geographic areas (block groups).

Distances are calculated between the paper mill and the centroid of each block group to

determine which block groups fall within 50 miles of the mill, and the block group values for


                                                 11
each population characteristic are aggregated to get the overall value for each mill.

        In past studies we developed a comprehensive database of U.S. pulp and paper mills to

study the impact of environmental regulation on plant-level productivity and investment. This

database includes published plant-level data from the Lockwood Directory and other industry

sources to identify each plant's production, investment, productivity, age, production technology,

and corporate ownership. We add financial data taken from Compustat, identifying firm

profitability.

        Our pulp and paper mill data is merged with annual plant-level information on regulatory

enforcement, compliance, and quantities of pollution, for both air and water pollution, taken

from EPA regulatory databases. Regulatory enforcement and compliance data for 1985-1997

come from the EPA’s Envirofacts and Integrated Data for Enforcement Analysis databases, as do

the water pollution discharges data for Biochemical Oxygen Demand (BOD) and Total

Suspended Solids (TSS). These datasets allow us to differentiate between two different types of

regulatory actions – enforcement actions (e.g. notice of violation) and inspections. Based on

conversations with regulators, the number of enforcement actions is more likely to be connected

with problems at the plant, while the number of inspections is more connected with the plant’s

size. Air pollution emissions data for particulates (PM10) and sulfur dioxide (SO2) comes from

the Aerometric Information Retrieval System database for 1985-1990 and from the National

Emissions Inventory for 1990-1997.

        Our analyses consider two different measures of the environmental regulatory pressures

faced by each plant. The number of inspections and the number of enforcement actions received

by the plant provide direct measures of regulatory attention. The level of air pollution emissions

and water pollution discharges from the plant provide an indirect measure of the regulatory


                                                12
pressures faced by the plant, all else equal (assuming that other variables included in the

analyses control for differences in the amount of pollution from the plant in the absence of

regulation).

       Each dependent variable Yit is a function of PLANT and PEOPLE characteristics, as

well as STATE variables and year dummies:

(3) Yit = f(PLANTit, PEOPLEit, STATEit, YEARt)


where Y is one of the eight dependent variables in our analysis: Air and Water Pollution

Inspections and Enforcement, Water Discharges of BOD and TSS, and Air Emissions of PM10

and SO2. Since increased regulatory activity will be seen (directly) in more inspections and

enforcement actions, and (indirectly) in less air and water pollution, we expect to find opposite

signs for the coefficients in the regulatory activity and pollution quantity equations.

       First, let us review the plant-, firm-, state-, and county-level control variables included in

each model. These controls include lagged compliance status, plant capacity, plant age, firm

financial condition, county attainment status (air only), major source and public health effects

(water only), and state environmental attitudes. All the results presented here include state

dummies, but the models without state dummies tend to lead to similar conclusions (results

available from authors upon request). To avoid having the state dummies absorb too much of the

cross-plant variation, we only include state dummies for states with 5 or more plants in the given

regression (e.g. the air pollution inspection model includes 22 state dummies, with the base

group being all other non-specified states).

       In terms of plant-level controls we include a lagged measure of regulatory compliance

(COMPLAG). Previous research has shown a strong relationship between compliance and

enforcement [Magat and Viscusi (1990); Deily and Gray (1991); Nadeau (1997); and Gray and

                                                 13
Shadbegian (2000)]. We also include pulp and paper capacity (PULP/PAPER CAPACITY) to

control for plant size, a dummy variable to indicate if the plant was established after 1960 (NEW

PLANT), and a dummy variable to indicate if the plant is the only paper or pulp mill owned by

the firm (SINGLE). We also include the number of the plant’s Occupational Safety and Health

Agency’s violations (OSHA VIOL), since previous research has shown that OSHA violations

are positively correlated with EPA violations [see Gray and Shadbegian (2000)]. To indicate the

financial health of the plant we include a measure from Compustat of the owning-firm’s rate of

return on its assets (RETURN ON ASSETS).

       We include three additional variables to control for exogenous factors affecting the level

of regulatory stringency faced by the plant. On the air side we include a dummy variable to

indicate if the plant is located in a county that is in non-attainment status with respect to

particulate standards (NONTSP; in our data non-attainment for sulfur dioxide is much less

common, and nearly always overlaps with particulate non-attainment, so we focus on

particulates for all equations). On the water side we include a numeric rating from EPA’s

Majors Rating Database indicating the extent to which the plant is a large water polluter

(MAJORS) and a dummy variable to indicate if the plant discharges into a stream whose water

quality has potential health effects, due to being a source of drinking water (PUBLIC HEALTH).

       We control for the state-level regulatory climate using GREEN VOTE, a measure of

support for environmental legislation by that state’s Congressional delegation. The League of

Conservation Voters calculates a scorecard for each member of Congress on environmental

issues, with data available back to the early 1970s. We use the average score for the state's

House of Representative members in our analysis. We also measured the overall inspection

activity in each state for each year by the total number of inspections in the state divided by the


                                                  14
number of plants in the EPA database for that state (STATE AIR INSPECTIONS and STATE

WATER INSPECTIONS). The unemployment rate in the state for that year (UNEMP) and

percent of the county designated as urbanized (URBAN) round out our control variables.

       Now consider the variables which are at the heart of our analyses, those influencing the

marginal benefits from pollution abatement at a particular mill (MBi in equation 2). As

described above, we have information on the expected benefits per unit of pollution reduction

(AIRBEN and WATBEN). On the air pollution side, we also have the percentage of the nearby

population under the age of 6 (KIDS) and those 65 and over (ELDERS) representing groups with

greater sensitivity to air pollution (Sxy in equation 1). We would expect each of them to be

positively related to regulatory activity (inspections and enforcement actions), and negatively

associated with pollution quantities.

       Differences in αxy across people are measured with several variables. We test for

Environmental Justice factors by including two measures of potentially “less valued”

populations: poor and minorities. POOR is the percentage of the nearby population living below

the poverty line. The minority variable is the percentage of the population that is nonwhite

(NONWHITE). We would expect both to be negatively associated with regulatory activity and

positively associated with pollution levels.

       A positive influence on αxy is expected to come from voter activity, measured using voter

turnout in the previous presidential election (TURNOUT), which should be positively associated

with regulatory activity. This sort of voter activity to overcome externalities is discussed in

Olson (1965). However, it is possible that in some cases a majority of the electorate could

oppose environmental regulation, so that higher turnout need not always increase regulation.

Thus we include an interaction between turnout and state membership in conservation


                                                 15
organizations (TURNOUT*CONVMEMB), which would be expected to have a positive

association with regulatory activity.

       We test for the effects of political boundaries by including two simple dummy variables

indicating whether the plant is within 50 miles of another jurisdiction (STATE BORDER or

CANADIAN BORDER). For these plants, some of their pollution may “spill over” to the other

jurisdiction. All else equal, regulators should care less about such pollution, so regulatory

activity should be diminished for those plants. However, the other jurisdiction(s) could respond

strongly to any transboundary pollution. Depending on the institutional arrangements in place,

the political costs associated with transboundary pollution could be larger than the costs of

intrastate pollution. For cross-state pollution, the sensitivity of the other state to transboundary

pollution (and hence the pressure to reduce such pollution) is presumed to be associated with that

state’s GREEN VOTE measure of pro-environmental Congressional support.

       An alternative approach to these benefit-related variables is to disaggregate the total

benefits received by the surrounding population into those received by different groups, in an

effort to see whether the coefficient on benefits differs across groups. To our regressions we add

an interaction between the total benefits and the share of the surrounding population in each

group, so that the coefficients on the interaction terms show the differences across groups. To

measure transboundary effects on the air pollution side we assume that the benefits are

distributed proportionately to the fraction of the population within 50 miles of the plant that is

out-of-state. On the water pollution side we measure the benefits for each out-of-state river

segment directly (where a river forms the border between states, half of the benefit is allocated to

each state).

       We estimate the eight different equations for the dependent variables measuring


                                                 16
regulatory stringency using two statistical techniques. For both air and water pollution we

measure stringency as the number of inspections (INSP) and enforcement actions (ENFORCE) a

plant receives in a given year. Since both INSP and ENFORCE are often zero and are otherwise

relatively small integers, we estimate the equations using a Poisson model (actually, we use a

Negative Binomial model, to allow for the observed over-dispersion of the data, relative to the

simpler Poisson model). For the four pollution quantity equations, we use ordinary least squares

on the logarithm of emissions quantities because of the wide dispersion in emissions across

plants.



                                            6. RESULTS

          Table 1 contains the means and standard deviations (along with variable descriptions) of

all variables used in this study. Note that the number of observations varies across the models

being estimated, depending on the availability of data for the dependent variable and some

specific explanatory variables. We have more data for regulatory activity (inspections and

enforcement actions) than we do for pollution quantities. To avoid having too many different

sample sizes, we restrict the pollution quantity estimation to plants which have both pollutants

reported. To simplify Table 1, all of the control variables have their values reported only for the

largest dataset, corresponding to air pollution regulatory activity.

          In our data the average plant-year observation receives nearly ten times as many

inspections as enforcement actions: approximately two air or water pollution inspections per

year and one air or water enforcement action every three or more years. The distribution of

enforcement actions is skewed in our data, with many plants receiving none and others receiving

several. There is also substantial variation across plants in their air emissions and water


                                                 17
discharges.

       Considering the control variables, the marginal benefits from pollution abatement vary

substantially for both air and water pollution. There is much less variation in the age-related

demographics variables (KIDS and ELDERS) compared to the ‘environmental justice’ variables

(POOR and NONWHITE). Most plants are within 50 miles of a state border, while a sizable

fraction are near the Canadian border. Most plants are in compliance with air and water

regulations (84% and 70% compliance rates respectively). Most plants were in existence by

1960 (75%) and are owned by a firm with more than one paper mill (75%). Approximately half

of the plants (43%) have water pollution discharges that have potential public health impacts and

34% of the plants are located in counties that are not in attainment with particulate emission

standards.

       Tables 2 and 3 present the results of the basic model for air pollution and water pollution

regulation respectively. Consider first the control variables in each equation. We see that lagged

compliance is associated with significant reductions in both pollution quantities and regulatory

activity for air pollution, but for water pollution the only marginally significant impact comes in

reduced water inspections. OSHA violations are surprisingly associated with lower pollution

quantities (though significant only for SO2), and more enforcement actions. The effects of plant

capacity seem to come primarily in terms of pulping capacity, rather than paper capacity (larger

coefficients and more frequently significant). Larger plants generate more pollution and face

more regulatory activity (except water inspections). Plants in urban areas generate less

pollution, but also (surprisingly) face somewhat less regulatory activity. Plants in areas with

high unemployment rates generate more air pollution and less water pollution, and face more air

enforcement actions. The time trends are mostly unremarkable. The base year is 1985 (during


                                                18
the Reagan administration) except for the water pollution quantity equations which use a base

year of 1989 (during the Bush administration). We see significantly higher regulatory activity

and lower pollution quantities during the Clinton administration (except for water inspections,

which are significantly lower).

       Now consider the benefits-related variables that are the focus of our analysis. The

marginal benefits per unit of pollution abatement for the overall population are associated with

lower pollution levels (significant for all pollutants except for sulfur dioxide), but are

surprisingly associated with significantly less air regulatory activity. The sensitive population

groups (KIDS and ELDERS) are significantly negatively related to air pollution quantities, but

also fewer air regulatory actions. Since the dependent variables are measured in log form, the

coefficients reflect percentage impacts on pollution. For example, a one standard deviation

increase in ELDERS (.019) is associated with 27 percent lower SO2 pollution and 19 percent

lower particulate pollution; the comparable reductions for KIDS (.006) are 27 percent and 10

percent. On the air side, a one standard deviation increase in pollution abatement benefits (1.3 in

logs) is associated with 18 percent lower particulate emissions and 20 percent lower sulfur

dioxide emissions. On the water side, the results (for a 2.0 increase in log benefits) show 11

percent lower BOD and 14 percent lower TSS.

       The results for the “Environmental Justice” variables are mixed. POOR has the expected

effects in most cases: significantly more air and water pollution, and fewer enforcement actions

(although unexpectedly more inspections). However, the NONWHITE coefficient is always

opposite in sign from POOR, and usually significant. It appears that nonwhites are not being

discriminated against by regulators, although the poor may be.

       Plants which are located in areas of high political activity and high support for


                                                  19
environmental regulation, as measured by TURNOUT*CONVMEMB, are expected to face more

regulatory activity and have less pollution. Pollution levels are significantly lower as expected,

although the greater relative magnitude of the TURNOUT coefficient for the water pollution

models means that the net effect of greater TURNOUT is more pollution for all but relatively

high CONVMEMB states. The regulatory activity results are unexpected, as states with high

turnout and above-average CONVMEMB values are associated with less, rather than more,

regulatory activity for all but air enforcement actions.

         The border effects in Tables 2 and 3 do not follow the expected pattern. Plants which are

located near state borders show no significant differences in water pollution and lower

particulate pollution, and there is more air pollution where the bordering states are stronger

environmentally.5 The results for Canadian plants suggest different impacts for different

pollutants. On the water pollution side we observe more BOD pollution and less regulatory

activity. On the air pollution side we observe less SO2 pollution and more enforcement actions.

This discrepancy across pollution media suggests that it might be valuable to examine the

mechanisms for regulatory cooperation between the US and Canada more closely.

         Tables 4 and 5 present the results when the various population characteristics are

interacted with the benefits from pollution abatement, to test for differences across groups in the

‘weight’ given their benefits when determining regulatory stringency. These results are similar

to those in Tables 2 and 3 for the different population characteristics. We see greater benefits

being associated with lower pollution levels at plants with low values of POOR and high values

of KIDS, ELDERS and (surprisingly) NONWHITE. Because of the large negative effects of the


5
 This is due at least in part to the use of 50 mile circles to define being near a state border - most of our plants are
near a state border by this definition. Earlier analyses using a 5 mile circle to define state borders find significantly
greater pollution at border plants, and lower pollution when those border states are stronger environmentally.

                                                           20
interactions with KIDS and ELDERS the non-interacted AIRBEN coefficient becomes positive,

but when we evaluate the overall AIRBEN effect at the mean values of the various interactions

we still get a negative impact of -0.14 on particulates and –0.15 on sulfur dioxide. The

comparable numbers for WATBEN are –0.13 for TSS and –0.19 for BOD.

       More importantly, we now get the expected results for the state border variables. Plants

near other states have more pollution, but this effect is reduced when the neighboring state is

stronger environmentally. How large are these effects? Recall that the overall impact of

AIRBEN on sulfur dioxide was –0.15. The AIRBENOUT coefficient of 0.263 combined with

the AIRBENOUT*VOTE coefficient of –0.003 evaluated at the mean GREENVOTE of 54

reduces this effect to –0.05, indicating that benefits outside the state have only one-third the

impact of within-state benefits. Changes in the neighboring state’s GREENVOTE from one

standard deviation below average to one standard deviation above average (from 36 to 72)

change this effect from +0.005 to –0.10, a shift of about two-thirds of the in-state benefits. The

impacts for other pollutants are similar, with benefits to people in high-GREENVOTE border

states having nearly as great an impact as people in the plant’s own state, while people in low-

GREENVOTE border states count substantially less (except for particulates, where the

interaction term is small). As before, the regulatory activity equations are less consistent with

the model, with more air regulatory activity being faced by plants with benefits outside the state.

The Canadian border effects are similar to those in the earlier models.

       We can also try to quantify the impact of changes in demographics around a plant using

the coefficients in Tables 4 and 5. For sulfur dioxide, a one standard deviation increase in

ELDERS increases the impact of benefits by about one-third, from -0.15 to -0.21 (for KIDS it

increases the impact to -0.20); a comparable increase in POOR reduces the impact of benefits by


                                                 21
about one-quarter, to –0.11. There is some variation in impact across pollutants, less on

particulates and more on water pollutants, but overall the results show substantial impacts of the

demographics around a plant on the responsiveness of our environmental measures to the

marginal benefits of abatement.

       Given that each model is being estimated for eight different equations (four air and water

pollutants, along with inspections and enforcement equations), one might wonder whether the

unobserved factors influencing each equation are correlated. To test this, we calculated the

residuals for each of the 8 equations in Tables 4 and 5, and checked the correlations among these

equations. The results are presented in Table 6. The only large correlations come for pollutants,

where plants with surprisingly high emissions of one pollutant also tend to emit surprisingly

large amounts of the other pollutant in that same media. These values are quite high, with

correlations of about 0.8 between BOD and TSS discharges and 0.55 between particulates and

sulfur dioxide emissions. Correlations between air and water pollutants are on the order of .1 to

.2, and correlations among the different measures of regulatory activity tend to be .1 or less.

       One issue for interpreting our results is the possibility that certain population

characteristics may be endogenous – driven by people sorting themselves between locations

based on the pollution in those areas, rather than the pollution levels at plants being driven by

regulatory pressures which depend on the population characteristics. Wolverton (2002) deals

with the sorting issue by examining a set of plants that are relatively young, and including

population characteristics from before the plants began operations. Unfortunately for our

analysis, most paper mills are quite old (only 25% of our plants started operations after 1960,

and very few started after 1980). In any event, population data at a detailed geographic level for

non-urban areas are first available in the 1990 Census of Population, and that’s what we use


                                                 22
here.

        Tables 7 and 8 present the results from an alternative analysis, focusing on the results for

the POOR variable. The poor are arguably the ones most likely to have their location decisions

driven by pollution characteristics, if greater pollution reduces housing values and attracts more

poor residents. Suppose that areas around plants differed in terms of the mobility of the

population, for reasons other than pollution levels. In the areas where the population moves

more often there will be more opportunity for endogenous sorting to occur. SORTING is the

fraction of the population near the plant in 1990 which had moved there since 1985. We interact

SORTING with POOR, and expect to see positive coefficients on POOR*SORTING in the

pollution level equations if sorting matters. We do find a significant positive coefficient for one

of the four pollution equations (particulates), but significant negative coefficients for both of the

water pollution results (and insignificant positive results for SO2). These results suggest that the

positive POOR coefficients found for all four pollutants in the earlier tables are not primarily due

to bias caused by endogenous sorting.



                      7. CONCLUSIONS AND POSSIBLE EXTENSIONS

        In this paper we use a plant-level panel data set on approximately 300 pulp and paper

mills from 1985-1997 to examine the allocation of environmental regulation across plants. We

focus on the benefit side of the MB=MC equation, and find that plants in areas with higher

marginal benefits of pollution abatement have lower pollution levels. Demographics also matter,

as plants with more kids, more elders, and fewer poor people nearby emit less pollution. Plants

near state boundaries emit more pollution, with these boundary effects reduced if the bordering

states have more pro-environment Congressional delegations. Plants in areas with politically


                                                 23
active populations that are also environmentally conscious emit less pollution.

          Not every result fits the predictions of our model. The percentage nonwhite near the

plant, expected to reduce regulatory attention in the Environmental Justice model, is actually

associated with more regulatory activity and lower emissions. The results for the regulatory

activity equations are generally less consistent with our hypotheses than those for the emissions

equations. Perhaps regulators use other, unmeasured, mechanisms to control emissions levels,

such as the details of the air and water permit requirements for each plant. Still, the significant

results for the air pollution emissions and water pollution discharges suggest an important role

for these benefit-side factors in determining the environmental regulation faced by different

plants.

          One important caveat on the results is the cross-sectional nature of our demographic data.

Some of our results could be explained as reverse causation or sorting: poor people move

towards dirty neighborhoods because housing is cheaper there; families with sensitive

individuals such as kids and elders avoid dirty neighborhoods. It is difficult for us to control for

such endogeneity because most paper mills are very old, so we cannot include pre-siting

demographics in the analysis. Our attempt to test for sorting (using the degree of population

turnover near the plant) finds significant evidence in favor of sorting for only one of the four

pollutants (particulates), while the two water pollutants find significant evidence against sorting.



          On the positive side, some of the differences in results for different regulatory measures

pose further research questions. There is a pattern of unexpected signs for regulatory activity,

where factors associated with less regulatory activity are often associated with less pollution,

when we expected opposite signs on these coefficients. Is this an artifact of the data, or does it


                                                   24
represent a real difference in the process by which regulatory activity is allocated in different

situations? Similarly, do the different effects on air and water pollution of being near the

Canadian border reflect real differences across pollution media in the mechanisms for ensuring

international cooperation on pollution control?

       Potential extensions of this project include a more detailed examination of these border

effects and the differences between air and water pollution regulation. We plan to distinguish

between state and federal enforcement and to explore other ways to more accurately measure the

political activism of a community. We will test whether a plant’s pollution abatement spending

is also affected by the benefits of pollution abatement. Finally, we will examine the results for

other industries, to see whether our results for the paper industry hold up in other settings.
