The Maturity and Payment Schedule of Sovereign Debt

This paper studies the maturity and stream of payments of sovereign debt. Using Bloomberg bond
data for eleven emerging economies, we document that countries react to crises by issuing debt with
shortened maturity but back-load payment schedules. To account for this pattern, we develop a sovereign
default model with an endogenous choice of debt maturity and payment schedule. During recessions,
the country prefers its payments to be more back-loaded—delaying relatively larger payments—to
smooth consumption. However, such a back-loaded schedule is expensive given that later payments
carry higher default risk. To reduce borrowing costs, the country optimally shortens maturity. When
calibrated to the Brazilian data, the model can rationalize the observed patterns of maturity and payment
schedule, as an optimal trade-off between consumption smoothing and endogenous borrowing cost.

1    Introduction
At least since the work of Rodrik and Velasco (1999) on the maturity of emerging market debt,
international economists have been puzzled by emerging economies’ heavy issuance of short-term
debt during crises. Short-term debt is particularly subject to roll-over risk, which is harmful to
consumption smoothing. We argue that this is less puzzling than one might think. Countries also
adjust the stream of promised payments to be more back-loaded, i.e., relatively larger payments are
scheduled closer to maturity, while the smaller payments are due sooner. This allows the sovereign
to mitigate the downsides of short-term borrowing.
    In this paper we introduce a parsimonious measure, the average growth rate of the scheduled
payments, to capture the timing and relative size of coupons and principals of sovereign debt. A
higher growth rate implies a more back-loaded schedule. We document that countries react to
recessions by increasing payment growth and by shortening maturity. During recessions, countries
prefer to delay relatively larger payments to smooth consumption. However, a schedule with such
a high payment growth is expensive, given that later payments carry higher default risk. To reduce
borrowing costs, the country optimally shortens the time to maturity. This choice reflects the
tension between present debt burden and lack of enforcement in the future.
    To understand how an emerging economy chooses the maturity and, more important, the growth
rate of scheduled payments for external debt, we explore the individual bond data of eleven emerging
markets from the Bloomberg Professional service using panel IV methods. We report two major
findings on sovereign debt issuance. First, the payment growth rate is higher when output is low
and spread is high. This implies that promised payments are more back-loaded during downturns.
Second, the maturity is shorter during such episodes, consistent with the evidence presented by
Arellano and Ramanarayanan (2012) and Broner, Lorenzoni, and Schmukler (2013).
    Our model extends the standard sovereign default framework of Eaton and Gersovitz (1981),
Aguiar and Gopinath (2006), and Arellano (2008) by introducing a flexible choice of payment
schedule. A small, open economy can issue only state-uncontingent bonds in the international
financial markets. Its government can choose to default over its bond, subject to a punishment of
output loss and temporary exclusion from international markets. We depart from the literature
and allow the government to issue bonds with different maturities and schedules. For example,
the government may issue a T -period, back-loaded (front-loaded) long-term bond. Before the bond
matures, the government makes periodic payments that increase (decrease) over time.
    The payment schedule and maturity of sovereign debt are determined by the interplay of two in-
centives: smoothing consumption and reducing default risk. To smooth consumption, the sovereign
would like to align payments with future output, i.e., larger payments ought to to be scheduled
in periods with higher expected output. Thus, a more back-loaded schedule is preferable during
economic downturns, since the government can repay the bulk of its obligation in the future, when
the economy is expected to recover. Therefore, under the consumption-smoothing incentive, the


                                                 2
growth rate of payments and current output should be negatively correlated.
        The government must also take into consideration its default risk when making choices over
payment schedules, since high default risk leads to high borrowing cost. A more back-loaded bond
is particularly expensive during downturns. The reason is that such a contract specifies that most
payments be made in the distant future, which subjects lenders to large losses if the government
defaults in the meantime. To reduce borrowing cost while enjoying the consumption-smoothing
benefit of back-loaded contracts, the government chooses a shorter maturity in economic downturns.
Contracts with shorter maturity allow lenders to receive their investment returns sooner. Lenders
therefore bear less default risk and offer a higher bond price.
        We calibrate the model to match key moments for the Brazilian economy. Our model generates
volatilities of consumption and trade balance similar to the data. The model replicates key features
of sovereign debt. The median maturity is about nine years in the model and ten years in the data.
The median growth rate of payment is five percent in the data and six percent in the model, which
implies that, on average, countries issue back-loaded bonds.
        Most important, our model matches the cyclical behavior of issuance well. When the spread
increases above its mean, maturity shortens from seven to about three years, while the payment
growth rate increases from 3.4% to roughly eight percent. By looking across quartiles of spread or
GDP we find that the cyclical properties of issuance in both model and data are similar and fairly
monotonic.
        This paper makes two contributions. Empirically, we construct a parsimonious measure of pay-
ment schedule and document the role of back-loading for consumption smoothing during downturns.
Most studies in the literature, such as those of Broner, Lorenzoni, and Schmukler (2013) and Arel-
lano and Ramanarayanan (2012), address this margin by focusing on the portfolio composition of
both short and long debt.
        Theoretically, we model the endogenous choice of payment schedule and maturity. The literature
often restricts borrowing either to a one-period bond or to exogenous payment schedules. A new line
of work studying long-term sovereign debt as in Chatterjee and Eyigungor (2012) and Hatchondo and
Martinez (2009) uses perpetuity bonds to avoid the curse of dimensionality. Such perpetuity bonds
are restricted to a front-loaded payment schedule1 , opposite those covered in the data. Another line
of work studies maturity for fiscal policy purposes, using zero-coupon bonds, e.g. Lustig, Sleet, and
Yeltekin (2008).
    1
    For example, in Arellano and Ramanarayanan (2012), one unit of the perpetuity bond promises payments
 1, δ, δ 2 , . . . and so forth, forever. This requires the gross growth rate δ to be bounded above, to keep the state
space bounded.

2        Empirical Analysis
This section documents how the maturity and payment schedule of new issuances vary with un-
derlying fundamentals, using bond-level data. Our key finding is that during financial distress the
sovereign shortens maturity and schedules payments to be more back-loaded, i.e., they promise
smaller payments in the near future and larger payments later.
        We study a sample of eleven emerging market sovereigns2 : Argentina, Brazil, Mexico, Russia,
Colombia, Uruguay, Venezuela, Hungary, Poland, Turkey, and South Africa. Using the Bloomberg
Professional database, we extract information on the schedule of coupons and principal of external
debt. We focus on foreign-currency denominated bonds and exclude bonds with special features
(e.g., collateralized) and those with guarantees from international financial institutions, e.g., the
IMF.
        We construct promised cash flows from coupons and principal payments. Since countries issue
debt denominated in various currencies, we need to convert these flows to real US dollars using
exchange rates provided by the IMF and the CPI series from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
LIBOR rates from EconStats.com are used whenever a bond specifies its coupon rate relative to
such a reference rate. We document key facts about these bond-level issuance data, in connection
with GDP and the spread series provided by Broner, Lorenzoni, and Schmukler (2013).3 Appendix
A contains further information on the data used.

2.1       Payment Schedule, Maturity, and Duration
We start by defining key concepts. We characterize bonds using three measures: maturity T ,
Macaulay duration D, and the growth rate of payments δ. Consider a sovereign country i in period
t. Let cit (s) denote the cash flow—in real US dollar terms—promised by the portfolio issued at
period t to be paid s ∈ {1, 2, . . . , Nti } periods later. Nti refers to the number of periods until the
last payment is scheduled. Let n be the number of periods in a year.
        Whenever multiple bonds are issued during a given time period, e.g. in the same week, we sum
over the cross-section of promised cash flows, at each future period, resulting in a single stream of
payments cit (s), as if the country had issued a single bond making all the payments scheduled by
the actual bonds issued. Such constructed streams are assigned a maturity Tti (measured in terms
of years since the issue date) given by the average maturity of the actually issued bonds, weighted
                                                                                                   Nt
by each bond’s real principal value. We label the promised cash-flow profile cit (s)
                                                                                            
                                                                                                   s=1   as payment
schedule. To compute the annualized growth rate of payment              δti ,   we regress the promised cash flows

    This is the same set of countries considered in Broner, Lorenzoni, and Schmukler (2013).

    The spreads are at a weekly frequency and measured by the differences in the (annualized) yield-to-maturity
relative to equivalent U.S. (or German) bonds. Their yield curve estimates deliver spread for bonds of the maturities
either up to three years, between six and nine years, or over twelve years.

where R denotes the gross annual, real, risk-free rate, which we fix at 3.2 percent, following Arellano
and Ramanarayanan (2012). Thus, Dti represents the risk-free version of the Macaulay duration and
is referred to simply as the duration. This is the measure commonly studied in the literature. Al-
though this measure reflects both maturity and the payment schedule, it obscures their independent
roles for issuance choice, as documented in our analysis.
    Table 1 reports the summary statistics for the eleven countries in our sample. The average
payment growth for weekly new issuances is 19%, while the average maturity is about nine years,
and average duration is six years. We are interested in how emerging markets vary issuance char-
acteristics with the business cycle, as reflected in the nine-year interest rate spread. We use the
series from the yield curve estimation of Broner, Lorenzoni, and Schmukler (2013). For all countries
except Russia, the maturity is negatively correlated with the spread, with correlations ranging from
-0.05 to -0.48. Payments are back-loaded when the interest rate is high, with a positive correlation
for most countries. Uruguay is an outlier in that it has issued a substantial number of zero-coupon
bonds.

    We illustrate the dynamics of payment growth and maturity in relation to the spread for the
case of Brazil, in Figure 1. The growth rate of scheduled payments co-moves with the spread, with
a correlation of 0.51. On the other hand, the maturity has a negative correlation of -0.48.

2.2    Regression Analysis
Given the suggestive correlations reported above, we undertake a more systematic analysis of the
data by employing the specification introduced by Broner, Lorenzoni, and Schmukler (2013). We
regress our measures on the interest rate spread, controlling for country fixed-effects, country-specific
time trends and the other controls used in Broner et al.4 We also report two-stage least-squares
estimates, using their identification strategy of instrumenting for sovereign spreads with the Credit
Suisse First Boston (CSFB) High Yield Index. This index measures the spread on high-yield debt
securities issued by the US corporate sector. Conditions in the US corporate debt market are a
demand-side factor for sovereign debt markets via the portfolio problem faced by investors.
    Table 2 reports our estimates. In all specifications, financial conditions are statistically signifi-
cant determinants of issuance choice, with a positive coefficient in maturity regressions and negative
in payment growth regressions. Throughout, results for duration are similar to those for maturity.
The OLS and IV coefficients share the same sign, the IV coefficients are more precisely estimated,
and the OLS coefficients are systematically closer to zero. This points to a potential attenuation
bias induced by mismeasurement of spreads or the omission of a variable negatively correlated with
spreads.
    The magnitudes of these results are also economically significant. For every one percentage point
increase in the spread, emerging markets will raise the growth rate of payments by eight to nine
percentage points, back-load the schedule, and reduce maturity by about 1.3 years. Since spreads
are quite volatile, for example, varying between two and ten percent for Brazil, our findings imply
substantial variation in these debt characteristics over the cycle.
    Constructed cash flows and their estimated payment growth δ require an explicit choice of
issuance frequency. To minimize any bias induced by time aggregation and for consistency with
the Broner, Lorenzoni, and Schmukler (2013) methodology, we use a weekly issuance frequency for
our empirical section. This means we aggregate all bonds issued within one week into a composite
bond that schedules all the payments of the individual bonds. In Appendix C we document that
our empirical results are robust to a choice of yearly frequency for issuance.
    Our analysis highlights two main results. First, the maturity of bonds shortens during crisis
periods. This is consistent with the existing work on maturity choice of emerging markets. To the
best of own knowledge, our second finding is new to the literature: sovereigns also adjust payment
schedules in response to crises by issuing more back-loaded bonds.

     All variables are six-month moving averages (measured by using 26-week rolling window). All independent
variables are logged and then demeaned for a given country, where spread variables are log-spreads 100∗log(1+spread).

3     Model
We study optimal maturity and payment schedule of sovereign debt in a small, open economy model
with default. A benevolent government borrows from a continuum of competitive lenders by issuing
uncontingent debt with a flexible choice of maturity and payment schedule. The debt contract has
limited enforcement, in that payments are state-uncontingent and the sovereign government has the
option to default.

3.1    Technology, preferences, and international contracts
The economy receives a stochastic endowment y, which follows a first-order Markov process. The
government is benevolent, and its objective is to maximize the utility of the representative consumer
given by,
                                                       ∞
                                                       X
                                                  E0         β t u(ct ),
                                                       t=0

where ct denotes consumption in period t, 0 < β < 1 the discount factor, and u(·) the period utility
function, satisfying the usual Inada conditions. Each period, the government may borrow abroad by
issuing a bond contract and decides whether to default on the outstanding debt. All the proceeds
of the government are transferred as a lump sum to the representative consumer. We assume the
government has access to enough policy instruments5 to be capable of perfectly control the overall
national level of borrowing, thus avoiding any issues related to private sector over-borrowing, as
discussed in Jeske (2005).
    While in good credit standing, the government has the option to default on its debt. Following the
sovereign default literature, we assume that after default, the debt is written off and the government
switches to bad credit standing. The government is then subject to output losses and temporary
exclusion from international financial markets. With probability φ, international lenders forgive a
government in bad credit standing and resume lending to it.6 Given default risk, lenders charge
bond prices that compensate them for expected losses.
    A bond contract specifies a maturity T and a payment schedule given by the growth rate of
payments δ, the number of units issued b, and a bond price q. For such a contract, conditional
on not defaulting, the government repays (1 + δ)−τ with 0 ≤ τ ≤ T periods to maturity. When
δ is negative, the payments shrink over time (front-loaded).7 When δ equals zero, the contract is
“flat” as the payments are constant over T periods. When δ is positive, the payments grow over
time (back-loaded). The contract also nests the zero coupon bond, when we let δ go to infinity.
   5
     For example, capital control policies, as studied by Kehoe and Perri (2004), Wright (2006), Kim and Zhang (2012),
or Na, Schmitt-Grohé, Uribe, and Yue (2014).
   6
     Our model abstracts from renegotiation. Yue (2010), D’Erasmo (2008), and Benjamin and Wright (2009) study
debt renegotiation explicitly. Quantitatively, the predictions of such models in terms of standard business-cycle
statistics of emerging economics are similar as that in Arellano (2008), without renegotiation.
   7
     This is the case covered by the perpetuity bond in Arellano and Ramanarayanan (2012).



                                                             9
Figure 2 shows examples of schedules for different cases of δ, for ten-year bonds. To make contracts
comparable, we pick the number of bond units issued b to finance one unit of consumption for all
cases, using the risk-free bond price. With a more back-loaded schedule, the number of units issued
b has to be larger due to discounting.

Note: Payment schedules for bond contracts with different δ, against periods to maturity τ . The number of units
issued b is picked so that all bonds finance 1 unit of consumption at the respective risk-free bond price.

    To mitigate the curse of dimensionality implicit in using richer descriptions of debt contracts,
we assume that the government can only hold one type of bond at a time. If the government
wants to change its payment schedule, it has to buy back the outstanding debt before it can issue
a new contract. Under this assumption, the state of a government with good credit standing is
z = (T, δ, b, y), including its income shock y and the outstanding units b, with remaining maturity
T and growth rate of payments δ.

3.2    Equilibrium
The government’s problem                        The government in good credit standing chooses whether to default
d, with d = 1 denoting default:
                                                                n                                   o

                                                      d∈{0,1}


where V d and V n are the defaulting and repaying values respectively.

                                                                      10
       If it defaults, the government gets its debt written off but receives a lower endowment h(y) ≤ y.
With probability φ, a government in bad credit standing will return to market, without any debt.
The defaulting value satisfies

If it repays, the government can continue the current contract, with value V c , or issue new debt
and receive value V r . We use x = 0 to denote continuing the current contract and x = 1 to denote
issuing new debt. Specifically, the problem under no default is given by

                                  V n (z) = max {x V r (z) + (1 − x) V c (z)}                                   (5)

If it chooses to issue, the government must retire outstanding obligations, at the risk-free bond price
q rf . The proceeds from the sale of the new bond are q (T 0 , δ 0 , b0 , y) b0 , where the bond price schedule
for new issuance, q, reflects future default risk and thus depends on the current endowment level y
and the payment structure.
       We assume that when buying back old bonds, the government faces a cost given by the risk-free
bond price q rf , the upper limit for the secondary-market price. This high cost is consistent with
evidence on expensive buybacks discussed in Bulow and Rogoff (1988) and proxies for issuance
costs in a reduced form. Here we abstract from issues of debt dilution, as studied by the recent
literature on long-term sovereign debt, e.g., Hatchondo, Martinez, and Sosa-Padilla (2014) and
Sanchez, Sapriza, and Yurdagul (2014). We conduct sensitivity analysis with respect to alternative
buyback costs, allowing for dilution, in section 4.4.

International financial intermediaries                     Lenders8 are risk neutral, competitive, and face a con-
stant world interest rate r. The bond price schedule must guarantee that lenders break even in
expectation. For a bond with remaining maturity T 0 and growth rate δ 0 , its risk-free price is defined
   8
    We assume that lenders have deep pockets and thus can unilaterally satisfy the country’s loan demand. This rules
out self-fulfilling crises due to lenders’ failure to coordinate, as in Cole and Kehoe (2000).

The risky bond price reflects expected payments to lenders. If the government repays next period,
                                                          0
lenders receive a payment of (1 + δ)−T per unit outstanding. The repaying government may choose
to restructure its debt x0 = 1 and so repurchase its outstanding debt at the risk-free bond price
q rf . Note that maturity T 0 and payment schedule δ 0 affect the risky bond price in two ways: on
one hand, conditional on no default, they matter for expected discounted payment and thus the
risk-free component of q, the corresponding q rf . On the other hand, both maturity and payment
schedule matter for future default decisions and thus the default premium priced into q.

Definition of equilibrium                       The equilibrium consists of policy functions T 0 , δ 0 , b0 , d0 , x0 , value
functions V , V d , V n , V c , the bond price schedule q, and the risk-free schedule q rf , such that, given
the world interest rate r,

(a) policies and values satisfy the government’s problem (3-7), given the bond prices, and

(b) lenders charge break-even bond prices (9) consistent with government policies, and the risk-free
    bond price schedule is given by (8).


4    Quantitative Analysis
We calibrate the model for the Brazilian economy over the period from 1996 to 2009 and study
its implications for standard business cycle statistics and, most important, for the maturity and
payment schedule of sovereign debt. We discuss the incentives faced by a country when designing
its bond issuance. Finally, we conduct sensitivity analysis related to the cost of retiring outstanding
debt and alternative shock specifications.

      The economy is subject to two, independent shocks: an endowment shock and a sudden stop
shock. The endowment of this economy follows an AR(1) process

                                                log(yt ) = ρ log(yt−1 ) + η εt ,                            (12)

where the idiosyncratic shock εt follows the standard Normal distribution. Every period, with a
constant probability pss , the country enters a sudden stop state, in which endowment is reduced
and the country can only lower its debt burden. While in this state, the country has a constant
probability pret of recovering in the next period.9
      Following Arellano and Ramanarayanan (2012), the output of a country with a bad credit
standing h(y) is given by
                                           h(y) = min {{y, (1 − λd ) E y}}                                  (13)

where E y is the unconditional mean of y and λd ∈ [0, 1] captures the default penalty. During
sudden stop, the endowment is capped by (1 − λs ) E y.
      To compare model and data, we define the yield to maturity as the constant interest rate r̂ such
that the present value of payments computed using this interest rate is equal to the market price
of the bond, i.e., r̂ is implicitly defined by

The spread is the difference between the yield to maturity r̂ and the risk-free rate r:

                                     spread T 0 , δ 0 , b0 , y ≡ r̂ T 0 , δ 0 , b0 , y − r.

      Table 3 presents the calibrated parameter values. The risk-aversion parameter σ is set to two as is
standard in the literature. The risk-free interest rate is set to 3.2 percent to target the average annual
yield to maturity for US government bonds. The persistence and volatility of the AR(1) output
process are taken from Arellano and Ramanarayanan (2012), who calibrate these two parameters to
the HP-filtered Brazilian GDP. They pick ρ = 0.9 and compute the standard deviation η = 0.017.

set to 0.17, following Arellano and Ramanarayanan (2012). The annual probability of sudden stop
pss and recovery pret are chosen to be 0.10 and 0.75, consistent with the quarterly values used by
Bianchi, Hatchondo, and Martinez (2012). The four remaining parameters, the discount factor β,
the output loss parameters λd and λs , together with the maximum maturity T are chosen jointly,
to match the average three-year and nine-year spreads, median maturity, and the debt service to
GDP ratio.
       Table 4 compares the baseline model (column 2) and data (column 1) statistics for Brazil. The
model matches the targeted moments well. For both data and model, we focus on new issuance.10
The median maturity is 10.3 years in the data and nine years in the model. The model also
replicates payment growth and key business cycle features of emerging markets well. It predicts a
six percent growth rate of payments, consistent with the data, where the median growth rate of
payments is 4.9%, implying a back-loaded payment schedule for new issuance. It generates excess
volatility of spreads relative to the data. Consumption is more volatile than output, as documented
by Neumeyer and Perri (2005). The volatility of consumption is 1.1 times that of output in both the
model and the data. The model produces a volatile trade balance (normalized by GDP), 55 percent
in the model and 36 percent in the data. In Brazil, the spreads for all maturities are countercyclical.
The correlations are -0.49, -0.57, and -0.52 for three-year, nine-year, and twelve-year with GDP,
respectively. Table 4 reports the average of these correlations, -0.53. This correlation is also negative
  10
    Following the sovereign default literature, for computational reasons, we restrict the sovereign to hold only one
asset at a time. It then must be the case that this period’s issuance will be next period’s stock. In contrast, in the
data the stock at any one time is the accumulation of many issuances, at various moments in the past. Faced with
a choice between targeting stocks and matching flows (issuance), we follow the literature and study issuance, e.g.,
Arellano and Ramanarayanan (2012) and Broner, Lorenzoni, and Schmukler (2013).

in the model, -0.34.
   In the data the debt-to-GDP ratio is strongly countercyclical, with a correlation with GDP of
-0.87. To replicate this behavior, we need to include a sudden stop shock that creates an additional
precautionary saving motive, discouraging excessive borrowing during good times when spreads are
low. Eliminating the sudden stop increases the correlation of debt-to-GDP with GDP to 0.26 but
leaves other moments relatively unchanged, as shown in the third column of Table 4.

4.2   Bond Price Schedule
The choice of optimal contracts depends on government’s preferences and the bond price schedule
it faces. This schedule depends on future governments’ default incentives, which are determined
by two channels: lack of commitment and debt burden. Contracts which make eventual default
more tempting for the government (lack of commitment) or which require higher payments (debt
burden), will carry higher default risk, lower prices and therefore be less attractive for debt finance.
   The bond price reflects the lender’s opportunity cost, the equivalently structured risk-free bond
price q rf . This price varies with T 0 and δ 0 , due to the changes they induce in the size and number
of payments. All other contract characteristics constant, longer maturity implies more payments
and thus a higher risk-free bond price. See Figure 3(a). A high δ 0 is associated with back-loaded
payments, which are subject to compounded discounting and thus have lower present value, resulting
in a lower risk-free price. See Figure 3(b).
   To isolate the consequences of default risk, Figure 4 plots the market bond price schedule

q(T 0 , δ 0 , b0 , y) relative to the risk-free bond price q rf (T 0 , δ 0 ) as a function of q rf (T 0 , δ 0 )b. We normalize
the number of units b with q rf to facilitate comparisons of debt values across different contracts. For
any given T 0 and δ 0 , issuing more units means a higher debt burden and thus higher risk of default
and a lower bond price.
    Figure 4(a) compares the bond price across growth rates of payments, δ = −3% versus δ = 18%,
for a fixed T = 14 and mean endowment. Consider an increase in δ, i.e., a more back-loaded contract.
In the absence of commitment, distant promises are less credible, leading to higher default incentives
and a lower bond price. On the other hand, more back-loading induces smaller payments in the near
future and larger payments later. Overall, due to compound discounting, this implies a lower debt
burden, lower default risk, and a higher bond price. For back-loaded contracts, the debt burden
effect dominates for high levels of debt and the government gets better bond prices.
    Figure 4(b) compares the bond price across maturity choices, T = 4 versus T = 14, for a fixed
δ = 18% and mean endowment. When extending the maturity, there is a greater lack of commitment
and the bond price is lower. At the same time, debt burden in any one period is decreased, reducing
default incentives. Overall, when less is borrowed, the price schedule is higher for short-term debt.
    When maturity is short, the bond price schedule becomes insensitive to the choice of δ, as
shown in Figure 4(c). This is because the two channels are fairly balanced. This suggests that when
countries shorten maturity during recessions, they are likely to smooth consumption by back-loading
payments. Figure 4(c) also illustrates the role of income in determining bond prices: higher income
implies fewer incentives to default and thus the country can borrow more cheaply.

4.3             Maturity and Payment Schedule
We now turn our focus to understanding how maturity and payment structure of issuance vary
with the business cycle. We use the spread and output as our preferred cyclical indicators. Table
5 reports key statistics for Brazil and their model counterparts. In the data, during normal times
when the spread is below its historic mean, the growth rate of payments is about five percent, with
a maturity of roughly 14 years and a duration of nine years. During periods of financial stress,
when the spread is above average, payments become more back-loaded, with a growth rate of 7.1%,
maturity shortens to about nine years, and duration is reduced to six years. These patterns are


                                                                                                 17
consistent with the findings in Section 2 where we studied a broader set of countries.
   Our model matches the observed cyclicality of maturity, payment growth, and duration well.
When the spread increases above its mean, the payment growth rate increases from 3.4% to roughly
eight percent, while maturity shortens from seven to about three years, and the duration decreases
from five to three years. Even though the model generates a lower maturity and duration, on
average, relative to the data, it successfully matches the magnitude and sign of their changes: in
both data and model maturity decreases by about four years, when spread increases above its
mean. By looking across quartiles of the spread we find that the cyclical properties of issuance
are fairly monotonic, and similar between model and data. However, the model has an excessively
low maturity when spread is below its 25th percentile. In the model, countries face a low spread
either when income is high or when they have close to no debt. In the model we find that countries
shocked with a low endowment realization, while carrying close to no debt, choose not to default
but face low spreads. Even so, due to the low endowment, they choose to borrow short-term, as
our mechanism predicts.
   Using GDP as a cyclical indicator, we get a similar message. When GDP is below trend, the
country shortens maturity from 13 to nine years but back-loads the payment from 3.2 percent to
8.4 percent. Duration follows the dynamics of maturity. In particular, it also shortens by 2.5 years.
   The payment schedule and maturity of sovereign debt are determined by the interplay of two
incentives: (i) smoothing consumption, and (ii) lowering the borrowing cost by reducing default
risk. To smooth consumption, the sovereign would like to align payments with future output,
i.e. scheduling larger payments for periods with higher expected output. Given the mean-reverting
nature of the output process considered, the growth rate of output decreases with the current output.
Thus, a more back-loaded schedule is preferable during economic downturns since the government
can repay the bulk of its obligation in the future, when the economy is expected to recover. Under
the consumption-smoothing incentive, the growth rate of payments and current output should be
negatively correlated.
   The government also takes into consideration the borrowing cost it faces when making choices
over payment schedules. During downturns, when income is low, the range of debt levels for which
back-loaded contracts offer better bond prices shrinks, as Figure 4(b) shows. This makes the
sovereign more likely to face a tighter bond price if it were to choose a more back-loaded contract.
To reduce the borrowing cost, while enjoying the consumption-smoothing benefit of more back-
loaded contracts, the government chooses a shorter maturity in downturns to mitigate its lack of
commitment. Moreover, for short maturities, the differences in bond price schedules for different
payment growth rates are small, as Figure 4(c) shows.

4.4    Sensitivity Analysis
In this section, we conduct sensitivity analysis for the case without sudden stop shock and alternative
bond buyback prices.
    We first recalibrate the model assuming no sudden stop shock. In particular, the median matu-
rity is calibrated to be 10 years as in the baseline model. The third column of Table 4 shows that
the model without sudden stop shocks generates similar volatilities of spread and net export as in
the baseline. The sudden stop shock, however, matters for characteristics of debt issuance. The
sovereign issues fewer back-loaded bonds, the median payment growth is reduced to three percent,
compared to six percent in the baseline model. This is mainly driven by borrowing choices of high-
income states, under which the sovereign tends to issue relatively front-loaded bonds if it borrows.
Without sudden stop shock, high-income states have fewer precautionary motives and thus borrow
more. We therefore observe lower median payment growth and positively correlated debt-to-GDP
and GDP.
    Though having a low payment growth, the model without sudden stop still produces counter-
cyclical payment growth and procyclical maturity issuance. When the interest rate spread becomes
high (i.e., GDP is below trend), the payment growth rate of new issuance increases by 2.4% points,
and the maturity shortens by three years, as Table 5 shows. These findings are robust to the use of
GDP as our conditioning variable.
    We now consider an alternative specification of bond buyback price. In our main analysis
we used the risk-free bond price q rf to retire outstanding debt, thus abstracting from any issues
raised by long-term debt dilution. First, we consider the “full dilution” case with buyback at the
competitive, secondary market price. This price results from valuing outstanding debt using the
default probabilities implied by new issuance. The logic is that if the government retires all but
a measure zero of outstanding bonds, these bonds’ remaining payments would be subjected to the
same default risk as the newly issued bond. This makes the buyback price a function of both current
state variables (T, δ, y) and issuance characteristics (T 0 , δ 0 , b0 ). The full dilution bond price q fd is
given by

                                                1                                 n

where hT 00 , δ 00 , b00 i are the optimal choices in state hT 0 , δ 0 , b0 , y 0 i, conditional on restructuring. Con-
sistent with Sanchez, Sapriza, and Yurdagul (2014), we find that, under full dilution, short-term
debt strictly dominates and only one period bonds are issued in the ergodic distribution of the
model. This is clearly inconsistent with the data. Sanchez, Sapriza, and Yurdagul (2014) show that
with the introduction of sudden stop shocks, a higher level of risk aversion, or a debt restructuring


                                                                    20
procedure can revert this extreme result.
    Given the lack of variation in optimal maturity under full dilution, we study a hybrid case,
labeled “partial dilution,” in which the buyback price is an average of the risk-free price and the
full dilution price. The partial dilution price is given by

                                                      1 h rf                                    i
                     q pd T, δ, y, T 0 , δ 0 , b0 =      q (T, δ) + q fd T, δ, y, T 0 , δ 0 , b0 .
                                              
                                                                                                     (17)
                                                      2

For our numerical results, we keep maximum maturity T = 15 as in the baseline, and recalibrate
other parameters. The partial dilution model can deliver cyclicality results in line with our baseline
and the data. However, on average, this produces shorter maturity and higher payment growth
on average, relative to baseline. The overall effect of dilution is to shorten maturity and increase
back-loading of payments. This level effect leaves intact our key findings, in terms of the magnitude
of changes in issuance characteristics, with respect to spread or GDP. See Table 5.


5    Conclusion
In this paper we address the outstanding puzzle of short-term borrowing by emerging markets
during crises. We go beyond the previous characterization of debt in terms of duration and instead
consider two complementary measures: payment growth rate and maturity. In our model, as in the
data, countries in crisis issue bonds with back-loaded payments and shorter maturity. This renders
the choice of maturity less of a puzzle, given that such a schedule helps with risk-sharing during
downturns.

A        Data Appendix
A.1       Exchange Rate, U.S. CPI, and LIBOR
Sovereigns often schedule payments over the course of 20 or 30 years in the future since the issue
date. In order to evaluate such promised payments in terms of real U.S. dollars, several assumptions
are necessary:

       • Exchange Rate: Under the assumption that foreign exchange rates are Martingales, the ex-
         pected future exchange rate is equal to the current value.

       • U.S. CPI: For the U.S. CPI, we assume perfect-foresight because the U.S. CPI is quite stable.

       • LIBOR: When the coupon rate is expressed as a spread over the LIBOR rate, e.g., the floating
         coupon-rate bond, we take as our benchmark the perfect-foresight case in measuring the
         LIBOR rates in the future.

       Note that our sample includes bonds with non-fixed coupon rate, e.g., floating and variable
coupon-rate bonds, as well as the fixed coupon-rate bond. By contrast, frequently in the literature,
non-fixed coupon-rate bonds are excluded from the analysis mainly for convenience rather than for
economic reasons. We must address all of these cases consistently to produce a coherent picture of
payment timing and size. For example, a variable coupon bond often specifies that coupon rates
rise with the length of time to payments in a step-wise form; this has important implications for
the growth rate of promised payments, i.e., positive growth rate of promised payments.

A.2       Sample Selection: Excluding Bonds with Special Features
We exclude from the sample bonds that are either denominated in local currencies or of special
features for the reason explained in Broner, Lorenzoni, and Schmukler (2013). First, we focus
on bonds denominated in foreign currencies for following reason. In many cases for emerging
market economies, sovereign bonds are denominated in foreign currencies. Sovereigns do issue
bonds denominated in their local currencies; in such a case, sovereigns would have an option to
dilute their debt burden by adjusting the inflation rate in local currency terms, which is not the
case for the bonds denominated in foreign currencies and is ruled out by the standard sovereign-
default models, such as the one studied in this paper.          11   Thus, we simply focus on foreign-currency
denominated bonds by excluding local-currency denominated bonds from our sample. Second, for
the same reason as above, we exclude from the sample bonds with special features that are absent
in our model and infrequently observed in the data: for instance, we exclude either collateralized
  11
     Moreover, as discussed in Broner, Lorenzoni, and Schmukler (2013), if both foreign- and local-currency denomi-
nated bonds were included in the sample, then the regression analysis of bond characteristics would require controlling
for the time-varying exchange-rate risk premium, which is difficult to measure.

bonds or bonds with the special guarantees provided by the third-party institutions such as the
IMF, World Bank, and leading foreign governments/banks.


B     Full Model with Sudden Stop Shock and (Partial) Dilution
We present the full model with a sudden stop shock and dilution. The state space must be extended
to include s ∈ {0, 1} an indicator for whether the country is in a sudden stop state. Under circum-
stances of (partial) dilution, the buyback bond price is a function of not only issuance characteristics
but also the outstanding debt structure.

C     Robustness to Issuance Frequency
In Table 6 we document the robustness of our main findings under the alternative assumption of
a yearly issuance frequency, which is in line with our calibrated period length. Quantitatively, the
results are largely unaltered for maturity T and duration D while our payment growth measure δ
is more sensitive to time aggregation. The coefficients preserve their significance and signs.
