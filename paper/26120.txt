The Price to Consumers of Generic Pharmaceuticals: Beyond the Headlines

                                         ABSTRACT

Generic drug prices have been the focus of much attention in recent years, with Congressional
committees, executive agencies and private organizations all conducting investigations into the
pricing patterns for generic drugs. Price spikes for selected old, off-patent drugs have also been
widely reported in the media. To place these generic price increases into context, we construct
two chained Laspeyres consumer price indexes (CPIs), using the 2007-2016 IBM MarketScan
Commercial Claims and Encounters Research Database. The first ("direct out-of-pocket CPI")
measures consumers' direct out-of-pocket payments to the dispensing pharmacy, while the second
("total CPI") represents the total revenues received by the dispensing pharmacy – the consumers'
direct out-of-pocket payments plus the amount paid to the pharmacy by the insurer on behalf of
the consumer.

We find the chained direct-out-of-pocket CPI for generic prescription drugs declines by about
50%between 2007 and 2016, while the total CPI falls by nearly 80% over the same time period.
The smaller decline in the direct out-of-pocket CPI than in the total CPI is due in part to
consumers' increasingly moving away from fixed copayment benefit plans to pure coinsurance or
a mixed package of coinsurance and copayments. While consumers are experiencing more cost
sharing that in fact shifts more of the drug cost burden on to them, on balance in the US
consumers have experienced substantial price declines for generic drugs.

Context: Generic drug prices have received a great deal of attention in the past few years.

Congressional committees, executive agencies and private organizations have all

conducted investigations into the pricing patterns for generic drugs. Price spikes for

several specific generic drugs have also been widely reported in the media.

Methods: We construct two Laspeyres chained price indexes that capture prices of

generic prescription drugs paid by consumers and private health plans. The first reflects

direct out of pocket payments made by the consumer to a pharmacy for dispensing a

generic prescription drug (“direct out-of-pocket CPI”, and the second the total price

received by the pharmacy (“total CPI”) comprised of the direct out-of-pocket payment

from the consumer plus the price paid to the dispensing pharmacy by the insurer on

behalf of the consumer.

Findings: The chained direct out-of-pocket CPI we construct shows a roughly 50%

decline for generic prescription drugs between 2007 and 2016. In addition, between 2007

and 2016 the total CPI for generic prescription drugs fell by nearly 80%.

Conclusions: The U.S. generic prescription pharmaceutical market continues to drive

overall prices downward, although pharmacy price declines are not fully passed through

to consumers. Our evidence suggests that overall affordability is not the main problem in

the generic drug market.

   I.      Introduction




                                             2
       Generic drug prices have received a great deal of attention in the past few years.

Congressional committees, executive agencies and private organizations have all

conducted investigations into the pricing patterns for generic drugs. 1 Price spikes for

certain specific generic drugs have also been widely reported in the media. While these

dramatic price increases have appeared with some regularity, they have typically

involved drugs with small sales volume. 2 Recent statistics on pricing trends for generic

drugs reported by pharmacy benefit manager Express Scripts and by the U.S.

Government Accountability Office document that for private insurers and Medicare,

overall generic prices paid to manufacturers have continued to drift downward. 34 Even

with these reported general price declines, there are on-going concerns about affordability

and the dramatic price increases accompanying supply interruptions in the market for

generic drugs. Some of these concerns emanate from changes in insurance benefit

designs that affect the out-of-pocket costs of health care for consumers, while others

involve the perceived exploitation of market power by manufacturers in some parts of the

generic drug marketplace. Together, this set of concerns has prompted policy makers to

propose actions to make generic drugs more affordable. For example, Senator Elizabeth

Warren (D-MA) has proposed creating a publicly owned and operated generic drug

maker. 5


       Private health insurers are increasingly offering high deductible health plans,

expanding cost sharing for services and shifting costs of health care from insurers to

consumers of care. For example, the Kaiser Family Foundation/HRET’s annual survey of

employer health benefits for 2017 shows a large increase in plans with deductibles of

over $1,000 since 2012. 6 More specifically, pharmacy benefits have also expanded the



                                              3
cost sharing requirements for consumers. Most cost sharing increases for prescription

drugs have been directed to specialty drugs but even generic drugs have been subjected to

increases in copayments and deductible provisions. This has the effect of creating more

consumer exposure to market prices. Such benefit design changes are experienced by

consumers as price changes for health care products and services.


       In this paper we focus on generic prices experienced by consumers in private

health insurance plans serving private and public employees and their dependents. We

report on price indexes constructed from insurance claims paid on behalf of enrollees in

large employee sponsored insurance plans. We construct two price indexes that capture

prices of generic prescription drugs paid by this segment of the health sector. The first

reflects direct out-of-pocket payments made by the consumer to a pharmacy for

dispensing a generic prescription drug (“direct out-of-pocket CPI”), and the second the

total price received by the pharmacy comprised of the direct out-of- pocket payment from

the consumer plus the price paid to the dispensing pharmacy by the insurer on behalf of

the consumer; we name this latter price index the “total CPI” We place both these

consumer price indexes (CPI) that we construct into the context of other recent analyses

of trends in generic prices to offer a more complete view of the price patterns for generic

prescription drugs. In addition, we explore changes in cost sharing arrangements in the

insured populations studied so as to understand trends in the composition of consumer

price indexes for generic drugs.


       The paper is organized into five sections. The section following this Introduction

provides background on consumer prices and issues in summarizing their trends. The




                                             4
third section describes the data used to construct the price indexes. The fourth section

presents the price indexes in graphical form and places them in the context of other

recently released data on price trends for generic prescription drugs. The final section

offers concluding observations.


Assessing Consumer Prices for Generic Drugs

       A consumer price index or CPI is a method of summarizing information on price

changes. The policy focus on the pricing patterns for generic drugs demands that

summary measures of price trends be available that offer a type of weighted average

picture of generic price movements with weights expressing relative quantity proportions

of the various generic drugs. Express Scripts, a pharmacy benefit management company

and the U.S. GAO have recently reported price indexes for generic drugs. Both indexes

focus on the payments made by an insurer to manufacturers for the ingredient cost of

generic drugs. As such these price indexes reflect a portion of the total price and do not

reflect the net out-of-pocket cost to consumers (or direct consumer out-of-pocket price).

Nor do they reflect dispensing fees received by the pharmacy. Thus they do not offer a

view of changes in the affordability of generic drugs for consumers. Both sets of indexes

show overall declines in generic prices through 2016 and 2015 respectively (more

discussion of the results follows below).



       In the out-of-pocket and total CPI price indexes we construct, we use principles of

the CPI as constructed by the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), although the BLS

does not publish separate brand and generic prescription drug price indexes. We allow for

new products to enter the market and construct a so-called chained Laspeyres index. Each



                                             5
time series observation is based on a chained Laspeyres index using the following

equation:

                ∑(𝑝𝑝𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡1 ∙ 𝑞𝑞𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡0 )       ∑(𝑝𝑝𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡2 ∙ 𝑞𝑞𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡1 )              ∑(𝑝𝑝𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡𝑛𝑛 ∙ 𝑞𝑞𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡𝑛𝑛−1 )
        𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝑛𝑛 = ∑(𝑝𝑝                       × ∑(𝑝𝑝                        × … × ∑(𝑝𝑝
                      𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡0 ∙ 𝑞𝑞𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡0   )         𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡1 ∙ 𝑞𝑞𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡1   )              𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡𝑛𝑛−1 ∙ 𝑞𝑞𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡𝑛𝑛−1 )


where 𝑃𝑃𝑡𝑡𝑛𝑛 is the price index for period 𝑡𝑡𝑛𝑛 and 𝑡𝑡0 is a base reference period that anchors the

value of the series. 𝑝𝑝𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 𝑖𝑖𝑖𝑖 the mean price of drug 𝑐𝑐 in period 𝑡𝑡 and 𝑞𝑞𝑐𝑐,𝑡𝑡 is the quantity of

drug 𝑐𝑐 sold in period 𝑡𝑡. New drugs are excluded from this formula in the first month that

they appear in the dataset, and only begin to contribute to the index in the second month

they exist in the data, when price and quantity information is available from the previous

month for purposes of comparison. Exiting drugs are included in the index for only those

months their quantities sold are positive.


        While our focus is on prices paid directly by the consumer, we also report two

other indexes. The first is the Bureau of Labor Statistics Consumer Price Index for all

prescription drugs (“BLS CPI”), an aggregate of brand and generic prescription drug

prices reflecting total revenues received by a dispensing pharmacy from the consumer

and the insurer. Procedures used by the BLS in constructing their aggregate CPI for

prescription drugs are described elsewhere. 7 The second, our “total generic CPI”, is a

price index we construct that represents the total revenue received by the dispensing

pharmacy for a prescription from both the consumer and the insurer. Both payment

sources are included in this index so as to provide context regarding whether changes in

consumer prices reflect cost shifts between consumers and insurers versus general price

changes. This total CPI is also similar to the prescription drug CPI price index




                                                                               6
constructed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, although the later encompasses both brand

and generic drugs whereas our total CPI covers only generic drugs.


       As noted earlier, a variety of important changes in the design of health insurance

and its management have occurred that have the potential to affect the relative shares of

consumer and insurer responsibilities for final payments for prescription drugs and other

medical services. In addition to increases in deductibles and copayments for generic

drugs in private insurance plans, there have been other changes in benefit design such as

increases in the number of cost sharing tiers and so called copay accumulators. All these

tend to increase consumers’ out-of-pocket liability, especially for branded specialty

drugs. In response to some of these benefit design changes, manufacturers have offered

discount coupons that serve to reduce the direct out-of-pocket price to consumers, but

these are mostly applied to brand name drugs. There has also been consolidation in the

supply chain that includes greater concentration among wholesalers, joint ventures

between wholesalers and retailers, and concentration in the market for pharmacy benefit

managers. Together these changes have the potential to alter dispensing fees and other

transaction costs. Our “total generic CPI” measures the total price paid to the dispensing

pharmacy including the ingredient costs, dispensing fees and other costs. It does not take

into account the rebates that are paid by manufacturers to pharmacies and pharmacy

benefit managers ex post the transactions. By comparison, our direct out-of-pocket CPI

tracks only what the consumer pays (all out-of-pocket costs, i.e., deductible, copayment,

and coinsurance).




                                             7
          Finally, we examine changes in cost sharing arrangements in some detail. We do

so by documenting how the use of coinsurance and copayments has changed over time

and the share of insured beneficiaries affected by those changes. We also focus on the

pattern of cost sharing by examining the percentage of generic drug claims that are

subject to zero copayments or coinsurance over time. These patterns enable us to offer a

richer distributional impact interpretation of the results from our constructed aggregate

CPI price indexes.


   III.      Data

          The data for our research comes from the IBM MarketScan Commercial Claims

and Encounters Research Database for the years 2007-2016. These data include de-

identified patient-specific medical inpatient and outpatient claims, outpatient

pharmaceutical data and enrollment data for approximately 40 million people annually.

The data come from a selection of approximately 350 payers consisting of large

employers, health plans, and government and public organizations. The database does not

include claims data from patients over age 65.


          The data contain more than 100 million adjudicated generic drug claims annually.

Generic drugs were identified through national drug codes (NDCs) and a generic

indicator flag contained in the data base. The claims are final and include the total

amount paid by all parties as well as out-of-pocket costs paid by the patient to satisfy any

copayment, coinsurance or deductible obligations. From these two amounts we are also

able to calculate the gross payment made by the insurer to the pharmacy.




                                             8
   IV.      Results

         Recent reports on price movements for generic prescription drugs for privately

insured groups and those covered by the Medicare Part D program document sharp

declines in generic prices overall. 8 In the Medicare program there was an overall drop of

60 percentage points from 2010 through 2015. There was a more modest decline of about

10% for drugs that were generic for the entire period. This is in part because most generic

molecules had reached a competitive equilibrium price point prior to the initial

observation period. While Medicare represents a different population and somewhat

different purchasing arrangements than private insurance, we nevertheless expect the

generic market to function in a similar fashion to that faced by privately insured groups.

The private insurance experience reported by Express Scripts is the most relevant to the

analysis we present. Figure 1 summarizes two Express Scripts price indexes for the

period 2008 through 2015 – one for brands, one for generics. Also included is BLS’

consumer price index, a market basket of commonly used household goods costing

$100.00 in 2008.

          Express Scripts Price Indices Comparison, Absolute (2008-2015)




       The Express Scripts generic price index shows a more than 70% decline in the

price index during the observation period. This suggests that insurers are paying much

less for generic drugs in 2016 than in 2008. Moreover, an increasing number of branded

drugs have lost market exclusivity, and the Express Scripts generic price index

incorporates the price impacts of these new generic products. It is important to note that

because of the so-called generic cliff that occurred around 2012, this index captures

competitive adjustments for a large number of newly launched generic products. During

this same time period the Express Scripts index for brand name drugs grew by 164%,

while the consumer price index increased by about 12%.

       We construct two price indexes using the IBM MarketScan data for the years

2007 through 2017; they appear on Figure 2. The first “out-of-pocket CPI” reflects

consumers’ out of pocket spending, a true CPI. It is the saw tooth curve on Figure 2. The

second is the total price paid by the payer and consumer (“total CPI”) and that is the

lower curve on Figure 2. To put this into context we scale the indexes to the level of the

BLS’ CPI for all (brand plus generic) prescription drugs in January 2007 (the BLS’ CPI

for all prescription drugs is 367, indexed to 100 in 1982). The BLS’ index is included in

Figure 2 as the upward sloping curve.

       Chained Direct Out of Pocket Consumer Price and Total Price Indexes




                                            11
       Figure 2 offers several key insights about the direct out-of-pocket prices facing

consumers for generic prescription drug products. The first and most important --

evidenced by the lowest trend pattern -- is that consumers appear to be benefitting from

the overall price reductions for generic drugs reflected in data on payer obligations for

generic drug costs. The chained direct out-of-pocket CPI we report (the middle curve in

Figure 2) shows a roughly 50% decline in the out-of-pocket costs for generic prescription

drugs between 2007 and 2016. The jagged annual pattern of prices that appears in the

Figure reflects the fact that deductibles are typically reset on the first day of the calendar

year. Thus, on the first of the year in each calendar year the price to consumers increase

as they become responsible for the full cost of the generic prescription and not just the

copayment or coinsurance after the deductible threshold is attained. Nevertheless if one

tracks just the high “price” points in each year, we observe a decline in the level that the

high point reaches each successive year. The graph also suggests that the increases from

the prior year’s low “price” point to the price at the beginning of each subsequent

calendar year has increased somewhat, consistent with observations from benefit design

surveys that deductible thresholds have been increasing over time.


       Figure 2 highlights the stark contrast between the generic out-of-pocket CPI and

the BLS’ overall drug CPI (or the Express Scripts CPI). Since 2007 the BLS’ overall

prescription drug CPI increased about 44%, while the mean monthly out-of-pocket CPI

over the 12 months in 2016 was about 58% less than its value in 2007. Notably, the BLS’

CPI has increased quite consistently over the period with a slight slowdown occurring in

late 2015 and late 2016.




                                              12
       The lowest curve in Figure 2 represents an index for the total price paid by

insurers and consumers to dispensing pharmacies for generic prescription drugs, based on

our IBM Health MarketScan Commercial Claims and Encounters Research Database.

The total CPI curve reveals that the overall price movement for generic drugs has

consistently declined since 2007. Notably, between 2007 and 2016 prices for generic

prescription drugs fell by nearly 80%. The price reductions since 2013 have been more

modest than were the reductions between 2011 and 2013, i.e., the period that covered the

generic cliff except for a drop at the beginning of 2016. In considering the change in

consumer prices compared to those in the overall price change of generic drugs we

observe that it appears that changes in consumer prices have been proportionately

smaller. That is, between 2007 and 2016 consumers’ out-of-pocket prices fell by roughly

22% less than total prices paid to pharmacies. Nevertheless, in the most recent three-year

period generic prices paid by consumers have seen larger proportional declines especially

at the end of the calendar year when coverage is most complete.


       We have explored further the differential drop between the total price paid (“total

CPI”) and consumer out-of-pocket prices (“out-of-pocket CPI”) by delving into changes

in cost sharing arrangements. Table 1 reports the changing mix of cost sharing

arrangements over time as found in the MarketScan claims database. We identify plans

where the cost sharing is predominantly coinsurance, copayments or a mix of the two, by

share of plan types and share of enrollees. The table shows a notable move away over

time from fixed copayment and a greater reliance on pure coinsurance or a mixed

package of coinsurance and copayments. Specifically, as seen in the right panel of Table

1, in 2007 85% of enrollees were in plans where out-of-pocket costs for generic drugs



                                            13
were defined by a fixed copayment. That percentage declined to 57% by 2016. This trend

coupled with higher deductibles during the 2007-2016 time period explains why out-of-

pocket prices appear to have declined less than the prices paid by insurers and patients

together.

       Figure 3 shows the net effect on the share of the total price of generic drugs paid

for out-of-pocket by consumers (i.e., out-of-pocket payment divided by total payment

received by pharmacy). Like the earlier out-of-pocket CPI for generic drugs we observe a

saw tooth pattern for the percent paid out-of-pocket. We also see that the highest out of

pocket price (the first day of each new year) declined from 25% to about 20% of the total

price. Similarly, the lowest out of pocket price (typically at year end) declined from about

20% in 2007-2008 to nearly 10% at the end of 2016. Furthermore the underlying data

reveals (though not shown in Table 1) that the share of transactions with a zero




                                            14

Concluding Observations

       The eye-catching increases in certain generic drug products have drawn attention

to generic drugs as a potential source of the most recent rapid rise in spending on

prescription drugs. Even though the 1,000% increases and more for drugs that have long

lost patent protection raise important and legitimate concerns about how various

segments of the industry are functioning, as has evidence of increasing consolidation in

the prescription pharmaceuticals market, the broader data on the overall behavior of

prices in the U.S. generic prescription pharmaceutical industry paints a different picture.



                                            15
The U.S. generic prescription pharmaceutical market continues to drive overall prices

downward. Thus, our evidence suggests that overall affordability is not the main issue in

the generic drug market and that this segment of the U.S. prescription drug market is not

responsible for reported growth in prices and spending for prescription drugs overall.



       Concerns have been raised about whether consumers are benefiting from the price

declines because insurers and prescription benefit managers have been offering products

that increasingly shift costs from insurers to consumers. Our evidence finds that

consumers are experiencing more burdensome cost sharing and that in fact consumers

are bearing a greater share of generic drug costs, yet on balance we find that consumers

have experienced substantial overall price declines for generic drugs.



       One important question raised by the differential patterns of price declines

between overall and out-of-pocket consumer prices is how the benefits of price declines

are being shared across the larger supply chain. Our CPI analysis shows that the full

amount of the declines in generic prices is not being passed through to consumers. While

a number of “back of the envelope” estimates have been made about the degree of pass-

through of price reductions to consumers, 9 we believe more systematic analysis of this

phenomenon is needed. 10 Moreover, our results also suggest a closer look at the workings

of the entire generic drug supply chain (manufacturer, wholesaler, pharmaceutical benefit

manager, insurer, and retailer) merits attention.
