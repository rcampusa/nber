                  INFLATION AND LABOR-MARKET ADJUSTMENT


                                 ABSTRACT


         The implications of downward nominal and exante   real   wage rigidity,
and   of wage contracting for the dispersion of relative wage   changes in the
presence   of price inflation are examined. Rigidity implies that unexpected

inflation will raise the variability of relative wage changes; contracting

implies unexpected inflation reduces variability. Using data on manufactur-

ing industries for 1955—81, and on private nonfarm industries for 1965—81,

these hypotheses are studied. The dispersion in relative wage cnanges is

reduced by greater price inflation. Most of the reduction is a response

to unexpected inflation: Expected inflation has little impact on dispersion.

These findings hold for subperiods within the sample, and are robust to

different choices of measures of price expectations, including those of

the Livingston survey, the Survey Research Center household data, and ARMA

forecasts. They stand in striking contrast to the commonly accepted result

that price inflation is associated with greater dispersion of relative price

changes. They suggest that inflation reduces the ability of relative wages

to signal disequilibria among labor markets.

  I. Introduction

           A vast array of studies has examined how the labor market affects

  inflation. In this study I reverse the process and examine how inflation

 affects adjustment in labor markets.      Similarly, a rapidly growing
 literature has shown that inflation raises the variability of relative

 price changes, and has interpreted this finding as demonstrating the effects

 of inflation on the allocative efficiency of the market mechanism. (See

 Vining—Elwertowskj, 1976; Parks, 1978; Fischer, 1982; and Cukierman-

 Wachtel, 1982.) The major empirical focus of this study is an examination
 of how   inflation affects   the variability of relative wage changes.

          With rare exceptions (Altonji, 1982, and Brown, 1982, are the best

 examples) modern theories of macroeconomic adjustment have not been tested

 on the labor market; where they have, the examination has been restricted

 to aggregate wage inflation or employment determination.
                                                              So too, atheoretical
empirical studies of cyclical variation in inequality in wage levels are

legion (most recently, Wachter, 1970); and one study (Ashenfelter-Layard,

1983) correlated wage inflation with inequality in the rate of wage increases.

Nonehas made a study of the determinants of inequality in relative wage
changes comparable to the studies of relative price changes, and none has
used   empirical work on inequality in rates of wage changes to examine the

validity of theories of macroeconomic adjustment.

          In Section II I outline how changes in the rate of price inflation

affect relative wage adjustment under two alternative theories of the

determination of relative wage changes. The first is a simple Keynesian

notion of downward wage rigidity; the second is based on notions of wage

contracting. The implications of these adjustment mechanisms -for the

effects of inflation on inequality of relative
                                                  wage changes are drawn out.

In Section III, I test the implications for inequality of relative wage

changes on two different data sets.      In addition to providing evidence on the

validity of these theories, the tests provide a new, strongly—supported fact

describing the adjustment of labor markets.      This result stands, moreover,

in surprising contrast to results others have obtained on the effects of

price inflation on the distribution of relative price changes.


II. Theories of Adjustment and Relative Wages

      Throughout this section I base the discussion on a standard model of

wage determination:

(1)       w=p+yp+ay.,
                                         the instantaneous rate of wage increase;
where i is an economic subunit; w is

e and      are the instantaneous rates of expected and unexpected aggregate

                                        rate of change of excess demand in the i'th
price inflation; y. is the nominal

                              and       are parameters,   <   1.   This general
sector, deflated by p; and

model can be modified to analyze the effects of alternative assumptions

about wage determination.

A. A Simple Keynesian Assumption

        Perhaps the essence of Keynesian adjustment is the assumption of

 downward nominal wage rigidity. How does price inflation affect adjustment

 in the labor market under this assumption? Rees (1970) has claimed, "A

 gently rising price level will lubricate relative price changes...

 Tobin (1972) argues that inflation is beneficial in improving matches

 between workers and jobs. These views are consistent with the casual

 observation that inflation enables firms to provide real rewards to those

 whose productivity is increasing while cutting real rewards to those who

 are becoming less productive without reducing their nominal wages. We. modify

 (1) by assuming further that y is a random variable with some distribu-

 tion function, G(y), and density function, g(y), and that:
                                             —3—

 (2)         w1 = max     {e + u +    ,
 This modification means that wage increases are either e +           +     or
 zero, with           =   if    <_(e + ,rpU)/a =     The average wage increase

 in the economy is then:


 (3)        w =   c;[e +         + ay] g(y)dy = [l_G(y*)]A + a f*yg(y)dy,
              e
 where A =        +

       The variance in the rate of increase in money wages across subunits

 is:

 (4)        Var w. =      f[A + ay — w}(y)dy + w2G(y*).
Letting a      1 temporarily to simplify the arithmetic, and differentiating

in (4) with respect to A, one can show that:

        Var w./A = 2G(y*) [l_G(y*)]w*,

where w is the mean increase in those subunits with positive (nonzero)

wage changes. Since A increases with both e and p's, the variance of

money wage changes will be increased as price inflation mitigates the effect

of nominal wage rigidity. Moreover, the effect of expected price inflation

will be greater than that of unexpected price inflation, for

If inflation does make labor markets work more efficiently by allowing the

effects of variations in y. to be reflected in wage changes, we should observe

a positive relation between the variance in wage changes and the rate of

price inflation. This positive relation will be greater for expected than

for unexpected inflation.

       One might argue that the form of rigidity rn (2) characterized well a

world in which inflation was rare, but is a poor characterization of a world

in which price changes are generally positive. One might modify (2) by replac-

ing the zero with pe; this respecification implies that all workers receive

a wage increase at least equal to the expected rate of price inflation.

 C. A Contracting Approach
        Stated very succinctly, an increase in wage contracting——an increased

  reliance upon pos changes in price inflation in setting wages——alters (1)

  by increasing y and reducing ct.    In the extreme case of complete indexing with

                                                                                  0.

  Assuming that greater uncertainty, denoted by u, affects these wage—setting

  parameters in this manner, (1) can be rewritten:

      This derivation is, unfortunately, completely mechanical.                   The reason why

 y>O is given by Gray (1978), who shows that increased uncertainty about

 inflation makes more indexing optimal, The other part of the issue is why

 optimizing agents might choose to rely more on wage indexation and less on

 the vicissitudes of the market for goods or services they are producing.

One can rationalize this by considering the worker in a typical industry

who must purchase a market basket of goods, the price of which is

increasing at a rate p, but whose wage, according to (1), is partly

determined by y.. Let the average perceived correlation between p and y.

be denoted by r0. At the uncertainty denoted by this correlation, the

average worker will Supply labor to the average industry for combinations

of indexed wages and a risk premium, contingent upon y.,, no worse than

those combinations shown by the frontier U   in Figure 1. The frontier
                                          r0
slopes down because workers require a greater risk premium to forgo

indexation; it is convex because, the less security workers derive from

indexation, the greater the incremental risk premium required to leave the

workers no worse off.

     in competitive product markets employers must offer workers a

combination of indexation and risk premiums along U                   .   For the typical
                                                                 r0

 employer, the best combinations of indexation and   risk   premiums that are

 consistent with obtaining workers are shown by the isoutility of profits

 curve 10 in Figure 1. Lower curves are more desirable to the employer.

 The curves slope downward: Larger premiuTms obviously reduce profits, while

 greater indexation reduces profits if it is associated with more frequent,

 costly wage adjustments.

      One of the effects of increased uncertainty may be to decrease the

 correlation workers perceive between p and y.,. The lowered correlation,

 to r1, causes the utility frontier U in Figure 1 to become flatter at any

 combination of indexation and wage premium. So long as workers are risk

 averse, the increased uncertainty reduces their willingness to trade off

 indexed wages which protect their purchasing power for additional

contingent risk premiums.

     The typical worker's utility frontier rotates to U          Assuming
                                                            r1
product markets are competitive and employers are risk neutral, the optimal

contract moves to point B, with a greater reliance on indexing and lessened

reliance on payments based on conditions in the individual product market.-"

This change implies that y in equation (I') will increase and a decrease

as the extent of uncertainty rises.


C. Summary of Implications

     The two approaches carry specific and contrasting implications for the

effects of inflation on the variance of relative wage changes. These are

summarized in Table 1. Absent any good definition of what uncertainty

about inflation means, we assume that unexpected inflation is one proxy

for the extent of that uncertainty; another is discussed in Section III.

If we make this assumption, the implications of contracting for the
                                       —8—


variance of relative wage changes are quite different from those of the

hypotheses involving some form of wage rigidity.            Thus an examination of

the effect of price inflation on the dispersion of wage changes provides

evidence on whether inflation does aid labor markets to work more

efficiently.

III.    The Variability of Relative Wage Changes

       To capture expectations about inflation I use the Livingston survey of

economists, most of whom were in private industry (Carlson, 1977); the

Survey Research Center survey of a random sample of households (Juster-

Comment, 1980); and ARNA forecasts of inflation. The Livingston surveys are

 taken semiannually in June and December, when information about the CPI through
                                       available. Accordingly, I let each observa—

 each series by taking the most recent six or twelve months of changes in the

 using six—month inflation expectations is the difference between the

 annualized rate of change in the CPI between April 1981 and October 1981,

 and the June 1981 average response in the Livingston survey.

      The SRC data were collected quarterly
                                              through 1979, monthly since then.
 I use the second and the fourth quarters'
                                             observations to correspond to
 the June and December data from the
                                       Livingston survey before 1980, and
 use the May and November data for 1980 and 1981.
                                                     Inflationary expectations
 are also calculated based on continuously—updated
                                                     forecasts from an ARNA

 (5, 1) process.—

      It is unclear what are the appropriate proxy variables for greater

uncertainty about inflation. Lacking any theory of what is a good measure

of this type of uncertainty, I experiment with
                                                 alternative proxies. Included
among these are Pu and the variances among the respondents in
                                                                 the Livingston
and the SRC surveys of the estimates of the rate of inflation.

     Equation (6) suggests that a measure of the dispersion of changes

in output across sectors be included along with measures of inflation or

inflation uncertainty as independent variables in estimating equations

describing the variance in relative wage changes.
                                                     Expecting that periods of
incomes policy would produce reductions in the inequality of relative wage

changes, I also add dummy variables for the period of the Kennedy—Johnson

wage—price guideposts and the Nixon controls to these equations. Since the

latter were statistically insignificant and did not affect the other parameter

estimates, they were deleted from the equations. The guidepost
                                                                  variable, G,
takes the value one from 1962
                                through the first half of 1966. The basic
equation to be estimated is:


(7) log (Var w) =
                                             y)+4G+s
                                            —10—



where      is a disturbance term.

      The equations to be estimated in this section are based on two

different sets of data. The first covers most of the private nonfarm

economy. The seven sectors are construction and mining; finance,

insurance and real estate; services; wholesale and retail trades transpor-

tation and public utilities; durable manufacturing, and nondurable

manufacturing.' Except for the two            manufacturing   sectors, the data on

hourly earnings needed to construct Var w. are only available since 1964;
                                                               Var w is calculated as:
thus the estimated equations cover 1965—1981 only.

time t. The series on Va w is shown in the first column of Table 2; there

is no obvious trend in it. Var               is constructed analogously using data

on nominal national income by sector deflated by an appropriate price

 index .'

                                                      1955—81. Var w is calculated

 as in (8), based on the average hourly earnings of production workers by

 industry. The series is listed in column (2) of Table 2; like Var w for

 the private nonfarm economy, it too shows no particular trend. The variance
                                                                   of changes in the

        Table 3 presents the estimates of equations describing
                                                               log (Var wt) for
   the private nonfarm economy; Table 4 presents the same
                                                          equations estimated
  for manufacturing. In each table columns (l)—(3) list
                                                         parameter estimates
  based on six—month inflation rates and the Livingston six—month
                                                                  inflation
  forecasts; columns (4)—(6) list
                                      estimates using twelve—month Livingston
  forecasts and price changes;
                               columns (7) and (8) use the SRC data, and
  columns (9) use the ARMA forecasts.
                                       Comparing the estimates in column (1)
  in each table to those in
                              column (2) (or the estimates in column (4) to
  those in columns (5), (7) and (9)), one sees clearly that,
                                                             no matter which
  sectors, price expectations or inflation horizon is used,
                                                            accounting for
  inflationary expectations improves the
                                            ability to track variations in the
 dispersion of relative
                          wage changes. The adjusted 2 is greater in each
 equation that decomposes price inflation into expected and
                                                            unexpected
 components. Actual inflation alone reduces
                                                dispersion in both samples,
 though not significantly so in the data
                                            from manufacturing. If one ignores
 inflationary expectations, though, one would fail to capture the
                                                                  mechanism
 through which inflation affects the
                                     dispersion of wage changes.
     The most important findings are contained in columns (2),
                                                                (5), (7)
and (9) of each table. In each
                                sample, for each inflation horizon and for
each series on price
                       expectations unexpected price inflation produces a
significant jye effect on the dispersion of wage changes.
                                                                    Expected
inflation has no significant
                               impact on dispersion except for the ARNA
forecasts   in Table 3 (though the
                                     coefficients on Pu and e are different
from each other fairly at low levels of significance_l.9>/t/>12)

results accord fully with the implications of the
                                                     contracting hypothesis
outlined in Section II,

 to unexpected inflation. The negative effect of Pu sharply contradicts

 the notion that inflation allows wage changes to reflect real factors more

 closely: More rapid price inflation compresses wage changes. Perhaps the

 only   support for the hypothesis of downward nominal or ex ante real wage
 rigidity is that the impact of e     is   more positive than that of U    Since   the
 latter's impact is negative, and since e has no effect, this is awfully weak
 support.    It seems fair to conclude that, though the results do not (indeed,

 could not) disprove the existence of downward nominal or ex ante real wage

 rigidity, they suggest very strongly that such rigidity describes wage—setting

 since the l950s in the United States very badly.

        Estimates of the equations describing the log variance of relative

 wage changes that include measures of the dispersion of forecasts

 of inflation are presented in columns (3), (6) and (8) of Tables 3

 and 4. Only in those equations for manufacturing industries in which

 the Livingston expectations data are used does the variance of

 inflation forecasts induce a significant reduction in the dispersion

of relative wage changes (though the coefficients are negative in

the other four cases). While providing some support for the con-

tracting hypothesis, these equations clearly are less successful

than those that include the actual rate of inflation or its decomposi-

tion into expected and unexpected inflation.     Given the difficulty of

identifying proxies for uncertainty about inflation, one might infer that

both sets of results support the
                                   contracting hypothesis.

     The results on the effect of expected and unexpected inflation

stand in sharp contrast to those in the literature that examines the

role inflation plays in affecting variation in relative prices. As

Parks (1978) has shown for relative price variation, I have shown that
                                     —16—


variation in relative wage changes is unaffected by anticipated inflation.

The dispersion diminishes with unexpected inflation in prices, while the

literature suggests relative price variability increases with unexpected

inflation. The diminution in relative wage increases can be viewed as

a reduction in the ability of relative wages to reflect variations in the

relative demand for lab.or by sector. Thus, following Friedman's (1977)

argument that inflation reduces the ability of relative prices to function

as allocative signals, the results here suggest that it does so by

compressing relative variation (in this case, relative wage variation)

rather than by widening it. That studies of relative price variation fail

to find this compression may be due to misspecification——their failure to

include measures o variation in the relative demand for commodities.

     An increase in the variance of changes in output produces the expected

positive effect on the dispersion of relative wage changes. This impact

 is significantly positive for nearly all formulations of the estimating

 equation and   data   sets. It implies that the failure to include changes in

relative demand when examining the effect of price inflation on the

dispersion of wage (or price) changes will produce an incomplete descriptIon

 of the underlying process. The other variable in the equations, a dunimy for

 the Kennedy—Johnson wage—price guideposts, sharply reduced the variability

 of wage changes. The reductions were roughly 50 percent from the rest of

 1965—81 in the private nonfarm sector, and were 60 percent in manufacturing

 from the rest of 1955—81. That the reduction was greater within manufacturing

 than within the nonf arm sector is consistent with the guideposts' focus on

 the larger firms in manufacturing.

      A number of alternative specifications of the equations in Tables 3

 and 4 were estimated, each embodying some alternative variable correlated

  with unexpected inflation and thus perhaps accounting for the surprising

  results obtained here. For
                                example, one might expect that more widespread
 unionization would reduce the variation
                                                 in relative wage increases, as union
 wage bargains focus less on labor—market
                                                 conditions than does nonunion wage—
 setting A     measure of the fraction of the work force unionized did not
 affect the coefficients on the inflation terms in the
                                                       equations, nor did
 the extent of unionism affect
                               relative wage variability. Similarly, a
 greater prevalence of indexed labor
                                       contracts might be expected to account
 partly for our results, because more
                                          rapid inflation leads to greater
 indexation. However, when the fraction of the work force
                                                          covered by
 cost—of—living escalators was included,
                                             only a slight reduction in the
 estimated impact of unexpected inflation occurred.2'
                                                             The results in Tables
 3 and 4 are also robust to the
                                  inclusion of the rate of change of an index

of average wage increases. This should increase one's confidence in
                                                                     the
results as reflections of increased indexing, rather than as partial reflec-

tions of other conditions in the labor market. A catch—all time trend

also added to the equations; it too had little effect on the estimated

effects of inflation, nor was the trend itself significant.2P-'

       The structure of most industrial
                                          economies was sharply affected by
the rise in energy prices in the early l970s, as indicated by a
                                                                temporary
increase in the extent of structural
                                     unemployment (Lilien, 1982). This
important change may   be accounting for our results: The reduced
                                                                       variability
of   relative wage changes that we have shown is associated with more rapid
inflation may   be a reflection of the simultaneous rapid
                                                              change in relative
factor prices instead. To examine this the basic equation was reestimated

interest in (8) are presented in Tables 5 and 6.

    As the Tables show, even during the post—OPEC period unexpected inflation

reduced the variability of relative wages. Anticipated inflation had

little effect on the dispersion of relative wage changes in the data for the

private nonfarm sector, but did have significant effects on dispersion

within manufacturing. The results for the period before 1973 are very weak

for the private nonfarm sector, perhaps because of the narrow range of

observations on rates of anticipated and unanticipated inflation between 1965

and 1973. For manufacturing, on which a longer time series of data are

available, the results for the first subperiod are qualitatively similar to

those in Table 4.         Indeed,   despite the apparent differences in some of the

coefficients        between the subperiods, we cannot reject any of the hypotheses
about
                                              "-
        pooling the data for these subperiods.—
        Table   7   presents the means and   extreme values of the series on price

inflation (expected and unexpected). The ranges of p'' are quite large.

Applying them to the estimated responses of the dispersion of relative wage

changes demonstrates that they produce effects that are substantial as well as

significant. In the private nontarm sector the dispersion was between 61

and 68 percent lower (depending upon the equation used) at the peak rate

of unexpected inflation compared to the lowest rate; in manufacturing the

comparable range of effects is between 42 and 54 percent.


V. Conclusions

        This study demonstrates the existence of a striking relation of the

response of labor markets to price inflation. The variability of relative

wage changes decreases when price inflation accelerates. The decrease is

mainly a response to unanticipated inflation; anticipated inflation has

little impact on the dispersion of changes in relative wages. The results

are quite robust with respect to changes in the sample period, the measures

of anticipated and unanticipated inflation, and the choice of sectors over

which the measures of dispersion are calculated.

       The negative relation between unexpected inflation and the dispersion

of relative wage changes is quite inconsistent with the notion that inflation

allows labor markets to work more smoothly by ameliorating the impact of

downward nominal wage rigidity. Rather, the finding can be interpreted as

implying that unexpected inflation reduces the responsiveness of relative

wages to changes in real factors. This implies that unexpected inflation

hinders the ability of wages to allocate labor among industries in response

to changes in relative demands. The finding is consistent with the role of

increased uncertainty affecting workers' desires to minimize risk in implicit

wage   contracts. It is also consistent with workers entering the lab or—
market in response to unanticipated increases in nominal wages (Lucas—Rapping,
1969) and supplying their labor to industries where demand is growing most
rapidly   and thus where relative wages would be rising most rapidly if the

size of the labor force remained unchanged).-'

       Inflation does not have the desirable side—effect of enabling employers

to   restructure relative wages more rapidly than otherwise in order to
reflect changes in relative demand. Quite the contrary: Relative wage
rigidity   is increased by inflation. We have attributed this to workers'

seeking to reduce fluctuations in their purchasing power by linking wage

increases more closely to aggregate price changes than to changes in excess

demand in their industry. The increase suggests that one cannot point to

the labor market as a sector of the economy whose functioning is improved

by price inflation.

 1. Sachs (1979) presents evidence on the importance of real wage rigidity
 during the l970s in a number of industrialized countries.

 2. The assumption of risk—averse workers and risk—neutral firms has been
 used in the contracting literature by, among others, Azariadis (1975).
 So long as the degree of relative risk aversion among workers exceeds that
 among employers, the result in the text will hold.

 3.  This process implies 2=1/2 years of lagged terms. Experiments ith longer
 lags never yielded higher R2.

 4. The data used to calculate Var w1 and Var y are taken from the CITIBASE
 data file.

5.  To deflate the nominal flows of national income by sector, I use: For
construction and mining, the implicit price deflator for private nonresidential
structures; for services, and for finance, etc., the CPI—U for services,
excluding rent; for wholesale and retail trade, the producer price index
for all commodities; for transportation and public utilities, the implicit
price deflator for personal consumption expenditures on transportation; and
for manufacturing, durable and nondurable, the respective implicit price
deflators for personal consumption expenditures.
6.
    Including c e in the equations in columns (2), (5) and (7) in Tables
3 and 4 changesthe results little. The significance of the terms in p
decreases very slightly; that of p declines even further below what is
shown in the Tables; and the dispersion of expected inflation itself produces
the same negative, though generally insignificant effect on the logarithm of
the dispersion of relative wage changes.

7.
    Relatively greater reliance on price changes than on unemployment in
wage—setting in unionized industries is demonstrated by, among others,
Hamermesh (1970).

8. Between 1957 and 1981 the fraction of workers in the U.S. who were
covered by a negotiated cost—of—living clause ranged from .027 to .069. The
highest values occurred in 1958—1959, and in 1975—1977; both are periods
that followed an acceleration in the rate of inflation.

9. The small effects on the parameter estimates do not contradict the
             of our application of contracting to the determination of
relative wage changes. Only a tiny fraction of workers are covered by
formal indexation. Our argument and, indeed, the whole contracting
literature applies to implicit arrangements. Thus the most one can do by
accounting for the fraction of workers covered by escalator clauses is to
limit the data to the overwhelming majority of the work force whose wages
may be affected by implicit contracting.

10. Also, tests of Granger and Sims causality in each sample and for each
measure of pu could not reject the hypothesis that it is exogenous in the
equations presented in Tables 3 and 4.

11. None of the F—statistics testing the correctness of pooling exceeds 1.6,
and most are below one. With the degrees of freedom implied by the sample
size and the number of regressors, none comes anywhere near to being significant
at even the 10 percent level.

12. While this is possible, the underlying requirement——that workers supply
labor elastically in response to transitory changes in perceived real wages——
is not supported by the data (see MaCurdy, 1981).
