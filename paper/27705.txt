The Tax Elasticity of Capital Gains and Revenue-Maximizing Rates

                                           ABSTRACT

This paper uses a direct-projections approach to estimate the effect of capital gains taxation on
realizations at the state level, and then develops a framework for determining revenue-
maximizing rates at the federal level. We find that the elasticity of revenues with respect to the
tax rate over a ten-year period is -0.5 to -0.3, indicating that capital gains tax cuts do not pay for
themselves, and that a 5 percentage point rate increase would yield $18 to $30 billion in annual
federal tax revenue. Our long-run estimates yield revenue-maximizing capital gains tax rates of
38 to 47 percent.

    The tax elasticity of capital gains realizations features centrally in U.S. fiscal policy debates. In the 1990s
"capital gains tax wars," U.S. Treasury and economic officials argued that the responsiveness of realizations
to capital gains tax rates was large enough that capital gains tax cuts would pay for themselves (Auten and
Cordes, 1991). Others (e.g., Gravelle, 1991) asserted that the true responsiveness was much lower, so capital
tax cuts would generate substantial fiscal cost. This issue has re-emerged in every presidential administration
since 1990 and plays a key role in ongoing tax reform plans. For instance, this elasticity is the central parameter
governing the revenue scores of Vice President Biden's plan to increase capital gains rates as well as President
Trump's proposal reducing capital gains taxes.
    Informing these policy debates is difficult because a wide range of estimates exist. Feldstein, Slemrod and
Yitzhaki (1980), for example, estimate an elasticity with respect to the capital gains tax rate of -3.8, whereas
the estimate of Burman and Randolph (1994) is -0.22. Moreover, there is limited empirical evidence in recent
decades when there has been lower inflation, more widespread use of diversified investment vehicles, and a
bigger role of pass-through firms, which have accounted for nearly half of capital gains realizations in recent
years (Smith, Yagan, Zidar and Zwick, 2019).
    This paper estimates the effect of capital gains taxes on tax revenues and quantifies the implications for
revenue-maximizing tax rates in the United States. We use a direct-projections approach and new state-level
panel data on capital gains realizations and the migration of the wealthy to estimate the effects of state capital
gains tax changes on realizations and location decisions. Our data, which range from 1980 to 2016, allow us
to characterize responsiveness in a more recent period than most of the literature, and our direct-projections
approach enables us to estimate effects over different time horizons and test for dynamic effects. We then build
a simple framework to relate these state-level effects to a policy-relevant elasticity at the national level, which is
the state-level realization response after removing migration effects and accounting for average state taxes and
a minor aggregation adjustment term. We find that this policy-relevant elasticity of realizations with respect
to capital gains tax rates over a ten year period is approximately -0.3 to -0.5 depending on the specification,
and that the estimates are larger in absolute value in the short and medium run than in the long run.
    We highlight three implications of these elasticity estimates. First, these estimates are well below an
elasticity of one in absolute value, which indicates that capital gains tax cuts do not pay for themselves. We
formally test and reject the null of an elasticity of -1.0. Second, these estimates suggest that raising capital
gains tax rates by 5 percentage points (in the current regime with unlimited deferral and step-up-basis at death)
would yield 18 to 30 billion in annual tax revenue, which is roughly twice the amount implied by the current
approach of the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT), which according to Gravelle (2020) currently uses an
elasticity of -0.7 to score proposals.1 Third, our long-run elasticity estimates correspond to point estimates for
the revenue-maximizing capital gains tax rates of 38 to 47 percent.
    Using state-level panel data provides more reforms and closer comparison groups than time-series analysis
at the federal level. At the federal level, there are not only fewer reforms but also many confounding factors.
    1 Gravelle (2020) also notes that Treasury had used an estimate of -1.0 previously, but has since moved closer to the JCT's

estimate. In addition, Dowd, McClelland and Muthitacharoen (2015), whose paper first appeared as a technical working paper
(JCX-56-12) of joint work of the staff of the JCT and CBO, estimate an elasticity of -0.72.




                                                               2
Figure 1 plots realizations and the maximum long-run capital gains tax rate since 1980. It shows that some
capital gains tax changes are associated with sizable movements in realizations, but the responses are quite
unequal across reforms. It is also quite difficult to separate these movements from unrelated macroeconomic
trends and asset price fluctuations. One approach is to difference out macroeconomic trends by comparing the
realization series in one county with that of a similar country. In panels (b) and (c) of Figure 1, we implement
this approach using the realization series of the U.K. around cuts to the U.S. capital gains tax rate in 1997
and 2003. These panels, however, show how precarious this approach is--it yields unstable elasticity estimates
that exhibit large variance in non-tax-related country-year shocks and inherits the limitations of cross-country
regressions.
    Our state-level approach complements prior work by Bogart and Gentry (1995), who use state panel data
from 1979 to 1990 to estimate the effect of capital gains tax rates on on state-level realizations per tax return,
and ongoing work by Bakija and Gentry (2014), who use a similar approach for a longer panel from 1950-2007.
Relative to this valuable work, our paper uses a different empirical approach and new data to provide new
policy-relevant elasticity estimates based on a more recent sample that is closer to current conditions in terms
of inflation, pass-through prevalence, and tax code. By having a better measure of location decisions of the
wealthy, our approach also provides a more accurate accounting for migration effects, and thus policy-relevant
realization effects, which difference out migration responses. Moreover, we use a direct-projections approach
that contributes new graphical evidence on the dynamics of realizations around tax changes. Scoring capital
gains tax changes requires estimating how realizations evolve over a ten-year period around the tax change,
which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been done in prior work.
    Much of the literature on capital gains in the 1990s and 2000s (e.g., Burman and Randolph, 1994; Auerbach
and Siegel, 2000; Poterba, 2002; Auten and Joulfaian, 2004) has focused on the distinction between temporary
and permanent effects, and used individual-level data to estimate these effects. The interpretation of these
individual-level results, however, is complicated by factors such as strategic loss-harvesting, observations with
zero realizations, and movement in and out of top income brackets depending on the timing of big realizations.
While standard approaches for addressing these concerns exist (e.g., selection corrections (Heckman, 1979) to
account for realization decisions and instruments for tax rates), aggregating within a state-year cell avoids
these complexities and also provides a longer panel than many existing individual-level studies. In addition,
mapping estimates of micro-level responses, which are often person-weighted rather than dollar-weighted, into
policy-relevant macro effects on tax revenues can be difficult.2 Indeed, Joint Committee on Taxation (1990)
highlighted similar concerns when evaluating the available literature to score reforms during the capital tax
wars. Some recent promising work using bunching approaches (e.g., Dowd and McClelland, 2019; Buhlmann,
Doerrenberg, Loos and Voget, 2020) also faces the challenge of mapping bunching responses into policy-relevant
elasticities. Our state-level approach has the benefit of estimating aggregate responses, while also providing
considerable variation over a long panel.
     2 For example, choosing the weights (especially for those with losses) and accounting for heterogeneous responses introduces

difficulties when aggregating from micro to macro.




                                                                3
1.      Data on Capital Gains Taxation and Realizations
Our primary outcome variable is realized capital gains by state and year from Smith, Zidar and Zwick (2020),
which is the sum of short-term and long-term net realizations and is available from 1980 to 2016.3 We inflate
nominal data using CPI-U from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to measure realizations in 2018 USD. We also
use data from 1980 to 2016 on the number of wealthy individuals by state and year from Smith, Zidar and
Zwick (2020). Specifically, we focus on the number of individuals in the top 10% and top 1% of the national
wealth distribution. Finally, some specifications use population and output data from the US Census Bureau
and the Bureau of Economic Analysis.
     We relate these state-level outcomes to the net-of-capital-gains-tax rate in state s in year t, which is (1 - s,t ),
where s,t is the maximum marginal federal and state tax rate. This variable comes from NBER TAXSIM and
measures the combined effect of federal and state taxes, incorporating the deductibility of state and local taxes,
the phase-out of deductions, and other state-year-specific features of the tax code. For instance, in terms of
deductibility, 1 - st  1 - tf ed - (1 - tf ed )  st
                                                 state
                                                       .
     The tax rate data are available from 1977 to 2017, which is a slightly longer range of years than the
realizations and count data. We use these extra years when estimating longer-term effects. For example,
although we cannot use a state tax reform in 1978 to identify the short-term impact on realizations, it can still
contribute to the identification of longer-term effects.4
     Table 1 provides summary statistics. On average, state capital gains tax rates are 4 percent, but they range
from 0 to 15 percent in our sample. Figure 1 plots the maximum federal tax rate over time. The current
maximum capital gains tax rate is 23.8 percent. Combining both tax rates and accounting for interactions and
phase-outs results in an effective keep rate of 75 percent on average, indicating that a dollar of realized capital
gains amounts to 75 cents after taxes.
     We find a total of 584 changes in state capital gains tax rates throughout our panel. Most of these changes
are fairly small, which reflects the fact that our tax rate measure includes the effect of deductions and other
minor provisions of state tax codes, so any changes to these provisions can cause the capital gains tax rate
to change. The largest changes, however, are in excess of 4 percentage points (Table A.1). In total, we have
128 state tax changes that exceed 1 percentage point in absolute value. In Appendix Figure A.2, we provide
a histogram of all changes. As we show below, our results are robust to using variation only from these larger
tax changes.
     We examine the relationship between changes in state capital gains tax rates and economic and policy
conditions in Appendix Table A.2. Specifically, we regress indicators for capital gains tax increases and de-
creases on lags of state unemployment rates, GDP per capita, and state tax rates on personal and corporate
income.5 Most coefficients are insignificant and small, though notably, higher unemployment in the previous
year is associated with a higher probability of increasing the capital gains tax rate. In our main analysis, we
     3 The vast majority of realizations are long-term realizations (Appendix Figure A.3).
     4 We generally use the terms "reform" and "tax change" interchangeably to indicate any non-zero value of  log (1 - s,t ).
    5 Appendix Table A.3 also shows that changes in state capital gains tax rates are often accompanied by changes in state

personal income tax rates. We include specifications that do (as well as those that do not) control for leads and lags of changes
in state tax rates on personal and corporate income.


                                                                4
include specifications that condition on unemployment prior to tax reforms and do not find evidence that this
relationship affects our estimates.



2.      Methods

2.1     Estimating the Annual Effects of Capital Gains Tax Changes

We investigate the effects of log net-of-tax rates on log realized capital gains and on log counts of wealthy
residents. We run direct projections regressions for different time horizons h  {-10, -9, ..., 9, 10}:




                               ys,t+h = h  log (1 - s,t ) + Xs,t h + s,h + t,h + s,t,h                                             (1)


where s and t index state and calendar year, ys,t+h is the outcome variable in year t + h (log realized capital gains
in our main specification), s,h and t,h are horizon-specific state and year fixed effects, and Xs,t is a vector of
controls. The main parameters of interest are the sequence of {h }10
                                                                  h=-10 , which describe the path of realized

capital gains around the tax change. The variable  log (1 - s,t ) is the one-year change in the log net-of-tax
rate. Using first differences helps deal with serial correlation concerns and facilitates estimating an impulse
response function. To express the results as elasticities at different horizons, we normalize the coefficients to
be relative to the coefficient in the year before the tax change, i.e., we define elasticities h  h - -1 . For
example, 5 = 5 - -1 measures the elasticity of realized capital gains 5 years after the reform with respect to
the capital gains net-of-tax rate, where the change in realizations is relative to the year before the tax event.
We plot the h estimates in our main figures.
     In our baseline specification, we control for the vector Xs,t of leads and lags of changes in the log net-of-tax
                          10
rate, i.e., Xs,t h =      r =-10,r =0   h
                                        r  log (1 - s,t+r ). Controlling for these other leads and lags of capital gains

tax changes isolates the effect of a given tax reform. Without these controls, estimates would reflect the effect
of not just the tax reform of interest, but also any other reforms occurring within the event window.6 To check
robustness, we also run specifications featuring additional controls in Xs,t , including GDP in pre-reform year
t - 1, GDP-growth-bin-by-year dummies, state unemployment in pre-reform year t - 1, and changes in state
corporate and personal income taxes. Finally, we include a specification that interacts the tax change with
indicators based on the size of the tax change, and report estimates for h coming only from larger tax reforms
that exceed 1 percentage point in absolute value.


Discussion of Alternative Specifications and Semi-Elasticities. To facilitate comparisons to prior
estimates, we discuss the theoretical and empirical implications of using logs and semi-logs in Appendix C. We
also provide estimates using a semi-log specification, which delivers similar results. We prefer our net-of-tax
    6 In Appendix Figure A.9, we run a specification that excludes the vector of controls for other reforms and find similar re-

sults.




                                                                 5
formulation because it measures the relevant price governing behavior and is standard in the broader literature
(Saez, Slemrod and Giertz, 2012).
    Compared with an event-study specification, which centers around the outcome year rather than the policy
reform year, the direct projections approach accurately recovers elasticities in simulations (see Appendix D
for details).7 In the appendix we also provide results using event-study specifications (Appendix Figure A.8,
Figure A.13 and Table A.5). Results are similar.


2.2     Estimating effects over multiple years

We extend the method in equation (1) to estimate the elasticity of capital gains realizations over longer time
horizons. First, we consider a direct projections specification that estimates the effect of tax reforms on
realizations in three-year bins, yielding estimates of the elasticity in the short (0-2 years), medium (3-5 years)
and longer run (6-8 years):


                               ys,t+h = ~h 3 log (1 - s,t ) + X   ~           ~t,h + 
                                                               s,t h + ~s,h +        ~s,t,h ,                                      (2)


where 3 log (1 - s,t ) represents the three-year change in the log net-of-tax rate (i.e., 3 log (1 - s,t ) =
log (1 - s,t ) - log (1 - s,t-3 )). For each value of h  -9, -6, . . . , 6, 9, we estimate a separate instance of this
regression. The controls for other reforms in this regression are also specified in 3-year bins: the vector of
controls Xs,t now contains the variables 3 log (1 - s,t+r ) for r = -9, -6, -3, 3, 6, 9. We use the notation ~,
~ etc, to distinguish the parameters in equation (2) from their analogues in equation (1).
,
    To understand why this specification correctly identifies the average elasticity over the specified three-year
periods, consider a simple example. Suppose a state changes its capital gains tax rate exactly once in year
2000. Then 3 log (1 - s,t ) takes a value of zero for this state in every year except three: t = 2000, 2001, 2002.
Now consider the regression above for h = 0. The variable 3 log (1 - s,t ) is non-zero whenever the left-hand
side variable is ys,2000 , ys,2001 or ys,2002 . Therefore, the coefficient ~0 will capture the average effect of the tax

reform on capital gains in these three years. Suppose instead h = -3. In this case, our left-hand side variable
of ys,t+h becomes ys,t-3 . Since 3 log (1 - s,t ) is still zero for all t except 2000, 2001, and 2002, ~-3 captures

the effect of the tax reform on ys,1997 , ys,1998 and ys,1999 (the only ys,t-3 such that t  2000, 2001, 2002). Now,
define ~0  ~0 - ~-3 . The parameter ~0 measures the difference in realizations in the periods immediately after

and before the reform. In our example, ~0 represents the difference between average realizations in post-reform

years 2000-2002 and average realizations in pre-reform years 1997-1999. In other words, ~0 identifies the average

elasticity over a 0-2 year horizon relative to the reform year. Similarly, ~3  ~3 - ~-3 would identify the impact

of the reform on the difference between average realizations in 2003-2005 and 1997-1999, thus giving us an
average elasticity over a 3-5 year horizon, and so on.
    We use a similar approach to estimate effects in the post period (i.e., in years 0-10) and in the long-run
    7 Since the direct-projections approach centers leads and lags on the policy reform year, it includes fewer pre-observation

controls when estimating the effect of post-observation reforms or vice versa. However, it also facilitates controlling for pre-
treatment conditions and handling locations with multiple events (and associated issues with adjusting standard errors).



                                                                 6
(i.e., years 6-10). To get a single estimate of the effect of capital gains tax reforms on realizations in the decade
following the reform, we use the following specification:


                                  ys,t =  11 log (1 - s,t ) + Xs,t ´h + ´s,h + ´t,h + ´s,t,h ,                                       (3)


where 11 log (1 - s,t ) = log (1 - s,t ) - log (1 - s,t-11 ).8 To estimate the elasticity for the 0-10-year estimate,
we take the point estimate  from this regression and subtract off the point estimate ~-3 from (2). Finally,

the long-run estimate for years 6-10 is implemented similarly to equation (3), but using a 5-year rather than
11-year difference for the right-hand side tax change variable (i.e., replacing 11 with 5 ), and using ys,t+6 as
the outcome variable.



3.      Capital Gains Tax Changes and Realizations at the State-Level
Figure 2 shows the results of our baseline specification from equation (1). The figure illustrates how capital
gains realizations evolve before and after a change in the capital gains net-of-tax rate, controlling for other state
capital tax reforms. We see no clear pre-trend: in each of the ten pre-reform years, capital gains realizations
tend to be stable. We then see a jump soon after the reform, after which the point estimates decline modestly
throughout the post-period. Unlike the 1986 and 2012 national reforms shown in Figure 1, we do not see
evidence of anticipation effects preceding state capital gains tax reforms, which would have manifested as a
downward spike at year -1.
     On average across post-reform years 0 through 10, the point estimates directly provide an elasticity estimate
of capital gains realizations with respect to the net-of-tax rate of around 3.18. The dynamics of this response
are also of interest. In Figure 2, there is a modest downward trend over the post-period. Combining some of
                                                                                         1    3   ^
our individual year point estimates, the estimated short-run elasticity                  3    h=1 h    is 3.61 (s.e. 1.22), whereas
                              1     10 ^
the longer run estimate       3     h=8 h   is somewhat lower at 2.59 (s.e. 1.42). However, we cannot reject the null
that these effects are the same.
     In Panel (b) of Figure 2, we present five robustness tests of these results: (1) controlling for pre-event state
GDP, (2) controlling for pre-event state GDP growth, (3) controlling for pre-event state unemployment rates,
(4) only using large reforms that change the capital gains tax rate by at least 1 percentage point, and (5)
controlling for changes in state income and corporate tax rates. The results are remarkably similar. We also
provide a range of other robustness checks in the Appendix Figures A.7-A.12, including an event study version
of the analysis, a specification without controls for other capital gains tax changes in the pre- and post-reform
periods, and separate analyses for small and large states
     State capital gains tax rates often move in the same direction as state income tax rates (Appendix Table
A.3). Many states treat capital gains as regular income for tax purposes, in which case the capital gains tax rate
will be identical to the income tax rate. We account for these possibilities using a specification that controls for
    8 In this specification, the vector of controls X
                                                      s,t contains variables that are still 3-year binned versions before and after the
long bin: 3 log (1 - s,t+r ) for r = -17, -14, -11, 3, 6, 9.



                                                                   7
changes in personal income and corporate taxes. Panel (b) of Figure 2 illustrates that the elasticity estimates
from this specification are very similar to the baseline.



4.      Federal Revenue-Maximizing Rates
In this section, we present a framework that shows how to use the state-level estimates from above to infer the
policy-relevant elasticity at the national level. We then derive an estimate for the revenue-maximizing tax rate
and calculate revenue effects of a hypothetical five percentage point tax rate increase.


4.1     A Simple Model of State-Level Capital Gains Realizations

Consider a country with states s  S . Residents of state s retain a share (1 - F - s ) of their realized capital
gains after paying federal (F ) and state capital gains taxes (s ).9
     We can decompose total realized capital gains in state s into two terms:


                                        CGs = Ns (1 - F - s , -s ) Rs (1 - F - s ) ,                                         (4)


where Ns (1 - F - s , -s ) represents the number of residents in state s, and Rs (1 - F - s ) represents real-
ized capital gains per resident conditional on residing in state s.
     Using equation (4), we can decompose the empirical elasticity of capital gains with respect to the net-of-tax
rate:
                                 log CGs              log Ns            d log Rs
                   CG =                       =                  +                   = N + R .                               (5)
                             log (1 - F - s )    log (1 - F - s ) d log (1 - F - s )

Thus, CG
      s  is the sum of two elasticities: a migration elasticity N and a realization elasticity R , which is
the main object of interest and represents the "pure" per capita response of capital gains realizations to the
net-of-tax rate.


4.2     From State-Level Realizations to the Federal Revenue-Maximizing Tax Rate

We show in Appendix Section E shows that the federal capital gains tax rate that maximizes federal tax revenue
from capital gains is:
                                                                   1-  ¯S
                                                            F =           .                                                  (6)
                                                                   1 + R

This formula resembles familiar optimal tax models (Saez, 2001; Diamond and Saez, 2011), but has an additional
aggregation adjustment term ¯S that denotes the average population-weighted state tax rate. The policy-
relevant elasticity at the federal level is our estimate of the elasticity of capital gains realizations at the state
level less the migration elasticity, i.e., R = CG - N .
     9 When   measuring keep rates net of federal and state taxes, we account for deductibility as described in section 1.




                                                                   8
4.3      Estimating the Federal Revenue-Maximizing Tax Rate

We estimate N based on the responses of those at the top of the national wealth distribution because the top
groups account for essentially all capital gains (Smith, Zidar and Zwick, 2020). To do so, we fit equation (1)
when the outcome is the share of the state population that belongs to either the top 10% or the top 1% of the
national wealth distribution. Panels (a) and (b) of Figure 3 show the outcome of this specification for the top
10% and top 1% groups, respectively. We see fairly stable pre-trends, though somewhat noisy in the earliest
pre-periods for the top 1% group. Following an increase in the net-of-tax rate, the share of residents in each of
the top groups grows, and the magnitude of the response is larger for the top 1% group.
    Connecting these migration responses to the theory requires weighing the following tradeoff. Focusing on
the top 10% delivers a more precise estimate, but risks putting too little weight on the responsiveness of those
at the top who have substantial capital gains realizations in dollar terms. Our preferred measure of migration
                                                                                           P 99-P 100
is a combination of the two groups. Specifically, we define the outcome variable as: s ln Ns,t        + (1 -
        P 90-P 100
s ) ln Ns,t        , which is a dollar-weighted convex combination of the two groups, where s is the state's
wealth share of the top 1% relative to the top 10%.10
    To estimate R , we first estimate CG and N using our binned specifications described in section 2.2, with
log capital gains and our migration measure from above as outcome variables. We perform this estimation at
various time horizons: the main estimate covering years 0-10 after each reform, as well as three-year bins of
0-2 years, 3-5 years, 6-8 years, and 6-10 years. We then calculate ^R
                                                                    h =^CG
                                                                        h -^N
                                                                            h at each time horizon.

    Panel (c) of Figure 3 shows the estimates from these binned regressions graphically. The grey series shows
estimates of ^CG
              h  at different horizons h, the dark blue series shows ^R
                                                                      h , and the light blue shows the average

policy-relevant elasticity over a decade following each reform, ^R
                                                                 0-10 .

    Table 2 also provides estimates of our elasticities at various time horizons. We also translate our net-of-tax
elasticity estimates into an elasticity with respect to the tax rate to facilitate comparisons to prior work. Table
2 includes estimates from two alternative specifications: one in which we identify all elasticities from state tax
reforms of at least 1 percentage point, and a second in which we control for all reforms to state income tax and
corporate tax rates in a 21-year window around the capital gains tax reform in question.11
    Overall, our baseline estimate at a 0-10 year horizon gives an elasticity with respect to the net-of-tax-
rate of approximately 1.87, which translates into an elasticity of -0.53 with respect to the tax rate. The
specification using only large tax changes yields an elasticity with respect to the tax rate of -0.42 and the
specification controlling for other state tax changes yields an elasticity with respect to the tax rate of -0.29.
While these point estimates are somewhat noisy, the point estimates are notably smaller in absolute value
than the conventional elasticities used by tax analysts. Moreover, we can definitively test and reject the null

                                                                 P 99-P 100
                                                                Ws,t

                                                                              ,

that is, it represents the average wealth share in state s of the top 1% within the top 10% across all years in our sample. Across
all states in the sample, the mean of s is 0.39. The minimum value is 0.28 (Iowa), while the maximum is 0.56 (District of
Columbia), with Wyoming, Nevada and New York also having values above 0.5.
   11 Appendix Tables A.6 and A.7 provide additional specifications that control for pre-reform unemployment and unemploy-

ment growth. These are very similar to the results in Table 2.


                                                                 9
hypothesis that this elasticity with respect to the tax rate equals 1 in absolute value. The p-values for the
baseline, big-change-only, and other-tax-control specifications are 0.066, 0.021, and 0.31, respectively. This
finding provides important evidence suggesting that capital gains tax cuts do not pay for themselves, which
has been a prominent proposition in this literature (Joint Committee on Taxation, 1990; Auten and Cordes,
1991; Gravelle, 1991; Burman, 2010; Gravelle, 2020).
    As in Figure 2, the results in Table 2 across all specifications show an elasticity which is somewhat bigger in
absolute value in the short to medium run, and then declines in the longer run. This pattern could potentially
reflect some transitory effects that are present in the short run but disappear over time. For instance, a tax
cut may in the shorter run spur some individuals to realize accumulated gains to take advantage of the lower
tax rate, particularly if they expect a possible reversal of the tax cut in the future. However, once many of
these accumulated gains have been realized, the potential for realization of further gains is limited, and the
magnitude of the behavioral effect declines in the longer run.12 For this reason, we view our 6-10 year estimates
as being the most likely to capture the long-run structural elasticity of capital gains to the net-of-tax rate,
though some transitory effects might exist even beyond a 10-year horizon.


4.4     Policy Implications

These elasticity results have policy implications for revenue-maximizing tax rates and the revenue effects of
capital gains tax reforms. Table 2 provides the corresponding estimates of the revenue-maximizing tax rate,
 
^F . Our baseline elasticity estimate for the full 10-year period implies a revenue-maximizing rate around 33%,
and the analogous estimates for the big-changes-only and control-for-other-tax-changes specifications are 38%
and 47%, respectively. Thus, over a ten year budget window, these results suggest that a capital gains tax
rate of around 40% would maximize federal capital gains tax revenues. For analysis over years 6-10, we find
somewhat higher revenue maximizing rates, ranging from 38% to 47% across the three specifications.
    We can use our elasticities from Table 2 to estimate how realizations and thus tax revenues change in
response to a 5 percentage point tax increase. By the definition of these elasticities, we can estimate how
realizations and thus tax revenues change for a given elasticity estimate and tax rate change. In 2017, the most
recent year that our state and federal tax data covers, the average combined maximum state and federal tax
rate was 27.82%.13 We use this rate as an approximation to the average marginal tax rate. An increase of 5
                                                                                              0.05
percentage points in the tax rate implies that the net-of-tax rate decreases by             1-0.2782   = 6.93%. We relate this
percentage change in taxes to a percentage change in realizations using our baseline 0-10 year policy-relevant
elasticity of 1.87 from Table 2, and find that realizations would have been 6.93 × 1.87 = 13 percent lower, for
a total of $754.3 billion in realizations. To calculate counterfactual tax revenue given this realizations amount,
we need to use the average tax rate, which differs from the marginal. In 2018, the most recent year for which
   12 This possibility seems consistent with the graphical evidence that we find when we examine the behavioral effects following

tax increases and tax decreases separately, which are shown in Appendix Figure A.10. Following a tax cut, we see a striking
and immediate upward jump in realizations, and the effect grows even larger over the following 3-4 years. However, after this
initial jump, the trend reverses, and the behavioral effect 7-9 years after a tax cut is much more modest. In contrast, the effect
on realizations following a tax increase is much smaller and more stable over time.
   13 Appendix Figure A.6 shows how the following calculations would change if the elasticity were measured at a different initial

tax rate.



                                                               10
we have data on federal tax revenue, total capital gains realizations were $890.6 billion (Piketty, Saez and
Zucman, 2018), and federal capital gains tax revenue was $158.4 billion, yielding an average federal tax rate
     158.4
of   890.6   = 17.79%. We assume that the 5 percentage points tax increase also applies to this number, for a
counterfactual average tax rate of 17.79 + 5 = 22.79%. Applying this average tax rate to the counterfactual
realizations amount yields tax revenue of 0.2279 × 754.3 = $176.6 billion, an increase of $18.2 billion relative
to the actual 2018 tax revenue. Repeating these steps, but using the net-of-tax elasticity estimate of 1.01 from
our specification with controls for other taxes would result in an increase of $30.3 billion in tax revenues. In
sum, we estimate that a 5 percentage point tax increase would yield between $18 billion and $30 billion in
additional revenues.
     Absent any behavioral response, which corresponds to an elasticity of zero, tax revenues from this 5 per-
centage point tax increase would increase revenues by $44.5 billion. Thus, depending on the specification, our
estimates indicate that, at current tax rates, between a third and half of the mechanical revenue gains are lost
due to behavioral effects.
     Our central elasticity estimate is lower than those in most existing studies, and our estimated revenue-
maximizing tax rate is correspondingly higher. In particular, it is interesting to compare our estimated elasticity
to that used by the JCT to evaluate the budgetary impacts of tax reforms. They currently assume an elasticity
with respect to the tax rate of 0.68 (Gravelle, 2020), substantially higher than our estimate. This elasticity
would imply a revenue gain from a 5 percentage point tax increase of only $10.6 billion, or that about three-
quarters of mechanical revenue gains are lost due to behavioral effects. Appendix Figure A.1 compares our
elasticity estimate, implied revenue-maximizing tax rate, and revenue impact with estimates implied by previous
studies. Note that all of these estimates apply to the current capital taxation regime with unlimited deferral
and step-up-basis at death.



5.       Conclusion
This paper estimates the effect of state capital gains tax changes on realizations at the state-level. These
estimates reflect the responsiveness of both capital gains realizations as well as the migration of the wealthy.
These overall effects at the state-level are of interest in their own right as many states consider revenue-raising
options to address budgetary pressures. We hope that estimates of how state-level realizations evolve around
state capital gains tax changes may serve as useful inputs into this process, as well as to the literature on state
taxes, capital gains behavior, and migration.
     We also provide policy-relevant elasticities at the federal level, which use a new framework to account for
migration responses on the wealthy and other aggregation adjustments. Our main estimate is an elasticity of
realizations with respect to the tax rate of -0.5 to -0.3 depending on the specification.
     These main elasticity estimates are notably smaller than estimates used by official analysts to score federal
tax reforms (Gravelle, 2020). We hope that these elasticity estimates, as well as their implications for revenue-
maximizing rates and tax revenue effects, will be considered when evaluating reforms to capital gains taxation,



                                                        11
although we note that using these estimates to evaluate large tax rate changes may require extrapolation beyond
the observed variation in our sample. In addition, revenue-maximizing rates may exceed welfare-maximizing
rates to the extent that capital gains taxes reduce investment below optimal levels or create lock-in effects
that misallocate capital. Overall, our bottom-line finding is that raising capital gains tax rates has sizable
revenue-raising potential, and that cutting capital gains tax rates has substantial fiscal cost.

Notes: In all panels, net capital gains have been scaled by the ratio of a country's real GDP in 2000 to the country's real
GDP in a given year (e.g. U.S. capital gains for 2005 were multiplied by the U.S. GDP in 2000 divided by the U.S. GDP in
2005). Panel (a) shows the evolution of realized capital gains and the maximum federal long-term capital gains tax rate in the
US from 1980 to 2018. Panels (b) and (c) compare realized capital gains in the US to those in the UK around the time of US
reforms. In all panels, net capital gains have been scaled by the ratio of a given country-year's GDP to the country's GDP in
2000. In both (b) and (c), the UK capital gains tax rate was constant throughout the period shown. The UK series has been
normalized to equal the US series in the year prior to the reform. We calculate the short-term (0-2 years) and medium-term (3-4
or 3-5 years) tax elasticities provided in panels (b) and (c) by normalizing the UK series in the year before reform, calculating
the average difference between the normalized UK series and the US series during the period, and dividing that difference by the
difference in US log net-of-tax rates before and after the reform. This calculation gives us elasticities with respect to the net-of-
                                        -0.22
tax rate, which we then multiply by 1   -0.22
                                              to convert them into elasticities with respect to the tax rate, at a tax rate of 22%.
We use this tax rate to facilitate comparisons between these numbers and those given in Table 2, where we also use a rate of
22% to calculate tax elasticities given net-of-tax elasticities. If instead we had calculated the tax elasticities in panels (b) and
(c) using the prevailing US federal tax rates prior to each reform, we would have obtained tax elasticities in panel (b) of -0.48
in the short run and 0.85 in the medium run, and in panel (c) of -1.64 in the short run and 1.28 in the medium run. We do not
include the fifth year post-reform in the medium-term analysis of panel (b) because this fifth year coincides with the 2003 tax

Notes: This figure presents our main results of the impact of state capital tax rate changes on capital gains realizations. The
points plotted are the estimated coefficients from equation (1) for the impact of a change in the total (federal and state) log
net-of-tax capital gains tax rate on log capital gains realizations. The alternate specifications include the following: (1) con-
trolling linearly for GDP in the year before the reform; (2) controlling for a set of dummies interacting prior GDP growth ter-
tiles and years, where the prior GDP growth tertile is determined using GDP growth over the most recent three years; (3)
controlling for prior unemployment rates; (4) interacting the tax change variable with indicators for reforms greater or smaller
than 1 percentage point, and reporting the coefficients corresponding to large changes, and (5) controlling for other state per-
sonal and corporate income tax changes. Specifically, for (4) we modify the baseline specification by estimating separate coef-

tered at the state level.

Notes: Panels (a) and (b) of this figure show the impact of state capital gains tax reforms on migration of high-net worth res-
idents, using the specification in equation (1). The outcome in panel (a) is the log of the share of residents belonging to the top
10 percent of the national wealth distribution, and in panel (b) it is the log share in the top 1 percent. The points plotted are
the estimated coefficients for the impact of a one-period change in the total (federal and state) log net-of-tax capital gains tax
rate on these outcome variables. In panel (c), we estimate the empirical capital gains elasticity using a specification analogous
to that in equation (1), but using three-year bins (see section 2.2 for details). This estimate is represented by the grey point es-
timates. The dark blue point estimates represent our estimates of the policy-relevant elasticity    ^R =  ^CG - ^N for each period.
As described in section 2.2,  ^N is estimated using a state-year specific dollar-weighted average of the migration responses of the
top 1% and top 10%.The horizontal light-blue line is our estimate of the policy-relevant elasticity using a binned specification
for post-reform years 0-10 (see equation 3). All specifications include state and year fixed effects and controls for tax reforms in
years surrounding the reform. The estimated coefficients are normalized to equal 0 at time -1, and standard errors are clustered
at the state level.

  Notes: This table summarizes capital gains and tax variables used in our analysis, which are observed at the state-year level. We report
  counts and magnitudes for changes in state capital gains tax changes in three bins: non-zero changes, increases of one percentage point
  or more, and decreases of one percentage point or more. The sample ranges from 1980 to 2016 for realizations, and from 1977 to 2017 for
  tax rates. All dollar values are in 2018 dollars. We use capital gains income data from Smith, Zidar and Zwick (2020) and data on state
  population from the Census Bureau via FRED. Data on state and federal capital gains tax rates are from NBER TAXSIM. Keep rates
  (1 - st ) are net of federal and state taxes on capital gains, accounting for deductibility and other provisions described in section 1. See
  data appendix B for additional details.

 Notes: This table shows estimates of main elasticities and associated revenue-maximizing rate for different specifications of equa-
 tion (2). The 0-2, 3-5 and 6-8 year specifications use 3-year bins, the 6-10 year specification uses a 5-year bin, and the 0-10 year
 specification uses an 11-year bin as described by equation (3)). As described in the main text, the empirical elasticities  ^CG and  ^N
 are calculated as the difference between the point estimate for each specific horizon, and the point estimate for the [-3, -1]-year
 bin. Revenue-maximizing tax rates are estimated using the formula in equation (6), which is derived in Online Appendix Section E.
 The term    ¯S adjusts for the average population-weighted state tax rate in 2016, which was 6.27% in 2016. All specifications con-
 trol for reforms in the capital gains tax rate in three 3-year bins before and after the reform in question, and include state and year
 fixed effects. The "Big changes only" specification replaces the right hand side variable of interest--the 3-year (or 5-year or 11-year)
 change in the log net-of-tax rate--with two variables: one which sums the changes in the log net-of-tax rate in years where the state
 tax rate changed by more than 1 percentage point, leaving out smaller changes, and one which sums changes to the log net-of-tax
 rate in years where the state rate changed by less than 1 percentage point. Specifically, we replace the right-hand side variable of
 interest ­ for instance, 3 log (1 - s,t ) ­ with two variables: big
                                                                   3   log (1 - s,t )     2
                                                                                          k=0  log (1 - s,t-k ) × 1(| (1 - s,t-k ) | 
 0.01), which sums all the tax changes greater than 1 percentage point in magnitude over the past year, and a corresponding variable
 that sums all tax changes smaller than 1 percentage point. We then report estimates for the variable that sums the big changes.
 The "Control for other taxes" rows report results from a specification that includes controls for changes in state income and corpo-
 rate tax rates. We control for the change in other tax taxes over the same 3-year (or 5-year or 11-year) bins that we use to identify
 our main point estimate in each regression, as well as three 3-year bins before and after the main period. Standard errors are clus-
 tered at the state level. Values in parentheses in columns 1-4 represent standard errors; values in parentheses in column 5 (2 test)
 represent p-values.

Notes: This figure compares our results with those from the previous literature on capital gains. With the exception of Dowd,
McClelland and Muthitacharoen (2015), the elasticities reported in panel (a) are calculated with respect to a tax rate of 22%
and are taken from Tables 1 and B-1 from Gravelle (2020). The relevant marginal tax rates in the Dowd et al. paper are those
in place between 1999 and 2008, which average around 17 percent. The tax increase analyzed in panel (b) is a 5 percentage
point increase, from 17.8% (the effective federal capital gains tax rate in 2018) to 22.8%, assuming that realizations and rev-
enues begin at their 2018 levels ($891 B and $158 B respectively). We calculate revenue-maximizing rate using equation (6)
from the text, using an average state tax rate of 6.4% (its 2016 population-weighted value).

Notes: This figure shows the distribution of the size of changes in the top state capital gains tax rate throughout our panel,
including changes to the statutory tax rate as well as deductibility and other minor provisions of the tax code. It has been cen-
sored at 6%, so tax changes of more than 6 percentage points in absolute value appear in the left- or rightmost bin in this fig-
ure. The figure does not include state-years where the tax rate stayed the same, i.e. changed by 0.

Notes: Data from the IRS SOI series "Short-term and Long-term Capital Gains and Losses" classified
by size of adjusted gross income and selected asset type (accessible at https://www.irs.gov/statistics/
soi-tax-stats-sales-of-capital-assets-reported-on-individual-tax-returns). More precisely, the long-term gain
series corresponds to total gains reported in returns with long-term gain transactions. The short-term gain series corresponds to
total gains reported in returns with short-term gain transactions. We calculate total capital gains as the sum of these two series.
We use cross-sectional data, which are available for 1985, 1997-1999, and 2007-2012. Although panel data are available for
1999-2007, the IRS warns that extrapolations from the panel to the general population should be made with "extreme caution".
Due to the IRS' warning, we have omitted data for these years.

Notes: This figure uses our direct projections framework from equation (1), but with the outcome variable being the net-of-
tax rate itself, and excluding the controls for capital gains tax reforms in other years. This creates a specification where the
treatment effect from time -1 to time 0 is 1 by construction, but where the point estimates in other years show the degree of
mean reversion in tax rates. A decline in point estimates following the initial jump indicates mean reversion, as states that lower
tax rates tend to partially revert back towards higher tax rates over time and vice versa. The estimated coefficients are normal-
ized to equal 0 at time -1. Standard errors are clustered at the state level.

Notes: This figure shows two scatterplots of our state-year data on tax rates and realized capital gains, as well as correspond-
ing binned scatterplots. In all plots, the variable on the vertical axis is the three-year change in log realized capital gains (2018
dollars). In the plots on the left, the variable on the horizontal axis is the three-year change in the net-of-tax rate by state (us-
ing the maximum combined federal and state capital gains tax rate, as we describe in section 1.), while in the plots on the right,
the horizontal axis shows the three-year change in the log net-of-tax rate. The plots in the top row are standard scatterplots,
while the plots in the bottom row are the corresponding binned scatter plots, using 30 bins. The regression corresponding to the
line of best fit in the scatterplot in panel (c) has an R2 of 0.1304, and in panel (b) the R2 is 0.1352.

Notes: This figure supplements the discussion in section 2.1 of models of capital gains realizations that either assume a
constant semi-elasticity (models of the form log CGt =  · t ), or a constant net-of-tax elasticity (of the form log CGt =
 · log (1 - t )). We here show some implications of these models at various tax rates when either the semi-elasticity or the net-
of-tax elasticity is assumed to be constant for all tax rates. All calculations are based on a tax rate elasticity of 0.53 at 22%,
corresponding to a semi-elasticity of 2.41 and a net-of-tax rate elasticity of 1.88. Panel (a) shows, at each given tax rate, what is
obtained when converting the semi-elasticity or net-of-tax elasticity to an elasticity with respect to the tax rate. We also evalu-
ate the implications of both models for realizations (panel b) and tax revenue (panel c) under a 5 percentage point tax increase
relative to the tax rate on the horizontal axis. We assume initial realizations equal to $891 billion regardless of starting tax rate.
This figure is equal to net capital gains realizations in 2018 according to data from Piketty, Saez and Zucman (2018). Total tax
rates observed in our data range from 0.15 to 0.37, comparable to the range of rates presented here.

Notes: This figure shows the five series from panel (b) of Figure 2 individually. Panel (a) in this figure controls linearly for
GDP in the year before the reform; panel (b) controls for a set of dummies interacting GDP growth tertiles and years, where
the GDP growth tertile is determined separately in each year by grouping states according to GDP growth over the three years
prior to the reform; panel (c) controls for the unemployment rate in the year prior to the capital gains tax reform. Panel (d)
uses a specification that interacts the variable for changes in the net-of-tax rate with indicators for reforms greater or smaller
than 1 percentage point in magnitude ­ the reported point estimates are for the interaction with the large reform dummy, such
that the effects shown in this panel are idetified only from larger reforms. Panel (e) includes controls for changes in the state
personal income and corporate tax rates in each year from 10 years before until 10 years after the capital gains reform. In all
cases, we plot the estimated coefficients for the impact of a one-period change in the total (federal and state) log net-of-tax cap-
ital gains tax rate on log capital gains realizations. Capital gains are in real terms and standard errors are clustered at the state
level. Estimates have been normalized to 0 in period -1. We include state and year fixed effects.

Notes: This figure shows a variation of our baseline graph in Figure 2 that uses a classic event study specification in which all
plotted coefficients are estimated within the same single regression rather than the direct projections approach. The specifica-
tion used is ys,t = 10 h=-10 h  log 1 - s,t-h + s + t + s,t (where  indicates a one-period change), and the figure plots
the point estimates for -10 , -9 , . . . , 10 . Capital gains are in real terms and the estimated coefficients are normalized to equal
0 at time -1. Standard errors are clustered at the state level.

ificatlly, we modify the baseline specification in equation (1) by estimating separate coefficients for tax increases and decreases,

malized to equal 0 at time -1. Standard errors are clustered at the state level.

Notes: This figure is analogous to panel (a) of Figure 2, but interacts the main right-hand-side variable of interest with an
indicator for belonging to the 10 most populous states, lagged by 10 years relative to the reform to avoid any potential con-
founding effects of recent population growth or decline. This thus creates two sets of treatment effects, one for larger and one
for smaller states. Realized capital gains are in real terms, and the estimated coefficients are normalized to equal 0 at time -1.
Standard errors are clustered at the state level.

Notes: This figure is analogous to panel (a) of Figure 2, but restricts the specification to only estimate the effects of reforms
after 1990. We do use realizations data from prior to 1990 to estimate the pre-trend, and we also include reforms from before
1990 when in our set of controls for capital gains tax reforms in the years surrounding the reform of interest. Realized capital
gains are in real terms, and the estimated coefficients are normalized to equal 0 at time -1. Standard errors are clustered at the
state level.

Notes: This figure is analogous to panel (c) of Figure 3, but uses an event study specification where elasticities at different
horizons are estimated jointly within the same regression model rather than using separate regressions for each coefficient as in
the direct projections case. Specifically, for the three-year bins, instead of equation (2), we run a single regression of the form
ys,t = -9 3 log(1 - s,t+9 ) + -6 3 log(1 - s,t+6 ) + · · · + 9 3 log(1 - s,t-9 ) + s + t + s,t . Using capital gains realizations
as the outcome variable, the grey line then plots elasticity estimates   ^CG as the difference between the coefficients t -  -3 from
this regression. Migration elasticities  N
                                        ^ are calculated correspondingly, using our migration variable from the main text as the
outcome variable, and the dark blue line then plots the estimated policy-relevant elasticity,    ^R = ^CG -   ^N . For the estimates in
the 0-10 year bin, we run a separate regression ys,t =    ~-9 3 log(1 - s,t+9 ) +  ~-6 3 log(1 - s,t+6 ) +    ~-3 3 log(1 - s,t+3 ) +
~0 11 log(1 - s,t ) + 
                      ~s +  ~t + ~s,t and estimate the 0-10 year elasticity as the difference ~0 -  ~-3 . Standard errors are clustered
at the state level.

Notes: This figure shows the outcome of the simulation exercise detailed in Appendix Section D. We simulate a log capital
gains realizations variable which is generated in such a way that it has a true empirical elasticity of 2 with respect to the net-of-
tax rate, constant across all horizons. The figures use three different methods to estimate the impact of changes in the net-of-
tax rate on this simulated outcome variable. Panel (a) shows the outcome of a direct projections estimation exactly as specified
in equation (1), panel (b) shows the outcome of a similar specification that excludes the controls for tax reforms in other years,
and panel (c) shows the outcome of an event study specification. Estimates have been normalized to 0 in period -1. We include
state and year fixed effects. See Appendix Section D for further details.

Notes: This figure shows the outcome of the simulation exercise detailed in Appendix Section D. Unlike Figure A.14, we here
generate an outcome variable for which the true elasticity with respect to the net-of-tax rate is 3 in years 0-2 following the re-
form, 1 in years 3-5, and 2 in the following years. Panel (a) shows the outcome of a direct projections estimation exactly as
specified in equation (1). Panel (b) shows the outcome of the estimation when binned specifications as outlined in section 2.2.
We include state and year fixed effects. See Appendix Section D for further details.

   Notes: This table shows the results of two OLS regressions aiming to determine whether economic conditions, pre-
   vious capital gains rates, and other tax rates predict changes in the capital gains tax rate. The outcome variables are
   dummies for increases and decreases in the state capital gains tax rate at time t, respectively. The variables "Unem-
   ployment", "Max state income tax" and "State corporate tax" are measured as decimal numbers, not percentages. We
   do not include fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered at the state level.

 Notes: This table relates the direction of year-by-year changes in state capital
 gains and income tax rates. Within each column, the percentages show the share
 of income tax changes that went in the given direction. The rates used are max-
 imum state capital gains and wage tax rates, calculated for a hypothetical high-
 income taxpayer for years 1977-2017 by Daniel Feenberg for NBER. Tax changes
 are relative to previous year. Observation (state-year) counts are in parentheses.

 Notes: This table corresponds to Table 2 in the main text, but uses a specification in which the right-hand side variable of inter-
 est is the change in the tax rate, rather than in the log net-of-tax rate. Specifically, we use the exact estimation method described
 in section 2.2, with the exception that in equation (2), we replace the variable 3 log (1 - s,t ) with 3 s,t , and correspondingly,
 in (3), 11 log (1 - s,t ) is replaced with 11 s,t . Similarly, the vector of controls for reforms in surrounding years, Xs,t , is also
 specified using the tax rate in levels rather than the log net-of-tax rate. With this change of right-hand-side variables, columns 1
 and 2 estimate semi-elasticities in a way completely analogously to how we estimate the corresponding elasticities in Table 2. In
 column 3, we calculate the revenue-maximizing tax rate given the policy-relevant semi-elasticity from column 2. In a model where
 the semi-elasticity  is assumed constant, the revenue-maximizing tax rate can be found as   = -         1
                                                                                                           . In column 4, we convert our
 semi-elasticity to an elasticity with respect to the tax rate simply by multiplying by a tax rate of 0.22. More details on our calcula-
 tions can be found in Appendix C. Standard errors are clustered at the state level. Values in parentheses in columns 1-4 represent
 standard errors; values in parentheses in column 5 (2 test) represent p-values.

 Notes: This table corresponds to Table 2 in the main text, but uses an event study specification where elasticities at different
 horizons are estimated jointly within the same regression model rather than using separate regressions for each coefficient as in
 the direct projections case. Specifically, for the three-year bins, instead of equation (2), we run a single regression of the form
 ys,t = -9 3 log(1 - s,t+9 ) + -6 3 log(1 - s,t+6 ) + · · · + 9 3 log(1 - s,t-9 ) + s + t + s,t . Using capital gains real-
 izations as the outcome variable, we then provide elasticity estimates as the difference between the coefficients t -  -3 from this
 regression. Migration elasticities are calculated correspondingly, using our migration variable from the main text as the outcome
 variable. For the estimates in the 0-10 year and 6-10 year rows, we run separate regressions. For the 0-10 year bin, we run the re-
 gression ys,t =   ~-9 3 log(1 - s,t+9 ) +    ~-6 3 log(1 - s,t+6 ) +    ~-3 3 log(1 - s,t+3 ) +    ~0 11 log(1 - s,t ) + ~s +  ~t + ~s,t
 and estimate the 0-10 year elasticity as the difference   ~0 -  ~-3 . Similarly, for the 6-10 year bin, we run the regression ys,t =
 -9 3 log(1 - s,t+9 ) + · · · + 
                                  0 3 log(1 - s,t ) +    3 3 log(1 - s,t-3 ) +     6 5 log(1 - s,t-6 ) +   s +  t +   s,t and identify the
 6-10 year elasticity as 6 -   0 . In the specification that controls for other taxes, we include as variables in the regressions changes
 in state labor and corporate tax rates over the same year bins as for capital gains taxes. In the "big changes only" specification, like
 in Table 2, we replace the q log(1 - s,t-r )-variables with two variables that each sum changes that are smaller and larger than 1
 pp, respectively, over the relevant time horizon. See the figure notes to Table 2 for details on this. After estimating the total capital
 gains and migration elasticities in this way, all other calculations follow exactly as in Table 2. Standard errors are clustered at the
 state level. Values in parentheses in columns 1-4 represent standard errors; values in parentheses in column 5 (2 test) represent p-
 values.

 Notes: This table provides additional alternative specifications to our main estimation, beyond those shown in Table 2 in the main
 text. The top panel of this table, labelled "Baseline", corresponds exactly to the Baseline panel in Table 2. The next two panels
 add controls for unemployment in two different ways. The middle panel includes a linear control for the state's unemployment rate
 prior to the capital gains tax reform in question. The bottom panel instead controls for a set of dummies interacting unemploy-
 ment growth tertiles and years, where the unemployment growth tertile is determined separately in each year by grouping states
 according to unemployment growth over three years prior to the reform. Standard errors are clustered at the state level. Values in
 parentheses in columns 1-4 represent standard errors; values in parentheses in column 5 (2 test) represent p-values.

  Notes: This table provides additional alternative specifications to our main estimation, beyond those shown in Table 2 in the main
  text. The top panel of this table, labelled "Control for other taxes", controls for changes in state labor and corporate taxes, and
  corresponds exactly to the bottom panel in Table 2 ­ see the notes to Table 2 for further details on how this is specified. The next
  two panels in this table include the same controls for other state tax changes, but also control for unemployment in two different
  ways. The middle panel includes a linear control for the state's unemployment rate prior to the capital gains tax reform in question.
  The bottom panel instead controls for a set of dummies interacting unemployment growth tertiles and years, where the unemploy-
  ment growth tertile is determined separately in each year by grouping states according to unemployment growth over three years
  prior to the reform. Standard errors are clustered at the state level. Values in parentheses in columns 1-4 represent standard errors;
  values in parentheses in column 5 (2 test) represent p-values.

B      Data Appendix
This appendix covers our data sources in more detail and clarifies adjustments and assumptions that have been
made in cleaning and processing the data.

Tax rates
     Maximum federal, state, and total tax rates on long-term capital gains for the years 1977 to 2017 are
     obtained from NBER TAXSIM data. These data are calculated by simulating the effect of a change in
     income for a hypothetical high earner in the TAXSIM model, and thus incorporate statutory state tax
     rates as well as phaseouts of exemptions and itemized deductions. In some specifications, we control
     for changes in the maximum state income tax and corporate tax rates, which we also obtain from this
     dataset.14
     Table 1 shows maximum federal long-term capital gains tax rates, which we obtain from the US Depart-
     ment of the Treasury.15 As of the time of writing, the Treasury data starts in 1954, but unfortunately
     only goes to 2014. Knowing that the maximum statutory tax rate on capital gains did not change between
     2014 and 2017, we manually extend the data forwards, assuming a tax range that is unchanged from its
     2014 level. Since the data also includes the effects of other minor provisions on maximum tax rates, it
     is possible that we are leaving out smaller changes in the maximum tax rate through our extrapolation.
     However, we expect any such discrepancies to be small, as the maximum effective tax rate is very close to
     the maximum statutory rate for recent years. In the data, certain years contain two different tax rates.
     In these cases, the capital gains tax rate changed at some point during the year, and different tax rates
     applied for gains that were realized in different parts of the years. Since our data on realized capital gains
     are at the year level, we are unable to apply these different tax rates over the year. Therefore, for these
     few years, we assume the relevant tax rate to be the midpoint between the two tax rates that applied
     over the year.
     Data on UK tax rates comes from HM Revenue and Customs.16 Note that for some of the years in
     question, the UK had different tax rates for individuals and trusts. For the purposes of our analysis,
     we ignore trusts, which account for a comparatively small and stable amount of capital gains across the
     years we study.

Realized capital gains
     Data on realized capital gains at the federal level are obtained from the appendix tables of Piketty, Saez
     and Zucman (2018).17 Specifically, the numbers we use can be found in column 21 of Table C1. These
     numbers were calculated by Piketty, Saez and Zucman (2018) as aggregates of the NBER micro-files
     samples of tax returns and correspond to the fikgi variable.18 Note that these are net long-term plus
     short-term capital gains, i.e., any capital losses are subtracted from the total in each year.19
     Data on realized capital gains at the state level are taken from Smith, Zidar and Zwick (2020). The series
     that we use comes from a state-year collapse of the fikgi variable in the IRS SOI sample files. We also use
     data from the same source on the number of residents by state within the top 1 and 10% of the national
     wealth distribution.
  14 Further   background information and the dataset itself are available at https://users.nber.org/~taxsim/state-rates/.
  15 These   data are currently available in excel format at https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/tax-policy/
tax-analysis/Documents/Taxes-Paid-on-Capital-Gains-for-Returns-with-Positive-Net-Capital-Gains.xlsx.
   16 Specifically, it can be found at https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/

attachment_data/file/764247/Table_A1.pdf. Note that we do not currently use these data directly in our analysis, except to
verify that the UK did not change its capital gains tax rate at any time during the periods in which we use it as a control group
to the US. Capital gains were treated as part of regular income throughout all of the years in our UK sample. The maximum
income tax rate throughout this period was 40 percent.
   17 Currently, these can be found under http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/PSZ2017AppendixTablesI(Macro).xlsx
   18 See the Piketty, Saez and Zucman (2018) codebook here http://gabriel-zucman.eu/files/PSZCodebook.pdf.
   19 In future work, it would be valuable to consider gains and losses separately and test where the inclusion of net short term

gains and losses and netting of loss carryovers from past years have different effects.




                                                               38
    UK data on realized net capital gains comes from HM Revenue and Customs.20 These data are given
    separately for individuals and trusts, which are taxed at different rates over the period that we study.
    We only use the data for individuals, who are taxed at a 40 percent rate throughout all the years that
    we study. For specific types of trusts, the tax rate did change slightly over the period that we study.
    Our choice to only use realized capital gains by individuals is therefore based on an assumption that any
    spillover effects between the two tax bases resulting from changes in the trust tax rate are negligible. We
    view this as a reasonable assumption since capital gains by trusts is a small and relatively stable share
    of total capital gains, since only certain types of trusts (i.e, interest in possession trusts and personal
    representative) were subject to tax changes over the period we study, and since the tax changes were very
    small, changing by only 3 percentage points over the period.

Other variables
    In some specifications, we control for state GDP numbers obtained from the Bureau of Economic Anal-
    ysis.21
    Other specifications control for unemployment, which we obtain from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.22

    To generate variables in per capita terms, we use annual estimates of US state populations from the US
    Census Bureau, obtained through the St. Louis Fed.23
    We convert dollar amounts into real values using the CPI for urban consumers (CPI-U), obtained from
    the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.24
    Nominal values from the UK are deflated using the Retail Price Index, avalable from the Office for
    National Statistics. 25

C      On Elasticities and Semi-Elasticities
Our approach in equation (1) relates log capital gains realizations to the log net-of-tax rate, which is a standard
approach in much of the recent literature on the elasticity of taxable income (e.g., Gruber and Saez, 2002; Saez,
Slemrod and Giertz, 2012; Kleven and Schultz, 2014; Doerrenberg, Peichl and Siegloch, 2017), where the log
net-of-tax rate (or changes in the log net-of-tax rate) is often used as the primary explanatory variable. One
reason for this formulation is that the net-of-tax price is often the relevant price governing behavior in standard
economic models.26 However, most of the previous literature on capital gains taxes (e.g., Bogart and Gentry,
1995; Bakija and Gentry, 2014; Dowd, McClelland and Muthitacharoen, 2015) has related log capital gains to
the linear tax rate or net-of-tax rate, fitting specifications of the semi-log form:

                                                         log CGt =  · t .                                                       (C.1)

In a model of this form, the coefficient  corresponds to a semi-elasticity of capital gains realizations with
respect to the tax rate. Empirically, given the variation we observe in tax rates, it is hard to determine
whether our baseline model in equation (1) fits the data better than a model of this type.27 However, the two
models generate different predictions about how behavioral responses scale with tax rates. Whereas our baseline
model would imply that a 1 percentage point change in the tax rate induces larger realizations responses when
the tax rate is higher, the model in (C.1) implies that a 1 percentage point change in tax rates would always
generate the same percentage change in realizations. As we illustrate in Appendix Figure A.6, the difference
between the predictions of these models grows larger when the tax rate is extrapolated further from the rate
at which both semi-elasticity and net-of-tax rate elasticity are calculated. This difference can be important,
for instance, when using these models to calculate the implied revenue-maximizing tax rate.
    We use the model in equation (1) as our baseline model because it is standard in the broader taxable
elasticity literature and may generate more realistic predictions when considering implied behavioral responses
at large tax rates. For example, the model in (C.1) implies that the percentage change in realizations would
be the same whether tax rates were increased from 20 to 21 percent or from 99 to 100 percent, which seems
less accurate given standard predictions about distortions growing with the square of the tax rate. Our model,
in contrast, would predict much larger responses when tax rates are high.

C.1        Empirical Estimates Using a Semi-Log Specification
We provide results estimation using semi-log specifications to facilitate comparisons to the prior literature and
to assess the robustness of our estimates. We report these semi-log results in Table A.4, which has the same
structure as Table 2 with our binned multi-year estimates from the main text, but with various changes as
outlined below.
    In the first column of Table A.4, we estimate the empirical semi-elasticity, which we label  CG . We do so
using the same procedure described in Section 2.2 in the main text, but with the right hand-side variable of
interest changed. For instance, instead of equation (2), we estimate:

                                     ys,t+h = ~h 3 s,t + X   ~           ~t,h + 
                                                          s,t h + µ
                                                                  ~s,h +        ~s,t,h .                                        (C.2)

Just as we do for the elasticities in the main text, we calculate the semi-elasticity based on these estimates
as the difference between post- and pre-reform point estimates. For example, the 0-2 year semi-elasticity is
calculated as   ~0      ~0 - ~-3 , the 3-5 year semi-elasticity as ~3  ~3 - ~-3 , and so on. Also note that in this
specification, the vector of controls for reforms in surrounding years, Xs,t , is also specified in terms of the tax
rate in levels, i.e., it contains the variables 3 s,t+r for r = -9, -6, -3, 3, 6, 9.
    In the second column of Table A.4, we obtain a semi-elasticity that differences out the migration effect by
                                                                                     P 99-P 100               P 90-P 100
subtracting the point estimates of  N from a specification like (C.2) with s ln Ns,t            +(1 - s ) ln Ns,t
as the outcome variable. This step is completely analogous to what we do in Table 2 for our main estimates.28
  26 For   example, labor supply decisions depend on the net-of-tax wage, i.e., (1 -  )w, in standard models of labor supply.
  27 Figure   A.5 shows that there is little difference in how strongly changes in log realized capital gains correlate with changes
in net-of-tax rates and log net-of-tax rates, respectively.
   28 One small difference is that unlike in Table 2, we do not multiply by the minor adjustment factor that we describe in Ap-

pendix E. This adjustment is not needed in a model where semi-elasticities are assumed constant for all tax rates. We can see
this point by repeating the simplification from equation (E.4) in the context of a semi-elasticity model. Specifically, let  
 dCG

         1
      · CG  be the policy-relevant semi-elasticity at a national level (corresponding to  in (E.4)), and let  R  d log d
                                                                                                                         Rs
                                                                                                                            = ddRs
                                                                                                                                 
                                                                                                                                   ·R1
                                                                                                                                     s




                                                                  40
    We then go on to calculate the revenue-maximizing tax rate implied by the estimated policy-relevant semi-
elasticities. As in Appendix E, this is the tax rate that solves the federal government's revenue maximization
problem,
                                                
                                                F = arg maxF F · CG
                                                  = arg maxF log F + log CG

Taking the first order condition for maximization with respect to F in the second line, we get:
                                                              1   d log CG
                                                       0=       +          ,
                                                              F      dF
which rearranges to

                                                                   1
                                                               F =- ,
                                                                   
                           d log CG
where   d      CG    1
              dF · CG =       dF    is the policy-relevant semi-elasticity at a national level. Note that unlike in
our main analysis, where we find the formula for the revenue-maximizing tax rate in equation (6), we do not
adjust for the average state taxes here. That is because in a model with a constant semi-elasticity, state taxes
are irrelevant for the federal tax; differences in the baseline tax rate do not affect the magnitude of behavioral
responses. In other words, in this model, if the semi-elasticity is -4, the revenue-maximizing federal tax rate is
25%, regardless of whether average state taxes are 0 or 50%.
    Finally, in the fourth column of Table A.4, we convert the estimated policy-relevant semi-elasticity to an
elasticity with respect to the tax rate, evaluated at 22% to facilitate comparison to Table 2 and the prior
literature as referenced in Gravelle (2020). Since the semi-elasticity is given by  = dd        CG    1
                                                                                                  · CG , it can be
converted into a tax elasticity at any given tax rate  by simply multiplying it by  .
    Our results in Table A.4 are broadly consistent with what we find in Table 2. While the first two columns
are not directly comparable, we find that the semi-log specification delivers tax elasticities that are slightly
larger than those in our main specification. However, despite differences in how revenue-maximizing tax rates
are calculated in the two models, we get similar estimates of the revenue-maximizing tax rate across our various
specifications.

D      Estimation Using Simulated Data
This section presents the results of two simulation exercises that aim to examine whether our estimation
methods are biased when estimating the empirical elasticity of capital gains with respect to the net-of-tax rate.
We use our actual empirical data on the maximum combined state and federal capital gains tax rate, but rather
than use empirical data on realized capital gains as the outcome variable, we simulate this variable in such a
way that we know the true empirical elasticity for this simulated variable with respect to the net-of-tax rate.
We start with a simulation that features an elasticity that is constant across all time horizons, before moving
on to the more complex case of a time-varying elasticity.

D.1      Simulation with constant elasticity
First, we generate the simulated log capital gains variable according to the following formula:

                               log CGsim
                                     s,t = 10 + 1 · f ipss + 2 · t + 2 · log (1 - s,t ) + s,t .                              (D.1)

From this data-generating process, it is clear to see that the "true" empirical elasticity of capital gains with
                                                         log CGsim
respect to the net-of-tax rate will be CG =  log(1-s,t   s,t )
                                                               = 2. The constant 10 and the terms 1 · f ipss + 2 · t
are chosen arbitrarily--they are simply there to generate a time trend and some variation across states which
will be absorbed by state and year fixed effects in our estimation anyway--mimicking structural time trends
and differences across states which are unrelated to the tax rate.29 The term s,t is a random variable with
mean 0 and standard deviation 0.001. In reality, the short-term and long-term elasticities likely differ, which we
explore in more detail in subsection D.2. Here, we have here simplified matters and assumed a single permanent
elasticity of 2, which holds for both the short and the long term. This is for expositional purposes, since it will
make any bias in the different estimation methods easier to see visually.
    Having generated this simulated capital gains realizations variable, we now estimate empirically the effect of
capital gains tax reforms on it, using various methods. The results of these estimations are shown in Appendix
Figure A.14. First, in panel (a), we use our main specification--the baseline direct projections specification
from equation (1), which includes a set of controls for other capital gains reforms in the 10 years before and
after each reform that enters our regressions. This figure is thus analogous to Figure 2 (a) in the main text,
but with simulated outcome data. If our estimation method is accurate, the figure should display a completely
flat trend in the pre-and post-periods, with a single upward jump of size 2 from year -1 to 0. The results show
we accurately identify the true elasticity of 2 in the simulated data. There is a clear jump from time -1 to time
0, the pre-trend is flat, and the trend in the post-period is almost entirely flat as well, with just a very slight
upward trend.30
    Panel (b) of Figure A.14 uses the same estimation method, but omits our controls for capital gains reforms
at different horizons. We see that not controlling for other capital gains tax changes performs worse. While the
jump at time 0 is still exactly 2, we now have a clear downward trend both before and after the reform year.
This pattern reflects the fact that tax reforms in our data tend to be somewhat mean-reverting, as we show in
Appendix Figure A.4 and discuss briefly in section 2.. Because of this mean-reversion, the difference between
tax rates at time 0 and -1 will tend to be an overestimate of the difference between rates at time h and -1 for
h > 0, and because we are overestimating the size of the tax change, we will correspondingly underestimate
the magnitude of the elasticity at these longer horizons.
    Finally, panel (c) of Figure A.14 uses an event study method. We use the following specification:
                                                   10
                                log CGsim
                                      s,t =             h  log (1 - s,t-h ) + s + t + s,t ,                                  (D.2)
                                                h=-10

and the figure plots the point estimates that are normalized relative to period -1, i.e. it shows -10 - -1 , -9 -
-1 , . . . , 10 - -1 . This differs from our baseline direct projections specification from equation (1) in that all
the point estimates are generated within the same regression. We see that this method performs better than
   29 f ips is literally just the FIPS code corresponding to state s, which is included as a crude way to ensure that the mean of
           s
log CGsim will vary across states.
   30 An alternative specification that is similar to equation (1), but using y
                                                                                s,t+h - ys,t-1 as the outcome variable, would in
fact remove this very slight bias. However, we have opted not to use this specification for our empirical analysis, as it would not
extend naturally to our long multi-year binned specifications, and therefore we do not present it here either.



                                                                42
the direct projections method without controls, but worse than the direct projections with controls, since there
is still somewhat of a downward trend. This result is likely because given the specification that we use, we
are unable to bin tax reforms that occur beyond the endpoints of our window of 10 leads and lags around the
realization year.31
    Overall, these results show that our main direct projections method with controls is accurately identifying
the true elasticity in the longer run. In the next subsection, we extend the simulation exercise to show that
our estimation methods also accurately identify true elasticities when they differ across time horizons.

D.2      Simulation with time-varying elasticity
To simulate a log realized capital gains variable with a varying net-of-tax elasticity over time, we slightly alter
the simulated variable we introduced in equation (D.1). It now becomes:

                    log CGsim
                          s,t =10 + 1 · f ipss + 2 · t + 2 · log (1 - s,t )                                                  (D.3)
                                    + 1 · [ log (1 - s,t ) +  log (1 - s,t-1 ) +  log (1 - s,t-2 )]
                                    - 1 · [ log (1 - s,t-3 ) +  log (1 - s,t-4 ) +  log (1 - s,t-5 )]
                                    + s,t .

In this specification, the long-run elasticity of capital gains with respect to the net-of-tax rate is still 2, but the
added terms modify this elasticity in the short and medium run. The first bracketed term increases the impact
of the change in the net-of-tax rate on realizations by 1 for reforms that happened 0, 1 or 2 years ago, which
means that the elasticity in these three years will now be 3. Similarly, the second bracketed term decreases the
impact of a reform that happened 3, 4 or 5 years ago on capital gains realizations, lowering the elasticity in
each of these three years to 1.
    We now estimate our baseline specification from equation (1) with this new outcome variable. The result
is shown in panel (a) of Figure A.15. We clearly see that our estimation method accurately picks up on the
time-varying elasticity across different years, which confirms that this specification also does a good job of
capturing the dynamics of the empirical capital gains elasticity around a tax reform.
    Panel (b) of Figure A.15 estimates the impact of capital gains reforms on the same simulated outcome
variable using the binned specifications in equations (2) and (3). We see that the 3-year binned specification
also captures the dynamics of the elasticity, and the long 0-10-year specification captures the average elasticity
across time (the three short-run years with an elasticity of 3 and the three medium-run years with an elasticity
of 1 average out to an elasticity of 2 across these six years). Overall, these results confirm that our empirical
methods are well-suited to capture the magnitude and evolution of empirical capital gains elasticities over
time.




   31 Specifiying the right-hand side variables in the event study specification in levels rather than first differences could help

deal with this problem, but would also make our empirical estimates harder to compare directly with those from the direct pro-
jections specification.


                                                                43
E       Full Model
This section contains further details and derivations for the model outlined in section 4.1 of the main text. We
first show the derivations of the formula for the revenue-maximizing tax rate provided in the text. Consider
the revenue maximization problem of the national government.32 Let       ¯S denote the average state tax rate.33
The government sets F to maximize revenue:

                                                           max F · CG,                                                           (E.1)
                                                             F

where CG = sS CGs =                 sS   Ns (1 - F - s , -s ) Rs (1 - F - s ). Taking logs in (E.1), we get the first
order condition
                                                         1    d log CG
                                                           =-          ,
                                                         F       dF
which is equivalent to
                                       1       d log CG
                                         =
                                       F   d (1 - F -   ¯S )
                                                 d log CG                d log (1 - F -   ¯S )
                                         =                             ·
                                           d log (1 - F -    ¯S )          d (1 - F -   ¯S )
                                                 d log CG                      1
                                         =                             ·              .

We can rewrite this expression to find that the revenue-maximizing tax rate is

                                                                  1-¯S

                                                                  1+
where

We call this elasticity the policy-relevant elasticity since it is a sufficient statistic for determining revenue-
maximizing rates at the federal level. We would like to express this elasticity in terms of the realization
elasticities R that we described in equation (5), since they are what we can empirically estimate. To simplify
the expression in (E.3), we impose two fairly reasonable assumptions.
    Assumption 1: In every region, ns is unaffected by the federal tax rate. Mathematically, this means that

                         dns (1 - F - 1 , 1 - F - 2 , . . . , 1 - F - s , . . . )
                                                                                  =0          for all s  S.
                                               dF
In reality, it might be hard to find a function for which this is indeed exactly true everywhere on its do-
main. However, within the range of usual tax rates that we consider, it seems like a reasonable first degree
approximation that a change in national tax rates wouldn't directly cause internal migration between regions.
   Assumption 2: Realization elasticities are homogenous across regions, R         R
                                                                             s =  for all s  S .
   32 Changes in the capital gains rate may affect other types of income (e.g., dividends, wage and salary income, etc.). This

formula does not account for spillovers to other parts of the tax base, so we may actually be underestimating the revenue max-
imizing capital gains rate. Estimating these fiscal spillovers precisely is difficult empirically. Another relevant issue is the nega-
tive vertical fiscal externality between federal and state governments--maximizing federal revenues is different from maximizing
federal plus state revenues.
   33 This average is weighted by state populations N , so

   Given these two assumptions, we can simplify the expression in (E.3):

                                              sS

where ns is the population of the state expressed as a share of the national population.34 This expression now
gives us the policy-relevant national elasticity as a function of the local realizations elasticity, R , times an
adjustment term which is somewhat difficult to interpret but deals with weighting among states. Essentially,
it corrects for the fact that an elasticity measured at the aggregate level is not necessarily exactly equal to the
mean of elasticities measured at a more granular level. Note that in our empirical setting, in every single year
for which we have data, the adjustment factor is very close to 1 ­ its minimum value across all years is 0.993,
and its maximum is 1.004. For this reason,  and R are in practice almost identical, which is why we present
equation (6) for the revenue-maximzing tax rate in the main text with an R , although it should be an  to
be completely precise, as in equation (E.2). We use the 2016 value, which is 1.0025, to adjust our empirical
estimates when estimating R and the revenue-maximizing tax rates in section 4.3.
    Equations (E.2) and (E.4) together tell us directly how to get an estimate of the revenue-maximizing tax
rate from local elasticities. Since our empirically estimated elasticities at the state level give us CG = N + S ,
we need an estimate of N to get the realizations elasticity. We do this in section 4. of the paper by running a
version of our direct projections with the outcome variable being a weighted combination of the log number of
state residents that belong to the top 10% and the top 1% of the national wealth distribution, respectively. This
can be thought of as applying our outlined model only to the top of the wealth distribution. Capital gains tax
reforms are likely to have a limited impact on migration of individuals outside the top 10%, and even if there
is a migration effect for these individuals, it will not substantially affect overall capital gains realizations in the
state, since individuals outside the top 10% only account for a very small share of capital gains realizations.

Two-region example
To make the above derivations a little more concrete, we present the following simple numerical example.
Suppose the country consists of two regions: California (c) and everywhere else (e). Assume the following

Suppose we estimate a total elasticity of capital gains  ^CG = 3 and a migration elasticity    ^N = 1.5.36 This
                                     R
implies a realization elasticity of ^ = 1.5.
   The average population-weighted state tax rate is   ¯ = 0.2 · 0.14 + 0.8 · 0.05 = 0.068. Using equation (E.4)
above, we thus find the policy-relevant elasticity  above to be

                                                        Rs              sS   ns (1 - F - s )

                                                   (1 - F - s )               sS ns Rs

                                           0.2 · 25 0.8 · 22 0.2 · 0.61 + 0.8 · 0.7
                                 = 1.5 ·           +         ·
                                            0.61      0.7      0.2 · 25 + 0.8 · 22
                                 = 1.5 · 1.006
                                 = 1.509.

The revenue-maximizing national capital gains tax rate implied by this elasticity is thus

                                                    1-¯S   1 - 0.068
                                            F =          =           = 0.371.
                                                    1+     1 + 1.509




  35 These values are roughly consistent with actual numbers for people in the top 10% of the wealth distribution in the US in

2016, with the population rebased to 100 individuals and the realized capital gains per capita given in thousands of dollars.
  36 These values are close to what we find in our specification using big tax changes only.
