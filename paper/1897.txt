                   Asset Prices in a Time Series Model with
                  Disparately Informed, Competitive Traders




                                   ABSTRACT


   This paper examines the time series properties of the price of a risky

asset implied by a model in which competitive traders are heterogeneously

informed about the underlying sources of uncertainty in the economy.   Traders

do not observe the shocks in the period they occur.      However, traders are

imperfectly and heterogeneously informed about these shocks for three reasons:

(1) the shocks are serially correlated arid hence partially forecastable from

their past history, (2) each trader receives private signals about the current

values of a subset of the shocks, and (3) the equilibrium price conveys

information about the private signals and beliefs of other traders.        Since

prices convey information in this economy, traders will face an infinite

regress problem in expectations associated with their desire to forecast the

beliefs of others, the beliefs of others about average beliefs, etc.         The

equilibrium time series representation for the price of the risky security is

deduced in various Imperfect information environments. Then the volatility

and autocorrelations of prices in this model are compared to the corresponding

statistics for a model in which agents are homogeneously informed.

1.   Introduction

     Surveys of the participants in organized securities markets indicate that

traders hold widely different beliefs about the future course of economic

activity.     Expectations not only differ, but they evidently respond
significantly to unexpected movements in such variables as real economic

growth and the weekly changes in the money stock [see Cornell (1983) for a

review of some of this literature]. Furthermore, French and Roll (1984) have

found that the variance of stock prices is greater over periods when the stock

market is open than when it is closed. Together, these observations suggest

that disparate beliefs and the sharing of information through the trading

process may b.e important ingredients in modeling asset price determination.

The purpose of this paper is to explore the implications of disparate

expectations for the time series properties of asset prices in the context of

a simple model with competitive traders facing serially correlated shocks.

     While the models examined are partial equilibrium in nature, this

exploration is motivated     in part by the apparent inconsistency of
representative agent, dynamic equilibrium models with the behavior of asset

prices. The variances and autocorrelation functions of asset returns seem to

be inconsistent with the implications of both linear expectations models [see,

e.g., Shiller (1979, 1981), Singleton (1980, 1985), Scott (1985)] and the

nonlinear models studied by Hansen and Singleton (1982), Ferson (1983), Dunn

and Singleton (1985), and Eichenbaum and Hansen (1985), among others. Now all

of these models assume that agents have a common information set.   In light of

the evidence to the contrary, it seems worthwhile to explore the consequences

for the time series properties of asset returns of introducing heterogeneity

in the form of disparate information sets. This paper compares the implied
                                       2



variances and autocorrelations of prices for alternative specifications of'

agents' information sets in the context of a simple, partial equilibrium asset

pricing model.

     There is an extensive literature on asset pricing in the presence of

disparately informed traders. Grossman (1976), Grossman and St.iglitz (1980),

I-iellwig (1980), Diamond and Verrecchia (1981), Kyle (19814), Admati (1985), and

Altug (19814), among others, investigate the role of equilibrium security

prices as aggregators of individual traders' information.          Attention is

restricted to oneperiod models in these studies, and the focus is primarily

on the extent to which prices reveal private information to all traders.1

None of these studies have considered the implications of disparate

expectations for the time series properties of security prices. Indeed, the

models investigated to date have typically not been designed to address this

issue.

     Heliwig (1982) considers a time series model for stock prices in which

agents condition their expectations on past rather than current prices. He

shows that as the length of the trading interval decreases, the equilibrium

price process obtained from conditioning on past prices approximates the fully

revealing equilibrium price that emerges in his model when agents condition on

current prices.   Heliwig does not examine the time series properties of his

model.   More recently, Shiller (19814) has studied a simple dynamic model of

stock prices in which there are two groups of traders: one group responds to

expected returns optimally forecasted and the other responds myopically.

Agents do not explicitly have different information sets in this model.

Furthermore, neither Heliwig (1982) or Shiller (19814) examine equilibria where

agents condition on current prices and prices are not fully revealing.

     This paper takes a first step toward filling this void by examining a

model with a continuum of traders in which the underlying sources of

uncertainty in the economy exhibit serial dependence over time.     An economy

with a single risky asset, in which traders have a one-period investment

horizon, is studied.    By restricting attention to a one-period investment

horizon, I am able to isolate the consequences for equilibrium asset prices of

serially dependent shocks in a model with disparate expectations. Although I

do not attempt to model formally the price of an existing risky security, the

specifications of both the objective functions and information sets of the

traders are motivated partially by the structure of U.S. government bond

markets.

     The model and the equilibrium time series representation for the price of

the risky security in the presence of disparate information and serially

correlated shocks are described in section two. The equilibrium price depends

on the average forecast across disparately informed traders of the next

period's price. This dependence gives rise to an infinite regress problem in

expectations that is similar to the problem discussed by Townsend (1983a,b).

Following Townsend (1983b), a technique of undetermined coefficients is used

to solve this infinite regress problem and obtain an expression for the

equilibrium price. Details of this derivation are presented in the Appendix.

    In section three the price relation is compared to the corresponding

relations obtained from several related models. First, I consider a model in

which agents have complete current information.       It is shown that the

disturbances have a more persistent effect on prices in the model with

disparate expectations than the model with complete information.      To help

interpret this finding, these models are also compared briefly with a model in

which agents are imperfectly, but homogeneously, informed.    Additionally, I
                                        14




examine the consequences for prices of setting the variances of some of the

disturbances to zero under disparate expectations.

        In section four, two models are solved numerically to obtain the time

series representations of the equilibrium price of the risky security for

various sets of hypothetical values of the parameters characterizing

preferences, uncertainty, and the supply of the security. First, the general

model set forth in section two is solved. Then the solutions of a model in

which traders are imperfectly, but homogeneously, informed are calculated.

Using these price representations, the consequences of subsets of agents

having better information than others or different levels of risk aversion are

investigated.      In addition, the implications for prices of different

specifications of the stochastic process for the underlying uncertainty in the

model are examined.

       Concluding comments are presented in section five.




2. P Model with a Continuum of Traders with One-period Investment Horizons

      Suppose there are a continuum of investors indexed by ic[O,1J.          Each

investor has the opportunity to invest in a single risky security with price

      and stochastic coupon payment c at date t. Purchases of these securities

may be financed by borrowing at the constant rate r.        Then the wealth of the

ith investor evolves according to the relation



(1)                 zt(pi+ct+i) â€”    (z1p_w)(l+r),

where        is the level of wealth and z denotes the holdings of the risky

security at date t.     Relation (1) does not constrain the net worth of each
                                                 5


 trader to exceed some minimum level,                    nor are short sales limited.
 Incorporating minimum capital requirements, constraints on short sales, and

 other limitations on trading that are present in U.S. stock and bond markets

 is of interest, but is beyond the scope of this analysis.

       The ith investor is assumed to have a one-period investment horizon and to

 rank alternative investment strategies using the exponential utility function


                   -Y.w.
             1       1 it+1

            Et_e


where            denotes the expectation of investor              i conditioned on his
information set (sigma-algebra)                   at date t and         is the constant
coefficient of. absolute risk aversion. The assumption that investors have a

one-period investment horizon simplifies the analysis by removing the

intertemporal dependence between investment decisions at dates .t and t+j,

 j     1,   that would be induced by multi-period horizons [see Pfleiderer
(198)4)].   In this manner I am able to focus on the implications of disparate

expectations for the time series properties of                   in models in which the

persistence of shocks is the primary source of dynamics in the model.

       The coupon stream (Ct} is assumed to be normally distributed and to
follow a first-order autoregressive process



                     = C   +
                               4c1   +
                                         u,   Eut = 0,   Var u a;        1.



The disturbance (Ut} is assumed to be independent of other sources of

uncertainty in the model. If the risky security is a bond (stock), then (Ct}

represents a stochastic coupon (dividend).               Some implications for prices of

altering the stochastic process for coupons are discussed in section three.

      In order to deduce an equilibrium expression for               under disparate

expectations, the underlying sources of uncertainty facing investors are

assumed to be normally distributed.          This assumption implies that the

distribution of the price of the risky security at date tÃ·1, conditional on

         is normal with mean Epti and variance Varpti,                      and the

conditional variance .

                               Var1(p  +c
                                  t t+1 t+1 )
                                                 is   a constant. Furthermore, the

first-order conditions for the maximization of (2), subject to the wealth

equation (1), are



(3)         _yE(ptÃ·i_pt) -     11c   +
                                             r 'iÂ°       0,




where         [1+r] > 1.       Solving for       gives the demand for the risky

security by the ith trader:



(!)
            z      {Epti_apt}/(yid1) +   (+ct)                i   [0,1].




A negative value of Zjt indicates short selling by the ith investor.

        In addition to the continuum of risk averse traders with demand functions

(II), I assume that there is a class of traders whose net supply of securities

at date t has the linear form (an interpretation of this class is provided

subsequently).

The disturbance        is serially correlated and is assumed to follow either an

autoregressive process of order one or a moving average process of order two:
                                                 7


 (6)                       +         or   8      +         + 2t-2

 In both representations              is distributed as a normal random variate with

mean zero and variance                    and in the AR representation       p1    <   1.      The

choices of AR(1) and MA(2) processes allow for a variety of' serial correlation

patterns in              modification of the following analysis for more general

processes is conceptually straightforward. The disturbance                        is serially

independent and normally distributed with mean zero and variance a2.

       It remains to specify the information set for agent ie.[O,1]. Speculative

traders observe current and past prices and coupon payments.                      Furthermore,

there is no private information about future coupon payments. In this respect

the model differs from previous models of information aggregation in security

markets, which assumed that there is private information about the future

dividend. Imperfect and private information is introduced into the model here

as follows. The speculative traders are assumed to observe u and                            with a

two-period lag. The only information they have at date t about                     and

is the information that can be extracted from                and ti' so traders are
equally, imperfectly informed about the process                      In contrast, the ith

trader is assumed to receive a private signal
                                                           51t
                                                                      +           about

       CT1t}

independent of the other disturbances in the model and have mean zero and

variances i,         i   c [0,11.2        Thus, at date t, traders are disparately

informed about the disturbance e underlying z and, accordingly, will
have disparate expectations about future security prices.                  Combining these

assumptions leads to the following information set for the ith investor:



(7)             aa                             0;
                                                     tj'         j   2},
                                      8




where aa(} denotes the sigma-algebra generated by the variables in
brackets.3 The twoâ€”period lag in acquiring information about       and c was

chosen arbitrarily; any informational lag of at least one period for e leaves

traders disparately informed.

    While this partial equilibrium model is intended primarily to be

illustrative of the consequences of disparate expectations for the temporal

behavior of security prices, the specification adopted is motivated by the

structure of trading in U.S. government bonds. The number of active traders

in bonds is large, so the assumption of competitive traders seems like a

useful starting point.     Furthermore, many traders finance their trading

activity through repurchase agreements or short-term borrowing, which is

consistent with the presence of the term (zp -     wt)(l+   r) in the wealth

equation (1).

   The net supply z in (5) can be interpreted as the trading activity of

agents who do not seek primarily to maximize wealth through speculative

trading, but rather who trade for non-speculative purposes.    Candidates for

such traders in the U.S. bond markets are the U.S. Treasury, the Federal

Reserve, (to a lesser extent) financial intermediaries, and those who are

classified as "liquidity" traders in several previous models of trading under

heterogeneous information. Pursuing this interpretation of the model, suppose

that collectively the "non-speculative" agents trade both to satisfy certain

"macroeconomic" objectives related to movements in output or unemployment, and

for technical reasons related to the intermediation process or to changes in

the monetary base due to activities of foreign official institutions.      If

these traders have more information than the speculative traders or there are

systematic random components to their objective functions, then a component
                                         9


 like e , which is unobserved by the speculative traders, will appear in the
 trading rule z.       At the same time, additional shocks that are unobserved by

 speculative traders and that relate to the intermediation process will affect

 the trading rules of intermediaries and the Federal Reserve.           A second
disturbance like       might capture the affects on trading of such shocks.

      Finally, the specification of a trader's information set, ,             also
captures some features of the actual information sets of bond traders. There

is typically little uncertainty about the value of the coupon payment one

period in the future, so there is not private information about fct} in this

model. On the other hand, there is substantial uncertainty about the current

motives for the trading activity of the Federal Reserve and financial
intermediaries.      After some time has elapsed both information about the

trading rule of the central bank and the balance sheets of intermediaries are

released (open market committee minutes are published for example).           The
introduction of the signal s and the two-period information lag are

motivated by these observations.5

      The idiosyncratic shocks           are the formal manifestation of the
assumption that traders are differentially informed.      One interpretation of
the          is as follows. No trader can infer the Federal Reserve's operating

procedures perfectly from available information, yet some information is
available.     Furthermore, traders differ in their innate ability to perceive

the truth.     Endowing agents with different measurement errors is one way of

representing these different forecasting abilities. In particular, having the

1it drawn from distributions with different variances induces different

forecast error variances across traders. The ability of trader i to extract

the truth from the available data depends on the relative magnitudes of

and a, where         is the variance of G.     Traders are assumed not to share
                                             10



their assessment (t) of the value of                        with other traders.   Also,

this analysis abstracts completely from the possibility that high quality

information (signals) may be available at a price; there are no costs to

acquiring the signal s,.6

      The remainder of this section is devoted to describing a procedure for

solving the model for the equilibrium time series representation of the price

of the risky security in the presence of disparate information (p).
L-ienceforth constant terms will be suppressed, so the price process derived

will be in deviation from mean form.              Suppose initially that all investors

have the same coefficient of absolute risk aversion (y) and the variance of

the            are the same (a2),         for all i[0,1].      Then the net aggregate

demand of the speculative traders is7

solving for the price gives

      Notice   that the equilibrium price depends on the average forecast across

traders of                   Thus, each trader's forecast of            depends on his

forecast of the market-wide average forecast of                     so the market-wide

average forecast of p1 depends on the market-wide average forecast of the

market-wide        average     forecast     of            Pursuing this logic, it is

apparent that there is an infinite regress problem in expectations of the type
                                                                   11



 discussed by Townsend (1983a,b).                              Following Townsend (1983b), this section

 uses a technique of undetermined coefficients to solve this problem and obtain

 an expression for the equilibrium price. This approach restricts attention to

 equilibrium price processes that are linear functions of the underlying
disturbances in the economy.

       The procedure for obtaining a solution is as follows. First, I conjecture

Equation (12) cannot be used directly to determine the optimal forecast at

date t of the unobserved shocks, because it is not a fundamental moving

average representation.              That is, the matrix M(z) viewed as a matrix of

polynomials in the complex variable z is not of full rank for all z with IzI

to apply to the model in this paper.

       Having deduced the fundamental moving average representation, the

forecasts of the unobserved shocks that appear in the price equation (11) can

be derived using the Weiner-Kolmogorov optimal prediction formulas (Whittle

1963).         Specifically, from (A.1L)         in the Appendix, it follows that

parameters (the coefficients for the latter term will depend on whether the AR

or MA representation of            is adopted). Equating these coefficients to the

corresponding coefficients in (9) and using (14) yields a set of (nonlinear)

relations that can be solved for the undetermined coefficients A and B.

This is accomplished by repeating the process just described until the

conjectured values of the coefficients equal the values in the derived

representation (11).        When this occurs, a fixed point in the space of moving

average representations for p has been reached. Mumerical examples of such

equilibrium price representations are presented in section four.




3. Properties of'     the   Equilibrium Price Representation

        It is instructive to compare the time series representations for prices

related models in which agents have partial or full information. Suppose that

function only of the current value of c, since only Ct affects the aggregate

holdings of securities by nonspeculative traders (z).                            In contrast, the

price p is affected by                   and              (i.e.,      B0    0, B1     0),      because

 Etj and                 (j    0,1) depend on                      for   all i      [0,1J. Longer
lags of        do not affect p, because B2 = 0 in (11) for all values of the

primitive parameters and, therefore, Eâ‚¬ti does not enter (11). Similarly,

B 0 for j         3,    so B*(L) = 0.          The number of additional MA terms in the

representation for p (here one) is linked directly to the informational lag

(two periods). An informational lag of k periods adds kâ€”i to the order of the

MA component of t involving                    This feature of time series models with
disparately informed agents was stressed previously by Townsend (1983b).

       Notice, however, that the more persistent effect of                       on p is due to
the assumption that all agents have incomplete information about                         and      for

two periods, and not to the presence of disparate expectations per se. For

suppose all agents are partially, but homogeneously, informed and receive a

common signal s about e.           Then the equilibrium price in this economy (p)

will be given by a version of (11), with the expectations in (13) augmented to

include the             (since they are now common shocks).      Furthermore,
                 nt-i
calculating the optimal forecasts in this case proceeds exactly as in the

model with disparate expectations.

      Digressing briefly, these observations imply that an observational

equivalence property across alternative information structures is satisfied by

an important class of linear models. Specifically, suppose aggregate demand

is given exogenously by a linear function of prices and that the decision

rules of firms depend linearly on expected future prices, but not on higher

order moments of prices. Then the coefficients in the decision rules of firms

on the aggregate shocks in a model with disparately informed firms will be

identical to those on the same shocks in the corresponding model with

homogeneously and imperfectly informed firms. In particular, the response of

the equilibrium price to shocks in Townsend's (1983a,b) linear-quadratic,

symmetric information models of firm behavior are identical to the responses

that would be obtained from the corresponding model with homogeneous

information.     An analogous observational equivalence obtains for models of

consumers facing linear supply functions.

      The asset pricing model described in section two is not a member of the

class of models for which this observational equivalence obtains. The reason

for this is that the time series representation of the equilibrium price

depends on the conditional second moment of next period's price, which is not

invarient to the information structure. More precisely, p is a function of

the common measurement error           while p is not a function of the

idiosyncratic errors            Consequently, Varp *    Varp      and, hence,

               The moving average coefficients of p and        depend on

and        respectively, as follows. When       follows an MA(2) process, then

the coefficients on the v's in the expression for p are         0 for j    3
                                           17


and A2 z _xDys.          On the other hand, when             follows an AR(1) process,

then A : xDypj/(lxDp) for              j     3    and
                                                        A2
                                                                   -   xD12.        The

corresponding coefficients for p have the same form with XH and                      in

place of       and       respectively. In sum, the shocks Ct and               may have

very different effects on prices in the full, partial, and disparate
information economies.    For comparison, the coefficients of the time series

representation of p are also calculated in section four.

     There are two related partial information economies that are also of

interest.     First, suppose that      : 0       so that only ' affects aggregate
nonspeculative supply, z.           (As in the original model, agents receive

different signals Sjt.)       For this case, Ct can be removed from (12) and

 p can be replaced by v+                     Then in solving for the undetermined

coefficients in (10) we can set B.: 0, for j            0.     Furthermore, given the

entire past history of t' it is now possible to infer                  In other words,
         j   O} and {t_j: j    O} span the same linear space and all agents

are fully informed (the signals s           are redundant).      Consequently, p is
given by a special case of the full information solution (15) with             : 0, for

all t.     Evidently, a nondegenerate distribution for           prevents prices from

being fully revealing of the unobserved disturbances.

     Second, it is instructive to examine the role of uncertain coupon

payments in the context of the model (9). If a : 0 and                   C, for all t,

then the traded security is no longer risky.             That is, a constant price

p    Cc / r) solves the first-order condition (3) and,                 hence, is an
equilibrium price in this setting. The traded security is a riskiess consol

that is a perfect substitute for the riskless security with return r and,

therefore, in equilibrium r : Cc / p), the one-period return on the consol.

It follows that with a 0 and               p : (c / r), the fact that agents are

disparately informed has no effect on the equilibrium price p.
                                        18



     The constant price equilibrium is not the only rational expectations

equilibrium solution to this model, however. If all agents believe that past

prices convey information about current and past shocks, and hence future

prices,   then prices will in fact have a nontrivial moving average
representation in terms of current and past shocks       and .      Thus, there are

multiple rational expectations equilibria for this model.           Note that the

equilibrium in which p has a nonzero variance is not a "bubble" equilibrium

of the type discussed by Taylor (1977) and McCallum (198U). Agents are not

conditioning on non-fundamental information.          The presence of multiple

equilibria is a "knife-edge" phenomenon in the context of (9).                   If

    > O(cÃ·.       is      not      perfectly       forecastable),      then

 Var(p1+c1) > 0.          Consequently, a constant price is not an equilibrium

price. Indeed, even if 2 is small, the variance of p may be relatively

large, because      and      may dominate the behavior of prices.        The price

 p has a nontrivial time series representation because, with           > 0, p is
a function of      and        and past prices convey information about future

prices.   Of course, even if a2 > 0,         there are bubble equilibria for this

model, since traders are "myopically rational" with a one-period investment

horizon (see Tirole 1982).      In section four, attention is restricted to the

non-bubble solutions for p.




    Time Series Implications of the Model

     A minor modification of the model with disparately informed agents will

be useful for presenting numerical examples.         Suppose that there are two

distinct subsets of traders each with positive measure, that have different

risk characteristics or qualities of information (as measured by a2).         Then

the equilibrium price is obtained by integrating over the subspaces of agents:

      To shed more light on the quantitative properties of the price process

under disparate expectations, the equilibrium moving average representations

and several population moments were calculated using hypothetical parameter

values.       These calculations differ in several important respects from the

comparative static analysis in Hellwig (1980).                      Perhaps the most important

difference is that                   and      represent the conditional variances of

endogenous variables (p and p), whereas the payoff from the security in

Heliwig's model is drawn from an exogenous distribution.                      A change in any

parameter that alters the time series representation for price in the model in

this paper will also change the conditional variance. Thus, unlike in many

previous studies, the conditional variance cannot be held fixed when comparing

models.

        Table 1 displays the parameters for the various models considered. For

                                           20



average process with parameters             .8 and '2      .611.     This MA process is a

truncated version of an AR(1) process with decay parameter                 p      .8.     The

implied variance of               is 2.05, since            1.        The quality of an

individual trader's signal depends on the relative values of                   a2 and 2.05;

the smaller is           / a2   the better informed is the trader. The variation in
                    11      0

the coupon payment is made small relative to the variation in                             and

           in order to focus on the implications for price movements of disparate
 {ct,}

beliefs about the actions of "nonâ€”speculative" traders.                This is consistent

with the fact that the profits of bond traders are determined largely by the

movements in prices and not by variation in coupon income (McCurdy 1979).

         The parameter      was set at 1.5. With        > 0, upward pressure on prices

induces an increase in nonspeculative supply.                    This supply, in turn,

attenuates the upward pressure on prices.       I would expect           to be positive if

z represents a trading rule of the Federal Reserve and the Open Market

Committee gives positive weight to low variation in interest rates in their

objective function. On the other hand, the sign of                 might be changed by the

presence of other types of nonspeculative suppliers. In the absence of a more

detailed model of z, I shall proceed under the assumption that                     > 0.

         The nonlinear equations that must be solved for the undetermined

coefficients (A0,A1,30,B1) are cubic equations.             Accordingly there may be

multiple equilibria for some configurations of the parameters.                            The

possibility of multiple equilibria in rational expectation models in which

conditional variances enter demand equations was illustrated by McCafferty and

Driskill (1980) in the context of a speculative model of inventory holdings.

I have been unable to demonstrate that there are unique solutions for the

models displayed in Table 1.           Eiowever, for these models, the successive

approximations method always converged rapidly                     to a moving average
                                       21



 representation with coefficients that are insensitive to their initial values

over a broad range of initial values.             Furthermore, for some other

combinations of parameters, the successive approximations method did not

converge, which suggests both that some models will have either no or multiple

linear equilibria arid that for these models the solution method fails.

Finally, when a2      0 and there are (at least) two equilibria, the successive

approximations method found two different linear equilibria        depending on
which initial values were used.     These observations provide some assurance

that I have found unique linear equilibria for the models displayed in Table



      The parameters of the equilibrium price and several descriptive
statistics fr Models 1 through 11 are displayed in Table 2.        For the zth
model, the row 9..D    in Table 2 displays the moving average coefficients for

 p;     Var p and (,); the          first two autocorrelation coefficients of

 p; and the variances of the stochastic "inputs" into the price process

(see, e.g., (11)).     The row t.H displays the corresponding statistics for

 p.      The objective here is to compare the quantitative features of

alternative specifications of the model and, therefore, the parameters were

chosen simply to provide benchmark sets of results for the purpose of

comparisons.

      For Model 1,    A is set at unity so thre is only one type of trader

(i.e., traders have common values of y and a2),    y   2., and a    2.   Model

2 is identical to Model      1   except for the value of the risk aversion

parameter.     A lower value of y leads to a smaller variance for p.

Providing an interpretation of this finding is complicated by the dependence

of net speculative demand and nonspeculative supply on p.      Intuitively, an

increase in nonspeculative supply due to say an increase in   v puts downward
                                                22



pressure on prices. With               > 0,   the price pressure induces a reduction in

supply which partially offsets the supply shock .                          Now     a reduction in

 y makes demand more sensitive to price changes (see (14)). Thus, as 'y'                   falls,
prices must respond less to a given supply shock in order to clear the market,

and, therefore, price is less variable.                Lower risk aversion also leads to

smaller autocorrelations for
                                                                2
        Next, consider the consequences of reducing a. In Model 3,                     a   is set

at .75 (with yl.), which implies that a2/a                           .215 (oE Var s) and
              1463       The noise to signal ratio for the comparable Model 2 is
 Varp
            .66,   and    Var p is .1481 for this model. Thus, a uniform increase

in the quality of each trader's signal leads to a decrease in the variance of

the equilibrium price. This result is explained by the decline in                          with a

reduction in a.           A smaller conditional variance also leads to relatively

more sensitive demands for a given expected price change and, hence, to lower

volatility in prices.            The roles of y and '5 are not entirely symmetric,

however.      A smaller value of a              also increases the autocorrelations in

         Put differently, for this eprocess, a uniform increase in the quality
 p.
of traders' information leads to a less choppy price process, while decreasing

risk aversion leads to a more choppy process.

        In Model 14 there are two types of investors.                 Ninety percent of the

investors have preferences with                  2 and a12,          while the remaining ten

percent have 2 1 and a2.75.                       Consistent with previous results, the

price is less volatile relative to the comparable Model 1 where all investors

have y = 2. and a=2.             The decline in the variance of p (from 1.02 to

.971)     is quite small, however.                Solving the comparable model with

 (y1= 1., a1= 2) and               =   .5, a2 .75), gives Varp = .3)48.                 Comparing
this    to Varp=.1481 from Model 2, it follows that halving the coefficient of
                                           23


absolute risk aversion for ten percent of the traders leads to a larger
                                 D
percentage decline in \Jarp at low levels of risk aversion. In both cases,

the effects on the autocorrelations are small.

        In sum, the presence of a small group of relatively well informed and

more risk tolerant traders reduces the volatility of the price of the risky

asset. A similar result is obtained in the "large market" models in Heliwig

(1980) and Admati (1985). This finding is interesting in light of the recent

analyses of Kyle (19814) and Altug (198)4) of one-period models in which a

finite number of agents behave strategically. They found that a trader with

inside information may act to conceal this information and in doing so reduce

the variance of the price.            Here it has been shown that a model with

competitive traders leads to a qualitatively similar result, but for different

reasons. Furthermore, in the competitive model, the primary source of reduced

volatility is the lower risk aversion, and not the better information. 10

        In Models 5â€”7,               follows an MA(2) process with coefficients
                           {8}
 81
        â€”.8 and      82 = .614 (and a= 1.).      This MA process is a truncated
version of an AR(1) process with autoregressive parameter           -.8.   The two

MA representations considered lead to         8 processes with the same variances,

but different autocorrelations.             The relatively choppy MA process
 (i:_.8, 2_.64) leads to a smaller variance for Pt (compare Model 1.D and

5.D).     Another difference across the two MA processes is that the first

autocorrelation coefficient is negative when 1=_.8.             Qualitatively, the

effects on the variances of prices of changing y or a are the same as in the

first four models.
                                       24


    Consider next the properties of                     obtained when agents are

homogeneously, but imperfectly informed.             The equilibrium time series

representations for p involve both the coefficients (0,A1,B0,B1) and the

coefficients F0 and F1 on      and n1, respectively. For Models 1 through

14, the variance of p is greater than or equal to the variance of p.

However, a notable feature of the results is that in all cases the differences

between these variances are small.     This similarity is a consequence of the

similarity in the corresponding MA coefficients and the relatively small

values of F0 and F1.   Note also that the autocorrelations for p and p are

also very similar. Thus, for the models examined, the time series properties

of p are induced largely by the incompleteness of information rather than

the disparate nature of information.

     In Models 5 - 7, the variance of p is greater than the variance of

    but again the differences are small.             Evidently, when nonspeculative

supply is choppy, differential information leads to a more volatile price

process than homogeneous, partial information, in this economic environment.

    There is another interesting feature of the variances.             The column of

Table 2 labeled Var(INP) displays the variances of the stochastic "inputs"

into the difference equation for p and p {see (16)1. A question that is

often asked in the context of linear rational expectations models is whether

the variance of the "output" variable (here price) exceeds the variance of the

"input" variable (here x*(et +   )     â€”
                                           x*4ct).      In some contexts it can be

shown that as long as the inputs are not explosive processes, the variance of

the output must be less than the variance of the input.             This observation

underlies the volatility tests of, for instance, expectations theories of the

term structure of interest rates (Shiller 1979, Singleton 1980) and the

monetary model of exchange rate determination (Meese and Singleton 1983).

Interestingly, Varp is not always less than the sum         of   the variances of the
                                              25


 "inputs" in the security model being investigated here.           For the MA process

          â€”.8, 2 .614)      the sum   of   Var(x*et),   Var(X*ct), and Var(X*lct) is
 greater than Var(p).         However, for the MA process ( .8, 2 = .614)           the
 variances of Pt and             exceed the sum of the variances of the inputs.

 Thus, under disparate expectations, a smooth trading rule by nonspeculative

 traders leads to a price process that is more volatile than the input process,

while the variability of the price process is attenuated for a choppy trading

rule.

        That VaroP may exceed VarIX*(O +E â€”the )]         is attributable to the risk
                                             t t    t
aversion of traders. Shiller (1981) showed that the variance of the price of

a security is less than or equal to the variance of the dividend under the

implicit assumption of risk neutrality.             In the context of a model with

logarithmic utility, Michener (1982) demonstrated that Shiler's bound may be

violated if agents are risk averse. The results in Table 2 provide another

example of this fact in the context of a model with exponential utility and

differential or partial information. Notice that for this model the ratio of
      D
 Var Pt     to   Var[x*(ot+Et_14,ct)] increases as      y decreases (compare models 1
and 2).

      The time series representations of prices for several models with

following autoregressive processes are displayed in Table 3.           The parameters

for these models are different than those for Models 1â€”7.               Specifically,
 a2     2. and a2 =   .5,   which gives a= 14â€¢          Also,   a2= .2 and   l,   .8.

These parameters were chosen to induce larger autocorrelations in prices and

to assure that a majority of the variation in prices is attributable to
variation in e.

      Models 8, 9, and 10 correspond to Models 1, 2, and 14 in Table 2, and

Models 11 and 12 correspond to Models 5 and 6.                    Qualitatively, the
implications for prices of lowering risk aversion or increasing the quality of
                                       26



traders' signals are the same. One difference across the two sets of results

in that (Varp1/Var p1) is much smaller for the AR models than for the MA

models. Evidently, the conclusions drawn from Models 1_14 are insensitive to

this ratio.

     Finally, a comparison of the variances of the full   information price p
to   the corresponding variances     of'     p is interesting.    For the MA

representation  (cr .8,    .6)4), Var p is larger than Var p         for

 -   2,   but Var p < Var p for y 1.11      Thus, for low levels of risk
aversion, disparate expectations does not lead to a more volatile price in

this model.      On the other hand, Var p > Var p for y      1 when e follows
the AR(1) model with       p   .8.         Thus, if much of the variation in

nonspeculative supply is due to persistent shocks about which there is partial

information, the price may be much more volatile than what would be observed

in a full information economy even if speculative traders do not exhibit much

risk aversion.




5. Discussion and Extensions

     In the context of a simple model of security prices, it has been shown

that both the variance and autocorrelations of prices are affected by the

presence of disparately informed traders. Precisely how prices are affected

depends critically on whether the trading rule of the nonspeculative traders

is smooth or choppy.       When the persistent shock to the positions of

nonspeculative traders is "smooth" and these positions are positively related

to the current price, security prices may be much more volatile than the

variables which determine equilibrium prices.        Moreover, the price has a

larger variance and is more choppy than the price in the corresponding model
                                      27


with full current information. Finally, introducing traders with relatively

low levels of absolute risk aversion and high quality information leads to a

decline in price variability.     These orderings among second moments are

typically reversed in the case of "choppy" forcing variables.     Many of the

aggregate economic variables that affect trading over the business cycle (e.g.

output, unemployment, inflation) are in fact quite smooth. If the time series

characteristics of these variables are inherited by the trading rules of the

nonspeculative traders, then the case of smooth forcing variables may be

relevant for modeling security markets in the U.S. However, in light of the

sensitivity of the results to the specification of nonspeculative traders, a

more systematic analysis of their objective functions is an important topic

for future research.

     Another interesting finding is that the equilibrium prices for the models

with disparate information and partial, homogeneous information follow very

similar time series processes. It remains to be seen whether this similarity

carries over to alternative parameterizations and information structures.

Based on the findings to date, however, it appears that disparate information

per se in a competitive market does not significantly effect the equilibrium

price process.   That is, imperfect information is the primary source of the

difference between models with complete current information and imperfect and

disparate information.

    There are many extensions of the simple model considered here that

warrant investigation.    The assumption that traders have a oneâ€”period
investment horizon is certainly restrictive.     Traders are concerned about

their inventory holdings over time.   Furthermore, they surely are trying to

anticipate economic developments several periods ahead when making their

investment decisions in the current period. As noted above, another important
                                     28


extension is the development of a more complete model of the trading activity

of nonspeculative traders.   This would lead to more readily interpretable

disturbances and possibly allow for a more direct link of' the quantitative

properties of the model to the properties of the data for U.S. securities

markets.

                 Derivation of Fundamental Moving Average Representation
                                for the Model in Section 2


        This appendix derives the fundamental moving average for t used in

sections two through four.                     The basic method used to obtain this
representation is the one suggested by Townsend (1983a). The details differ

because the model he considers is different, and Townsend assumes that all of

the shocks have unit variances whereas I allow the shocks to have different

variances.

        The autocovariance generating function for yi                        can be expressed as
                                                                     g(z),

(A.1)           gy(z) =     M(z)M(z)*,


where z is a complex number, 2 is the diagonal covariance matrix of w, and
"i"   denotes transposition and conjugation. We seek a representation of                     of

the      form      yt=M'1(L)w such        that               is     fundamental   for       and

g(z)=M(z)M#(z)*.
      Toward this end, rewrite            as                where

The rank of N(z) evaluated at zzO is less than three.   A matrix of full rank

at all z inside the unit circle is obtained by postmultiplying N(z) by a

series of Blashke matrices. More precisely, let

and let W and W be 3x3 matrices satisfying WW':I and WW':I.      Then it will

be shown that W and W can be chosen such that



(A.5)     M#(L) = N(L)WB(L)WB(L)




(A.6) w B(C1)'W'B(L1YW'c


gives the desired fundamental moving average representation.

    The matrix W is chosen such that the first column is given by

Using this vector as the first column of W, a Grainâ€”Schmidt orthogonalization

procedure can be used to construct the remaining columns.      This procedure

yields the matrix

The rank of the matrix N#(0) is still less than three, although one of the

zeros of the determinant of the lower 3x3 matrix has now been "flipped"

outside the unit circle.

     Similar steps lead to a matrix M#(z) that has full rank at z0.
Evaluating N#(z) at z:0 gives

 1. 1illiams (1977) and Jarrow (1980) have taken a different approach to
  modeling with heterogeneous beliefs in their extensions of the capi,tal
  asset pricing model. At least some of the agents in their models do not
  know all of the parameters of the price process and, therefore, must learn
  about the parameters over time.     Unlike the studies of aggregation of
  information in securities markets, these studies of capital asset pricing
  models are not concerned with solving for an endogenous price that agents
  condition on when forming expectations about future prices.
       A third and closely related literature is represented by the work of
  Feldman (1983), Detemple (1983), and Gennotte (1984).         These studies
  investigate the implications for asset pricing models of partial
  information about the underlying state variables.    It is shown that, in
  continuous time and under normality, the unobserved state variables can
  simply be replaced by agents' best forecast of these variables in deducing
  equilibrium price representations. These studies also do not address the
  properties of prices in models where equilibrium prices convey imperfectly
  the private information to other traders.


2.These independence assumptions could easily be relaxed, although the
  computations in section four would be somewhat more complicated.


3.Subsequent examples could be modified to incorporate a larger common
  information set. In particular, the price of the risky security need not
  be the only commonly observed variable at date t.        For illustrative
 purposes, I shall work with       in (7).


4.A similar structure of uncertainty could be rationalized using the
 analysis in Siegel (1985). Specifically, measures of real economic growth
 are published with a lag, but there are economic indicators published
 before the announcement of the growth figures that are correlated with
 real growth. Siegel (1985) discusses a signaling interpretation of the
 effects of money stock announcements on interest rates that is based on
 such a correlation between money and real income.

5. In practice, some information about the trading activity of the Federal
   Reserve is available to traders.              Given the structure of uncertainty
   considered here, current knowledge of z would fuily reveal                   and      to

   traders.       Full revelation would not be present if there were additional
   sources of uncertainty, however.


 6. The model is not, however, inconsistent with a desire on the part of
   traders to acquire information, since prices are not fully revealing of'
         and


7. Formally, the integrals in (8) may not be well defined, since realizations
                              iD            need not be measurable [but see Judd
   of the process {EtPt+l}i[Q           1
    1985].      Throughout this analysis I shall assume that the integrals are
   well defined and that a version of the strong law of large numbers
                                                                               since the
   holds.             Specifically, the integral        J,   ndi.i(i)     0,

    it (i[O,1]) are independent.


 8. This simple expression for the coefficient on ct obtains because c is
   common information at date t and is independent of               and


 9. Of course, if            were serially correlated than longer lags of             would

   appear in (15).


10. If         < 0,     then the variances of p are much larger than in the
   corresponding models with           > 0.       Furthermore, Var p is inversely
   related to the values of y and a              when     < 0.



11. What makes this possible, of course, is the fact that the equilibrium
   prices are functions of their respective conditional variances.
   Consequently1 arguments based on the law of iterated expectations cannot
   be applied to order the variances for all possible representation of [en)
