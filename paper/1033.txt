             MONEY, CREDIT AND NONFINANCIAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY:

                    AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF FIVE COUNTRIES


                                  Abstract



       Data for five major industrialized economies show that the relationship

between credit and nonfinancial economic activity exhibits stability comparable

to that of the relationship between money and economic activity. Specific

orderings among a narrow monetary aggregate, a broad monetary aggregate and

a credit aggregate differ depending upon the stability criterion being applied

and the country under study. On balance, credit exhibits the most stable

contemporaneous relationship among the three aggregates, while the narrow

money stock exhibits the most stable dynamic relationship with credit in

second place and the broad money stock third.

       Further tests for the same five economies also show that, within the

total of nonfinancial debt comprising the aggregate, the respective public

and private debt components exhibit movements over time that offset one

another, and hence act to maintain the stability of total credit in relation

to economic activity.

       Finally, additional tests for these five economies do not support

the notion that the comparability of the respective relationships of credit

and money to nonfinancial economic activity is due to any straightforward

process whereby ttmoney causes income and income causes credit." The

interrelationships among money, credit, real income and prices in each

economy are too complex to admit of any such simple interpretation.

               MONEY, CREDIT AND NONFINANCIAL ECONOMIC ACTIVITY:

                      AN EMPIRICAL STUDY OF FIVE COUNTRIES

         Recent research for the United States has shown that one particular

credit aggregate, the outstanding indebtedness of all nonfinancial borrowers,

bears as close and as stable a relationship to the economy's nonfinancial

activity as do any of the monetary aggregates or the monetary base) More-

over, in contrast to the monetary aggregates, among which there seems to

be little basis for choice from this perspective, total nonfinancial debt

appears to be unique in this regard among major credit aggregates. Hence

unlike the monetary (and broader asset-side) aggregates, the stability

of   the relationship for total nonfinancial debt does not just represent
the stability   of a sum of   stable parts.
         The stability of the relationship between total nonfinancial debt

and economic activity bears several potentially important implications for

economic analysis as well as economic policy. From a theoretical perspec-

tive, this finding calls into question the conventional structure of macro-

economic models, which explicitly represents the supply-demand equilibrium

for the money market but not for the credit market, With respect to monetary

policy, the stability of the credit-to—income relationship immediately

suggests that, as long as a central bank operates within an intermediate

target framework, perhaps one of its principal targets should be a credit

aggregate. With respect to fiscal policy, some of the behavioral hypotheses

that are consistent with this finding have direct implications for whether

debt—financed government spending (or tax cuts) can provide an effective
                                            —2—




economic stimulus or can merely "crowd out" private spending.

          The object of this paper is to show that the finding of a stable

relationship between credit and nonfinancial economic activity is in no

way unique to the United States. Sections I-IV replicate for data from

four additional countries — Canada, Germany, Japan and the United Kingdom

— the comparative analyses of the credit-to—income versus money—to—income
relationships previously carried out for U.S. data. These tests span a

variety of methodologies including simple comparisons of coefficients of

variation (Section I), nominal income regressions (II), vector autoregression

generalizations of nominal income regressions (III), and vector autoregres-

sion analysis of private and government debt interactions (Iv). Section V

presents a further vector autoregression analysis for each country, addressing

the question of whether the explanation for the stability of the credit-to-

income relationship is simply that money "causes" income while income "causes"

credit.     (The answer is no.) Section VI summarizes the empirical findings

and   offers   brief concluding comments.

I.   Comparison of Money and     Credit   "Velocities"

          Each panel of Figure 1 shows, for a particular country, the movement

over time of three different ratios relating three of that country's finan-

cial aggregates to its nonfinancial economic activity as measured by gross
                    2
national product.        The three financial aggregates are in each case a narrow

money    stock measure ("Ml"),   a broad money stock measure ("M2" or "M3") and

total    nonfinancial   debt ("credit"). The data plotted are quarterly values

for Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. They are annual

for Germany (where quarterly credit data are unavailable). The specific

sample periods used for the five countries differ according to data avail-

ability as of the time of writing, and each series is indexed to 100 at its

inception to facilitate ready comparisons.

         Table 1 summarizes the stability of these fifteen ratios by showing

their respective coefficients of variation (standard deviation normalized

by mean), computed first from the raw data plotted in Figure 1 and then

from detrended data. What stands out most in intra—country comparisons

of coefficients of variation computed from the raw data is simply the dif-

ference, already apparent in Figure 1, between those aggregates that exhibit

time trends in their respective "reciprocal velocity" ratios — for example,

Ml in Canada, the U.K. and the U.S.; M2 in Canada and M3 in Germany; and

credit   in Germany and the U.K. — and      those that exhibit little or no trend.

Even so, as judged from the raw data, the credit ratio is more stable than

either of the money ratios in three of the five countries.

         On the basis of the detrended data, the credit ratio is more stable

than either of the money ratios in four of the five countries. Only in

Canada does either of the monetary aggregates (actually both, for Canada)

exhibit a more stable ratio to income than does credit. (Interestingly enough,

Canada is one of the three countries for which the credit ratio is the most

stable on the basis of the raw data.) A comparison of the two monetary

aggregates, across the four countries in which the credit ratio is more

stable than either one, shows that the Ml ratio is more stable than that

for M2 or M3 in all but Japan.

       In sum, intra—country comparisons of the respective coefficients of

variation of the ratios to gross national product of three financial aggregates

— narrow money, broad money, and credit —   show that credit consistently

exhibits either the closest, or nearly the closest, relationship to nonfinan-

cial economic activity.

II. Comparison of Nominal Income Regressions

            Because most of the interesting aspects of financial—nonfinancial

interactions are presumably dynamic, simple ratios of contemporaneous

observations like those presented in Section I probably fail to capture

the concept of "stability" that is relevant for either analyzing economic

behavior or formulating economic policy. Relationships admitting a lead

or lag pattern provide more useful stability measures.

            Table 2 presents summary statistics for equations estimated for

the same data analyzed in Section I, for each country, relating the growth

of nominal gross national product to a moving average of the growth of each

of the three financial aggregates listed in Table 1, plus a moving average

of a fiscal policy measure. Each equation is estimated in the familiar

form


            Aln    =   a   +         13 Am Ft. +                 Am Et. +                    (1)
                               i=O                      i=O

where Y is gross national product; F is any of the three aggregates; E is

government expenditures, measured on a full—employment basis;3 a, the 13.

and the y. are estimated scalar coefficients; and the 13. and                     are both

constrained to lie along fourth-degree polynomials with the implied l =

        =                      =     0.    For the four sets of equations based on
13N+l                  N+l
quarterly data, the lag lengths are N = 4.                    For Germany the lag lengths

based on armual data are N =              2,   with the 13.   and y. unconstrained.4

        For researchers familiar with nominal income regressions based on

U.S. data, perhaps the most striking feature of the results shown in Table 2

is not the intra—country comparisons at all but the inter—country comparisons

of overall performance. In contrast to the three U.S. regressions, not one

of the twelve non—U.S. regressions has a standard error smaller than .010
                                     —6—




(that is, 4% per annum for quarterly data). Only two of the twelve non-U.S.

regressions, those based on Ml for Canada and Germany, have coefficients of

determination above .20; and neither of these two have Durbin-Watson coeffi-

cients close to 2.00. Relationships of this kind apparently have much less

ability to "explain" the variation of nominal income in countries other

than the United States, perhaps because of the greater openness of their

respective economies.

       The within—country comparisons indicate that the equation based on

Ml has the greatest explanatory power for three of the five countries.

The equation based on credit performs best for the other two countries,

and is second-best in two of the three for which Ml is superior. Only in

the case of Germany does credit not outperform at least one of the two

monetary aggregates

III. Comparison of Multivariate Vector Autoregressions

       Because of widespread criticisms of the methodology underlying

nominal income regressions like those in Section II, researchers investigat-

ing the money—to—income (or, here, credit—to—income) relationship have

increasingly turned to methods that relate the variation of income not to

the entirety of the variation of money but to that part of it which cannot

already be deduced either from the past history of money itself or from

the joint past history of both money and income.6 A useful approach to

analyzing the dynamic interrelationships among economic time series in this

way is the vector autoregression.7 In brief, the vector autoregression

methodology first expresses each of a system of variables as a function of

lagged values of itself, lagged values of the other variables, and a distur-

bance term; then solves this representation to express each variable as a

function of the entire history of the disturbances associated with it and

the other variables; and, finally, investigates the direction and magnitude

of the response of each variable to given independent shocks, or "innovations,"

to any or all variables in the system. The vector autoregression is straight-

forward to estimate empirically, and simulation of the solved-out system

can then show the system—wide reactions that follow in response to innovations

in particular variables.

       A representation of the money—to—income or credit—to—income relation-

ship that is more general along these lines (but that omits the fiscal policy

variable, to keep the system small) is the vector autoregression

where the p. are disturbances, and the c. and B,. are, respectively, fixed

scalar coefficients and fixed—coefficient lag operator polynomials to be

estimated.8 Solution of the autoregression (2) yields a moving—average

representation of the form

      :i             iJ
values and past histories of both p1 and p2.

           Although        the normalization convention imposed in (2)   in order to

estimate       the system constrains the zero—lag elements of the four polynomials

                                             = 0, so

     "the y disturbance" in the usual sense, in general the p1 and p2 series
generated        in the estimation of (2) are not independent. Simulations of
(3) to trace the time paths of F and Y resulting from specific movements of
p1 and p2 would contain all the information that the vector autoregression

system can provide, but it is easier to think intuitively about the implica-

tions of such a simulation when it is possible to identify as its driving

force an independent innovation in either F or Y. Hence it is useful either

to subtract out of p1 that part of its variation that is correlated with

p2 so as to leave the residual to represent the independent innovation in

F or, alternatively, to subtract out of p2 that part of its variation that

is correlated with p1 so as to leave the residual to represent the independent

innovation in Y. The orthogonalization of (3) that extracts the independent

F innovation (as                is simply

German annual data, the table shows values for the first five years.

       By construction, Y remains unaffected in the initial period in which

an independent innovation occurs in F, so that in each case the F/Y ratio

rises by the full 1% of the innovation in F. In each system, however, the

bulge in F/Y shrinks as Y rises or F declines, or both. The question of the

stability of the relationship between F and Y is then a matter of the speed

and smoothness with which the bulge disappears. In the absence of a largely

arbitrary judgment of the exact time horizon that is relevant, any comparisons

among these results a±nit interpretation in a descriptive way only. Even

so, the intra—country comparisons are suggestive in several respects.

       The most straightforward aspect of these comparisons is the relatively

weak performance of the broader monetary aggregate. Only for Canada do

the simulation results show the ratio of M2 to income returning rapidly to

its baseline after the one—period impulse innovation in M2. For Japan the

M2 ratio's return is slower, and for Germany it is scarcely noticeable.

For both the United Kingdom and the United States, an M3 or M2 innovation

induces still further movements of the respective ratio away from the

baseline, followed by substantial over—correction on the return.

       The comparison between Ml and credit on this criterion of stability

is much closer, although on balance Ml has the edge. After an innovation

in Ml, the Ml-to-income ratio returns to its baseline quite quickly in three

countries, and moderately so in a fourth (Canada) .   Only for Japan is the
return somewhat slow and unsteady. Credit performs well in this context

in two countries (Germany and the United States) and moderately well in

a third (Japan). For Canada, however, the return of the credit ratio shows

substantial over—correction, and for the United Kingdom it shows both slow-

ness and over—correction. By a rough margin of one country out of five,
                                                 —11—




therefore, Ml appears to have the more stable relationship to income in

this context.

       A further element in the tendency of recent researchers to eschew

reliance on simple nominal income regressions like those in Section II has

been an increasing reluctance to focus on the relationship between money

 (or, here, credit) and nominal income without distinguishing between the

real and price components of nominal income variation.11 Table 4 presents

simulation results that are analogous to those shown in Table 3 but are

based on the trivariate system

The Mi—to—income ratio returns rapidly and smoothly to its baseline after

an innovation in Ml in two countries, the United Kingdom and the United

States, and moderately so in two others, Canada and Japan. (It is interesting

that the one exception here is Germany, while in the bivariate results the

one country for which Ml performs poorly is Japan.) The credit—to—income

ratio also returns to its baseline rapidly and smoothly in two countries,

here Germany and the United States. In Canada and the United Kingdom,

however, the credit ratio exhibits a temporary but substantial over—correction,

and in Japan the over-correction is fairly modest but persistent nonetheless.

Canada is again the only country for which the broader money ratio shows

strong stability on this criterion, although the respective M2 results for

Germany and the United States also show stability after some delay.

       On balance, the intra-country comparisons of stability in bivariate

and trivariate vector autoregression generalizations of the more familiar

nominal income regressions suggest, somewhat weakly, that the money—to—

income relationship is either more or less stable than the credit—to—income

relationship according to whether the "money" in question is a narrow or

a broad monetary aggregate, respectively. This conclusion about the relative

stability among the three aggregates in this sense is somewhat different

from that indicated by nominal income regressions themselves, and quite

different from that indicated by comparisons of coefficients of variation.

Hence the specific criterion for judging stability appears to be important

for the implied ordering. Moreover, the country-by-country differences

between the results shown in Tables 3 and 4 further reinforce the importance

of the choice of criterion, in that even the difference between bivariate

and trivariate autoregressions can alter the results for any given country.

IV.   Interactions Between Public and Private Debt

          n argument for the stability of an aggregate inevitably relies on

some notion of negative covariance among that aggregate's components. More-

over, as the analysis in Sections II and III has emphasized, for many purposes

what is important is not just the precisely contemporaneous covariation

but the joint movement of two or more series over time. In the case of an

economy's total nonfinancial debt ratio, stability requires that movements

in any one sector's debt relative to economic activity typically be offset

by movements in the opposite direction in at least some other sector's debt.

          The vector autoregression methodology used in Section III to examine

the dynamic covariation between aggregate credit and income in each country

is equally suitable for analyzing the dynamic covariation among the respec-

tive debt totals of different sectors comprising each country's aggregate

credit. Although in principle it would be possible to apply this analytical

apparatus to as full a disaggregation as each country's data sources permit,

doing so would yield so many partial relationships as to confound rather than

enhance understanding. Hence some more compact —that is, more fully

aggregated — way of organizing the data is needed. In light of the

theoretical literature on financial aspects of fiscal policy, one procedure

that makes sense intuitively is to distinguish between the government and

private   components of total nonfinancial debt, while continuing to aggregate
fully within the private sector)
          The bivariate vector autoregression representing the interaction of

the public and private sectors' respective outstanding debt totals, each

measured as a ratio to gross national product (so that for each country

the two sum to the aggregate credit ratio plotted in Figure 1), is

       By construction, whichever of CG/Y or CP/Y does not experience the

1% innovation in the first year remains unchanged in that year, so that the

aggregate debt ratio (CG+CP)/Y also rises by 1%. Soon thereafter, in most

cases, a gradual decay in the component ratio experiencing the innovation

and an induced offsetting response in the other component ratio combine to

return the aggregate ratio to (or at least toward) the pre-innovation

baseline. For an innovation in the government debt ratio, the simulations

for Canada, the United Kingdom arid the United States all show prompt inter-

actions of this kind, and those for Germany arid Japan do as well (albeit

more slowly in Germany) after a counter—stable reaction in the second year.14

For an innovation in the private debt ratio, the simulations for Japan, the

United Kingdom and the United States all show this stable pattern, and that

for Germany does also except for some over-correction. In sum, except only

for Japan in the case of an innovation in the government debt ratio and

Canada in the case of an innovation in the private debt ratio, these results

provide evidence of offsetting dynamic interactions between public and

private debt behavior that tend to restore the stability (in relation to

income) of their sum in the context of a disturbance in either one.

V. Questions of Causality

       The finding that the stability of the credit-to-income relationship

is comparable to that of the money-to—income relationship is interesting

in many respects. Nevertheless, its potential importance for issues of

economic analysis and economic policy fundamentally depends on the behavior

underlying this empirical phenomenon. Alternative behavioral mechanisms,

each consistent with this basic observation, imply different answers to

familiar questions about individuals' and firms' perceptions, about their

actions in the financial markets, about the connection between spending—

saving decisions and borrowing—lending decisions, and about the effects of

monetary arid   fiscal   policies. Investigating the behavioral determinants

of the stability of the credit-to-income relationship conätitutes a major

challenge for macroeconomic research, but one that lies well beyond the

scope of this paper.15
       Even at the outset, however, it is important to clarify one dimension

of the uncertainty surrounding the source (or sources) of the stability of

the relationship between aggregate credit and income. In particular, this

finding would be of limited usefulness if credit were merely the "tail"

being wagged by the "dog" consisting of the rest of the economy — that

is, if the other major aspects of economic activity were predetermined with

respect to credit, rather than jointly determined along with credit. The

same proposition also holds, of course, for the relationship between economic

activity and money (however measured). A stable money—to—income relation-

ship is of little value for economic policy if variations in money are simply

after—the—fact responses to variations in nonfinancial economic activity.

        In the context of this paper's focus on intra—country comparisons

of money versus credit, the important question is whether credit is more or
                                     —17—




 less fundamentally bound up in the joint determination of nonfinancial

economic activity than is money. Does money "cause" income while income

in turn "causes" credit? Is the reverse true? Does some dichotomy render

nonfinancial activity predetermined with respect to both money and credit?

Or are money and credit both jointly determined along with behavior in

nonfinancial markets?

       Following Granger [5] and Sims [8, 10], Table 6 presents test statis-

tics based on the estimation of (8), with first the Ml money stock and then

credit used as the financial aggregate. The estimation again includes

eight quarters of lags on each variable in each system based on quarterly

data. Because the choice of lag length affected the results in the system

based on German annual data, the table presents separate results for Germany

based on lags of two years and four years, respectively, on each variable.

For each variable in each estimated equation, the table reports the F—statis-

tic for a test of the null hypothesis that all of the 13..   coefficients   on

that variable in that equation are zero —   in   other words, the hypothesis

that that particular independent variable does not incrementally contribute

to explaining the variation of the dependent variable in that equation,

beyond the explanation already provided by the other included variables.

       Although there is little uniformity in results across the five countries

(apart from the tendency of each variable to be significantly related to its

own past history), these test statistics do not support the notion that

money affects nonfinancial economic activity in some sense that credit

does not. The coefficients on the lagged money values are significantly

different from zero at the .10 level in the real income equations in Canada,

the United Kingdom and the United States, while the analogous coefficients

on credit significantly differ from zero only for Germany and the United

States.16 By contrast, the money coefficients are significantly different

from zero in the price equations only for Japan, while the analogous credit

coefficients are significantly nonzero not only for Japan but also for

Canada and the United States.

       The results are somewhat more consistent with the notion that money

is predetermined with respect to nonfinancial economic activity while credit

is not. Apart from the results for Germany, which differ here according to

the lag length, the respective sets of coefficients on real income and

prices are both insignificantly different from zero at the .10 level in the

money equations for all countries except the United States. In the credit

equations the coefficients on income are significantly nonzero only for

Canada (and for Germany with two years of lags); but the coefficients on

prices are nonzero for Canada, Japan and the United States (and again Germany

with two years of lags).

       If neither money nor credit is in the situation of simply being

affected by nonfinancial activity while not affecting it, then systems that

exclude one aggregate or the other —'--like those underlying the results

shown in Table 6 — are misspecified. Table 7 presents analogous test

statistics based on the estimation of a four—variable vector autoregression

that generalizes (8) by including both Ml and credit (in addition to real

income and prices, as before).

       The results for these four—variable systems do not support the idea

that money affects nonfinancial economic activity in some way that credit

does not, nor the idea that money is predetermined with respect to economic

activity in some way that credit is not. In the equations for real income

the coefficients on money are significantly nonzero only in the case of

Canada, while the coefficients on credit are significantly nonzero only in
                                       —19—




the case of Germany.17 In the price equations, the coefficients on money

are significantly nonzero Only for Japan, while the coefficients on credit

are significantly nonzero for Canada, Japan and the United States. In the

equations for money, the coefficients on real income are significantly

nonzero only for the United States, while the coefficients on prices are

significantly nonzero for Germany and the United States. In the credit

equations the coefficients on real income are significantly nonzero only

for Germany, while the coefficients on both prices and money are significant

for Canada and Germany.

       Although the results of these two sets of exogeneity tests add little

to understanding of the economic behavior connecting money, credit and

nonfinancial economic activity, they do show that there is no evidence to

warrant dismissing the observed stability of the credit-to-income relation-

ship on the supposed ground that behavior in the credit market — unlike

that in the money market —   is   determined after the fact, without effect

on behavior in nonfinancial markets.

VI. Summary of Conclusions

       A series of different tests, based on a range of methodologies and

on data for five major industrialized economies, shows that the relationship

between credit and nonfinancial economic activity exhibits stability that

is comparable to that of the relationship between money and economic activity.

Specific orderings among a narrow monetary aggregate, a broad monetary aggregate

and a credit aggregate (defined in each case as total nonfinancial debt)

differ depending upon the stability criterion being applied and the country

under study. To the extent that the results as a whole admit of generaliza-

tion, credit exhibits the most stable contemporaneous relationship among

the three aggregates, while the narrow money stock exhibits the most stable

dynamic relationship with credit in second place and the broad money stock

third. Further tests also show that, within the total nonfinancial debt

(credit) aggregate, the respective public and private debt components exhibit

movements over time that offset one another, and hence act to maintain the

stability of total credit in relation to economic activity.

       Moreover, additional tests for the same five economies do not support

the notion that the comparability of the respective relationships of credit

and money to nonfinancial economic activity is due to any simple process

whereby "money causes income and income causes credit." The interrelationships

among money, credit, real income and prices in each economy are too complex

to admit of any such straightforward interpretation. Hence the economic

behavior underlying the stability of the credit—to—income relationship

reamins a major puzzle — though, on reflection, no more so than the stability

of the money-to-income relationship (for any "inside" definition of money).

       Unraveling that puzzle is an important and challenging task for

macroeconomic research. In the meanwhile, the empirical fact that the
                                   —21—




credit—to—income relationship is roughly as stable as the money—to—income

relationship raises important caveats about the conventional focus of macro—

economic theory on the economy's assets but not its liabilities, about

the conventional inclusion in macroeconomic models of an explicit represen-

tation of the money market but not the credit market, and about the conven-

tion focus of central bank policy on monetary aggregates but not credit

aggregates.

*    I am grateful to Richard Clarida for research assistance and useful
     discussions; to John Fleinming, Randy Geehan, Shafiqul Islam, Ingebord
     Schram and Stephen Taylor for help in gathering data; and to the National
     Science Foundation (grant SES 81—12673) and the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation
     for research support.

    1.   See Friedman [2, 3].

    2. For the monetary aggregates these ratios are the reciprocals of the
        familiar "income velocity" measures. In the case of the United Kingdom,
        the income measure is gross domestic product.

    3. In the case of Japan, the Only available series for E is not seasonally
        adjusted. The three regressions for Japanese data therefore also in-
        clude seasonal dummy variables. Once again, in the case of the United
        Kingdom the income measure is gross domestic product.

4. The choice of N = 2 versus N = 4 slightly affects the ordering in the
    regressions for the German annual data. With N = 4 (and th polynomial
    constraint on the . and y.) the respective sets of (SE, R , DW)
    values are (.0232, .16, l.6) for Ml, (.0336, —, 1.16) for M2 and
    (.0357, —, 1.26) for credit.

5. With both - 2 values negative, it is difficult to say that credit
         "outperforms" M3 despite the slight difference in standard errors.
         Also, see again footnote 4.

6. The most prominent criticisms of nominal income regressions like (1)
    have focused on the assumption of exogeneity with respect to nominal
    income of the two right—hand—side variables, as well as on the failure
    to distinguish the autoregressively deterministic from stochastic
    components of the variation of all three variables. See, for example,
    Goldfeld and Blinder [4], Sargent [7], and Modigliani and 7ndo [6].
    See Section V below for tests of the exogeneity assumption for the
    money or credit aggregates.

7. See Sims [9] for a discussion of the vector autoregression methodology
    and its underlying rationale.

8. The use of levels of logarithms in (2) instead of differences of
    logarithms as in (1) has essentially no effect as long as the lag
    lengths of the B.. are sufficient to provide roots near the unit circle.
     (If no roots nearthe unit circle are needed, then the differencing in
     (1) is incorrect in the first place.) Including a time trend in (2)
    would in general make a difference, but for the U.S. data results
    based on the alternative specification including a time trend differed
    little from those shown in Table 3 below.

9. The alternate orthogonalization that extracts E.) as the independent
    innovation in y simply reverses the off-diagona' positions of 0 and
    A in (5) and (6), with var(1j1) replacing var(p2) in the denominator
    of (7).
10. Results based on U.S. data indicated that the response of F/Y to
     independent innovations in Y show little difference according to which
      aggregate   is used for F; see Friedman [31.
11.   The exogeneity tests presented in Section V below provide further
      support for distinguishing movements of real income and prices.
12. Results based on U.S. data indicated that the response of F/(X.P)
      to independent innovations in either X or P show little difference
      according to which aggregate is used for F; see again Friedman [31.

13. How to treat the debt of sub—national governmental jurisdictions for
     this purpose is a subtle question. The procedure followed here was
     to treat as "public" only the debts of national governments, as far
     as the available data permitted drawing distinctions.

14. The individual components of the simulation for Germany in the second
     year show a movement to 1.18 in CG/Y, offset in part by an induced
     reaction of - .15 in CP/Y. The (CG+CP)/Y ratio continues to decline
     after the fifth year, falling below .10 in the ninth year.

15. See Friedman [1] for a beginning along these lines.

16.   These results for the United States differ from those reported in
      Friedman  [2], which were based on a different sample period and a
      different definition of money.

17. This result for the United States again differs from that reported in
     Friedman [2] for a different sample period and a different definition
     of money. The German results shown are for N = 2; in the results
     for N = 4 (not shown), nothing was significant except F(X) in the
     equation for X.
