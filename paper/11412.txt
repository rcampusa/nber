In this paper, I examine changes in labor supply and earnings across regions of Mexico during the
1990s. I focus the analysis on individuals born in states with either high-exposure or low-exposure
to emigration, as measured by historical data on state migration to the United States. During the
1990s, rates of external migration and interval migration were higher among individuals born in
high-migration states. Consistent with positive selection of emigrants in terms of observable skill,
emigration rates appear to be highest among individuals with earnings in the top half of the wage
distribution. Controlling for regional differences in observable characteristics and for initial regional
differences in earnings, the distribution of male earnings in high-migration states shifted to the right
relative to low-migration states. Over the decade, average hourly earnings in high-migration states
rose relative to low-migration states by 6-9%.

1. Introduction

        Over the last several decades, migration to the United States has profoundly

affected the Mexican economy. The most obvious change has been to Mexico’s labor

supply. Between 1970 and 2000, the share of the Mexican population (individuals born

in Mexico) residing in the United States increased from 1.7% to 8.6% (Figure 1).1

Emigration rates have been rising steadily over time and are highest for young adults.

Between 1990 and 2000, 10.0% of males and 7.7% of females born in Mexico between

1965 and 1974 migrated to the United States, raising the share of this age cohort living in

the U.S. to 17.5% for males and 12.6% for females (Table 1).

        Not surprisingly, the outmigration of labor appears to have put upward pressure

on wages in Mexico. Mishra (2004) estimates that in Mexico over the period 1970-2000

the elasticity of wages with respect to the outflow of migrant labor was 0.4 and that

emigration raised average wages in the country by 8.0%. Upward pressure on wages has

been strongest for young adults with above-average education levels (those with 9 to 15

years of schooling), who in the 1990s were the individuals most likely to migrate to the

United States (Chiquiar and Hanson, 2005). Increased labor flows between Mexico and

the United States appear to be one factor contributing to labor-market integration between

the two countries. For the 1990s, Robertson (2000) finds that a shock that raises U.S.

wages by 10% raises wages in Mexico by 1.8% to 2.5%.

        Were the only effect of emigration to raise wages for migrants and for non-

migrating workers who substitute for migrant labor, the labor outflow would yield static

 In this calculation, the numerator is the population of individuals born in Mexico, as enumerated in the
U.S. population census, and the denominator is the sum of this figure and the population of individuals
born in Mexico, as enumerated in the Mexican population census. This calculation ignores the small
number of individuals born in Mexico who have migrated to third countries.


                                                                                                       1
welfare losses in Mexico. However, an additional consequence of Mexican emigration

has been an increase in the return flow of remittances.                In 2003, remittances from

Mexican immigrants in the United States equaled 2.0% of Mexican GDP (IADB, 2004).

These appear to more than offset the loss in GDP due to emigration.2

        An important aspect of migrant behavior in Mexico is that the propensity to

emigrate varies greatly across regions of the country. Due partly to historical accident,

central and western Mexico have long had the country’s highest labor flows abroad. In

Figure 2, which shows the fraction of households that sent migrants to the United States

over 1995-2000 by Mexican state, emigration rates are relatively low in states along the

U.S. border, sharply higher in states 600-1200 kilometers from the United States, and

lowest in distant southern states. Regional variation in migration behavior suggests that

the labor-market consequences of migrant outflows may be concentrated in specific

areas. If this is true, estimates of the impact of emigration at the national level may

understate its impact on the most affected regions. While the importance of specific

sending regions in Mexican migration to the United States has long been recognized

(Cardoso, 1980), there is relatively little empirical work that assesses the regional

economic effects of emigration in Mexico (Durand, Massey, and Zenteno, 2001).

        In this paper I examine the regional impacts of emigration on labor supply and

labor-market earnings in Mexico. I compare changes in labor-market outcomes across

individuals between 1990 and 2000 in two groups of states, states that had high

emigration rates in the 1950s and states that had low emigration rates in the 1950s. There


2
  Based on Mishra’s (2004) estimates, the emigration loss in Mexico for 2000 would be 0.45% of GDP (0.5
times change in wages due to emigration of 8.0% times loss in labor supply due to emigration of 16.0%
times labor share of income of 0.70). In that year, remittances were 1.1% of Mexican GDP. See Borjas
(1999a) for estimates of the immigration surplus for the United States.


                                                                                                     2
are two key identifying assumptions in my analysis. One is that labor is sufficiently

immobile across Mexican regions for region-specific labor-supply shocks to affect

regional earnings differentials. Robertson (2000), Chiquiar (2004), and Hanson (2004)

provide evidence of region-specific labor-market shocks having affected Mexico’s

regional wage structure, which is consistent with some degree of regional labor

immobility. The second identifying assumption is that current opportunities to migrate to

the United States depend on regional historical migration patterns. One reason this may

be the case is that migration networks are regionally organized and historically

dependent. Munshi (2003) and Orrenius and Zavodny (2004) are recent contributions to

a large literature that finds that in Mexico access to family or community networks helps

migrants enter and succeed in the United States.3

        In the estimation, I use migration rates in the 1950s as a reduced-form

determinant of current migration opportunities. Since high emigration in the past could

have altered regions in a manner that affects current labor-market conditions, a reduced-

form approach is more appropriate than using past migration behavior as an instrument

for current migration. To control for internal migration, I use the 1950s emigration rate

in an individual’s birth state, rather than his current state of residence.                   Historical

migration rates in an individual’s birth state are thus meant to capture current access to

migration networks, and so current opportunities to emigrate, in the Mexican regional

labor market in which an individual is located. The persistence in regional differences in

migration behavior (Figure 3) is roughly consistent with my identifying assumptions.


3
  An implicit third identifying assumption is that emigration incentives for Mexicans were stronger in the
1990s than in previous decades, which in combination with the second assumption would imply that any
negative labor supply shock associated with emigration would be larger in states with a longer history of
U.S. migration. Data presented in section 3 are consistent with this assumption.


                                                                                                        3
       The challenges to identifying the regional consequences of emigration in Mexico

are analogous to those in identifying the regional consequences of immigration in the

United States. Many studies have found that across U.S. cities and states immigrant

inflows are only weakly negatively correlated with wage changes for U.S. native

workers, suggesting that immigration has had little impact on the U.S. wage structure (see

LaLonde and Topel, 1997; Smith and Edmonston, 1997; Borjas, 1999; Card; 2001).

Borjas, Freeman, and Katz (1997) argue that cross-area wage regressions of this type

identify the wage impact of immigration only under restrictive assumptions.           The

tendency for immigrants to settle in regions with high wage growth makes estimates of

the immigration wage impact based on cross-area regressions susceptible to upward bias.

The standard practice of using the preceding decade’s regional immigrant stock to

instrument for current regional immigrant inflows may not be valid if regional labor-

market shocks persist over time. Borjas (2003) examines age and education cohorts at

the national level and finds larger wage effects from immigration. He estimates that over

1980-2000 the elasticity of U.S. native wages with respect to immigrant inflows was 0.3-

0.4 and that immigration contributed to a decrease in U.S. average wages of 3%.

       Similar to the cross-area regression approach, I distinguish between Mexican

states based on historical migration behavior. However, distinct from this approach I am

able to use much longer lags on regional migration rates and to measure historical

migration rates in an individual’s birth state. These features help address the concerns

that (i) regional labor-market shocks may persist for more than a decade, and (ii) an

individual’s current state of residence may be affected by current regional migration




                                                                                        4
rates. The assumptions underlying my approach are thus perhaps less restrictive than

those underlying the standard cross-area approach in literature on U.S. immigration.

          An obvious challenge for the estimation is that there may be other, unobserved

differences between high and low migration states that may affect current labor-market

outcomes.      By examining regional differences in changes in outcomes, rather than

regional differences in outcome levels, I am able to control for time-invariant region-

specific characteristics. Still, there may have been other shocks in the 1990s that had

differential effects on regions with high versus low opportunities to migrate to the United

States.    Candidate shocks include the North American Free Trade Agreement, the

privation and deregulation of industry, the reform of Mexico’s land-tenure system, and

the 1994-1995 peso crisis.4 The potential for these shocks to contaminate the analysis is

an important concern, which I address in discussing qualifications to my results.

          In the next section, I document further how migration behavior varies across

regions of Mexico and discuss the criterion I use for selecting which Mexican states to

include in my sample. In section 3, I describe how changes in labor supply vary across

high and low-migration states in Mexico and compare mean earnings and the distribution

of earnings in high and low-migration states. In section 4, I use standard parametric

techniques and non-parametric techniques developed by DiNardo, Fortin, and Lemieux

(1996) and Leibbrandt, Levinsohn, and McCrary (2004) to examine how earnings have

changed over time in high and low migration states. By wage of conclusion in section 5,

I discuss limitations of the estimation strategy and ideas for extending the analysis.

2. Regional Patterns of Emigration in Mexico
2.1 Data Sources

       Data for the analysis come from two Mexican sources. In 1990, I use the 1%

microsample of the XII Censo General de Poblacion y Vivienda, 1990, and in 2000 I use

a 10% random sample of the 10% microsample of the XIII Censo General de Poblacion y

Vivienda, 2000. Unfortunately, the 1990 census contains no information about household

emigration behavior. The 2000 census includes two questions related to emigration: (i)

whether anyone from the household migrated to the United States (or another foreign

country) in the last five years (and the number, age, and gender of these individuals), and

(ii) whether anyone in the household received income in the previous month in the form

of remittances from migrants located abroad (and the quantity received). These questions

have obvious shortcomings. They provide no indication of the education of migrants,

return or round-trip migration, migration before 1995, annual receipts of remittances, or

transfers from migrants in kind rather than in cash. Still, the 2000 census is useful in that

it is the only nationally representative sample available for Mexico that contains

information about migration to the United States.

       For data on historical migration patterns, I use estimates of state emigration rates

from Woodruff and Zenteno (2001). They calculate the fraction of each Mexican state’s

population that migrated to the United States over 1955-59 by combining data on

Mexican state populations with data on annual U.S. immigration of temporary legal

workers from each Mexican state under the U.S. Bracero Program.                The Bracero

Program, which lasted from 1942 to 1965, allowed U.S. employers to import workers

from Mexico (and the Caribbean) to fulfill short-term labor contracts. Most braceros



                                                                                           6
worked in agriculture (Calavita, 1992). Woodruff and Zenteno (2001) also provide data

on state emigration rates in 1924, which I use in some empirical exercises.

        For the analysis of earnings, I focus on men, since their labor-force participation

rates are relatively stable over time, rising modestly from 73% in 1990 to 74% in 2000

(and are quite similar in high and low migration states). Labor-force participation rates

for women are low and variable over time, rising from 21% in 1990 to 32% in 2000. For

women, this creates issues of sample selection associated with who supplies labor outside

the home that complicates examining changes in the distribution of earnings.



2.2 Regional Patterns in Mexican Migration to the United States

        Large scale migration from Mexico to the United States began in the early 20th

century. The construction of railroads in the late 19th century linked interior Mexico to

the U.S.-Mexico border, which gave U.S. employers improved access to Mexico labor

(Cardoso, 1980). In the early 1900s, growers in Texas began to recruit farm laborers in

Mexico.     At the time, the population on the Texas-Mexico border was small and

dispersed. To find workers, recruiters followed the main rail line into Mexico, which ran

southwest through relatively densely populated states in the west-central region of the

country. Early migrants came primarily from nine states in this region (Durand, Massey,

and Zenteno, 2001).5 The recruitment efforts of U.S. employers intensified in the 1920s,

after the U.S. Congress imposed stringent quotas on U.S. legal immigration, which

sharply reduced immigration of low-skilled labor from southern and eastern Europe.

Recruitment intensified further in the 1940s, after Congress passed legislation allowing


5
 These nine states are Aguascalientes, Colima, Durango, Guanajuato, Jalisco, Michoacán, Nayarit, San
Luis Potosí, and Zacatecas.


                                                                                                       7
large-scale temporary legal immigration from Mexico under the Bracero Program

(Calavita, 1992). From the 1920s to the 1960s, the nine west-central states accounted for

44.0% to 56.1% of Mexican migration to the United States (but only 27.1% to 31.5% of

Mexico’s total population) (Durand, Massey, and Zenteno, 2001).

       After working in the United States, many migrants return to Mexico where they

often assist later generations in emigrating. Migrants remaining in the United States have

created home-town associations that help members of their communities in Mexico make

the transition to living north of the border (Cano, 2004). In addition to home-town

associations, there appear to be many informal networks through which current migrants

help prospective migrants enter the United States, find housing in U.S. cities, and obtain

jobs with U.S. employers. These networks are often embedded in relationships involving

family, kin, or community of birth, which gives them a strong regional component. Of

218 home-town associations formed by Mexican immigrants enumerated in 2002 survey

of such organizations in southern California, 86.6% were associated with one of the nine

west-central states (Cano, 2004). Networks appear to be important for migrant outcomes

in the receiving country. Munshi (2003) finds that Mexican immigrants in the United

States are more likely to be employed the larger is the U.S. population of residents from

their home community in Mexico (where he instruments for the size of the home-

community population using time-series data on regional rainfall in Mexico).          The

importance of migrant networks for migration behavior and their strong regional

character may help explain regional persistence in migration patterns.

       Figure 3 provides graphical evidence of persistence in regional migration

behavior. The states that had high migration rates in the 1950s, during the height of the




                                                                                        8
Bracero Program, continue to be high migration states. The correlation between state

emigration rates in the 1995-2000 and the 1955-59 periods is 0.73. The correlation

between state migration rates in the 1995-2000 and 1924 periods is 0.48.

       As Figure 2 illustrates, high migration states are not those closest to the United

States. Nor does income appear to be the sole determinant of emigration. Table 2 reports

regressions of state emigration rates in 1995-2000 on income and other state

characteristics. In column 1, there is a negative correlation between state emigration

rates and state per capita GDP, but the explanatory power of income isn’t all that high. In

column 2, adding distance to the United States (and distance squared) more than doubles

the R-squared of the regression. The relation between emigration and proximity to the

U.S. is nonlinear, with emigration initially rising with distance (reflecting low emigration

in states on the U.S. border) and then declining with distance (reflecting high emigration

for central states and low emigration for distant southern states). In column 3, adding the

state emigration rate in 1924 as an independent variable raises the R-squared of the

regression from 0.25 to 0.46. However, there appears to be little covariation between the

1995-2000 and 1924 emigration rates that is independent of the 1950s emigration rate. In

column 4, once the 1955-59 emigration rate is added the R-squared rises further to 0.67

and the 1924 migration rate becomes statistically insignificant, reflecting the strong

historical persistence in state emigration patterns. Columns 5-8 repeat the exercise using

the fraction of households in 2000 receiving remittances from migrants abroad as the

dependent variable, with similar results.

       If states with relatively high emigration rates are also states that are more exposed

to other aspects of globalization, then the empirical analysis might confound the effects




                                                                                          9
of emigration with the effects of trade or capital flows. During the 1980s and 1990s, the

Mexican government lowered barriers to international trade and foreign investment.

Chiquiar (2004) and Hanson (2004) find that since 1985 Mexican states more engaged in

international trade have enjoyed faster growth in average income and labor earnings.

However, high emigration states do not appear to have benefited disproportionately from

trade and investment reform. As expected, trade liberalization has affected states on the

U.S.-Mexico border most strongly, and, as Figure 2 shows, border states are not high

emigration states. Most high emigration states appear to have relatively low exposure to

foreign trade and investment. This is seen in Figures 4 and 5, which plot the fraction of

the state population migrating to the United States over 1995-2000 against the share of

foreign direct investment in state GDP and the share of imports in state GDP. Table 3

shows that across Mexico states in the 1990s emigration rates are weakly negatively

correlated with exposure to trade and foreign investment. It appears high exposure to

emigration is not associated with high exposure to globalization. I discuss variation in

state exposure to these and other shocks again in Section 5.



2.3 Sample Design

       The goal of this paper is to examine the regional labor-market consequences of

emigration in Mexico. One approach would be to utilize data on migration to the United

States in Mexico’s 2000 population census. Using the 2000 data, I could compare labor-

market outcomes in households with emigrants to outcomes in households without

emigrants.   Or, combining the household cross-sections in 1990 and 2000, I could

examine the covariation between the 1990-2000 change in household outcomes with the

1995-2000 state emigration rate. The obvious concern with either of these approaches is


                                                                                      10
that household migration behavior is endogenous. The unobserved characteristics of

households that affect their earnings and labor supply are also likely to affect whether

households send migrants to the United States.

         One way to address the endogeneity problem would be to use historical state

emigration rates as an instrument for current opportunities to migrate abroad.                         The

discussion in section 2.2 suggests that the 1950s emigration rate in an individual’s birth

state would be a good indicator of an individual’s access to migration networks and so of

an individual’s relative opportunity to migrate to the United States. Using data from the

2000 census, unreported probit regressions show that the likelihood a household either

has sent a migrant to the United States in the last five years or has received remittances

from abroad in the last month is strongly positively correlated with the 1955-59

emigration rate in the household head’s birth state.6

         However, historical state emigration rates are unlikely to be a valid instrument for

current migration rates. Emigration opportunities in an individual’s birth state may have

affected an individual’s accumulation of human capital, either by influencing the

individual’s early employment prospects (if local emigration rates affect local wage

levels) or the quality of education the individual received as a youth (if remittances or

local income levels affect the quality of local schools). Past emigration opportunities are

thus likely to affect current labor-market outcomes both directly, through their impact on




6
  Additional controls in this regression are a cubic in age of the household head, dummies for the
educational attainment of the household head, the sex of the household head, and dummy variables for the
state of residence. Evaluated at mean values for the other regressors, individuals born in high-migration
states are 24.3% more likely to have had someone in their household migrate to the United States in the last
five years and 21.7% more likely to have received remittances from migrants located abroad in the last
month (with both of these effects very precisely estimated).


                                                                                                         11
current emigration opportunities, and indirectly, through their impact on an individual’s

stock of human capital (which is only partially observed).

       Given these concerns, I take a reduced-form approach by comparing changes in

cross-section labor-market outcomes, where I categorize individuals according to the

emigration rate in their birth state. In so doing, I capture both the direct and indirect

effects of historical emigration opportunities on current labor-market outcomes.       In

presenting the empirical results, I will discuss whether the reduced-form effect of

historical emigration rates on labor-market outcomes is likely to under or over-state the

effect attributable solely to current emigration opportunities.

       My empirical strategy is thus to compare labor-market outcomes in regions that

have been more or less exposed to opportunities to migrate to the United States. Table 4

describes the sample of states. I drop the six border states from the sample, since these

states have benefited disproportionately from trade and investment liberalization. Most

border states had above average emigration rates in the 1950s and including them in the

sample could confound the effects of emigration with those of other aspects of

globalization. To help isolate the effects of emigration, I limit high-migration states to

those with emigration rates in the top three deciles of non-border states and low-

migration states to those with emigration rates in the bottom three deciles of non-border

states. In 2000, 10.4% of households in the seven high-migration states had sent a

migrant to the United States in the previous five years, compared with only 2.1% of

households in the seven low-migration states.

       With the exception of the Federal District, in which part of Mexico City is

located, all the low-migration states are in southern Mexico. Per capita income in the




                                                                                       12
Federal District is over three times that in the southern low-migration states. And, as

Figures 4 and 5 show, the Federal District has much higher exposure to international

trade than the southern low-migration states. There is also heterogeneity among high-

migration states. Jalisco, in which Guadalajara (the country’s second largest city) is

located, has high relatively high exposure to international trade. By way of checking the

robustness of the results, I will perform the analysis with and without individuals born in

the Federal District or Jalisco included in the sample.



3. Preliminary Analysis

3.1 Population Changes in High and Low Migration States

        The most direct effect of emigration has been to reduce the relative population of

young adults born in high-migration states. Figures 6 and 7 show cohort sizes based on

age in 2000 for males and females born in high-migration or low-migration states. In the

absence of measurement error, changes in population size are due to either net migration

abroad or to death. Cohort sizes decline for all age-sex groups, except 10-19 year olds.7

Population declines are largest for 20-29 year-old men (men born between 1971 and

1980) from high-migration states, whose number declines by 33.4 log points. In low-

migration states, the number of 20-29 year-old men drops by only 9.4 log points, such

that the relative decline of the 20-29 year-old male population in high-migration states

over 1990-2000 is 24.0 log points.             Overall, the population of 20-59 year-old men

declines by 9.8 log points in high-migration relative to low-migration states.8


7
  One explanation for the increases in cohort size for 10-19 year olds is greater measurement error in the
1990 census (in which case Figures 7 and 8 may understate reductions in cohort sizes over the decade).
8
  One might imagine that internal migration in Mexico could have partly reversed the change in relative
regional labor supplies due to emigration. The large exodus of individuals born in high-migration states
might have given individuals from other states an incentive to move in. But data on population by state of


                                                                                                       13
        Absolute and relative changes in female cohorts are smaller. The cohort of 20-29

year-old women declines by 16.8 log points in high-migration states and 2.0 log points in

low-migration states. Overall, the population of 20-59 year-old women declines by 8.4

log points in high-migration relative to log-migration states.9 Figure 8 shows that as a

result of higher emigration rates for males, the share of men in the population of 20-29

year olds from high-migration states falls from 49% to 45% during the 1990s. In low-

migration states the change is more modest, with a drop of 50% to 48%.

        It appears men and women born in high-migration states in Mexico have become

more likely to migrate abroad. One might also wonder whether they have become more

likely to migrate internally. Table 5 reports probit regressions using data from 1990 and

2000 on whether individuals born in high-migration or low-migration states have

changed their state of residence since birth. The regressors are (a) a cubic in age, dummy

variables for five categories of educational attainment (1-5 years, 6-8 years, 9-11 years,

12-15 years, 16+ years), a dummy variable for marital status, dummy variables for

presence of children in the household (ages 0-5, 6-12, 13-18), dummy variables for the

state of birth, and a dummy variable for 2000; (b) interactions between the age,

education, marital status, and children variables and the year 2000 dummy; (c)

interactions between the age, education, marital status, and children variables and a

dummy variable for whether the individual was born in a high-migration state; and (d) the

interaction between the year 2000 dummy and the dummy for whether an individual was

born in a high-migration state. I report results only for this last variable, which captures

residence (rather than state of birth) suggest that this is not the case. During the 1990s, high-migration
states experienced the largest net decrease in resident population, followed by low-migration states. Border
states had the largest net increase in resident population.
9
  Dropping the Federal District and Jalisco, the relative population of 20-59 year olds in high-migration
states declines by 9.4 log points for men and 7.3 log points for women.


                                                                                                        14
the change in the likelihood of having migrated internally over 1990-2000 for individuals

born in a high-migration state relative to those born in a low-migration state.

       Between 1990 and 2000, men from high-migration states become 3.4% more

likely to live in a state different than their birth state, relative to men from low-migration

states. Excluding the Federal District and Jalisco the estimate falls to 1.6%. Between

1990 and 2000, women from high-migration states become 4.1% more likely to live in a

state different than their birth state, relative to women from low-migration states.

Dropping the Federal District and Jalisco the estimate falls to 2.1% (and remains

precisely estimated). It appears that during the 1990s individuals from high-migration

states have become more likely to migrate either externally or internally.



3.2 Education and Earnings in High and Low Migration States

       The educational profile of individuals by birth state varies between high- and low-

migration states. Table 6 shows the distribution of schooling by age cohort in 2000 for

the sample of Mexican states. For men, average schooling is higher in low-migration

states. Among 30-39 year-old men in 2000, 62.6% had completed nine or more years of

schooling in low-migration states, versus 47.7% in high-migration states. For women,

these figures are 57.5% and 42.7%, respectively. These differences, however, depend on

including among low-migration sates the Federal District, which has the most educated

work force in the country. Once the Federal District and Jalisco are dropped from the

sample, educational attainment is relatively similar in the two groups of states, with

46.9% of men and 40.1% of women in the 30-39 age cohort having completed nine or

more years of education in low-migration states and 45.9% of men and 40.6% of women

in the 30-39 age cohort doing so in high-migration states.


                                                                                           15
         Despite comparable or higher education levels in low-migration states, wages

appear to be higher in high-migration states. Table 7 shows average hourly wages by age

and schooling cohort in 1990 and 2000.10 For the full sample of states, wages are higher

in high-migration states for most cohorts in 1990 and for all cohorts in 2000. In 1990, for

men with 6-8 years of education, which spans mean schooling levels in either year,

average hourly wages are $0.06 to $0.44 higher in high-migration states, depending on

the age cohort (based on age in 2000). In 2000, these wage differentials widen to $0.25

to $0.74.      Wages in high-migration states increase relative to wages in low-migration

states in 15 of the 18 age-schooling cohorts. Dropping the Federal District and Jalisco,

wages remain higher in high-migration states in most cohorts for both years.

         Figure 9, which shows kernel densities for log average hourly wages, gives

another perspective on wages in high and low-migration states. In 1990, wages have

lower dispersion and a higher mean in high-migration states when compared to low-

migration states.         In 2000, these features are more pronounced.                         Relative to high-

migration states, wages in low-migration states show an increase in relative dispersion

and in relative mass in the lower tail.                   In Figure 10, which shows wage densities

excluding the Federal District and Jalisco, the relative rightward shift in the wage

distribution for high-migration is more evident.

         Both in terms of average wages and wage densities, it appears that unconditional

wages in high-migration states are higher than those in low-migration states and that this

differential increases over the 1990s. This is seen clearly in Figure 11, which shows the


10
   Average hourly wages are calculated as monthly labor income/(4.5*hours worked last week). I need to assume
individuals work all weeks of a month, which could bias wage estimates downwards. To avoid measurement error
associated with implausibly low wage values or with top coding of earnings, I restrict the sample to be individuals with
hourly wages between $0.05 and $20 in Mexico (in 2000 U.S. dollars). This restriction is nearly identical to dropping
the largest and smallest 0.5% of wage values.


                                                                                                                    16
double difference in wage densities for high-migration and low-migration states (i.e., the

2000 difference in wage densities for high-migration and low-migration states minus the

1990 difference in wage densities). Relative to low-migration states, over time high-

migration states gain mass in the upper half of the wage distribution.



4. Decomposing Changes in Earnings

        During the 1990s, the earnings gap appeared to increase between men born in

high-migration states and men born in low-migration states. At face value, this change is

difficult to interpret.   It is possible that the large exodus of individuals from high-

migration states may have increased the wages of non-migrating individuals from these

states relative to wages for non-migrating individuals from low-migration states. In this

case, the national wage changes associated with emigration reported by Mishra (2004)

would also be evident at the regional level.

        However, other interpretations of the observed wage changes are plausible.

Borjas (1987) suggests that in countries with high skill premia and high earnings

inequality, such as Mexico, the less-skilled are likely to have the highest propensity to

migrate to countries with low skill premia and low earnings inequality, such as the U.S.

In Mexico, if low-skill, low-wage individuals are more likely to migrate abroad (migrants

are negatively selected in terms of skill), the apparent increase in wages in high-migration

states may be due partly to shifts in labor-force composition.

        To describe wages changes in high-migration and low-migration states more

thoroughly, I apply non-parametric techniques for constructing counterfactual wage

densities developed by DiNardo, Fortin, and Lemieux (1996) and Leibbrandt, Levinsohn,

and McCrary (2004). In the first exercise, I compare the 1990-2000 change in the


                                                                                         17
distribution of earnings between high-migration and low-migration states, holding the

returns to observable characteristics constant. By fixing the returns to characteristics but

allowing the distribution of characteristics to vary over time and across regions, I isolate

how regional differences in the composition of the labor force have changed. This will

help reveal whether it is low-wage or high-wage individuals from high-migration states

who are more likely to migrate abroad. In the second exercise, I compare the 1990-2000

change in the distribution of earnings between high-migration and low-migration states,

holding the distribution of individual characteristics constant. By fixing the distribution

of characteristics, but allowing the returns to characteristics to vary, I examine whether

non-migrating individuals in high-migration states have enjoyed wage gains relative to

non-migrating individuals in low-migration states.11

         It is important to recognize that neither non-parametric exercise I perform

amounts to a truly valid counterfactual. This is because emigration is likely to have

changed both the distribution of worker characteristics and the returns to these

characteristics. By looking at each change in isolation, the counterfactual differences in

wage densities I construct represent only partial decompositions of the change in the

wage distribution.12        Nevertheless, the non-parametric analysis will be helpful for

assessing the plausibility of the parametric results.

         Following the non-parametric estimation, I consider a parametric regression of

differential wage changes in high-migration and low-migration states on differential

emigration opportunities (as summarized by historical emigration rates). The parametric

11
   DiNardo, Fortin and Lemieux is not the only approach to non-parametrically decompose changes in wage
distributions. See Machado and Mata (2005) (and Autor and Katz, 2004) for an alternative methodology.
12
   A complete decomposition would separate wage changes into components due to changes in returns for
given characteristics, changes in characteristics for given returns, and the interaction of changes in returns
and changes in characteristics. The non-parametric analysis in effect ignores the third component.


                                                                                                          18
approach will provide an estimate of the differential in wage growth between high-

migration and low-migration states that is associated with emigration. There are several

reasons why we might be reluctant to assign a causal interpretation to the parametric

results, which I discuss in the concluding section.

        Finally, the analysis doesn’t address changes in the distribution of unobservables.

If, holding observed characteristics constant, Mexican emigrants have low (high)

unobserved ability relative to non-migrants in Mexico, I would tend to understate the

extent to which migrants are negatively (positively) selected in terms of skill.



4.1 Estimating Counterfactual Earnings Densities

        Let f(w|x,i,t) be the density of hourly labor earnings, w, conditional on a set of

observed characteristics, x, in region i and time t. Define h(x|i,t) as the density of

observed characteristics among wage earners in region i and time t. For regions, i=H

indicates high-migration states and i=L indicates low-migration states; for time periods,

t=00 indicates the year 2000 and t=90 indicates the year 1990. The observed density of

labor earnings for individuals in region i at time t is,

                                  g ( w | i, t ) = f ( w | x , i, t )h ( x | i, t )dx

Differences in f ( w | x , H, t ) and f ( w | x , L, t ) reflect differences in returns to observables

in high and low-migration states; differences in h(x|H,t) and h(x|L,t) reflect differences in

the distribution of observables in high and low-migration states. The empirical analysis

examines how regional differences in these two sets of densities changed over the 1990s.

        In the first exercise, I compare the composition of the labor force across regions.

I ask how the difference in earnings densities between high and low-migration states




                                                                                                   19
changes over time, holding constant returns to observables such that only the distribution

of observables varies across regions and years. The first decomposition I consider is how

the wage density differs between high-migration and low-migration states in 1990 for a

common set of returns to observable characteristics:

                 f ( w | x, L,90)h ( x | H,90)dx − f ( w | x , L,90)h ( x | L,90)dx .   (1)

The density difference in equation (1) evaluates the difference in the earnings distribution

in high and low-migration states in 1990, fixing the returns to observables to be that in

low-migration states in 1990. This density difference characterizes the initial difference

in the distribution of observables between high and low-migration states. Applying

DiNardo, Fortin, and Lemieux (DFL), I rewrite (1) as

                         [θ L90 → H90 − 1]f ( w | x , L,90)h ( x | L,90)dx ,            (2)

where

                                                 h ( x | H,90)
                                 θ L90 → H90 =                 .                        (3)
                                                 h ( x | L,90)

Equation (2) is simply the observed marginal earnings density in low-migration states in

1990, adjusted by a weighting function. Given an estimate of the weighting function in

(3), it would be straightforward to apply a kernel density estimator to equation (2).

Following DFL, I estimate the weighting function in (3) by running a logit on the

probability a Mexican male is from a low-migration state in 1990 for the sample of

Mexican males from high-migration and low-migration states in 1990.

        Consider the analogue to equation (2) for 2000. The 2000 difference in the

earnings distribution in high and low-migration states that is associated with differences

in the distribution of observable characteristics can be written as



                                                                                              20
                 f ( w | x, L,90)h ( x | H,00)dx − f ( w | x, L,90)h ( x | L,00)dx .         (4)

Using weighting functions analogous to (3), I rewrite equation (4) as

                 [θ L90 → H 00 − θ L90 → L 00 ]f ( w | x , L,90)h ( x | L,90)dx .            (5)

Putting (2) together with (5), we have the 1990-to-2000 change in the earnings

distribution in high-migration versus low-migration states that is associated with changes

in the distribution of observables:

   ( f (w | x, L,90)h(x | H,00)dx −    f (w | x, L,90)h(x | L,00)dx) −
   ( f (w | x, L,90)h(x | H,90)dx −    f (w | x, L,90)h(x | L,90)dx) =                   .   (6)
     (θL90→H00 − θL90→L00 )− (θL90→H90 −1) f (w | x, L,90)h(x | L,90)dx
Equation (6) shows the difference in the earnings distribution in high-migration versus

low-migration states in 2000, relative to that in 1990, holding the returns to observables

constant. Since an individual’s birth state is fixed, I can use (6) to evaluate changes in

labor-force composition in high-migration versus low-migration states, where I evaluate

workers based on their place in the 1990 earnings distribution in low-migration states.

To perform this exercise, I estimate a series of logit regressions to construct the

weighting functions and then apply the weights to a kernel density estimator to obtain

estimates for the densities described by (2), (5), and (6). The first two of these are for a

single difference in densities and the third is for a double difference in densities.

       The second exercise I perform is to examine how the returns to observable

characteristics have changed in high and low-migration states, holding the distribution of

characteristics constant. For 1990 the difference in earnings densities we’d like to see is

                 f ( w | x , H,90)h ( x | L,90)dx − f ( w | x , L,90)h ( x | L,90)dx .       (7)




                                                                                                   21
which evaluates the difference in earnings distributions in high and low-migration states

in 1990, fixing the marginal density of observables to be that in low-migration states in

1990. Following the logic of DFL, I rewrite equation (7) as

                          [λL90 → H90 − 1]f ( w | x , L,90)h ( x | L,90)dx ,                     (8)

where

                                                 f ( w | x , H,90)
                                 λL90 → H90 =                      .                             (9)
                                                 f ( w | x, L,90)

The corresponding difference in densities for 2000 is

                 f ( w | x , H,00)h ( x | L,90)dx − f ( w | x, L,00)h ( x | L,90)dx ,            (10)

which evaluates the difference in earnings distribution between high and low-migration

states in 2000, again fixing the marginal density of observables to be that in low-

migration states in 1990. Using the weights,

                          f ( w | x , H,00)                            f ( w | x , L,00)
          λL90 → H 00 =                       and λL90 → L 00 =                          ,       (11)
                          f ( w | x, L,90)                             f ( w | x , L,90)

I rewrite equation (10) as

                [λL90 → H 00 − λL90 → L 00 ]f ( w | x , L,90)h ( x | L,90)dx .                   (12)

Putting equations (8) and (12) together,

 ( f (w | x, H,00)h(x | L,90)dx −     f (w | x, L,00)h(x | L,90)dx) −
 ( f (w | x, H,90)h(x | L,90)dx −     f (w | x, L,90)h(x | L,90)dx) =                        .   (13)
   (λL90→H00 − λL90→L00 )− (λL90→H90 −1) f (w | x, L,90)h(x | L,90)dx
Equation (13) shows the 1990-to-2000 change in earnings distribution in high-migration

states relative to low-migration states, holding the distribution of observables constant.




                                                                                                        22
This is the component of the change in relative regional earnings densities associated

with changes in relative regional returns to observable characteristics alone.

       To estimate the weighting functions in (9) and (11), I use Leibbrandt, Levinsohn,

and McCrary’s (2004) extension of DFL. As they show, applying Bayes’ Axiom yields

                f ( w | x , L,00)   Pr( t = 00, i = L) | w , x ) 1 − Pr( t = 00, i = L) | x )
λL90 → L 00 =                     =
                f ( w | x , L,90) 1 − Pr( t = 00, i = L) | w , x ) Pr( t = 00, i = L) | x )

                f ( w | x , H,00)   Pr( t = 00, i = H) | w , x ) 1 − Pr( t = 00, i = H) | x )
λL90 → H 00 =                     =                                                           .   (14)
                f ( w | x , L,90) 1 − Pr( t = 00, i = H) | w , x ) Pr( t = 00, i = H) | x )

                f ( w | x , H,90)   Pr( t = 90, i = H) | w , x ) 1 − Pr( t = 90, i = H) | x )
λL90 → H90 =                      =
                f ( w | x , L,90) 1 − Pr( t = 90, i = H) | w , x ) Pr( t = 90, i = H) | x )

Each weighting function in (14) is the product of odds ratios. In the first weight, the first

ratio is the odds an individual is from a low-migration state in 2000 (based on a sample of

individuals from low-migration states in 1990 and 2000), conditional on observables, x,

and earnings, w; and the second ratio is the (inverse) odds an individual is from a low-

migration state in 2000, conditional on just on x. To estimate the odds ratios, I estimate

two logit models. In each case, the regressand is a 0-1 variable on the outcome i=L and

t=00 (based on a sample of (i=L, t=00) and (i=L, t=90)). For the first logit, the regressors

are x and w; for the second, the regressor is x, alone. Other weights can be estimated

analogously. After constructing the weights, I estimate (8), (12), and (13).



4.2 A Parametric Approach

       To evaluate the association between emigration and earnings parametrically, I

pool data on working age men in 1990 and 2000 from high-migration or low-migration

states and estimate the following difference-in-difference wage regression,



                                                                                                   23
ln w hst = α s + X hst (β1 + β 2 Y 2000 ht + β 3 High hs ) + φ * Y 2000 ht * High hs + ε hst

                                                                                                (15)

where w is average hourly earnings, X is a vector of observed characteristics, Y2000 is a

dummy variable for the year 2000, and High is a dummy variable for whether an

individual was born in a high-migration state. The regression includes controls for state-

of-birth fixed effects and allows returns to observable characteristics to vary across

regions and time. The coefficient, , captures the mean differential 1990-to-2000 change

in earnings between high and low-migration states.13

        One important estimation issue is that shocks other than emigration may have had

differential impacts on high and low-migration states. I’ve already discussed the shock

associated with NAFTA and other aspects of trade liberalization. Another shock was the

peso crisis of 1995. After a bungled devaluation of the peso in 1994, Mexico chose to

float its currency, which proceeded to plummet in value relative to the dollar. The

ensuing increase in the peso value of dollar-denominated liabilities contributed to a

banking collapse and a severe economic contraction. Low-migration states (excluding

Mexico City) are modestly less industrialized than high-migration states and so may have

been less hurt by the credit crunch. Also, low-migration states tend to have larger tourist

industries, which may have benefited from the devaluation. Other shocks in the 1990’s

included a reform of Mexico’s land tenure system in 1992, the privatization of state-

owned enterprises, and industry deregulation. The existence of these shocks leaves the



13
   Equation (15) is a standard difference-in-difference specification, which implies I estimate the mean
differential in wage growth between high and low-migration states. This approach ignores the possibility
that the wage effect of being in a high-migration state may not be uniform throughout the wage
distribution. A more elegant approach would be to estimate the regional differential in wage changes non-
parametrically, as in the framework derived by Athey and Imbens (2003).


                                                                                                       24
results subject to the caveat that factors other than emigration may have contributed to

differential regional changes in earnings. I return to this issue in section 5.



4.3 Empirical Results

       The sample for the analysis is the cohort of Mexican men aged 20 to 49 years in

1990 or 30 to 59 years in 2000 who were born in one of the seven high-migration states

or one of the seven low-migration states. By restricting the analysis to a single cohort, I

limit possible contamination of the sample associated with more-educated younger

workers entering the labor force and less-educated older workers exiting the labor force.

The dependent variable is log average hourly labor earnings (see note 10).

       Figure 12 shows kernel density estimates for the density differences in equations

(2) and (5), which characterize the difference in earning distributions between high and

low-migration states holding constant the return to observable characteristics. In 1990

and 2000, the density difference has negative mass above the mean and positive mass

below the sample mean (where the mean over the entire sample of states is normalized to

zero). This implies that in either year there are relatively few men from high-migration

states with above-average earnings and relatively many men from high-migration states

with below-average earnings. Whatever the source of this initial difference, it becomes

modestly more pronounced during the 1990s. Between 1990 and 2000, the density

difference loses mass above the mean and gains mass below the mean. Compared to low-

migration states, it appears that men with above-average earnings from high-migration

states disappear from the sample in larger numbers.

       The change in the composition of the labor force is perhaps seen more clearly in

Figure 13, which shows the 1990-to-2000 change in the difference in earnings densities


                                                                                        25
between high-migration and low-migration states (for constant returns to observables).

This (partial) double difference shows negative mass above the mean and positive mass

below the mean, indicating that over time the relative scarcity of high-wage workers has

increased in high-migration states relative to low-migration states.

        Comparing units on the vertical axes in Figures 11 and 13, it is apparent that the

counterfactual double difference in wage densities is small, but it is still informative

about the nature of migrant selection on observables. Figure 7 shows that between 1990

and 2000 there was a relatively large loss in the population of working-age men born in

high-migration states, which is consistent with individuals from high-migration states

having a relatively high propensity to migrate abroad. What Figures 12 and 13 suggest is

that the men most likely to migrate abroad are those in the top half of the earnings

distribution. This finding is inconsistent with negative selection of emigrants in terms of

observable skills and suggests that emigrants exhibit intermediate or positive selection in

terms of observable skills. Using data from Mexican and U.S. population censuses,

Chiquiar and Hanson (2005) also find evidence against negative selection.14

        One might also be concerned that including the relatively rich and globalized

regions of the Federal District and Jalisco in the sample of birth states affects the results.

In Figure 14, I show the double difference in counterfactual wage densities reported in

Figure 13 (with returns to observables fixed at those for low-migration states in 1990) for

a sample that excludes the two states. Comparing Figures 13 and 14 shows that results

are similar with or without these states in the sample. The results are also robust to

dropping any one of the other states from the sample.


14
   Results are similar if I evaluate change in earnings densities between high-migration and low-migration
states for returns to observables fixed at those for high (rather than low) migration states in 1990.


                                                                                                       26
       Over time, it appears that men born in high-migration states are emigrating from

Mexico in relatively large numbers and that the emigrants include a disproportionately

large number of individuals with relatively high earnings potential. In a simple labor-

supply, labor-demand framework, a decrease in the relative supply of more-skilled

workers in high-migration states would put upward pressure on relative wages in these

states (as long as labor was not perfectly mobile between regions of Mexico). Next, we

examine how relative regional returns to observables have changed over time.

       Figure 15 shows kernel density estimates for the density differences in (8) and

(12), which characterize the difference in earning distributions between high and low-

migration states holding constant the distribution of observable characteristics. In 1990

and 2000, the density difference has positive mass above the mean and negative mass

below the mean. In either year, returns to observables appear to be higher in high-

migration states relative to low-migration states. Although one cannot identify from

Figure 15 the source of the initial difference in relative regional earnings, relatively high

returns to observables in high-migration states is consistent with the relative scarcity of

high-wage workers in high-migration states evident in Figure 12.

       Over time, the difference in returns to observables between high and low-

migration states appears to have become more pronounced. Figure 15 shows that from

1990 to 2000 the difference in wage densities between high-migration and low-migration

states gains mass above the mean and loses mass below the mean. This is seen more

clearly in Figure 16, which shows the 1990-to-2000 change in the difference in earnings

densities between high-migration and low-migration states, holding constant the

distribution of observables. This double difference shows positive mass above the mean




                                                                                          27
and negative mass below the mean, indicating that during the 1990’s the wage premium

for above-average wage earners increased for men born in high-migration states relative

to men born in low-migration states. Though the partial double difference in wage

densities is again small (compare to Figure 11),15 the increase in the relative wage for

men born in high-migration states evident in Figure 17 is consistent with the decrease in

the relative supply of men born in high-migration states evident in Figure 13.                             In

unreported density estimates, I obtain similar results when I drop men born in the Federal

District or Jalisco from the sample.

         The non-parametric results suggest there has been an increase in relative wages

for men born in high-migration states in Mexico. To evaluate the change in regional

relative wages parametrically, Table 8 shows estimation results for equation (15). The

dependent variable is log average hourly earnings. The regressors are dummy variables

for educational attainment, a quadratic in age, a dummy variable for the year 2000 and its

interaction with the age and education variables, a dummy variable for having been born

in a high-migration state and its interaction with the age and education variables, dummy

variables for birth state, and the interaction of the year 2000 and high-migration dummy

variables. This last variable captures the differential change in wage growth in high-

migration states relative to low-migration states.                 Standard errors are adjusted for

correlation across observations associated with the same birth state.

         Panel (a) of Table 8 shows that during the 1990’s the cohort of men born in high-

migration states enjoyed labor earnings growth that was 6.3 log points higher than

15
  Since both counterfactual double differences in densities are small, it appears that the interaction between
changes in worker characteristics and changes in returns to characteristics accounts for a large portion of
the total change in regional relative wages. However, the double differences in wage densities still appear
to be informative about the direction of these changes. Relative regional wage changes appear to be larger
where relative regional labor-supply changes are larger.


                                                                                                          28
earnings growth for individuals born in low-migration states. These coefficients are

precisely estimated. This is consistent with the non-parametric estimates and again

suggests that men born in high-migration states enjoyed higher growth in labor earnings

than men born in low-migration states. The second two columns of Table 8 show results

where the year2000/high-migration interaction is interacted with an indicator for an

individual having 9 to 15 years of education (roughly, workers with above mean

schooling years but with less than a college education).                       This term allows relative

earnings growth to be larger for more-educated workers. The education interaction term

is positive, consistent with Figure 17 (while the variable appears imprecisely estimated

the two reported interaction terms are jointly highly statistically significant).16

           Panel (b) of Table 8 redoes the estimation, dropping observations for the Federal

District and Jalisco. Estimated relative wage growth for high-migration states is higher

for this sample, with men born in high-migration states enjoying labor earnings growth

8.6 to 8.9 log points higher than for men born in low-migration states. In the second two

columns, the interaction between the year2000/high-migration interaction and the dummy

variable for secondary education is again positive (and the two interaction terms are again

jointly highly statistically significant).

           Since emigration rates are highest for individuals in their twenties, one might

expect that wage changes between high-migration and low-migration states would have

been largest for men who are more educated and young. In unreported results, I included

additional interactions between the year 2000 dummy, secondary education, and age, but

these proved to be imprecisely estimated in most regressions.



16
     Introducing interaction terms for more disaggregated schooling categories yields similar results.


                                                                                                         29
       Based on the coefficient estimates, it is possible to construct an elasticity of the

relative wage for high-migration and low-migration states with respect to the relative

labor supply in high-migration and low-migration states. From Figure 6, the supply of

working-age men in high-migration states fell by 9.8 log points relative to the supply of

working-age men in the same cohort in low-migration states. This implies a wage

elasticity of 0.64. Excluding the Federal District and Jalisco the wage elasticity is 0.91.

Either elasticity is larger than the value of 0.4 that Mishra (2004) estimates using data on

changes in wages and labor supply for age-schooling cohorts at the national level.

Recall, however, that my estimates are reduced form. They include the direct effect of

emigration on wages (through changes in the labor supply), and any indirect effect

associated with differential labor-demand growth in high-migration states that is

associated with historical emigration patterns.      Comparing my results to Mishra’s

suggests that the indirect effects of emigration on regional wages are positive.



5. Discussion

       In this paper, I examine how emigration may have affected regional labor supply

and regional earnings in Mexico. Mexico has a long history of sending migrants to the

United States. Since the early 1900s, emigration rates have varied widely across regions

of the country, with individuals from west-central states having the highest propensity to

migrate abroad. I exploit regional persistence in emigration behavior by focusing the

analysis on individuals born in states with a history of either high-migration or low-

migration to the United States, as measured by state emigration rates in the 1950s.

       As in earlier decades, during the 1990s individuals born in Mexico’s high-

migration states appeared to have a relatively high propensity to migrate abroad.


                                                                                         30
Between 1990 and 2000, the population of 20-59 year-old men born in high-migration

states declined by 10 log points relative to similarly aged men born in low-migration

states. For women, the corresponding relative regional change in population was 8 log

points.     The relatively large exodus of individuals from high-migration states is

concentrated among individuals with above-average earnings potential. This suggests

that in terms of observable skills emigrants are positively selected. Controlling for

observables, wages in high-migration states rose relative to low-migration states by 6-

9%. This implies an elasticity of wages with respect to the labor supply of 0.7-0.8. This

change reflects both the direct effects of emigration on the labor supply and any indirect

effects of historical emigration patterns on current regional wage growth.

          There are several possible interpretations of these results. One is that emigration

raises wages in Mexico, with the effects being most pronounced in states that have well-

developed networks for sending migrants to the United States. This interpretation is

consistent with the findings in Munshi (2003), Hanson (2004), and Mishra (2004).

          However, emigration was by no means the only shock to the Mexican economy

during the 1990’s. Other shocks may have also contributed to changes in regional

relative wages.      A large literature documents how NAFTA and other aspects of

globalization appear to have increased regional wage differentials in Mexico. It is not

clear how globalization interacts with emigration. States more exposed to globalization

appear to have lower migration rates to the United States, suggesting that emigration and

globalization may be complementary mechanisms for integrating Mexico into the North

American labor market. Another important shock was the Mexican peso crisis in 1995.

This may have hurt high-migration states more than low-migration states (since high-




                                                                                          31
migration states have larger industrial bases and smaller tourist industries), suggesting my

estimates may understate the true effect of emigration on regional wages.

       Other policy changes, such as the privatization and deregulation of Mexican

industry or the reform of Mexico’s land-tenure system, may also have had differential

regional impacts. Privatization and deregulation appeared to lower union wage premiums

in these sectors (Fairris, 2003). Since more heavily unionized industries are concentrated

in Mexico’s north and center and relatively absent in Mexico’s south (Chiquiar, 2003),

we might expect a loss in union power to lower relative wages in Mexico’s high-

migration states, in which case my results would tend to understate the true effect of

emigration. The reform of Mexico’s land-tenure system allowed the sale of agricultural

land that had previously been held in cooperative ownership. We might expect this

change to have raised relative incomes in southern Mexico, which specializes in

agriculture. Since low-migration states are concentrated in southern Mexico, this is

another reason my results may tend to understate the true effect of emigration.

       A brief review of Mexico’s other policy reforms during the 1990’s does not

suggest any obvious reason why they should account for the observed increase in relative

earnings in high-migration states. Still, in an environment where multiple shocks have

affected Mexico’s labor market it is important to be cautious about ascribing shifts in

relative regional earnings to any specific event. In the end, we can only say that I find

suggestive evidence that emigration has increased relative earnings in Mexican states that

have stronger migration networks vis-à-vis the United States.

This table shows Mexican immigrants in the U.S. as a percentage of the population of
individuals born in Mexico (equal to the sum of the Mexico-born population residing in
Mexico and the Mexico-born population residing in the United States) by age and sex
categories. The sample is individuals 16-65 years old (in the U.S., excluding those in
group quarters; in Mexico, excluding those not born in the country). Residents of Mexico
in 1990 are the 1% microsample of the XII Censo General de Poblacion y Vivienda,
1990, and in 2000 are a 10% random sample of the 10% microsample of the XIII Censo
General de Poblacion y Vivienda, 2000. Mexican immigrants are from the 1990 and
2000 5% U.S. Public Use Microsample. Source: Chiquiar and Hanson (2005).

This table reports results for probit regressions in which the dependent variable equals one if an
individual resides in a different state than his/her birth state and zero otherwise. The sample is
men and women in Mexico aged 20-49 in 1990 or 30-59 in 2000 born in a high-migration or a
low-migration Mexican state. The other regressors are: (a) a cubic in age, dummy variables for
five categories of educational attainment (1-5 years, 6-8 years, 9-11 years, 12-15 years, or 16+
years), a dummy variable for marital status, dummy variables for presence of children in the
household (ages 0-5, 6-12, or 13-18 years), dummy variables for the state of birth, and a dummy
variable for the year 2000; (b) interactions between the age, education, marital status, and
children variables and the year 2000 dummy; and (c) interactions between the age, education,
marital status, and children variables and a dummy variable for whether the individual was born
in a high-migration state. The coefficients show the change in the probability of internal
migration associated with an individual being from a high-migration state in 2000 versus that in
1990 (evaluated at mean values for other regressors). Standard errors (corrected for correlation
in the errors within birth states) are in parentheses.

The dependent variable is log average hourly labor earnings. In columns 1 and 3, the sample is
males born in a high-migration state or a low-migration state; in columns 2 and 4, the sample
includes males who report working 20-80 hours a week. Other regressors (quadratic in age,
dummies for year of education, and their interactions with year 2000 dummy and with High
Migration dummy; year 2000 dummy variable; state dummy variables) are not shown. Standard
errors are in parentheses and are adjusted for correlation across observations within birth states.
In panel (a), the sample is working males in all high and low-migration states and time periods;
in panel (b), I drop observations for the Federal District and Jalisco from the sample.
