Did Securitization Affect the Cost of Corporate Debt?

JEL No. G21,G32

                                              ABSTRACT

This paper investigates whether the securitization of corporate bank loans had an impact on the price
of corporate debt. Our results suggest that loan facilities that are subsequently securitized are associated
with a 15 basis point lower spread than that of loans that are not subsequently securitized. To identify
the particular role of securitization in loan pricing, we employ a difference in differences approach
and consider loan characteristics that are associated with the likelihood of securitization. We document
that Term Loan B facilities, facilities originated by banks that originate CLOs, and loans of B-Rated
firms are securitized more frequently than other loans. Spreads on facilities estimated to be more likely
to be subsequently securitized have lower spreads than otherwise similar facilities. The results are
consistent with the view that securitization caused a reduction in the cost of capital.

1. Introduction.

        While much attention has focused on the role of securitization in the mortgage market, relatively

little has been paid to the securitization of corporate bank loans in the form of Collateralized Loan

Obligations (CLOs).1 This lack of attention is surprising given that both the volume of non-investment

grade bank loans and the number of newly-originated CLOs spiked dramatically between the years 2002

and 2007, from over $125 billion of loans and 43 CLOs in 2002 to over $540 billion of loans and 213

CLOs in 2007.2 One potential explanation for this pattern was that the popularity of CLOs created a

demand for collateral that could be used to construct them (see for example Gennaioli, Shleifer and

Vishny (2010)). Consequently, banks active in the securitization business had incentives to adjust their

lending behavior to increase the quantity of loans that could be used for collateral, affecting the cost of

capital for firms in the primary lending market.

        In this paper we estimate the extent to which the practice of securitizing bank debt influenced the

cost of such debt for borrowers in the primary corporate debt market. To do so, we rely on a sample of

over 7,000 loan facilities from the Dealscan database. We match these loans to a database of CLOs

provided by Moody’s, which contains the identity of the underlying collateral in each CLO. We first

address the question of whether a loan that was ultimately securitized had a lower spread than an

otherwise similar loan that was not securitized. Our estimates indicate that the answer to this question is a

clear “yes”; they suggest that of the most-commonly securitized facilities (a B-rated, Term Loan B), a

facility that is ultimately securitized has about a 15 basis point lower yield than an otherwise identical

loan that was not securitized.

        There are a number of possible interpretations to this result. It is possible that CLOs, for some

unidentified reason, were more likely to add relatively low-yielding loans in their portfolio, or that an

omitted variable is driving both spreads and securitization demand in our specification. Alternatively,

Keys, Mukherjee, Seru, and Vig (2008), Loutskina and Strahan (2009), and Nadauld and Sherlund (2010).

  The estimates on the dollar volume of non-investment grade loans originated in 2002 and 2007 are likely
understated in both years. The reported figures are calculated using our sample of U.S. originated syndicated bank
loans made to non-financial borrowers with available sales data that is described below in Section 3.


                                                        1
there could have been a reduction in the demand for capital from the firms whose loans tend to be

securitized. These interpretations imply that although CLOs have lower-yielding loans in their portfolio,

there are no distortionary real effects from their existence, since their role is to reallocate the loans that

would have been made in their absence. More consistent with the securitization-driven explanations of

the Financial Crisis is a story in which banks have a high demand for securitizable loans when they put

together CLOs and consequently lower the yields to attract more borrowers. This latter explanation

implies that demand for loans from CLOs has a real effect, as it lowers the cost of capital for the firms

obtaining the loans.

           To distinguish between these explanations, we utilize a “Difference in Differences” approach

based on factors that are correlated with the demand for bank loans from participants in the securitization

market (and thus impacts credit supply in the primary market) but uncorrelated with the demand for credit

from corporate borrowers in the origination market. First, we make use of features related to the structure

of corporate loans. Corporate loans are typically made up of a number of tranches (also referred to as

facilities), usually containing an amortizing “Term Loan A” portion, a bullet “Term Loan B” portion, and

a “Revolver” that can be drawn down at the discretion of the borrower. These tranches usually have the

same seniority, but because of the amortization of Term Loan A and the options implicit in the revolver,

they have different effective maturities and yields. An important difference between the tranches,

however, is that typically only the Term Loan B (bullet) portion is securitized, while the other tranches

are typically held by the issuing bank.3 Consequently, the difference in yields between the tranches

potentially reflects differences in demands for securitizable loans, among other factors.

           Second, we use the identity of the loan-arranging bank in our identification strategy. Over the six-

year period between 2002 and 2007, 79% of all CLOs were underwritten by just ten banks. Leveraged

loans arranged by banks that also underwrite CLOs are more likely to be securitized because CLO

underwriters can more accurately evaluate the value of a particular loan to CLO structures. That is, CLO

underwriting banks are more likely to arrange a given bank loan for the purpose of using it as collateral in

3
    In Section 2.2 we discuss at least two reasons why Term Loan B’s are preferred as collateral by arrangers of CLOs.


                                                           2
a CLO.4 We show empirically that loan facilities arranged by these securitization-active banks were

securitized more frequently than loans issued by other banks.

           Third, the credit rating of borrowers affects the likelihood of being securitized. In a sample of B

and Ba-rated bank loans, holding other factors constant, the lower credit quality B-rated firms obtained

loans that were more likely to be securitized. This pattern is consistent with Benmelech and Dlugosz

(2009), who document that cash-flow arbitrage CLOs tend to employ B-rated bank loans as collateral.

Demand from deal arrangers in the securitization market for B-rated collateral rather than Ba-rated

collateral represents an increase in demand for corporate bank loans that is unrelated to factors affecting

the demand for loans from borrowers in the primary loan market.

           We exploit these three institutional features of the CLO market to identify the impact of

securitization on the cost of corporate credit. Since increased demand for securitizable assets should occur

in Term Loan B facilities originated by securitization-active banks, we estimate the difference between

spreads on these loans relative to Term Loan B facilities issued by non-securitization active banks. We

find that spreads on Term Loan B facilities originated by securitization-active banks are 11 basis points

lower than spreads on facilities issued by other banks, holding other factors constant.

           If this decline occurs because of demand for securitizable loans, then we expect this decline in

spreads to be larger in B-rated debt than in Ba-rated debt because B-rated debt is securitized more

frequently. For this reason, in a sample of Term Loan B facilities only, we estimate the difference in

spreads between B-rated facilities originated by securitization-active banks and compare those estimates

to spreads on Ba-rated facilities originated by securitization-active banks. Consistent with a securitization

demand-driven hypothesis, our estimates indicate that the difference in the spread on loans issued by

securitization-active banks to B-rated borrowers was almost 23 basis points lower than the spread on

loans made by non-securitization active banks to B-rated borrowers. In contrast, there is virtually no

difference in spreads between Ba-rated loans from securitization-active banks and non-securitization

active banks.

4
    We discuss more specifically why this is the case in Section 2.


                                                            3
        In addition, if the demand to securitize Term Loan B facilities issued to B-rated borrowers was

highest among securitization-active banks, we would expect to find differences in the spreads of Term

Loan B facilities with these securitization-friendly attributes relative to Term Loan A facilities or

Revolving facilities. Our estimates indicate that the incremental effect of being a securitization-friendly

Term Loan B facility is 32.9 basis points relative to Term Loan A’s and is 19.5 basis points relative to

revolvers. These equations imply that the drop in spreads for securitization-friendly facilities do not

reflect a bank-specific characteristic, such as an increased risk tolerance, since this characteristic would

likely be reflected in the spreads of securitization-friendly Term Loan A facilities and revolvers as well.

        Another way to do the comparison is by estimating the factors that affect the differences across

facilities within a particular loan. This approach has the advantage of having common underlying risks

within the loan, although the data is limited to loans that contain multiple types of facilities. In this case,

the differences in spreads between Term Loan B and either Term Loan A or revolvers decline with

characteristics associated with securitization, again consistent with the view that demand for collateral for

CLOs affects the pricing of the loans in the primary market.

        Overall, the results are consistent with the view that CLOs’ demand for collateral affected pricing

in the corporate debt market. While the effect of the securitization-driven debt market on the housing

market during the 2002-2007 period is well-known, and Shivdasani and Wang (2011) and Axelson et al.

(2011) have documented that the debt market was an important driver of the LBO boom during that

period, our results suggest that securitization had a pricing impact on the corporate debt market more

broadly.

2. Institutional Background.

         Collateralized loan obligations (CLOs) transform speculative-grade bank loans into highly-rated

bonds through the process of pooling and tranching.5 The incidence of securitizing corporate bank loans

exploded between 2002 and 2007 and has been well documented in the literature and popular press. Over

80% of the CLOs originated between 1996 and 2008 were originated in the years 2002-2007, with nearly

50% occurring in 2006 and the first-half of 2007 alone (see Table 4). Also noteworthy is the fact that

between 2002 and 2007, 79% of new CLOs were originated by just ten banks. In short, the creation of

CLOs was very active over a relatively short period of time and concentrated in a relatively small number

of originating banks.

         Theoretically, securitization can occur for a number of reasons. First, DeMarzo (2005) suggests

that securitization reduces asymmetric information problems about the quality of individual loans by

providing the purchaser with a diversified pool of loans from different issuers, presumably having a lower

information asymmetry problem than any individual loan would have. Second, Gaur, Seshadri and

Subrahmanyam (2009) point out that securitization reduces market incompleteness, providing investors

who value that particular cash flow distribution with the ability to purchase it. Finally, Coval, Jurek, and

Stafford (2009), relying on the assumption that investors purchase bonds based solely on credit ratings,

attribute the proliferation of securitization activity to the potential for deal arrangers to deliver the

cheapest possible set of assets that can obtain a high quality credit rating, thereby engaging in ratings

arbitrage. The observation that the bank loans of B-rated borrowers get securitized more frequently than

Ba-rated loans is consistent with a “cheapest-to-deliver” view of collateral selection in securitization.

         Yet, none of these theories of securitization provides a rationale for why securitization should

affect the spreads on loans that subsequently are securitized. In other words, given two loans, why should

their spreads differ depending on whether they are subsequently securitized if the risks associated with the

loans’ repayment are identical? For this to be the case, the very process of securitization likely influences

5
  The term “Tranche” is used to describe different bonds arising from a CLO deal and is also used to describe
different loan facilities within a bank loan. The term tranche in this sentence refers to the tranches (bonds) that arise
from the origination of a CLO.


                                                            5
the lender’s decision about the loan at the time of origination. One way in which this influence could

occur would be if the lender itself is heavily involved in putting together the collateral of the CLO, either

through a close relationship with the collateral manager of the CLO or in warehousing the loans to be

used as collateral in the CLO. If this lender has a high demand for securities that can subsequently

become part of the CLO, it has an incentive to offer the borrower a lower interest rate than it otherwise

would given current market rates and the risk on that particular investment.6 Consequently, the

securitized loans end up having interest rates that do not fully reflect the risks associated with the cash

flow distributions generated by their collateral.7

2.1. The Structure of Loans. An important feature that we rely on to identify the demand for securitizable

loans is the structure of the bank loans themselves.8 Bank loans usually receive capital from a syndicate

of lenders, made up of up to three types of investors: institutional investors, banks, and finance

companies. To cater to the preferences of each type of investor, these loans contain multiple facilities or

tranches. Commercial banks typically invest in the revolving portion of the loan. “Revolving” credit lines

can be drawn down and repaid at the discretion of borrowers, but fees are paid based on the entire amount

committed to the lending facility regardless of whether it has been drawn down. “Term Loan A” facilities

are typically senior, amortizing loans that are generally kept by the issuing bank or purchased by other

commercial banks. In contrast, “Term Loan B” facilities, which are also senior and usually pari passu to

the Term Loan A, typically mature with bullet payments, and are usually sold to institutional investors.




6
  The underwriter of a CLO (securitization-active bank) frequently warehouses loans that are to be used as collateral
in a CLO during the portfolio selection process. An underwriting bank is likely to feel more comfortable
warehousing a loan that it originated rather than a loan on which it has less information.
7
  An obvious question is why this effect does not just lower interest rates for all firms, because all borrowers will
flock to the securitizing banks, so that to attract borrowers, non-securitizing banks will lower their rates to match the
securitizing banks. Presumably, to some extent, non-securitizing banks did lower their interest rates (conditional on
credit quality), but because of the relationship-specificity in banking and CLO creation, were able to keep some
customers despite charging a higher interest rate than their securitizing competitors.
8
  We rely on the institutional details provided in a primer on Bank Loans published annually by Standard and Poor’s
(2009).


                                                            6
        Term Loan B facilities are appealing to CLOs for a number of reasons.9 The main difference

between Term Loan A and Term Loan B concerns the payout structure, which is amortizing for Term

Loan A facilities and bullet for Term Loan B. The amortizing payout structure leads to a shorter duration

for Term Loan A than Term Loan B facilities. This shorter duration creates reinvestment risk, and even if

there are good places to reinvest the money, the CLO managers are more frequently required to search for

places to reinvest the steady stream of amortized principal as it is paid back. Collateral managers find it

easier to reinvest the bullet payments of Term Loan B’s when they mature or prepay.10 In addition, the

purchasers of AAA bonds (insurance companies, pension funds) produced by CLOs tend to prefer to

purchase bonds with longer maturity. It is easier for CLO arrangers to create bonds with a longer expected

maturity with collateral of longer duration.

        CLOs are far more likely to invest in institutional tranches (Term Loan B specifically) than in the

revolving facilities or Term Loan A facilities (see Table 2, Panel B). When demand for loans from CLOs

increased dramatically in the 2002-2007 period, this demand likely affected the Term Loan B portion of

corporate loans substantially more than either the Term Loan A portion or the revolver portion.

        To illustrate the nature and complexity of a multiple-facility bank loan, we provide a detailed

example of a typical loan. Table 1 documents the details of the financing involved in the 2005 leveraged

buyout of the British tire firm Kwik-Fit.11 The total transaction value of £773.5M included £582.5M of

term-loan debt, £40M in a revolving credit facility, and £50M in a Capex facility. This type of multiple-

facility financing structure is not specific to LBO transactions, but also characterizes many corporate

loans. The Term Loan A facility of £140M, featuring a 7-year amortizing term and spread of 225 basis

points over LIBOR, is typically purchased by commercial banks. In contrast, the Term Loan B facility is

often securitized; in the Kwik-Fit Example it is of £135M, and has an 8-year bullet payment and pays a

  This paragraph is based on conversations with practitioners who originate CLOs and summarizes the typical
arguments for why CLOs usually prefer to purchase the Term Loan B tranche of a loan rather than the Term Loan A
tranche.
10
   Because of these differences in duration, we control econometrically for differences in term structure when
estimating differences in spreads between Term Loan B’s, revolvers and Term Loan A’s below.
11
   The Kwik-Fit example documented in Table 1 is taken from Axelson et al. (2011).


                                                       7
spread of 250 basis points over LIBOR. This particular transaction also contains a Term Loan C, which is

similar in features to the Term Loan B.

2.2. The Ratings Structure of CLOs. The predominant form of corporate loan securitization is what is

known as a cash-flow arbitrage CLO.12 The idea underlying this structure is to combine a group of low-

rated loans into a structure that has a higher rating. Covenants in CLO deals require that each deal

maintain a minimum weighted-average credit rating (WAR), which is calculated as the average credit

rating of the collateral, weighted by the size of each piece of collateral. Not surprisingly, CLOs are

almost always structured to use the minimum quality collateral so as to satisfy this constraint and yield a

high, usually AAA, rating for the CLO. Benmelech and Dlugosz (2009), analyzing a comprehensive

sample of cash-flow arbitrage CLOs, document that the weighted-average credit rating in 85% of the

deals in their sample was B+ (B1 in Moody’s rating classification). Furthermore, they document that the

average B1 rating of the collateral was almost uniformly met with uniformly B-rated collateral (with

collateral concentrated specifically in the B1 rating).13

        Consequently, when demand for CLO collateral increased in the securitization-active period, we

expect that this demand will be reflected in demand for B-rated collateral more than for higher-rated debt.

This increase should be in the institutional (Term Loan B) tranche of the loan and not for the Term Loan

A or revolver tranches of the loans. In addition, it should be higher for loans issued by banks active in

securitization, that presumably package these loans immediately into the CLOs that they arrange

themselves. These differences in attractiveness to originators of CLOs lead to clear identification of the

effect of demand for collateral on the relative pricing of different kinds of bank loans.




12
   Other forms of CLOs include balance sheet CLOs, whose primary purpose is to remove loans from bank’s balance
sheets. According to Moody’s data on CLO originations, balance-sheet CLOs represent about 1% of all CLOs.
13
   The average CLO deal in their sample transformed the B-rated collateral into securities in which 70% of the
principle balance of the originated bonds were rated AAA, while 90% of the principle was rated BBB or higher. The
pattern is very similar in the Moody’s sample of CLOs we analyze below.


                                                       8
3. Data

          To study the way in which securitization affects the pricing of loans, we utilize data from two

publicly available databases: Reuter’s Dealscan and Moody’s EMS data services. We restrict our sample

to Dealscan loan facilities originated between 2002 and September of 2007, which represents the

beginning of disruptions in the CLO market. Our sample requires that facilities have Moody’s credit

ratings on the borrowing firm’s senior debt at the time of loan origination.14 Our analysis focuses

specifically on firms with Moody’s senior-debt credit ratings of B (B1, B2, or B3) or Ba (Ba1, Ba2, Ba3).

We further restrict the sample to include only syndicated loans originated in the United States and remove

financial firms with SIC codes between 6000 and 6500. We also identify and remove any second-lien or

mezzanine loans from the sample.

           The Moody’s EMS sample provides data on the characteristics and identity of all the securities

serving as collateral in any Moody’s-rated CLO as of the first quarter 2009. The strength of the Moody’s

data is that it allows us to identify exactly which loan facilities serve as collateral in CLOs as of the first

quarter 2009. Unfortunately, it provides only a one-time snapshot of securitized loans, and does not

contain unique identifiers that map to Dealscan.

          To illustrate how our matching of the two databases occurs consider the following examples from

the Dealscan and Moody’s EMS databases. In October 2006, Armstrong World Industries raised $1,100M

through a bank loan; $300M in the form of a revolving line, $300M in a Term Loan A facility, and the

remaining $500M in a Term Loan B facility. The Moody’s EMS database reports a security with the

name “Armstrong World Ind. – Term Loan B” in the amount of $500M with expected maturity in

October 2013. It is important to note that no other facility associated with the Armstrong World Industries

bank loan appears in the Moody’s database. Consequently, we classify the Term Loan B portion of the

Armstrong debt issuance as being securitized while the Revolving and Term Loan A facilities are not.

14
   We require the rating on the senior debt and not on the specific loan because it is available for a much larger
number of loans: there are 7,331 loans on Dealscan that meet our sample criteria for which there is a rating on the
senior debt and only 3,335 for which there is a rating on the specific loan. For the loans in our sample that have both
loan-specific credit ratings and senior-debt credit ratings, the ratings are either the same or within one ratings class
(i.e. B1 senior debt and Ba3, B1, or B2 loan-specific rating) over 72% of the time.


                                                           9
         We emphasize, however, that there are limitations inherent in constructing the database in this

manner. Because the Moody’s data represent a snapshot of CLOs in 2009, we cannot tell whether a loan

was initially securitized and subsequently paid off prior to 2009 or if it was included and then dropped

from the CLO prior to 2009.15 In addition, the imperfect nature of matching suggests that some matches

were likely missed due to human error or uncertainty in the naming of the facilities. Consequently, it is

likely that the matching process employed here understates the number of loans in our sample that are

securitized. For these reasons, our primary empirical strategy does not rely on an exact determination of

whether a loan was securitized. Rather, we rely on the EMS database to identify attributes of loans that

are simply correlated with securitization activity.

         Table 2 presents summary statistics on our sample of facility-level loan data. Panel A provides

statistics on the number and spread over LIBOR for securitized and un-securitized loan facilities of

different credit qualities. As expected, loan spreads increase monotonically as credit quality declines.

Panel B breaks down these statistics by facility type. It indicates that revolving facilities are the most

common facility, followed by Term Loan B’s and Term Loan A’s. Panel C reports the same statistics

broken down by the reported purpose of the facility. The somewhat vague description of “corporate

purposes” appears most frequently in the data, followed by debt repayments and corporate takeovers.

Facilities supporting leveraged buyouts represent 12% of the loan facilities we study, and these loans are

securitized at a higher rate than other loan facilities.

         Table 3 documents the differences in the attributes of loan facilities identified as having been

securitized, compared to their non-securitized counterparts. This table indicates that securitized loans

have lower spreads, with differences in spreads increasing as credit quality declines. In addition

securitized loans have larger facility sizes, slightly longer maturities, and were arranged by smaller

syndicates. The differences between securitized and non-securitized loans highlight the importance of

15
  Collateral managers of CLOs actively manage the portfolio through time selling one loan and replacing it with
another. They would do so because their compensation is in part tied to the adequacy of the collateral pool. CLOs
do contain covenants that constrain the frequency of trading within the collateral. Benmelech and Dlugosz (2009)
report that “typically 10-15% of the par value of assets may be traded per year in addition to defaulted securities or
credit-risk securities.”

controlling for differences in facility size, sales size, tranche maturity, and covenants, in drawing

inferences on the incremental effect of securitization.

         The time-series pattern of CLO origination in our sample is illustrated in Table 4. The sample is

predominately made up of CLOs originated between 2002-2007. In addition, the CLOs are highly

concentrated among a relatively small number of originating banks, with the top 10 banks underwriting

692 of the 884 CLOs (78%) over the entire sample and 569 of the 719 deals (79%) during the 2002-2007

time period. Although Table 4 focuses on the CLO underwriting activity of 18 unique banks, at least 38

different banks were involved in the underwriting of at least one CLO between the years 1996 and 2008.

         Figure 1 plots the quantity of originations of Term Loan B facilities over time. Panel A plots the

three-month moving average of the number of Term Loan B facilities originated by securitization-active

and non-securitization active banks, where a securitization-active bank is defined as one of the top ten

banks ranked by the number of securitization deals underwritten during our sample period.16 The plot

indicates that origination patterns were very similar until 2002, when securitization active banks began to

increase their origination of Term Loan B facilities aggressively. Panel B plots the origination activity of

securitization-active banks by credit rating. The plot indicates that much of the boom in Term Loan B

originations was concentrated in loans of a lower credit-quality. Finally, Panel C plots the origination

activity of non-securitization active banks by credit quality. While non-securitization active banks also

increased their origination of lower credit quality loans, the plots suggest that the difference was not as

dramatic as the difference observed in the origination activity of securitization-active banks. Overall,

these plots suggest that there was a dramatic increase in securitization activity after 2002, and that this

increase was concentrated in the securitization-active banks, and in lower credit quality issues.

  Determining the appropriate cutoff for classifying whether a bank is “securitization active” requires some
discretion. Given that ten banks are responsible for the vast majority of CLO creation, we feel it an appropriate
cutoff. In separate analysis we check the robustness of our primary results to different securitization active cutoffs
and find similar results.

4. Results

4.1. Do Securitized Loans Have Lower Spreads?

        4.1.1. Univariate Tests. The question we consider in this paper is whether increased demand for

CLOs shifted the demand for bank loans serving as collateral in CLOs, thus lowering the cost of corporate

credit. A clear prediction of this argument is that loans that were subsequently securitized should have

had lower spreads than loans that were not securitized. Panel A of Table 3 performs this comparison,

presenting the average difference in spreads between loans that were securitized and those that were not

securitized according to the Moody’s data. As a rough control for loan attributes, we present the

comparison by rating class for the most commonly issued rating levels: Ba1, Ba2, Ba3, B1, B2 and B3.

        This Panel indicates that in each rating class except for Ba1, spreads are lower for the securitized

sample than for the non-securitized sample, with the difference ranging from 2.4 basis points for the Ba2

rating category to 32.9 basis points for the B2 category. These differences are consistent with the notion

that the ability to securitize a loan leads to a lower spread and consequently a lower cost of capital for the

firm borrowing the money. However, it is not a conclusive estimate of the incremental effect of

securitization on spreads for at least three reasons. First, we have an imperfect matching of loans to

CLOs that likely understates the fraction of loans that are securitized. Second, these differences do not

control for other factors that are known to affect loan pricing. Finally, it is possible that some other factor

could affect both spreads and securitization decisions simultaneously, leading the observed relation

between the two to occur but not to be causal.

        The first issue, involving the imperfect matching of loans to CLOs results from both the fact that

we have only a snapshot of CLOs as of 2009, and also from the “by hand” nature of the matching process.

As a result, it is likely that most or all of the loans classified as securitized really were securitized, but that

a number of loans that we classified as non-securitized actually were securitized. Such a misclassification

would imply that the differences documented in Table 3 would understate the true differences in spreads

between securitized and non-securitized loans.




                                                        12
        4.1.2. Multivariate Tests. The second issue, that factors in addition to whether a particular loan

is securitized are likely to affect spreads, is addressed using a multivariate regression framework. We

create a dummy variable set equal to one if the loan was part of a CLO in the Moody’s database, and

estimate a regression of the following form:




where the subscript i refers to loan facility i at time t. The list of borrower controls includes facility-

specific credit ratings along with dummy variables for secured loans, loans with covenants, and the

existence of a pricing grid. We also control for facility amount, facility type, borrowers sales, size of the

lending syndicate, and tranche maturity.

        We control for macroeconomic factors such as the term structure of interest rates and changes in

the market price of risk. Our term structure control is calculated as the difference between the five-year

and 3-month treasury-bill rate in the month of deal origination. To control for changes in the price of

credit risk, within each month, we calculate the spread of a ten-year Ba and B-rated bond index over the

ten-year Treasury-bill rate. Loan facilities whose borrowers have B-rated (Ba-rated) senior debt are

assigned the value of the B-spread (Ba-spread) in the month of origination.

        Table 5 reports estimates of this equation. Column (1) estimates the regression with all facility

types over the 2002 to September 2007 sample period. The results indicate that when all facility types are

pooled, the incremental effect of securitization is not statistically meaningful. Columns (2), (3), and (4)

consider Term Loan B facilities only. Column (2) suggest that the impact of securitization on spreads is

negative and significant for all Term Loan B facilities. The estimates in Column (4) document that the

impact of securitization on yield is concentrated in the lower-rated B loans, which are associated with a

statistically significant 15.7 basis point drop in spread. These results are consistent with the notion that

banks lower the spreads on loans that will be securitized.

4.2. A Difference in Differences Approach




                                                       13
         The results in Table 5 suggest that securitized loans are associated with lower spreads, holding

other factors constant, at least to the extent that a loan’s risk is measured by Moody’s ratings. But what is

the appropriate interpretation of this finding? The pattern is certainly consistent with the story in which

high demand for securitizable assets from CLOs provided banks with incentives to be overly aggressive

in lending, leading to a lower cost of capital. However, the negative association between securitization

and spreads does not by itself rule out an alternative story in which lending went up not because of

anything to do with the supply of capital, but instead because of increased demand for funds. If this

demand-based story were the explanation for the increase in loans over the 2002-2007 period, and also

the explanation underlying the fact that CLOs that for some reason end up with loans in their portfolios

that have lower spreads than average for a given credit rating, then changing demand for capital could

imply that securitized loans have lower spreads than non-securitized loans.17

         The usual way to address this type of endogeneity is through an instrumental variables approach.

Unfortunately, to be a valid instrument for whether a loan is securitized would require a variable to be

related to the securitization decision but unrelated to the spread charged in the loan. Since in practice,

virtually all publicly-available variables relating to the loan potentially are at least arguably related to its

spread, the use of instrumental variables is not likely to be a practical solution.

         To distinguish between alternative explanations, we instead rely on the fact that the securitization

process by its very nature leads to a preference for certain types of loans over others. For example, it is

commonly believed that it is easier to construct CLOs from Term Loan B’s, which have bullet payments

that are set in advance, than Term Loan A’s, which have amortizing payments, or revolvers, whose

payments depend on the extent to which the borrower chooses to draw them down. In addition, Table 4

suggests that CLOs are highly concentrated in a small number of issuing banks, so loans initiated by those

banks are more likely to be securitized than loans by other non-issuing banks. Finally, Benmelech and



17
  Of course, it is not clear why CLOs would choose to purchase loans with lower spreads than average. One
possibility would be if spreads were not priced completely by the market for some reason, leading banks to sell the
lower spread loans and keep the higher spread ones for any particular quality level.


                                                         14
Dlugosz (2009) suggest that B-rated loans are the most commonly-used type of loan facility in CLOs, a

finding confirmed in the summary statistics of our sample of securitized loans.

         Our approach is to compare the relative yields on loans with securitization-friendly characteristics

to those with securitization-unfriendly characteristics during the 2002-2007 Securitization Boom. The

“securitization affecting supply of capital argument” predicts that the demand from CLOs for loans

having these attributes increased relative to other types of loans, leading to lower yields. However, there

is no particular reason why demand for capital should be reflected differentially between these types of

loan offerings. Therefore, we interpret the difference in yields for loans originated by securitization-active

banks relative to non-securitization active banks and differences between B-rated loans and Ba-rated

loans as reflecting the effect of securitization on the cost of capital.

4.3. Which Factors Affect the Likelihood that a Loan is Securitized?

         A key assumption in our analysis is that the factors we posit as being related to the securitization

decision actually do affect the likelihood a particular loan is securitized. To ensure that these assumptions

hold in our sample, we estimate equations predicting whether a particular loan from the Dealscan sample

is securitized according to the Moody’s classification. We estimate the following econometric

specification:




The Facility Type variables are dummy variables indicating the type of facility. The equation also

includes the borrower controls used in Table 5, with the exception of tranche maturity, which is

essentially deterministic in tranche type.18 Because the dependent variable is dichotomous, we estimate

the equation by probit. We constrain the sample to include years 2002-2009, since loan facilities




18
   Revolvers have a very short maturity while Term B and Term A facilities have longer maturities. Including
tranche maturity in the probit specification is essentially redundant to controlling for facility type when revolvers are
included in the sample.


                                                           15
originated prior to 2002 likely would have matured prior to 2009, making it impossible for such loans to

serve as collateral in CLOs as of 2009.19

           Table 6 reports estimates of this equation. The results in Column (1) suggest that Term Loan B

loans are significantly more likely to be securitized than Term Loan A loans (the omitted category).

Revolvers are securitized at a significantly lower rate than either type of Term Loan. In Column (2) we

classify loans as being associated with securitization active underwriters or not. The results indicate that

loan facilities initiated by the banks designated as “Securitization Active” are more likely to be

securitized than other loans. In Column (3) we estimate whether B-rated loans are securitized at a

different rate than Ba-rated loans through the inclusion of a B-rated dummy variable. The results of this

estimation confirm those of Benmelech and Dlugosz (2009) and are consistent with the unconditional

results presented in Table 2.

           In Column (4) we include tranche purpose fixed-effects and year fixed-effects, and re-estimate

the model. These controls do not materially change the inference on securitization likelihood for Term

Loan B or securitization-active facilities. However, in this specification we cannot reject the hypothesis

that Ba and B loans are securitized at the same rate at conventional significance levels since the t-statistic

drops to 1.28. The t-statistic is sensitive to the choice of clustering standard errors by borrower; when

they are clustered instead by credit rating, the t-statistic on the B-rated dummy variable rises to 2.78,

which is statistically significant at conventional levels. Overall, the results in Table 6 together with the

evidence in Benmelech and Dlugosz (2009) suggest that B-rated loans are more likely to be securitized

than Ba-rated ones, and that loans from banks designated as “Securitization Active” are more likely to be

securitized than loans from other banks.

4.4. The Impact of CLO Demand on Loan Pricing: Differences in Spreads by Type of Loan

           The hypothesis that demand from CLOs affected pricing on loans predicts that when CLO

demand is high, then loans that are most attractive to CLOs should be favored by banks issuing loans.

Consequently, these loans should be priced more aggressively than loans that are less attractive to CLOs.

19
     Over 90% of the loan facilities in our sample have an expected tranche maturity of less than seven years.


                                                           16
Since loan facilities originated by securitization-active banks appear to be more likely to be securitized

than facilities originated by non-securitization active banks and because CLO demand appears to be more

concentrated in B-rated debt, we hypothesize that spreads will reflect differences in this demand.

        We test whether increased demand by CLOs lowered spreads by estimating the following

specification:




where the sample is constrained to Term Loan B’s only. The estimate on the interaction of the

securitization-active and B-rated dummy variables represents the difference in the spread relative to non-

securitization active B-rated loans or securitization-active Ba-rated loans, holding other factors constant.

The other variables in the equation, represented by X i,t , are the term structure and credit spread variables

discussed above, along with the remaining set of the controls described in our discussion of Table 5. We

include tranche purpose fixed effects, year fixed effects, and credit-rating fixed effects where appropriate.

As in Table 5, we cluster standard errors by year and borrower.

         Table 7 reports estimates of this equation over the 2002- September 2007 sample period.

Column (1) reports results controlling only for the impact of securitization-active banks on spreads,

Column (2) adds the B-rated dummy, and Column (3) includes both of those dummy variables plus the

interaction term. The estimate of the coefficient on the interaction term is -22.7, which implies Term Loan

B facilities from securitization-active banks had 22.7 basis point lower spreads than Term Loan B

facilities from other banks, holding other attributes of the loan constant. When the interaction term is

included in Table 7, the coefficient on the securitization active bank dummy, which measures the impact

on Ba-Rated debt (since there is a dummy interacting the B-rated dummy with the securitization active

bank dummy), is actually positive, albeit not significantly different from zero. These estimates suggest

that the pricing impact of being active in securitization is concentrated in the B-rated debt, which is the

most commonly securitized type of loan.




                                                      17
        This 22.7 basis point spread for B-rated debt from securitization-active banks is a substantial

magnitude; a 22.7 basis point discount on an average-sized Term Loan B facility ($400 million U.S.

dollars) represents annual savings of close to US$ 1 Million over the life of the loan. This estimate

implies that the impact of the issuing bank’s identity is approximately the same as the impact of

covenants on spreads. To the extent that the bank’s belonging to the “Securitization Active” group reflects

the likelihood of securitization, it implies that banks are willing to discount loans substantially to be able

to have them as collateral for CLOs.

4.5. Comparisons of Term Loan B Facilities to Term Loan A Facilities and Revolvers

        The results from Table 7 suggest that loans that are sold into CLOs are issued at a lower spread

than loans that are not sold into a CLO. In addition, the difference in spreads between loan facilities

originated by securitization-active banks and non-securitization banks is most pronounced in facilities of

lower credit quality, which are the loans most commonly securitized. While we have interpreted this

finding as a consequence of heightened demand for collateral from CLOs, an alternative explanation is

that the results occur because of some unmeasurable bank-specific factor, such as an increase in banks’

risk tolerance over this period for the banks we classify as securitization-active. Such an increase in risk

tolerance for the securitzation-active banks could lead to both an increase in securitization activity as well

as an increase in lending to lower credit-quality borrowers, consistent with the empirical evidence

presented thus far.

        To distinguish between the demand for collateral and increased risk tolerance explanations for the

lower spreads on Term Loan B facilities from securitization-active banks, we consider how other facilities

issued by these same banks are priced. We do so because the other facilities are not as attractive as

collateral for CLOs as Term Loan B facilities but have similar seniority as Term Loan B facilities and

consequently similar risk. In particular, we estimate whether the pricing of Term Loan B facilities

originated by securitization-active banks, especially for lower-rated loans, is different from the pricing of

Term Loan A facilities with similar securitization-friendly attributes. To perform this test, we use a

sample made up of both Term Loan A facilities and Term Loan B facilities, and estimate whether the


                                                      18
relation between securitization activity, ratings, and pricing documented above for Term Loan B facilities

also holds for Term Loan A facilities.

        In doing so, it is important to control for other differences between Term Loan A and Term Loan

B facilities. Both are typically senior bank debt with equal priority, but have a different payoff structure

because Term Loan A facilities are normally amortizing and Term Loan B bullet. Given that these loans

have no prepayment penalties, Term Loan B facilities will always be issued at a higher spread than Term

Loan A. However, if the demand for collateral is largest at securitization-active banks and for B-rated

loans, we expect the differences to be largest for these types of loans. To evaluate this hypothesis, we

include interaction terms into the equation that allow for separate effects based on type of loan (Term

Loan A or Term Loan B), the securitization activity of the bank, and the rating of the borrowing firm’s

senior debt. In addition, our estimates include the same controls as in earlier tests, as well as year and

tranche-purpose fixed effects.

        Column (1) of Table 8 reports estimates of this equation. The effect of demand for collateral can

be seen in the coefficient on the “Term Loan B * Securitization Active Bank * B-Rated Senior Debt”,

which picks up the incremental effect on pricing of a loan having these attributes, which are those most

associated with being desirable as collateral for a CLO. The results in this column indicate that

securitization-friendly Term Loan B spreads are 32.9 basis points lower than spreads on Term Loan A

facilities with securitization-friendly attributes. This substantial coefficient suggests that the incremental

effect of having characteristics that make a loan particularly attractive as collateral for CLOs imply that

these loans are sold at a substantial discount to otherwise similar loans.

        In addition to Term Loan A facilities, most loans also contain revolvers, which are lines of credit

that can be drawn down at the borrower’s discretion. These facilities also have the same seniority as Term

Loan B facilities but also have a shorter expected maturity. Because the options implicit in these

revolvers make them less attractive as collateral for CLOs, we expect to observe the spread between

revolvers and Term Loan B’s to decline for those facilities for which the Term Loan B’s are most

attractive as collateral for CLOs.


                                                      19
        Column (2) of Table 8 presents estimates of an equation comparing the spreads of Term Loan B’s

and revolvers, again using interaction terms to allow for separate effects of type of loan, the rating of the

loan and the securitization activity of the issuing bank. The results from this equation are similar to the

results for Term Loan A’s in the first column. In particular, the incremental effect of having a

securitization-active originating bank and a B rating is to lower the loan’s spread by about 20 basis points,

and this drop is statistically significantly different from zero. This finding is consistent with the view that

demand for collateral for CLOs leads to a lower spread on facilities most attractive to CLO issuers.

Overall, the results in Table 8 favor the demand for collateral explanation rather than the increased-risk

tolerance explanation for the decline in spreads, since the latter explanation should apply equally for Term

Loan A facilities and revolvers, while the results suggest that they are specific to Term Loan B facilities.

4.6. Within-Loan Comparisons of Facility Spreads

        Thus far our analysis has been conducted at the loan-facility level. In doing so, our goal was to

measure the incremental effect that demand for collateral from CLOs has on the pricing of deals, so we

have controlled for factors that affect spreads but are unrelated to demand for collateral. The results

suggest that, holding these other factors constant, the effect of characteristics associated with the

likelihood of securitization, in particular being issued by a securitization-active bank and having a B

rating, lowers the spread difference for a Term Loan B facility relative to an otherwise similar Term Loan

A or revolving facility. We interpret this finding as consistent with the demand for collateral explanation.

However, the econometric controls we use are imperfect and it is possible that unobservable differences

across types of loans and not demand for collateral from CLOs could explain this result.

        Because of this issue, we use an approach introduced by Ivashina and Sun (2011) and compare

the spreads across facilities in the same loan. Since the facilities are from the same loan, they necessarily

have the same risk. Using this specification, the number of loans in the sample declines, since not all

loans containing Term Loan B facilities also contain a Term Loan A or Revolver. To perform this

comparison, we estimate equations that predict the difference in spreads between Term Loan B facilities

and either Term Loan A facilities or revolvers within the same loan as a function of factors likely to affect


                                                      20
the demand for collateral from CLOs.20 In doing so, we also include into the equation other factors that

potentially affect the differences in spreads.

         We present estimates of the within-loan spread differences in Table 9 for differences between

Term Loan B and Term Loan A facilities, and in Table 10 for differences between Term Loan B and

revolvers. In each case, the coefficient on the securitization-active bank dummy variable interacted with

the B-rated dummy variable is negative and significant (albeit at the 10% level for the revolver

comparison in Table 10). This finding suggests that even comparing within loans, facilities that are most

likely to be securitized are priced at a discount relative to other facilities. It does not appear that the

measured pricing discount of facilities likely to be securitized occurs because of unobserved

heterogeneity; rather the evidence is consistent with the view that issuing banks price these loans more

aggressively because they can be easily sold to CLOs.



5. Discussion and Relation to the Literature

         Perhaps the most closely related work to ours is Ivashina and Sun (2011), whose study provides

evidence that demand for loans from institutional investors in the secondary market, measured by the time

a loan remains in syndication, is negatively related to spreads on these loans. The authors present

evidence that some but not all of their effect is due to demand from CLOs. Our analysis extends their

work in a number of directions. First, we focus exclusively on the role of securitization in loan pricing.

Second, we provide direct evidence on the types of loans most associated with securitization, in

particular, Term Loan B facilities, loans issued by banks that also issue CLOs, and loans that are made to

B-rated borrowers. Third, we use these characteristics as a way to identify the causal nature of the

relation between pricing and securitization. To the extent that Ivashina and Sun (2011)’s and our

identification strategies are different from one another and our results are nonetheless similar, each



20
  In the event where a bank loan includes multiple facilities of the same type, we use the facility with the lowest
spread, so as to be conservative in our estimate of differences in spread. Of the 4,658 deals in our sample, 70 deals
have multiple Term Loan A or Term Loan B facilities.


                                                          21
paper’s analysis complements the other’s and strengthens the conclusion that securitization affects the

demand for collateralizable loans, and ultimately the cost of capital in the primary market.

           In addition, this work is closely related to work on buyouts by Shivdisani and Wang (2011), who

provide evidence suggesting that structured finance fueled the 2004-2007 LBO boom by increasing the

availability and pricing of leverage. Shivdasani and Wang (2011) present some evidence of a pricing

effect in aggregate (pricing is aggregated to the quarterly level) and in a smaller loan-level sample of

Term Loan B facilities supporting public targets of LBO transactions. To the extent that some of the

loans in our sample are used to finance LBOs, these findings are also consistent with those of Shivdasani

and Wang (2011).

           However, only 12% of the facilities in our sample are used to provide financing to LBOs; the vast

majority of them are used for general corporate purposes. To evaluate whether our results are driven by

the LBO loans in our sample, or whether the demand for collateral affected the cost of capital more

generally in this period, we exclude from our sample of loans those used to finance LBOs and reestimate

the equations reported above.21 The results are similar to those for the full sample. Term Loan B facilities

with securitization-friendly attributes exhibit lower spreads than Term Loan B’s without securitization-

friendly attributes, and Term Loan B’s exhibit lower spreads than Term Loan A’s and Revolvers with

securitization-friendly attributes. Within deal results are also quantitatively similar, although differences

between Term Loan B’s and revolvers within the same deal are not statistically significant at the

conventional levels when LBO’s are excluded. Overall, it appears that the pattern of securitization

affecting the cost of debt finance affected corporate borrowing more generally than just for buyouts

during the 2002-2007 period.

           Other related work includes Benmelech, Dlugosz, and Ivashina (2010), who test whether the CLO

market is a lemons market by investigating whether loans originated by the bank that acts as the CLO

underwriter underperform the rest of the CLO portfolio. Nini (2008) examines the investment behavior of

firms more likely to benefit from securitization-driven increases in credit supply. Finally, there is a

literature discussing numerous other factors outside of securitization which influence the spread charged

to corporate borrowers in the bank loan market (See Guner (2006), Sufi (2007), and Ivashina (2009)).



6. Conclusion

        Understanding the debt buildup from 2002 through 2007 followed by the Financial Crisis of 2008

is an important area of research for financial economists. A key element of both the debt buildup and the

Crisis is often thought to be the increase in securitization of loans over this period. By packaging loans

together in CLOs the market created a highly-rated security as a combination of low-rated (usually B-

rated) ones. While the volumes of both loans and CLOs both increased substantially during the

securitization-active period, the link between these phenomena is unclear. It is possible that this high

volume of debt issuances could reflect a high demand for capital by firms. Alternatively, as has been

alleged by theories of the Financial Crisis (see Gennaioli, Shleifer and Vishny (2010)), the demand from

CLOs for securitizable loans could have led banks to lend too much. This paper evaluates the pricing

implications of this hypothesis, and finds support for the view that demand for securitizable loans lowers

the cost of capital for firms.

        Controlling for other factors, including the risk of the loan, loans that are securitized are issued at

about a 15 basis point lower spread than an otherwise identical loan that was not securitized. This finding

is consistent with the notion that the demand for securitizable loans led banks wishing to securitize their

loans to discount them to attract more borrowers. However, there are other interpretations to this finding;

it is possible that firms’ demand for capital is such that firms’ borrowing patterns lead loans that get

securitized to have lower spreads.

        As a way of evaluating explanations based on demand for capital, we consider how the relative

spreads between loans with characteristics that are considered to be “securitization-friendly” and loans

with characteristics considered to be “securitization-unfriendly” are different during the “Securitization

Boom”. In particular, we consider the payoff structure of the debt, with “Term Loan B” loans whose

bullet payoff structures are considered more securitization-friendly than amortizing “Term Loan A” loans


                                                      23
or revolvers, whose payoff and amount borrowed is at the discretion of the borrower. Second, we

consider the issuer of the loan, with banks who are top arrangers of CLOs to be more likely to securitize

their own loans than loans from other banks. Finally, we consider the rating of the loan, with evidence

that loans made to B-rated borrowers are more likely to be securitized than loans with other ratings.

        Our findings suggest that spreads on loans with characteristics making the loan desirable to a

CLO decline relative to other loans with less securitization-friendly characteristics during the

Securitization Boom. The spread on Term Loan B facilities issued by securitization active banks to

borrowers with B-rated senior debt dropped 22 basis points relative to Term Loan B facilities with less

securitization-friendly attributes from 2002 through the fall of 2007. Consistent with the CLO demand

hypothesis, we provide evidence that the decline in spreads is concentrated in Term Loan B facilities with

securitization-friendly characteristics rather than Term Loan A or revolving facilities with otherwise

similar securitization-friendly characteristics. This result suggests that the decline in spreads cannot be

attributed to a factor associated with the particular banks originating the CLOs, such as an increase in

their risk tolerance. This general pattern of a decline in securitization-friendly facilities relative to non-

securitization-friendly facilities over the 2002-2007 period is true even for facilities that are part of the

same loan package, and is true for a sample excluding LBO loans.

        Taken together, we interpret the evidence as being consistent with the hypothesis that

securitization had a causal impact on the cost of corporate capital. Were an omitted variable to be driving

our results, it would have to be uniquely correlated with Term Loan B’s originated only by securitization

active banks to borrowers with B-rated senior debt but uncorrelated with Term Loan A’s and revolving

facilities with the same characteristics. Such a variable, other than securitization, is difficult to identify.

        These results raise a number of questions as well. For example, what was the cause of increased

demand for securitized debt? In this paper, we take increased CLO activity as given, yet we know little

about the ultimate drivers of final demand for bonds collateralized by corporate debt. Second, does the

securitization process, with its complicated cash flow rules and multiple market participants, lead to

information destruction resulting in lenders not charging spreads commensurate with risks?

Fundamentally, the question posed by the theoretical literature on securitization remains, namely, how

does the restructuring of cash flows from a pool of assets into a securitization structure create real value?

Figure 1. Plots of Term Loan B Origination Volume.

Figure 1 plots the quantity of originations of Term Loan B facilities over time. Panel A plots the three-month
moving average of the number of Term Loan B facilities originated by securitization-active and non-securitization
active banks, where a securitization-active bank is defined as one of the top-ten banks ranked by the number of
securitization deals underwritten during our sample period. Panel B splits the sample into loans with B-rated senior
debt and Ba-rated senior debt and plots the origination activity of each ratings class by securitization-active banks.
Panel C plots differences in securitization activity by ratings class for non-securitization active banks. Section 3 of
the paper describes the data screens employed in arriving at our final sample.

Table 1. The Structure of a Typical Bank Loan.
Kwik-Fit is a leading tyre and exhaust fitting company, operating in the UK, Netherlands, France and Germany.
Private equity funds were both the buyer and the seller: PAI bought KwiK-Fit from CVC. In private equity
transactions the purchase price and level of debt are typically expressed in terms of multiples of earnings before
interest, tax, depreciation and amortization (EBITDA), as shown in the last column. In this example, the estimated
EBITDA for 2005 of £95.9m is the reference point. Pricing of the debt is expressed relative to the London Inter-
bank Offered Rate (LIBOR). For the mezzanine debt, the return is split between cash interest payments and
“payments in kind” (PIK). This table is taken from Axelson et al. (2011).

Table 2. Facility Summary Statistics by Credit Rating, Facility Purpose and Facility Type.

In this table we report summary statistics on the number of loan facilities and spreads by credit rating, tranche type, and facility purpose. Our Dealscan sample
consists of senior secured and unsecured loan facilities originated between 2002- September 2007 which have Moody’s credit ratings on the senior debt of the
issuing firm available at the time of loan origination. We restrict our sample to include syndicated loans originated in the United States, and exclude firms with
SIC codes between 6000 and 6500. We also identify and remove any second-lien or mezzanine loans from the sample.

Table 3. Differences in Attributes of Non-Securitized Facilities and Securitized Facilities.
In this table we report summary statistics on loan facilities identified as having been securitized and compare them against the attributes of un-securitized loans.
The Moody’s EMS data provide a “snapshot” of the characteristics and identity of all the securities serving as collateral in any Moody’s-rated CLO as of the first
quarter of 2009. We rely on the Moody’s EMS data services data to identify loan facilities from Dealscan that are serving as collateral in CLOs specifically. We
outline the matching process in the text. The Dealscan sample runs from 2002- September 2007. Our Dealscan sample consists of senior secured and unsecured
loan facilities originated between 2002- September 2007 which have Moody’s credit ratings on the senior debt of the issuing firm available at the time of loan
origination. We restrict our sample to include syndicated loans originated in the United States, and exclude firms with SIC codes between 6000 and 6500. We
also identify and remove any second-lien or mezzanine loans from the sample. T-statistics test the significance in difference between the means.

Table 4. The Creation of CLOs through Time and by Originator.

This table reports the frequency and timing of CLO originations by CLO underwriter. Data is taken from Moody’s EMS database. Of the 884 reported CLOs,
less than 1% are reported as balance sheet CLOs. The remaining are primarily “cash-flow arbitrage” CLOs. Over 80% of all deals were created between the
2002-2007 period, with almost 50% of the deals being created in 2006 and 2007. Over 78% of the deals were originated by the top-10 originating banks. The
top-10 underwriting banks over our 2002-September 2007 sample period are classified as “securitization-active.”

Table 5. Do Securitized Loans Have Lower Spreads?

In this table we estimate differences in spreads between securitized and non-securitized loans in a simple regression
framework. We create an indicator variable for loans identified as having been securitized and estimate a regression
of the following form:
                                                                                                                  ,
where the subscript i refers to loan facility i at time t. The variables term structure, credit spread, and tranche
maturity are discussed in the text. The covenants and pricing grid indicators take the value one for loan facilities
with covenants and the existence of a pricing grid. The list of borrower controls includes facility-specific credit
ratings, a dummy variable for secured loans, log facility amount, and the log of borrowers’ sales. Where appropriate,
relevant controls include year fixed-effects, tranche purpose fixed-effects, tranche-type fixed effects, credit rating
fixed-effects and fixed effects for the bank working as the lead arranger in organizing the syndicate of lenders. We
cluster standard errors by year and borrower.

Table 6. Probit Analysis: What Type of Loans Get Securitized?

The probit specification employs a sample of loan facilities originated between 2002-2009. Our sample includes
loan facilities of three types: Revolving, Term Loan B, and Term Loan A, which serves as the omitted group in the
estimation. The sample is also constrained to include facilities with senior debt rated Ba1, Ba2, Ba3, B1, B2, and B3
at the time of loan origination. The primary specification is as follows:
                                                                                                                   ,
Depending on the specification, the list of borrower controls includes credit ratings, log facility amount, log of
borrowers’ sales, and syndicate size. We include dummy variables for secured facilities and facilities with covenants
and pricing grids. Results in the fourth column include year and tranche-purpose fixed effects. Standard errors are
clustered by year.

This table estimates the relationship between facility-level spreads and facility characteristics, specified as,

The estimation sample includes only Term Loan B facilities and runs from 2002-September 2007. The sample is
also constrained to include facilities with senior debt rated Ba1, Ba2, Ba3, B1, B2, and B3 at the time of loan
origination. Securitization-active banks are defined as the top-10 most active CLO-underwriting banks over the
sample period (see Table 4). B-rated senior debt is an indicator variable for facilities whose borrower has B-rated
senior debt. The variables term structure, credit spread, and tranche maturity are discussed in the text. The
covenants and pricing grid indicators take the value one for loan facilities with covenants and the existence of a
pricing grid. Other borrower controls include log facility amount, log borrower’s sales, syndicate size, and an
indicator variable for secured loans. Relevant macroeconomic controls include year fixed-effects and tranche-
purpose fixed effects. Results presented in Column (1) control for credit-rating fixed effects. Standard errors are
clustered by year and by borrower.

Table 8. Is the “Securitization-Friendly” Decline in Spreads Specific to Term B’s Only?

This table estimates the relationship between facility-level spreads and facility characteristics. The estimation
sample in Column (1) includes Term Loan B and Term Loan A facilities and runs from 2002-September 2007,
which represents a period of heightened securitization activity. The sample is also constrained to include facilities
with senior debt rated Ba1, Ba2, Ba3, B1, B2, and B3 at the time of loan origination. The estimation sample in
Column (2) includes Term Loan B facilities and Revolving facilities. Securitization-active banks are defined as the
top-10 most active CLO-underwriting banks over the sample period (see Table 4). B-rated senior debt is an indicator
variable for facilities whose borrower has B-rated senior debt. The variables term structure, credit spread, and
tranche maturity are discussed in the text. The covenants and pricing grid indicators take the value one for loan
facilities with covenants and the existence of a pricing grid. Other borrower controls include log facility amount, log
borrower’s sales, syndicate size, and an indicator variable for secured loans. Relevant macroeconomic controls
include year fixed-effects and tranche-purpose fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by year and by borrower.

Table 9. Within-Deal Differences in Loan Spreads: Term B’s vs. Term A’s.

This table estimates the relationship between facility-level spreads within the same deal. For each deal in the sample
with adequate data, we compute the within-deal difference in spreads on Term Loan B facilities compared to Term
Loan A facilities. The estimation sample runs from 2002-September 2007, which represents a period of heightened
securitization activity. The sample is also constrained to include facilities with senior debt rated Ba1, Ba2, Ba3, B1,
B2, and B3 at the time of loan origination. Securitization-active banks are defined as the top-10 most active CLO-
underwriting banks over the sample period (see Table 4). B-rated senior debt is an indicator variable for facilities
whose borrower has B-rated senior debt. The variables term structure, credit spread, and tranche maturity are
discussed in the text. The covenants and pricing grid indicators take the value one for loan facilities with covenants
and the existence of a pricing grid. Other borrower controls include senior-debt credit ratings, log facility amount,
log borrower’s sales, and an indicator variable for secured loans. Relevant macroeconomic controls include year
fixed-effects and tranche-purpose fixed effects. Standard errors are clustered by year and by borrower.

Table 10. Within-Deal Differences in Loan Spreads: Term B’s vs. Revolver’s.

This table estimates the relationship between facility-level spreads within the same deal. For each deal in the sample,
we compute the within-deal difference in spreads on Term Loan B facilities compared to Revolving facilities. The
estimation sample runs from 2002-September 2007, which represents a period of heightened securitization activity.
The sample is also constrained to include facilities with senior debt rated Ba1, Ba2, Ba3, B1, B2, and B3 at the time
of loan origination. Securitization-active banks are defined as the top-10 most active CLO-underwriting banks over
the sample period (see Table 4). B-rated senior debt is an indicator variable for facilities whose borrower has B-rated
senior debt. The variables term structure, credit spread, and tranche maturity are discussed in the text. The
covenants and pricing grid indicators take the value one for loan facilities with covenants and the existence of a
pricing grid. Other borrower controls include senior-debt credit ratings, log facility amount, log borrower’s sales,
and an indicator variable for secured loans. Relevant macroeconomic controls include year fixed-effects and
tranche-purpose fixed-effects. Standard errors are clustered by year and by borrower.

Appendix Table 1: Differences in Securitization-Friendly Spreads: Excluding LBO Loans.
This table estimates the relationship between facility-level spreads and facility characteristics. Each estimation
sample in this table excludes any bank loan affiliated with LBO transactions. The estimation sample runs from
2002-September 2007, which represents a period of heightened securitization activity. The sample is also
constrained to include facilities with senior debt rated Ba1, Ba2, Ba3, B1, B2, and B3 at the time of loan origination.
Column (1) includes Term Loan B facilities only. Column (2) includes Term Loan B and Term Loan A facilities and
Column (3) includes Term Loan B facilities and Revolving facilities. Securitization-active banks are defined as the
top-10 most active CLO-underwriting banks over the sample period (see Table 4). B-rated senior debt is an indicator
variable for facilities whose borrower has B-rated senior debt. The variables term structure, credit spread, and
tranche maturity are discussed in the text. The covenants and pricing grid indicators take the value one for loan
facilities with covenants and the existence of a pricing grid. Other borrower controls include senior-debt credit
ratings, log facility amount, log borrower’s sales, and an indicator variable for secured loans. Relevant
macroeconomic controls include year fixed-effects and tranche-purpose fixed-effects. Standard errors are clustered
by year and by borrower.

Appendix Table 2: Within-Deal Differences in Loan Spreads: Excluding LBO Loans.
This table estimates the relationship between facility-level spreads within the same deal. Each estimation sample in
this table excludes any bank loan affiliated with LBO transactions. For each deal in the sample, we compute the
within-deal difference in spreads on Term Loan B facilities compared to Term Loan A or Revolving facilities.
Column (1) estimates differences in within deal spreads between Term Loan B facilities and Term Loan A facilities.
Column (2) compares Term Loan B’s against Revolvers. The estimation sample runs from 2002-September 2007,
which represents a period of heightened securitization activity. The sample is also constrained to include facilities
with senior debt rated Ba1, Ba2, Ba3, B1, B2, and B3 at the time of loan origination. Securitization-active banks
are defined as the top-10 most active CLO-underwriting banks over the sample period (see Table 4). B-rated senior
debt is an indicator variable for facilities whose borrower has B-rated senior debt. The variables term structure,
credit spread, and tranche maturity are discussed in the text. The covenants and pricing grid indicators take the
value one for loan facilities with covenants and the existence of a pricing grid. Other borrower controls include
senior-debt credit ratings, log facility amount, log borrower’s sales, and an indicator variable for secured loans.
Relevant macroeconomic controls include year fixed-effects and tranche-purpose fixed-effects. Standard errors are
clustered by year and by borrower.
