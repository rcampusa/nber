                                              ABSTRACT

The main purpose of this paper is to estimate an equilibrium model of private and public school competition
that can generate realistic pricing patterns for private universities in the U.S. We show that the parameters
of the model are identified and can be estimated using a semi-parametric estimator given data from
the NPSAS. We find substantial price discrimination within colleges. We estimate that a $10,000 increase
in family income increases tuition at private schools by on average $210 to $510. A one standard deviation
increase in ability decreases tuition by approximately $920 to $1,960 depending on the selectivity
of the college. Discounts for minority students range between $110 and $5,750.

1       Introduction
The net tuition paid by any two students sitting in the same college classroom is often
quite different.1 Product differentiation and market segmentation together with id-
iosyncratic preference shocks can generate market power for private colleges. Private
colleges and universities engage in third-degree price discrimination, conditioning in-
stitutional financial aid and thus net tuition on student ability, household income,
and other characteristics such as minority status. Colleges compete to attract higher
ability students and students who increase diversity, while also wanting high income
students who might cross-subsidize desirable lower income students. The exercise of
market power can be expected to vary across student types. The main purpose of this
paper is to estimate an equilibrium model of private and public school competition
that can generate realistic pricing patterns for private universities.
    Our empirical analysis builds on the model developed in Epple, Romano, Sarpca,
and Sieg (2017), in which students differ by income, ability, state of residence, and
unobserved idiosyncratic preferences for colleges. Demand for colleges can be modeled
using a discrete choice random utility framework. The demand model accounts for
the fact that not all students are admitted to selective colleges. Both private and state
colleges optimally use minimum ability admission thresholds. Given these admission
thresholds, we can determine the set of colleges that are feasible for each student
type.
    Epple, Romano, Sarpca, and Sieg (2017) also derive the optimal financial aid and
pricing policies of private schools, which have a number of interesting properties.
First, because private schools set a posted or maximum tuition, a minimum ability
threshold that characterizes admission policies of private colleges arises. A certain
fraction of students do not obtain financial aid and pay this maximum tuition. These
are students that are of relatively low ability in the school and thus do not qualify
    1
     By net tuition, we mean tuition net of the student’s institutional financial aid. We use posted
tuition to refer to the amount paid by students that receive no institutional aid.



                                                 1
for merit aid. Moreover, these students must have income sufficiently high so that
they are willing to pay the price maximum. Second, net tuition can be expressed as
“effective marginal cost” plus a mark-up for all students that are not at the maximum.
   Important differences distinguish this model from a standard oligopolistic pricing
model. First, effective marginal cost depends on the ability and minority status of
a student. Pricing by ability or merit-based aid arises because high ability students
increase college quality through reputation and peer effects. Discounts for minority
students arise because they enhance diversity.2 Second, the mark-up term for a
student does not depend on the overall market share of the college, but on the market
share conditional on observed student characteristics. We show that these terms can
differ by large margins among students, especially for highly selective colleges. Hence
“local” or conditional market shares drive mark-ups in the model, and not overall
market shares. Third, the mark-up can be decomposed into two additive terms. The
first term takes the standard form derived in standard discrete choice demand models.
This term reflects idiosyncratic preferences for the school and product differentiation.
The second term is monotonically increasing in student or household income capturing
pricing by income and arises due to price discrimination. As a consequence, this model
is sufficiently rich to generate the qualitative features of tuition policies observed in
the U.S. market for higher education.
   The first objective of this paper is then to derive a new semi-parametric estimator
for the parameters of the model. We can identify and estimate almost all parameters
of the model using a method of moments estimator that is based on the difference
between the observed and predicted price functions at private colleges. To implement
this estimator we need a non-parametric plug-in estimator of the conditional market
share for each student at the school that is attended in equilibrium. Our estimation
approach does not require us to solve for the equilibrium of the model.3 This has the
   2
      Our paper is, therefore, also related to the recent literature that estimates empirical models of
affirmative action. Some recent work includes Hickman (2013), Kapor (2016), and .
    3
      The idea of conditioning on observed choice probabilities is similar to Heckman (1979), Hotz and
Miller (1993), Berry (1994), and Aguirregabiria and Mira (2002). Our quasi-maximum likelihood


                                                  2
virtue of simplicity. It is also computationally feasible since we do not need to use a
nested fixed point algorithm. Moreover, the estimator is consistent for a finite number
of elements in the choice set as the number of students in a single cross section goes
to infinity.
   The second objective of the paper is to implement this estimator using data from
the National Postsecondary Student Aid Study. Our sample size consists of approxi-
mately 9,500 students that attended a two-year public community college, a four-year
public college, or a four-year private college in the U.S. in 2012. Approximately 2,270
students attend a four-year private college. This subsample is the core sample used
in estimation. The remaining students that attend public schools are primarily used
to estimate the conditional market shares.
   While our sample size is large, it is not large enough to estimate a model at
the individual college level.4 We, therefore, use clustering algorithms to aggregate
four-year private colleges into ten types, public four-year colleges into four types,
and public two-year colleges into one type. Our empirical demand model thus has
15 different college types. To our knowledge, this is the most disaggregate demand
model for higher education that has ever been estimated.
   We find that the majority of private colleges engage in pricing by income, ability,
and minority status. A $10,000 increase in family income increases tuition at private
schools by on average $210 to $510. A one standard deviation increase in ability
decreases tuition by approximately $920 to $1,960 depending on the selectivity of the
college. Large and substantial discounts for minority students arise that range be-
tween approximately $110 (at historically black colleges) and $5,750. Average mark-
ups in private colleges range between $750 and $13,200. Much more heterogeneity
and some much larger mark-ups occur within colleges than the averages.
estimator is most similar to the one proposed by Bajari, Hong, and Nekipelov (2010) to estimate
games with incomplete information.
   4
     The NPSAS is the most comprehensive data set available for the U.S., but only samples a subset
of all colleges in the U.S. As a consequence some sort of aggregation is unavoidable if one estimates
any demand model for higher education using this data set.



                                                 3
   Our paper is related to at least three different areas of research that have focused
on markets for higher education. First, there are many empirical papers that have
documented that pricing by income, ability and minority status is prevalent in the
financial aid data.5 Previous structural papers have either ignored this or explained
pricing by income by appealing to a motive of serving the poor or providing valued
socio-economic diversity on campus. The former approach is taken in most theoretical
papers on higher education. The latter approach is taken in Epple, Romano, and Sieg
(2006) and Fillmore (2016) who also estimates a model of competitive college pricing.
He studies price discrimination and explores restricting colleges’ ability to use some
or all of the information incorporated in the Free Application for Federal Student
Aid (FAFSA). In that case colleges have incentives to use other information that is
correlated with FAFSA information.
   Second, our work is related to research that has modeled admission and attendance
decisions in the market for higher education. The informational environment in our
model implies students face no uncertainty in admissions, so we can abstract from an
application-admission game with incomplete information. Avery and Levin (2010),
Chade, Lewis, and Smith (2014) and Fu (2014) provide a detailed analysis of these
issues. Our model also abstracts from choices made by students once they enter
college. The most important decision is the choice of a major. Arcidiacono (2005)
and Bordon and Fu (2015) develop and estimate dynamic models of choice of academic
major under uncertainty.6 Last, in Epple et al. (2017) , we have developed the basic
theoretical model to examine effects of policy changes on attendance patterns and
student costs. We have calibrated the parameters of the model and imposed an
equilibrium selection criteria. These simplifications allow us to numerically solve for
equilibrium in the model and perform policy analysis. In this paper we extend the
model to allow for differences in minority status. Most importantly, we develop and
   5

1999), Dynarski (2002), Epple, Romano, and Sieg (2003), and McPherson and Schapiro (2006), and
Fillmore (2016). van der Klaauw (2002) shows that colleges use price discounts to attract students.

      Wiswall and Zafar (2015) exploit an informational experiment to study major choice.

implement a semi-parametric estimator for the parameters of the model. Moreover,
we conduct an empirical analysis of price discrimination and market power here.
    Finally, our paper is related to recent research on the importance of peer effects
in education. Regarding peer effects in schools, there is a large literature by social
scientists. Methodological issues are discussed in Manski (1993), Moffitt (2001), and
Brock and Durlauf (2001). Recent research on peer effects in higher education in-
cludes studies of college dormitory roommates (Sacerdote (2001), Zimmerman (2003),
Boisjoly, Duncan, Kremer, Levy, and Eccles (2006), Stinebrickner and Stinebrickner
(2006) and Kremer and Levy (2008)), dormitory residential groupings (Foster, 2006),
randomly formed groups in military academies (Lyle (2007, 2009) and Carrell, Fuller-
ton, and West (2009)), classroom peer effects (Arcidiacono, Foster, Goodpaster, and
Kinsler, 2012), effects of high school peers (Betts and Morell, 1999), and peer effects
among medical students (Arcidiacono and Nickolson, 2005).7 We do not provide any
direct evidence on the importance of peer effects, but provide strong indirect evidence
based on our analysis of pricing by ability, income, and minority status.
    The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces our data set
and provides descriptive statistics. Section 3 introduces the model that characterizes
student sorting among and price and admission policies of colleges. Section 4 intro-
duces a parametrization and discusses our estimator. Section 5 reports our parameter
estimates. Section 6 explores the implications of this analysis for mark-ups, market
power and price discrimination. Section 7 concludes the analysis.



2       Data
Our data source is the 2011-12 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS)
from the National Center for Education Statistics (NCES).8 Our model focuses on
    7
    See Epple and Romano (2010) and (Sacerdote, 2011) for a more complete literature survey.
    8
    The NPSAS data are accompanied by inverse probability weights that account for the composite
probability of sampling, both at the college and individual level. We use these weights throughout
the empirical analysis.


                                                5
initial attendance/matriculation outcomes. We construct our sample using first-year
students, who are oversampled in this wave of the NPSAS and constitute more than
half of all observations.9 We drop some students whose behavior or characteristics
require separate modeling. These include multiple attenders–students who switch
institutions in their first academic year.10 These also include a larger number of
students with atypical attendance patterns–those who attend part-time or part-year,
as is often the case at two-year colleges. We also drop veterans and athletes because
their financial aid opportunities are different from those faced by the average student,
and their priorities in selecting an institution may also differ. We drop foreign students
(or students with no state residence) for two reasons: (i) Their choice sets possibly
include the universities in their home country, as well as universities in other non-
home countries (based on their decision to study abroad); and (ii) their eligibility for
financial aid and their pricing by colleges may differ.
   Ability is a key variable in our analysis, and we drop observations with missing
components of the ability measures (ACT or SAT score and high school GPA).11 We
drop all students attending schools at which we cannot match institutional expen-
ditures. Finally there are a few sample schools that offer both 4-year and 2-year
degrees, and we drop their 2-year enrollees (the minority) and treat them as 4-year
institutions. The resulting sample consists of approximately 9,490 students. Table 1
presents the numbers of these groups of students along with their distribution over
different types of colleges.
   Table 2 presents selected statistics from our sample. Our measure of ability is
   9
     College completion and continuation decisions are likely to differ from the initial matriculation
decision. Also, family resources and aid packages in later years of attendance need not be identical
to those in the student’s first year. For these reasons we use first-year students in our analysis.
  10
     These constitute about 4 percent of the sample, dropped because we cannot know if the switch
was planned from the point of matriculation, and so the decision space would become much more
complex.
  11
     As approximately 40% of first-year public 2-year students do not take SATs or ACTs, it is
possible that the remaining sample is of higher ability than the general student body. Thus, our
measure of average peer quality may be biased upward for this college, and we will underestimate
the quality differentiation among the lowest-tier colleges. However, there is no other viable measure
of student ability, and so this is an unavoidable challenge to estimation.

predicted college GPA–we model college GPA as a function of high school GPA, ACT
or SAT score, gender, major, and college fixed effects in a sample of non-minority
four-year college students. We then predict GPA at a generic college, using only
the recovered parameters for high school GPA, ACT/SAT score, and gender.12 This
ability measure is then transformed to have unit standard deviation and positive
mean. The choice of mean ensures that the average ability at each college is weakly
greater than zero.13
   Our measure of income is adjusted gross income in 2010. Where possible, NPSAS
computes this value based on the federal financial aid application, and uses total
income (of family or student as implied by dependency status) reported in the student
interview where no application or tax return are available. The 2010 value is used
as federal financial aid eligibility for 2011-2012 school year would be based on 2010
income. Race, ethnicity, and gender are drawn from the student interview where
possible, and from student records when no interview is possible.
   In-state status is determined by comparing the student’s reported state of residence
  12
     We do not account for minority status in this regression although it could be easily done. A
priori one can make arguments in favor and against either approach.

     Appendix A provides additional details. It also explains the construction of the ability thresholds
used for each cluster.

with the imputed availability of public college types. We calculate total institutional
aid by taking the sum of institutional grants, one-half of work study, and one-quarter
of loans. Thus, net tuition is the posted tuition less the sum of institutional aid
(federal aid is considered separately).

  Federal aid is limited to Pell grants, which are calculated by the formula

                                 n                            o
                          A = min max {0, COA − EF C(y)}, 5500 ,


where COA is the federally determined cost–of-attendance and EF C(y) the federally
determined expected family contribution, which increases with household income.
Pell grants are awarded up to COA − EF C if positive, but with a maximum of




                                                        8
$5500. However, in practice, we use the amended formula:

                            n                                o
                     A = min max {0, p¯j + L − EF C(y)}, 5500 ,


as cost of attendance – posted tuition (p¯j ) plus estimated non-tuition costs (L) – varies
by student-college combination and is only occasionally observed at the attended
college, and never observed for potential alternatives. EFC is directly reported in the
NPSAS, and thus can be used both for the attended college as well as the potential
alternatives.
   Then we calculate the Pell aid at each college using the above formula, also ad-
justing to account for the Pell minimum award (in 2012, 555 dollars). Any student
offered at least half of the minimum, but less than the minimum, is given the min-
imum, and any student eligible for less than half of the minimum was awarded no
aid. Additionally, we have many “never-takers” in our sample, and so if we observe
a student to be a non-taker at the attended college when eligible for some aid, we
assume the student is a never-taker at all colleges.
   Our sample includes observations from approximately 900 colleges. The number
of students observed per college averages about 11. Having more observations per
college is desirable for precision when testing within-college predictions of the model.
At the same time, our model implies that colleges with similar characteristics would
make similar admission and pricing decisions. Working with smaller choice sets (fewer
colleges) also has computational advantages. For these reasons, we group together
colleges that are similar in their key characteristics, treating them as one college.
We group public and private colleges separately based on the joint variance of posted
tuition, average ACT score, and instructional expenditures per student, using k-means
clustering. We choose the number of clusters based on the elbow method, increasing
the number of clusters until the marginal cluster does not significantly decrease the
within-group variance, which suggests approximately four clusters of public four-year
colleges, and approximately twelve clusters of private four-year colleges.

  The “rule of thumb” relates the suggested k to the number of schools to cluster,
k = n2 , implies approximately 13 private clusters (npriv =350). We initially create
   p

twelve private clusters, but then combine two sets of resulting cluster pairs to ensure
an adequate sample size of students at each cluster. Table 3 presents the key charac-
teristics of private and public clusters, ordered within the two college groups by mean
ACT. The term “college” will refer to a cluster in the rest of the paper.14



3      A Model of Price Discrimination
In this section, we briefly review the model derived in Epple, Romano, Sarpca, and
Sieg (2017) and derive the key implications for optimal admission and pricing poli-
cies. The main difference between the model that we estimate in this paper and
the model that was used in Epple, Romano, Sarpca, and Sieg (2017) is that we add
minority status as a student characteristic and thus study the pricing implications of
preferences for diversity.
    We consider a model with S regions or states and normalize the student population
in the economy to 1. Let πs denote the student population proportions or size of each
state and note that Ss=1 πs = 1. Students in each state differ continuously by after-
                    P

tax income y and ability b. Students also differ by minority status which is a discrete
indicator variable m ∈ {0, 1}. Let fs (b, y|m) denote the density of (b, y) in state s
conditional on m. The fraction of of type m households in state s is denoted by πsm ;
          P
note that m πsm = πs .
    For expositional simplicity, we assume each state operates one public university. In
our application discussed below, we extend the model and allow for product differenti-
ation among public colleges within a state.15 In addition to the S public universities,
  14
     Treating clusters as one college assumes: (i) students perceive colleges within a cluster as equiv-
alent; and (ii) either students apply to no more than one college within a cluster or that colleges
within clusters effectively collude. Since we have 14 clusters and students that qualify for a cluster
can attend at their price, we are not significantly limiting the choice set of students.
  15
     Our empirical model allows for up to four public types in each state.



                                                  11
there are P private universities that operate nationwide and also compete for stu-
dents. There is an outside option which we model as attending a two-year public
college. The total number of alternatives is then J = S + P + 1.16
   A student with ability b that attends a university of quality qj has an achievement
denoted by a(qj , b). Let psj (m, b, y) denote the tuition that a student from state s with
ability b, income y, and minority status m pays for attending college j. Let Asj (y)
denote federal aid and L the non-tuition cost of attending a college. Federal aid
depends on income and the cost of attending a college, which varies with a student’s
state of residence if attending a state college. Let εj denote an idiosyncratic preference
shock for college j, which is private information of the student.
   The utility of student (s, m, b, y) for college j is additively separable in the idiosyn-
cratic component and given by:


           Uj (s, m, b, y, εj ) = U (y − psj (m, b, y) − L + Asj (y), a(qj , b)) + εj .           (1)


U (·) is an increasing, twice differentiable, and quasi-concave function of the numeraire
and educational achievement, a(·). Educational achievement is an increasing, twice
differentiable, and strictly quasi-concave function of college quality and own ability.
   Utility depends on location and minority status because tuition depends on loca-
tion and minority status. The dependence on location can arise for two reasons. First,
state colleges are likely to give preferential treatment to in-state students. Second,
private colleges may use different mark-ups to students coming from different states
because these students may face different state college options. The dependence on
minority status follows from the fact that colleges value diversity as discussed below.
   Let Sa (s, m, b) denote the subset of state colleges to which student (s, m, b, y) is
admitted, Pa (s, m, b) the same for private colleges, and Ja (s, m, b) ⊂ Sa (s, m, b) ∪
  16
    We abuse notation for convenience by using S to denote both the number of state colleges and
the set of them {1, 2, . . ., S}, and likewise for P and J (which usage will be obvious by context).
Also for expositional convenience, we sometimes refer to university j from the set of all alternatives
J, though this includes non-universities like the two-year public college.


                                                 12
Pa (s, m, b) ∪ O the options that provide positive utility available to the student.17
Taking as given tuitions, qualities, and non-institutional aid, student (s, m, b, y)
chooses among j ∈ Ja (s, m, b) to maximize utility (1). Let the optimal decision rule
be denoted by δ(s, m, b, y, ε). The vector ε satisfies standard regularity assumptions
in McFadden (1974).
   Integrating out the idiosyncratic taste components yields conditional choice prob-
abilities for each type:
                                                  Z
            rsj (m, b, y; P (m, s, b, y), Q) =         1{δj (s, m, b, y, ε) = 1} g(ε) dε,          (2)


where 1{·} is an indicator function, δj (·) = 1 means college j is chosen, P (s, m, b, y)
denotes the vector of tuitions that apply to student type (s, m, b, y), and Q denotes
the vector of college qualities.
   Private colleges attract students from all states of the country. Their objective is
to maximize quality. College j has a cost function


                                Cj (kj , Ij ) = Fj + Vj (kj ) + kj Ij ,                            (3)


where kj denotes the size of college j’s student body and Ij expenditures per student
on educational resources in college j. The costs Fj + Vj (kj ) are independent of educa-
tional quality, which we refer to as “custodial costs.” Moreover, each college obtains
an exogenous amount of non-tuition income denoted by Ej , e.g., from endowment
earnings Finally, private colleges also have exogenous posted or maximum tuitions,
denoted by p̄j .18
   Letting θj denote mean ability in college j’s student body and Γj the fraction of
  17
    Admission is independent of income, though net tuition will vary with income.
  18
    In reality, private colleges have a posted (advertised) tuition, which is what almost every student
among those that do not receive any institutional aid pay. Setting a maximum tuition, rather than
having tuition strictly monotonic in income (for given other student attributes), is likely explained
by a combination of social/political marketing and uninformed students who are unaware of financial
aid. For tractability, we do not model the latter elements, and we then treat a private college’s
posted tuition as given in the theory.


                                                  13
minority students, college quality is given by


                                            qj = qj (θj , Ij , Γj )                             (4)


which is a twice differentiable, increasing, and strictly quasi-concave function of
(θj, Ij , Γj ). Quality increases with average student ability due to a combination of
peer learning effects, non-learning externalities from developing relationships with
high ability peers, and reputation effects.19 Quality increases with diversity as having
diverse student peers enhances post-college success in a diverse workplace.20
   Colleges maximize quality behaving as monopolistic competitors. Private college
j takes as given other colleges’ tuitions and qualities when maximizing quality. We
can write the quality optimization problem of private college j as follows:


                                            max                  q(θj , Ij , Γj )               (5)

enhancing college effect. See, for example, MacLeod and Urquiola (2015).

represented.

   The left-hand side of (12) is the usual expression for marginal revenue. The right-
hand side of expression (12) is the “effective marginal cost” of student (s, m, b, y)’s
attendance, which sums the marginal resource cost given by the first two terms and
the marginal peer costs given by the last two terms. The ability-based marginal peer
cost (third term) multiplies the negative of the student’s effect on the peer measure
                                                                                             ∂q/∂θ

The diversity marginal peer cost has analogous decomposition. Note that EM C
varies with students in college j only with the student’s ability and minority status.
The ability-based marginal peer cost is negative for students of ability exceeding the
college’s mean, and the diversity-based marginal peer cost is negative for minorities.

     An appendix is available upon request from the authors that derives the optimality conditions
for the private and the public school’s optimization problem.




                                                  15
   Students (m, b, y) are admitted to the college if and only if


                            min{p̄j , psj (m, b, y)} ≥ EM Cj (m, b)                           (14)


Equation (14) yields minimum ability thresholds that vary with minority status for
each private college implicitly defined by:


                                     p̄j = EM Cj (m, bmin
                                                      jm )                                    (15)


Since effective marginal cost decreases with ability and is lower for a minority student
of given ability, the admission threshold for minorities is lower.
   It is interesting to compare the tuition results to that for a profit-maximizing
private college. It is not hard to show that a profit-maximizing college would have a
tuition function that is of the exact form of (12). The main objective of the paper
is to determine the empirical content of the pricing equation in (12). Our estimation
approach, discussed in detail in the next section, is therefore consistent with quality
or profit maximization assumptions.
   Distinguishing quality and profit maximization empirically would require distin-
guishing relatively subtle differences between equilibria under the two alternatives.22
Given educational inputs, the quality maximizing college sets tuition to maximize
profits, while taking account of the peer value effects, so as to have the maximum
funds to increase quality. However, the quality maximizing college has stronger incen-
tive to spend on educational inputs, implying inputs will be higher in (12). Moreover,
if the quality function is such that qθ /qI increases with I, as we might expect, then the
weight on the ability-based peer effect (θ − b) in (13) will differ, implying the quality
maximizer has stronger incentives to attract higher ability students. Likewise, the
quality maximizer has stronger incentives to attract minorities.
  22
    See Epple and Romano (1998, 2008) for an analysis of profit maximization by (secondary) schools
in a related model.



                                                16
    To test the implications of equation (12), we need to close the demand model and
derive the conditional market shares for each private college. For that we need to
derive the admission policies of state schools. From an empirical perspective, we will
only require that public colleges adopt minimum ability admission thresholds that
depend on the state of residence and the minority status of the student. Next we
summarize a model of state colleges that generates admission policies that have these
properties.
    From the perspective of a state college, a student with characteristics (m, b, y)
is either an in-state student or an out-of-state student. We assume that tuition
charged to in-state students is fixed exogenously at Ts and to out-of-state students
at Tso . Epple, Romano, Sarpca, and Sieg (2017) then show that state schools that
maximize aggregate achievement of their in-state students use ability threshold rules
to determine access to the school. These thresholds differ for in-state and out-of state
students.23 With these results in hand, we are now in a position to turn to empirical
analysis and determine whether the predictions of this model regarding pricing and
demand are consistent with the observed data.



4      Estimation

4.1     A Parametrization

To estimate the model we need to invoke some additional parametric assumptions.

Assumption 1
  23
     With Tso > Ts , as hold empirically, the ability threshold for admitting in-state versus out-of-
state students can be higher or lower theoretically. Out-of-state are valued by state schools for their
peer spillovers and higher regulated tuition. This can lead their admission threshold to be higher
or lower depending on the relative weight in the quality function on the peer effect to the resource
effect. Note, too, these admission thresholds will each be lower for minority status, though this was
not analyzed in Epple, Romano, Sarpca, and Sieg (2017).




                                                  17
a) The quality function is given by


                              qj = θjγ Ijω Γκj euj , γ, ω, κ > 0                           (16)


where uj is an unobserved exogenous characteristic.
b) The utility function is given by:


 Uj (y −psj −L+Asj , a(qj , b)) = α ln(y −psj −L+Asj ) + α ln(qj bβ ) + j , β, α > 0 (17)


where α parameterizes the weight on the systematic component of utility.
   c) The disturbances εj are independent and identically distributed with Type I Ex-
treme Value Distribution.

   The assumptions above then imply that the conditional choice probability for type
(s, m, b, y) is given by, for j ∈ Ja (m, s, b):

                                    [(y − psj (m, b, y) − L + Asj (y)) qj ]α
            rsj (m, b, y) = P                                                        α
                                                                                       .   (18)
                                k∈Ja (m,s,b) [(y − psk (m, b, y) − L + Ask (y)) qk ]

The pricing equation (12) for private colleges can then be written:

                      (1 − rsj )α                         1
  psj (m, b, y) =                   EM Cj (m, b) +                 (y − L + Asj (y)) (19)
                    1 + (1 − rsj )α                1 + (1 − rjs )α

Effective marginal costs at private colleges are given by:

                                                  γIj            κIj m
                EM Cj (m, b) = Vj0 + Ij +             (θj − b) +    (Γ − m)                (20)
                                                  ωθj            ωΓj j

The pricing function is then:
                                                                             
                      (1 − rsj )α       0        γIj              κIj
    psj (m, b, y) =                   Vj + Ij +        (θj − b) +     (Γj − m) (21)
                    1 + (1 − rsj )α              ωθj              ωΓj
                           1                         
                  +                   y − L + Asj (y)
                    1 + (1 − rjs )α


                                                  18
In addition we simplify notation by writing the marginal resource costs as


                                    Vj = V 0 (kj ) + Ij                             (22)


We treat the V1 , ...VJ as additional parameters to be estimated.
  The model implies an appealing decomposition of tuition. From (19), observe
that tuition to student (s, m, b, y) is a convex combination of the student’s effective
marginal cost and cost adjusted income. The linkage of tuition to ability and minority
status reflects the student’s within college externality, which is independent of market
power. The linkage to income reflects market power over the student type (s, m, b, y).
The weight on income increases with the student type’s market share at the college
indicating increased market power over the student. The weight on income decreases
with α, the weight on the systematic component of utility. This indicates that market
power declines as idiosyncratic preferences become less important.


4.2    The Information Set

The information set of the econometrician can be characterized as follows.

Assumption 2

   • We observe a sample i = 1, ..., N . Let si denote the state of student i, mi the
      minority status, bi ability, yi income and psji , the tuition at college j. Note
      that we only observe the tuition at the college attended in equilibrium. Let dji
      denote an indicator which is equal to one if student i attends college j and zero
      otherwise.

   • L is known.

   • θj , Ij , kj are known for all j.

   • In- and out-of-state tuitions at state colleges (p̄js ) and posted prices at private
      colleges (p̄j ) are known.

                                            19
   • Asij (yi ) are observed for all i and j.

   • Prices for all students i at private colleges that are not paying the posted price
      are measured with classical error:


                                  p̃sji = psij (mi , bi , yi ) + vij                 (23)


      where vij is iid across i and j.


4.3    A Semi-parametric Estimator

Consider the subsample of students that attend private colleges and are not paying
the full posted price, i.e. the subsample of students at private schools that obtain
some institutional aid. Using this subsample we can identify and estimate most of the
parameters of the model using the predictions of the model about price discrimination.
In particular, we can implement the following semi-parametric estimator.
   We non-parametrically estimate the conditional market shares rsj (m, b, y) for all
students for the private college that is attended in the data. We use a simple flexible
Logit estimator using a quadratic approximation in b and y, where the coefficients
depend on m and s. We then use the estimated Logit model to predict the conditional
choice probability denoted by r̂sj (m, b, y). Alternatively, we could use nonparametric
techniques such as kernel or sieve estimators.
   Substituting the estimator of the conditional market share into the pricing equa-
tion, we obtain:
                                                                          
                    (1 − r̂sj )α               γIj             κIj
        p̃sji   =                    Vj + Ij +      (θj − b) +     (Γj − m)          (24)
                  1 + (1 − r̂sj )α             ωθj             ωΓj
                         1                         
                +                    y − L + Asj (y) + vji
                  1 + (1 − r̂js )α

where vji is the measurement error term. We can, therefore, identify and estimate α,
the ratios γ/ω and κ/ω, as well as the marginal costs V1 , ..., VJ using a semi-parametric

                                             20
NLLS estimator based on equation (24). We use a bootstrap algorithm to estimate
the standard errors to account for the sequential nature of the estimation procedure.
    All the empirical results reported on this paper are based on this estimator. One
nice property of this estimator is that it is consistent for large N , but small J. This
scenario is relevant for most practical applications.
    For certain applications, knowledge of the level of ω, γ, and κ is useful. Appendix
B of this paper discusses how to identify and estimate the levels of these parameters
using a semi-parametric estimator that extends the estimators suggested Berry (1994)
and Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (1995).



5     Parameter Estimates
Table 4 summarizes the parameter estimates for our model. Note that these estimates
are based on the subsample of students at private universities that received a positive
amount of institutional financial aid. The relevant sample size is 2,270. Note that
we only need the other students to construct the correct measures of the conditional
market shares which then enter into the pricing equation. We estimate three types
of model specifications. The first two specifications ignore minority status while the
third specification – which is our preferred specification – also accounts for minority
status. Dollar amounts are measured in tens of thousands.
    The first column uses unweighted data. The second and third column uses the
weights suggested by NPSAS. Comparing the weighted estimates in Column 2 with
the unweighted estimates in Column 1, we find only small differences in the estimated
parameter values. The main difference is that the unweighted estimator yields a
somewhat greater point estimate of α. The estimates in Column 2 are similar to the
ones in Column 3.
    Focusing on our preferred estimates in Column 3 we obtain an estimate of α which
is equal to 72.72 with an estimated standard error of 7.13. As a consequence we find


                                          21
that our estimate is highly significant at standard levels of significance. Note that α
is primarily identified from the observed pricing by income.

  Next consider the ratio of   ω
                                 .   Our point estimate equals 0.079 with an estimated
standard error of 0.012. This ratio is primarily identified off the observed merit based
aid. We conclude that both key parameters are estimated with high precision. The
quantitative implications of these estimates are discussed below.

                                            22
                                          κ
    Our point estimate for the ratio of   ω
                                              is 0.012 with a standard error of 0.003. This
ratio is primarily identified off the observed institutional aid to minority students
holding income and ability fixed. The average predicted marginal effect of being
a minority student in our model is a $900 discount. We conclude that our model
provides strong evidence that private schools care about racial diversity.
    We can also estimate the marginal resource costs of admitting an additional student
to the college. Not surprisingly, we find that there is much heterogeneity in marginal
costs. Our estimates range between approximately $5,400 and $16,600. Note that
these estimates combine marginal expenditures on educational inputs and marginal
custodial costs.
    We conclude that our estimator performs well and provides reasonable estimates
for the key parameters. Next we explore the implications of our model estimates for
price discrimination and market power in the market of higher education.



6     Price Discrimination in U.S. Higher Education
Table 5 reports the average derivatives of price in ability and in income implied by
our model and compares these predictions to simple reduced form OLS estimates
with fixed cluster effects. It is instructive to compare these estimates, which embody
the structural properties of our model, to OLS estimates that simply assume linear
pricing. Overall, we find that our model captures well the basic regularities in the
data revealed by OLS. Of course, the payoff from our model is that we can assess the
role of local market power and nonlinearities in the patterns of pricing by income and
ability that are observed in the data.
    To gain some additional insights into the predicted magnitude of pricing by income
and ability as well as the extent of market power, it useful to decompose the prices
paid by students into the different components. For students not paying the posted

price, the marginal effect of ability on price is approximately given by:

                         ∂psj (m, b, y)      (1 − rsj )α γIj

The marginal effect of income on price is approximately:

                            ∂psj (m, b, y)          1
                                           ≈                                      (26)

We compute the ”mark-up” as the difference between price and effective marginal
cost:
                 mark-upj (s, m, b, y) = psj (m, b, y) − EM Cj (m, b).            (27)

Computing the mark-up over EM C, rather than the more standard mark-up over
marginal resource cost, is to capture market power by purging the discounts to ability
and minority status that reflect externalities.
   Table 6 shows the value of the average mark-up and the marginal pricing by ability
and income terms for each cluster (i.e., each column). Average mark-ups rise rapidly
along the quality hierarchy, ranging above $13,000 for elite colleges. Our estimates
imply little difference in average pricing by income. The average effects range between

$210 and $510 for an increase of $10,000 in family income among the 10 clusters.
However, our estimates imply much more variation in pricing by ability and in the
mark-ups. Average pricing by ability ranges between $920 to $1960 (for an increase in
one standard deviation in ability). The largest discounts for minority status occur at
the four highest ability schools, with discounts ranging from $1,600 to $5,750. Overall
average mark-ups range between 3.5% and 35.5%. We thus conclude that the most
selective colleges have significant market power.
  The average estimates mask price discrimination within colleges, which is more
substantial. To illustrate the magnitude of these effects, we focus on Clusters 1 and
2, which include the most selective colleges. Table 7 reports “local” market shares for
non-minority students at the two most selective private colleges, with these market
shares conditional on deciles for income and ability.24 Because colleges value student
ability and price discriminate according to income and ability, the equilibrium exercise
of market power will vary with student characteristics. The conditional market shares
for high ability and high income students in these clusters are much larger than the
overall unconditional market share, which is equal to 0.08. As a consequence the

      We use deciles, though localness can be defined using a finer or broader delineation.

college has significantly larger local market power than is suggested by its overall
market share.
   The panels of Table 8 report predicted mark-ups by income and ability for majority
students in Clusters 1 and 2. The values in the upper panel are the predicted mark-
ups over EM C for a student at the midpoint of the cell, averaged over clusters 1 and
2, the cells delineated by quintiles in these colleges calculated using our estimated ad-
mission thresholds.25 We see that these mark-ups increase precipitously with income,
especially as students become relatively wealthy. A combination of higher willingness
to pay as income rises and increasing market power of top tier colleges over richer
students explains the latter. The mark-ups to the richest students of relatively low
ability are very high, about $18,000. For given income, mark-ups vary little with
  25
     We use the estimated admission thresholds to calculate the minimum ability, the bottom value of
the lowest ability quintile. Then we use the data for students above this minimum ability attending
all colleges to compute ability quintile thresholds and income quintile thresholds, thus delineating
the cells. The “midpoint” of each cell is the midpoint within the cell of ability and income. We
have also calculated these tables using the predicted tuitions among the students in the data that
attend clusters 1 and 2, with very similar results and available on request. The entries left blank in
the table are because the number of students that actually attend within the cell, and thus used in
estimation, are so low that the predictions are not credible.

ability, except for the richest quintile where they fall substantially as ability increases
(see the rightmost column). This reflects more competition for and thus less market
power over high ability students that have enough income to be willing to pay for
expensive colleges.
   The lower panel calculates the more traditional mark-ups over marginal resource
costs. That tuition is higher for low ability students and lower for high ability students
is not purged in this version of the mark-up, and these mark-ups are then higher
(lower) for low (high) ability students than in the upper panel. For high ability
students without much income, these mark ups are negative, implying fellowships.
Overall, we see that mark-ups and market power vary widely with student type.

   We thus conclude that the most selective colleges have significant market power
and charge significant mark-ups to students, especially for higher income, majority
students.

7     Conclusions
We have developed a new semi-parametric estimator for a model that explains price
discrimination and market power in the U.S. market for higher education. We have
implemented our new estimator using data from the NPSAS. We obtain reasonable
estimates for all of the key parameters. Our empirical findings suggest that the ma-
jority of private colleges in the U.S. engage in pricing by income, ability, and minority
status. A $10,000 increase in family income increases tuition at private schools by
an average of $210 to $510. A one standard deviation increase in ability decreases
tuition by approximately $920 to $1,960 depending on the selectivity of the college.
There are large and substantial discounts for minority students which range between
approximately $110 (at historically black colleges) and $5,750 dollars. Average mark-
ups in colleges range between 3.5 and 33.5 percent, but vary substantially within
colleges and are very large for high income students. There is much more hetero-
geneity in mark-ups within colleges than among colleges. Our analysis suggests that
highly selective colleges have significant market power, especially for high income,
high ability, non-minority students.
    We view the results of this paper as promising for future research. One might add
private and state colleges with alternative objectives, perhaps focused on serving a
segment of the population. Making endogenous state college pricing is of interest, a
challenge being modeling public policy choice. Consideration of foreign students is of
interest. In practice, there are small differences among the colleges within a cluster
and colleges may engage in some limited competition for students that our model fails
to capture.
    One drawback of our modeling approach is that we do not allow for random coef-
ficients in our utility specification. We do this primarily because of data limitations.
It it is well know that it is rather difficult to identify the parameters of these dis-
tributions in a single cross-section without having access to second choice data as
discussed in detail in Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes (2004). We also do not observe

                                           28
large changes in the choice set over time. One could potentially use information of
students that transferred between private and public schools to address these issues.
Alternatively, it would be helpful to know the full portfolio of colleges that a students
chooses at the application stage.
  Finally, it would be useful to estimate a more comprehensive demand model that
accounts for even more differentiation in the choice set. Estimating a model with a
sufficiently large number of elements in the choice set would then allow researchers
to implement the second stage of the estimator discussed in Appendix B and obtain
reliable estimates for the remaining parameters of the model.

A      Construction of the Ability Measure and Abil-
       ity Thresholds
We measure ability by predicting students’ first-semester GPA as a function of their
high school GPA, ACT score (or SAT score converted to ACT score), gender, major,
and college choice.
   The predicted GPA for student i at school j in discipline d is given by:


GP Aijd = β0 +β1 HSGP Ai +β2 ACTi +β3 HSGP Ai ∗ACTi +β4 f emalei +βj +βd +ijd
                                                                                              (28)
where βj represents a college fixed effect and βd represents a major fixed effect (12 ma-
jors, humanities omitted). Using a sample of approximately 5,000 white students at
4-year public or private universities, we obtain the following prediction (for a generic
discipline at a generic school as these fixed effects and the intercept are dropped):


GP
\  Ai = −3.184HSGP Ai + −2.559ACTi + 0.918HSGP Ai ∗ ACTi + 21.961f emalei
                                                                                              (29)
The R2 for the estimated model (including fixed effects) is 0.9342. After clustering,
we then standardize the ability measure to have standard deviation 1 and mean 0.415,
such that all schools have θj ≥ 0.
   There are no explicit ability admission thresholds in the data. We estimate these
thresholds using all students except a small number of “legacy students” at some of
the most selective universities.26 We construct these by taking the first percentile
predicted GPA at any public college with at least ten non-minority students (as our
model implies different admission thresholds for minority students), and applying
  26
    Legacy students are believed to contribute additional value to the school (perhaps through
alumni donations), and thus are subject to different admission criteria. Due to this unobserved
characteristic, they have a lower net marginal cost for the school and may be admitted despite
lower ability. Legacy students are identified off the empirical CDF of ability within a school–they
precede the lowest flat region in the CDF. In support of our hypothesis, such students tend to be
non-minority students with high family income.


                                                34
the minimum within cluster as the cluster admission threshold. Any students below
this threshold presumably have characteristics desirable to a college, and so these
students are “bumped up”to the threshold predicted GPA. This new measure is used
in admission and tuition estimation for all colleges. We considered other approaches
to construct these admission thresholds, and found that the main results reported in
this paper are not sensitive to the specifics discussed above.



B      Identification and Estimation of the Remaining
       Parameters of the Model
For certain applications, knowledge of the level of ω, γ, and κ is useful. This section
discusses how to identify and estimate the levels of these parameters using a modified
version of the estimator suggested by Berry (1994).
    Two additional challenges to estimation are present that are typically not encoun-
tered in standard demand analysis. First, the potential choice set of a student is
unobserved by the econometrician. Our model implies, however, that both private
and public schools use minimum-ability threshold rules to determine admission func-
tions. These arise because both private and public colleges face binding price maxima
that lead to minimum ability admission thresholds. We observe attendance in equilib-
rium and as a consequence can estimate minimum admission thresholds using order
statistics. This allows us to characterize the relevant choice set for each student in
the sample.
    Second, private colleges engage in third-degree price discrimination. Hence insti-
tutional aid and net tuition policies of all private colleges are functions of income and
ability as long as the price maximum is not binding. A key challenge encountered in
estimation is that the institutional aid is only observed at the college that is attended
in equilibrium. The econometrician does not observe the financial aid packages and,
hence the net tuition, that were offered by the colleges that also admitted the stu-


                                           35
dent, but were ultimately rejected by the student. As a consequence, we cannot
directly evaluate the conditional choice probabilities for each student. However, we
can consistently estimate the institutional aid functions of each college type using
nonparametric techniques such as kernel or sieve estimators. Given these consistent
estimators we then can compute the conditional choice probabilities of each student.
  Consider the full sample of all students, including those students that attend pri-
vate colleges and that pay the posted price as well as students attending public colleges
and universities.
  We can construct the minimum ability threshold for each college, by computing
the minimum ability of the students. Let our estimator be denoted by bmin
                                                                      jm . We can

then identify the choice set for all students as follows:


 Ja (m, s, b) = {s|b ≥ bmin                      min                 min
                        sm } ∪ {o ∈ S \ {s}|b ≥ bom } ∪ {j ∈ P |b ≥ bjm } ∪ {0} (30)



The first and second sets are, respectively, the in-state public colleges and the out-of
state public colleges admitting the student. The third set denotes the set of all private
colleges to which the student is admitted, and the last set is the outside option.
  We then non-parametrically estimate the prices for each student at each college to
which the student was admitted based on the observed tuition levels, using a local
smoothing quadratic polynomial that uses a bin width of half of all points for each
local estimation. Let us denote these estimates by p̂np
                                                     sji .

  For private colleges, we use a local polynomial smoothing estimator to estimate
the tuition function. The polynomial constructs a non-parametric estimate of tuition
based on ability and income, and interpolates only where the observed data span.
That is, if we observe an individual with a similar ability and income attending the
college with a given tuition, the LOESS estimator calculates a polynomial relationship
among tuition, ability, and income within the relevant bandwidth and predicts tu-
ition locally. However, the resulting admission set–where a tuition can be predicted–is
really a combination of admission and matriculation. Thus, many lower quality col-

                                           36
leges would appear to reject high-quality applicants, because no such applicants are
observed at the college. Hence we assume that if a college accepts an individual with
ability bmin , it accepts all individuals where bi ≥ bmin . Then, we extrapolate the
local polynomial to such individuals to ensure all admitted individuals have a valid
first-stage tuition offer.
   Substituting the nonparametric estimates of the tuitions into the conditional choice
probabilities, we obtain

                                       [(yi − p̂np   sji − L + Asi ,j (yi ))qj ]
                                                                                 α
                       r̂ji   = P                             np                      α
                                                                                          (31)
                                  k∈Ja (mi ,si ,bi ) [(yi − p̂ski − L + Ask (yi ))qk ]


The quality levels for each school are determined by the fixed point of the following
mapping:
                          q̃j = qj + ln(sN
                                         j ) − ln(sj (q))         j = 1, ..., J − 1       (32)

where: qj is initial guess of the quality, sN
                                            j is the average empirical market share of

college j observed in the data, and sj (q) is the predicted average market share using
the initial guess about the vector of qualities:

                                                         n
                                                      1 X
                                             sj (q) =       r̂ji                          (33)
                                                      N i=1

We can identify qj ’s for each college, subject to a normalization such as q1 = 1. The
normalization of quality is necessary since market shares add up to one.
   Using the fact that qj = θjγ Ijω Γκj euj we obtain the the following regression model:

                  γ               κ                    γ         κ                 
ln(qj /q1 ) = ω        ln(θj ) +     ln(Γj ) + ln(Ij ) − ln(θ1 ) − ln(Γ1 ) − ln(I1 ) + uj − u1
                   ω               ω                    ω         ω
                                                                                          (34)
Define

                   γ          κ                   γ         κ
           wj =      ln(θj ) + ln(Γj ) + ln(Ij ) − ln(θ1 ) − ln(Γ1 ) − ln(I1 )            (35)
                   ω          ω                   ω         ω


                                                       37
and note that wj is known at this point. Rewriting equation (34) as


                            ln(qj /q1 ) = ω wj + uj − u1                        (36)


and hence ω can be estimated using a simple ratio estimator. This estimator is
consistent despite the fact that wj and uj − u1 may not be independent because the
regression above does not have an intercept. Note that the last step of the estimator
requires a large number of colleges or preferably multiple markets.
  When we implement the last two stages of our estimator, we obtain point estimates
for ω that range between 0.027 and 0.033. Unfortunately, our sample size is too small
(J = 15) to obtain precise estimates.
