                                              ABSTRACT

In response to the dramatic rise in childhood obesity, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and other
organizations have advocated increasing the time that elementary school children spend in physical
education (PE) classes. However, little is known about the effect of PE on child weight. This paper
measures that effect by instrumenting for child PE time with state policies, using data from the Early
Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K) for 1998-2004. Results from IV models
indicate that PE lowers BMI z-score and reduces the probability of obesity among 5th graders (in particular,
boys), while the instrument is insufficiently powerful to reliably estimate effects for younger children.
This represents some of the first evidence of a causal effect of PE on youth obesity, and thus offers
at least some support to the assumptions behind the CDC recommendations. We find no evidence
that increased PE time crowds out time in academic courses or has spillovers to achievement test scores.

Introduction

         The prevalence of obesity among elementary schoolchildren in the United States nearly

quadrupled between 1965 and 2000 (Ogden et al., 2002).2 As of 2009-2010, 32.6% of American

youths aged 6-11 years are overweight, and 18.0% are obese (Ogden et al., 2012). The U.S.

Surgeon General has declared childhood obesity to be an “epidemic” with significant adverse

health consequences, including vascular disease and Type 2 diabetes (U.S. D.H.H.S., 2010), that

significantly raise health care costs for youth (Trasande and Chatterjee, 2009; Trasande, Liu,

Fryer et al., 2009).

         The U.S. Surgeon General attributes the rise in childhood obesity, in part, to school

cutbacks in physical education (PE) and urges all school systems to mandate daily PE that totals

at least 150 minutes per week for elementary schoolchildren (U.S. D.H.H.S., 2010). Other

organizations concur, including the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), Centers for Disease

Control and Prevention (CDC), Institute of Medicine (IOM), and National Association of State

Boards of Education (NASBE) (see, e.g., IOM, 2012; AAP, 2006). However, as of 2006, only

3.8% of elementary schools were in compliance with the recommendation of 150 minutes of PE

per week (Lee et al., 2007).

         Despite the recommendations of the Surgeon General, CDC, and others, there is little

evidence of a causal effect of PE on youth obesity. There are several reasons that additional PE

may not lower weight or the risk of obesity. First, PE classes may not involve much physical

activity. Several studies have used direct observation or accelerometers to measure the amount

of time that students spend physically active during PE; they conclude that elementary

schoolchildren spend only 9-42% of PE time engaged in moderate to vigorous physical activity

2
 For children, overweight is defined as a body mass index (BMI) above the historic 85th percentile of the BMI
distribution for youth of the same age and gender, and obesity is defined as a BMI above the historic 95th percentile
(Barlow et al., 2007). BMI is calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared.

                                                          2
(Pate et al., 2011). A second issue is that students may offset any additional physical activity

during PE by decreasing physical activity outside of school, with little net impact on physical

activity or weight.

        This paper contributes to the literature by estimating the causal effect of PE time on the

weight of elementary schoolchildren. A large number of studies have reported the correlation of

PE with student weight (see Pate et al., 2011, for a review). However, the correlation may be a

badly biased estimate of the causal effect for several reasons. First, if enrollment is optional then

there may be selection bias; physically fit students may be more likely to enroll. Second, the

amount of required PE and enrollment in PE in a school may be correlated with the area’s

socioeconomic status (SES); e.g. higher-SES schools may require more PE, or may offer more or

better PE courses, and may also have more physically fit students because of their higher SES.

Alternatively, higher-SES schools may devote more time to academic subjects and less to PE.

        A small number of studies estimate the causal effect of PE on youth weight.3 Cawley,

Meyerhoefer, and Newhouse (2007) estimate the effect of PE time on the physical activity and

weight of high school students, using variation in PE requirements across states as an instrument.

Their IV models indicate that PE increases self-reported physical activity but has no detectable

effect on the weight of high school students. Datar and Sturm (2004) study the effect of the

increase in PE that results from progression from kindergarten to first grade, and find that an

additional hour of PE time per week is associated with lower BMI in overweight or obese girls,

but results in no change in BMI for healthy weight girls or for boys.

        This paper examines the effect of PE on elementary schoolchildren (specifically, those in

kindergarten through fifth grade). We analyze data from the Early Childhood Longitudinal

3
 There are also studies that involved randomized experiments of innovative PE curricula (for reviews, see Katz,
2009; Brown and Summerbell, 2008), but these studies are not informative about the effect of PE as it currently
exists.

Study, Kindergarten Cohort (ECLS-K). Our methods for identifying causal effects are described

in the next section.



Methods and Data

        The objective of this paper is to measure the causal effect of PE time on the weight of

elementary schoolchildren. If PE time was randomly assigned, then one could regress child

weight W on time spent in PE (PE), controlling for a vector of relevant observables X:

                                                         ′

and interpret the coefficient on PE time, β, as the causal impact of PE on weight.

        However, PE time is not randomly assigned. Physically fit students may be more likely

to choose PE, and the PE requirements and offerings of individual schools may be correlated

with local SES. As a result, the error term ε is likely correlated with the regressor of interest PE,

and thus an OLS estimate of the coefficient of interest β is likely biased.

        In order to measure the causal impact of PE on weight, one needs to find a natural

experiment that creates exogenous variation in PE time without directly affecting student weight

(i.e. the instrument should be highly correlated with PE but uncorrelated with ε). The natural

experiment that we exploit is variation across states and over time in state requirements for PE

for elementary schoolchildren. Using these state policies as instruments, we estimate models of

instrumental variables in order to measure the causal effect of PE time on child weight. We

cluster standard errors at the state level in all of our models because the instrument varies at the

state level.



Data: State PE Policies



                                                  4
         Our source for state policies regarding elementary school PE by year is the LexisNexis

database of state statutes. These laws were cross-referenced with the Shape of the Nation Reports

in 1993, 2001, and 2006, the Trust for America’s Health (TFAH) annual reports that began in

2004, and the State School Health Policy database maintained by the National Association of

State Boards of Education; we used these sources to determine when PE was first mandated if

historical statues were unavailable in LexisNexis.4

         There is significant variation across states in how the legislated mandates are written.

For example, some states only require that PE be offered, but do not require that students enroll

in it. States also differ in whether they recommend or require a minimum number of minutes per

week that students spend in PE; some states specify both a recommended and required number of

minutes. The instrument we use is the required number of minutes of PE per week.5 See

Appendix Table 1 for details of the relevant laws by state.



Data: Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K)

         The Early Childhood Longitudinal Study, Kindergarten Class of 1998-99 (ECLS-K) is a

nationally representative survey of children entering kindergarten in the 1998-99 school year

conducted by the National Center for Educational Statistics of the U.S. Department of Education

(Institute of Education Sciences, 2009).6 The data were collected on children entering full day

and part day kindergarten in either a public or private school. The ECLS-K collected

information from children, their parents, their teachers and their schools, using a variety of


4
  The District of Columbia is excluded from this analysis because its statute wasn’t available on LexisNexis and the
Shape of the Nation and TFAH reports were inconsistent.
5
  The results reported below are robust to including as an additional instrument whether a state has a mandate at all
(which may not involve a minimum number of minutes), whether the students are required to take PE (as opposed to
schools only being required to offer PE), or the number of recommended minutes.
6
  The ECLS-K includes respondents from 41 of the 50 states. The states not included are: Arkansas, Idaho,
Montana, Nevada, New Hampshire, North Dakota, South Carolina, Vermont, and West Virginia.

                                                         5
methods. Trained assessors interviewed children in schools and measured their weight and

height. Parents were surveyed by a trained interviewer over the phone, and teachers and school

administrators completed paper and pencil surveys. For more information on the ECLS-K, see

the User’s Manual (Tourangeau et al., 2009).

       Data were collected during the fall and spring of kindergarten (1998-99), fall and spring

of first grade (1999-2000), the spring of third grade (2002), the spring of fifth grade (2004), and

the spring of eighth grade (2007), but not all of those waves are useful for this analysis. The fall

kindergarten wave does not include information on the child’s PE participation, so we use that

wave only to extract certain time-invariant characteristics of children, such as their race and

ethnicity. The wave from the fall of 1st grade included only a 30% sub-sample of the original

kindergarten cohort, so this wave is excluded from our analysis. We also exclude the 8th grade

wave because it did not record minutes of PE time.

       We limit the sample to students attending public school because our identification

strategy uses state requirements for PE as instruments, and these requirements apply only to

public schools. We also limit the sample to students with non-missing values for state of

residence and time spent in PE.

       The body weight outcomes of interest (W in the model above) are: BMI z-score, an

indicator for whether the child was obese (BMI ≥ 95th percentile of the age-gender specific BMI

distribution), an indicator for whether the child was either overweight or obese (BMI ≥ 85th

percentile of the age-gender specific BMI distribution), and the child's weight-for-age z-score.

All z-scores and weight classifications are computed using the year 2000 release of the CDC

Growth Charts (U.S. D.H.H.S, 2002); the z-scores measure the difference in standard deviation

units between a given child's weight and the mean of the historic reference population. All of the



                                                 6
weight variables are calculated using the measured weight and height recorded by the trained

assessor during the school visit with the child.

        The ECLS-K data also contain various measures of physical activity. In particular,

parents are asked the number of days per week that their children exercise vigorously for 20

minutes or more, whether they are more or less active than other children of the same age, and

whether they received regular exercise through various activities during the past 12 months.

Information on relative physical activity was collected for structured activities at school, such as

team sports, activities during the child’s free time, and aerobic activities during which the child

sweats and experiences increased heart rate. We created indicator variables for whether parents

perceived their children to be more physically active than others for each of these three

categories. We also created indicator variables for whether parents reported that their children

received regular exercise during the past 12 months through the following activities: group

sports, individual sports, recreational sports, general exercise, dance, karate, playground

activities, and other sports.

        The ECLS-K also asks parents how much time their children spend watching TV on

school days as well as weekend days, which we use as a proxy for sedentary activities. We

combined reported levels of TV watching on weekdays and weekend days to create a measure of

total TV minutes per week.

        Because of the age of the children, they were not considered to be reliable sources of

information on their number of minutes of PE per week, so the ECLS-K collected the

information from the best informed party: the student’s teacher. Teachers reported the number

of days per week that the student had PE class (the options are: never, less than once, 1-2 times,

3-4 time, or every day) and the minutes per day (the options are: 0, 1-15, 16-30, 31-60, or more



                                                   7
than 60). We created one measure of days of PE instruction using the midpoint of the intervals

and a second measure using the upper limit of the intervals. Likewise, we computed two

measures of PE minutes per day; one using the midpoint of the intervals, using 75 minutes for

the highest category, and one using the upper limit of the intervals, using 90 minutes for the

highest category. We then generated three measures of how many minutes per week each child

spent in PE by multiplying the following variables together: (1) midpoint for PE days/wk and the

midpoint for PE minutes/day; (2) midpoint for PE days/wk and the maximum for PE

minutes/day, and (3) maximum for PE days/wk and the maximum for PE minutes/day. All of the

measures generated similar results in our empirical models, so we report the measure (2) because

we think that daily instructional times are much more likely to correspond to the upper interval

numbers, while the number of days per week of PE is likely to be uniformly distributed within

the reported interval. Using the maximum values of PE minutes per day is conservative (i.e. we

are potentially assuming children spent more time in PE than they actually did, so our impacts of

PE times on outcomes should be attenuated).

         In the waves for kindergarten through third grade, one teacher was asked to provide this

information. However, in the fifth grade wave two teachers (reading and math) were asked to

provide this information; in this case we use the average response across the two teachers.7

         Because PE time is reported by teachers, and is furthermore reported in categories, there

is likely measurement error in PE time that, without adjustment, biases estimates of the

coefficient on PE time. An advantage of the method of IV is that, in addition to addressing the

endogeneity of PE time, it reduces the bias from measurement error in the endogenous regressor;

see Bound et al. (2002).

 Both teachers give similar estimates of time the child spends in PE; the mean (standard deviation) of reported
weekly PE time is 100 (70) by the reading teacher and 101 (70) by the math/science teacher.

                                                         8
       The set of control variables (X in the model above) includes: child age, gender,

race/ethnicity (White, Black, Hispanic, Other), birth weight, population density of residence

(Urban Suburban, Rural), family income, family size, and the years of education of the most

educated person in the family. Our models also include controls for grade, public school type

(Charter school, Magnet school, Special education school, Bureau of Indian Affairs school, or

Early childhood center), and the percentage of students at the school eligible for a free or

reduced price lunch.

       Policy endogeneity is a concern whenever policies are used as instruments (see, e.g.,

Cawley and Ruhm, 2012). That is, wealthier or more progressive states may pass higher

standards in education, as well as have populations in better health for a variety of reasons. To

address this possibility, we control for state characteristics related to income, education and

health; specifically: real per capita income, the percentage of adults in the state with a bachelor's

degree or higher, the state percentage of overweight and obese girls and boys, the state

percentage of overweight adults, the average public school pupil-to-teacher ratio, real total state

tax revenues per student, and real state instructional expenditures per teacher. Per capita income

and adult education were obtained from the U.S. Census Bureau; the percentage of obese and

overweight children was obtained from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; and the

other variables were obtained from the U.S. Department of Education. Additionally, from the

U.S. Department of Agriculture we obtained state participation per student in the National

School Lunch Program (NSLP), School Breakfast Program (SBP), and Summer Food Services

Program (SFSP). We use these measures to control for poverty, the quality of school meals, and

access to food assistance.

Empirical Results

Summary Statistics and Descriptives

       Table 1 lists summary statistics for the ECLS-K variables used in the analysis. The

average number of minutes per week spent in PE rises from 76 minutes in kindergarten to 87

minutes in 1st grade, 91 minutes in 3rd grade, and 104 minutes in 5th grade. During elementary

school, the prevalence of overweight rises from 26.1% in kindergarten to 40.5% in fifth grade,

and over the same period the prevalence of obesity roughly doubles from 11.8% to 22.4%.

       Appendix Table 1 describes the PE requirements for elementary schools that prevailed in

each state during each wave of the ECLS-K. Table 2 shows the change over time in state PE

mandates. Between the ECLS kindergarten wave (1999) and the 5th grade wave (2004), the

number of states that did not mandate PE for elementary schoolchildren fell from 21 to 13, and

the number of states that required a specific number of minutes per week of PE for elementary

schoolchildren rose from 2 to 11. The increase in the number of states with PE mandates

between the kindergarten wave in 1999 and the first grade wave in 2000 is due to the fact that

many states require PE of 1st graders but not kindergarteners (i.e. it is due to grade progression;

no states changed PE requirements for first graders between 1999 and 2000). In contrast, the

increase in the number of states with PE mandates between the first grade wave in 2000 and the

fifth grade wave in 2004 is due to states enacting new PE mandates.

       Figure 1 depicts the requirements as of 2004, the timing of the 5th grade wave of the

ECLS-K. In 2004, eleven states mandated a specific number of minutes of PE per week, and

these states ranged from relatively liberal and high-SES states such as California, New York, and

New Jersey, to relatively conservative and low-SES states such as Alabama, Mississippi, and




                                                 10
Arkansas. In addition, 26 states mandated PE without specifying a minimum number of minutes,

and 13 states did not mandate PE for elementary schoolchildren.

       Table 3 lists the percent of ECLS-K students who were subject to a mandated number of

minutes in PE. In kindergarten, only 6% of the sample was subject to a PE mandate with a

minimum required number of minutes. That jumped to 26% in 1st grade, remained roughly

constant at 27% in 3rd grade, and jumped to 38% in 5th grade.



The impact of state policies on PE time (1st stage of IV)

       The first stage of our IV method uses the state mandated number of PE minutes per week

as an instrument for the number of minutes per week the child spends in PE. A reasonable

question to ask is whether schools comply with these state mandates. For example, a study by

the New York State government found that students in grades K through 3 received only 72% of

the PE class time, and students in grades 4 and 5 received only 77% of the PE class time, that

New York State required (Office of the New York State Comptroller, 2008). In general, the

Institute of Medicine (IOM) has concluded that there is insufficient enforcement of state PE

standards (IOM, 2006).

       We calculated estimates of student compliance. Across all waves of the ECLS-K, only

34% of students in states with a mandated number of minutes were in PE for the required

number of minutes. Compliance varies with grade and year, from 17% in kindergarten to 31% in

1st and 3rd grades to 45% in 5th grade. Less than perfect compliance by schools reduces the

power of state mandates to affect individual student PE time.

       The first stage of our IV model is reported in Table 4. The first stage is calculated for all

waves pooled (column 1) as well as for each wave separately (subsequent columns). The results



                                                11
of the first column indicate that the instrument (number of required minutes) is a significant

predictor of individual student PE time in the pooled sample. However, the subsequent columns

reveal that this correlation is driven solely by the 5th grade wave. Not only is the instrument only

statistically significant in the 5th grade wave, but the point estimate of the coefficient is several

times larger in that wave than any other. Moreover, only in the 5th grade wave does the F

statistic associated with the instrument exceed 10, the conventional minimum standard for the

power of a continuous instrument (Stock, Wright, and Yogo, 2002). Specifically, the F statistic

in the 5th grade wave is 21.7.

        The point estimate of the coefficient on the instrument indicates that a state mandate of

an additional 100 minutes of PE per week translates into an actual increase in PE time of only 13

minutes for kindergarteners, 2 minutes for first-graders, 4 minutes for third-graders, and 40

minutes for 5th graders.

        The statistical significance of the instrument in the 5th grade wave, as opposed to any

other, is driven by increases in state-mandated PE time between 2002 (the 3rd grade wave) and

2004 (the 5th grade wave). The average number of minutes per week spent in PE in states with a

minute requirement was 89 in 2002, but that rose to 127 in 2004. This increase is the result of

both new states adopting minutes requirements (that were substantial) between 2002 and 2004,

and increases in PE time among states that had enacted minutes requirements earlier (in

particular, those that adopted them prior to 2000).



The effect of PE time on child weight (2nd stage of IV)

        Table 5 presents results of the second stage of IV, and (for the sake of comparison),

results from OLS regressions. We continue to present results for the pooled sample, as well as



                                                  12
for each wave individually, and we focus in particular on the results for the 5th grade wave, given

that the instrument is sufficiently powerful only in that wave.

       In the 5th grade wave, the IV coefficient on PE minutes is negative and statistically

significant at the 1% level. The point estimate implies that an additional 50 minutes per week in

PE (roughly what is needed to bring the mean up to the minimum amount recommended by the

AAP and CDC) would lower BMI z-score by 8 percent of a standard deviation, or 12 percent of

the mean BMI z-score in the sample. The negative sign of the IV coefficient in the 5th grade

wave (final column) is consistent with the sign of the corresponding OLS coefficient (second-to-

last column), although the IV point estimate is greater in absolute magnitude than that from OLS;

this difference may be due to IV correcting for measurement error in PE time, or may be a result

of the OLS estimate being biased by selection or omitted variables.

       We report the results of IV models for other weight outcomes in Table 6. These

estimates are based on the 5th grade wave only, because it is only in that wave that the instrument

is sufficiently powerful. The IV models indicate that PE reduces the probability of overweight,

obesity, and the weight z-score; in each case the IV coefficient is statistically significant at the

1% level. The point estimate implies that an additional 50 minutes per week in PE (roughly

enough to raise the mean to the amount recommended by the AAP and CDC) reduces the

probability of youth obesity by 4 percentage points, which is 18 percent of the baseline

prevalence.

       In summary, for each of the four measures of weight (BMI z-score, weight z-score,

overweight, obese), the IV model consistently finds that PE time reduces child weight.

       We also investigate mechanisms, and the possibility of offsetting behavior, in Table 7.

There, we report the results of IV models of PE time on various measures of overall physical



                                                  13
activity, as reported by the parent. The IV results, presented in Table 2, suggest that additional

PE leads to greater overall participation in structured physical activity and more physical activity

overall. There may also be some crowd-out, however, as the IV models also indicate that

additional PE time reduces the probability of participation in dance and in playground activities.

For the remaining activities (including days per week of vigorous exercise, participation in other

specific physical activities and TV minutes per week) we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no

effect of PE.



Falsification Tests:

       When using policies as instruments, one must be wary of policy endogeneity (e.g.

Cawley and Ruhm, 2012). Because we are concerned that states which enact or raise PE minute

mandates may differ in important ways from those which do not, we control in our models for a

wide variety of state characteristics relating to income, health, and education. Consistent with a

lack of policy endogeneity, no state characteristics are statistically significant at the 5 percent

level (and only one of 12 is significant at the 10 percent level) in regressions of the required

number of PE minutes on the set of state characteristics in 2004, which is the year of 5th grade

wave of the ECLS-K. Likewise, no state characteristics in 2002 are significantly associated with

the change in required number of PE minutes between 2002 and 2004. However, it is possible

that even controlling for these observed characteristics, there may remain a problem of policy

endogeneity that would imply our instrument is invalid and the IV estimates are biased.

       To investigate this possibility we conduct several falsification tests. Specifically, we

estimate our IV model for the following weight-related outcomes: birth weight, BMI in the fall

semester of kindergarten, and height z-score. These are not plausibly affected by PE in



                                                  14
elementary school, so a correlation with PE time would imply that our instrument is invalid.

Results of the falsification test are shown in Table 8. In no case does the IV model suggest that

PE time affects any of these three outcomes; none of the IV coefficients comes close to being

statistically significant.8 These results should be interpreted cautiously; a failure to reject the

null hypothesis does not prove the null. However, the falsification tests yield no evidence of

policy endogeneity and are consistent with our identifying assumptions.



Extension: Crowd-Out of Academic Class Time, Spillovers to Academic Achievement

         As an extension, we test whether there are unintended consequences of mandating

additional PE time, specifically whether a higher number of mandated minutes crowds out time

in academic classes, or has spillover effects on academic test scores.

         To test for crowd-out, we estimate the same IV model as earlier, except that the

dependent variable is the number of minutes in specific academic classes, such as reading,

writing, math, social studies, science, and foreign languages. We also examine time spent in

enrichment classes, such as music and art, as well as in lunch and recess.9

         The results of these models are presented in Table 9. The IV results, in the center

column, indicate that increased PE time does not lead to a significant crowd-out of time in any

academic class. The only significant decrease in class time is for music; a one-minute increase

in PE time is associated with a 0.2 minute decrease in music class. Instead of schools cutting

academic classes when PE mandates are increased, they seem to increase the length of the school


8
  Consistent with the estimates in Table 8, the main results are robust to controlling for fall kindergarten BMI z-
score.
9
  As described in the appendix, of the 11 states with a minimum required number of minutes for 5th grade in 2004,
only Texas requires physical activity more generally, which may include recess in addition to PE. The results in
Table 9 show that state PE requirements and time in PE are not associated with a change in time spent in recess.
Additionally, the main results are robust to excluding students in Texas from the sample. Thus, the results
throughout the paper reflect the impact of PE, as opposed to physical activity more generally.

                                                         15
day. The first row of Table 9 shows that a one-minute increase in mandated PE time is

associated with a 1.6 minute increase in the length of the school day.

        Based on these findings, one would not expect raising PE mandates to lower scores on

achievement tests. On the contrary, some have argued that PE may improve achievement test

scores, as physical activity may enhance cognitive functioning (e.g. Tomporowski, 2003).

However, the results of IV models of the impact of PE on achievement test scores (presented in

Table 10) consistently yield no evidence of spillover effects of PE on achievement test scores for

reading, math, or science.



Subgroup Analyses: Differences by Gender

        We also investigate whether the relationship between additional PE time and weight

varies by gender. IV models were estimated separately by gender, and results are presented in

Table 11. The F statistics for both boys and girls exceed the conventional minimum threshold of

10 (18.2 for girls, 25.8 for boys), and the first-stage coefficients are similar for both boys and

girls (0.401 for girls, 0.395 for boys).

        The IV results in Table 11 indicate that increased PE time reduces weight only for boys;

the reduction is statistically significant for all three measures of weight (BMI z-score,

overweight, and obese). In the IV models, an additional 50 minutes of PE time reduces BMI z-

score by .15 of a standard deviation, and reduces the probability of overweight and the

probability of obesity by 6 percentage points. Although the probit models indicate that girls who

spend more time in PE are less likely to be overweight and obese, the IV coefficients are not

statistically significant, and thus it is not possible to reject the null hypothesis that additional PE

time has no effect on weight for elementary school girls.



                                                  16
Discussion

       This paper estimates IV models of the effect of PE time on child obesity. The IV models

address both endogeneity of PE time and measurement error in PE time. The results of the IV

models indicate that an additional 50 minutes per week of PE time (enough to raise the mean to

the amount recommended by the AAP and CDC) lowers BMI z-score by 12 percent of the mean,

and reduces the probability of obesity by 4 percentage points.

       Our results are limited to 5th graders (i.e. the 2004 wave of ECLS-K), because it was

around that time that a substantial amount of variation in the relevant policies occurred. First, as

noted above, there was an increase in the number of states adopting PE requirements with a

minimum number of minutes. Second, the 5th grade wave of the ECLS-K, which is the 2003-

2004 school year, was the first wave under which the formal school accountability policies

enacted under No Child Left Behind (NCLB) would have been effective. In response to

accountability pressures, schools may decrease the amount of time in PE to offer more time in

the tested subjects (Pate et al., 2006). Consistent with this possibility, Anderson, Butcher, and

Schanzenbach (2012) and Yin (2012) find that accountability policies increase childhood

obesity. Thus, state PE requirements would be more effective in increasing time spent in PE in

the 2004 wave of the ECLS-K because these requirements limited schools’ ability to strategically

respond to the accountability pressures of NCLB.

       Our subgroup analyses indicate that the effects of PE on weight in the 5th grade wave are

concentrated among boys. This may be due to factors on the supply side (boys may voluntarily

be more physically active during PE) or factors on the demand side (PE teachers may structure

different activities for boys and girls in PE, or demand more of boys in the same activities).



                                                 17
Better understanding gender differences in the impact (and curriculum) of PE is clearly a priority

for future research.

         Although we find beneficial effects of PE on weight for only certain grades (waves), and

only for boys, these results offer some of the first confirmation of an important assumption

behind the calls by the CDC, AAP, IOM, and other groups for school districts to increase

required PE time for elementary schoolchildren in order to prevent obesity.

         More generally, this study represents a response to the call of the IOM to evaluate the

effects of policies and programs and thereby increase the knowledge base regarding what works

to prevent childhood obesity (IOM, 2006). This information is valuable because childhood

obesity is associated with impaired health, social stigma, and elevated health care costs (IOM,

2005).

         What policymakers would most like to know is the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) of

PE, but what is estimated by IV models is the Local Average Treatment Effect (LATE). The

LATE may differ from the ATE if state mandates increase PE only in certain types of schools.

For example, high-SES schools may already satisfy the new mandate (because they have more of

everything) or may be less likely to already satisfy the new mandate (if they are focused on

academics to the exclusion of PE). In addition, the instrument was sufficiently powerful only in

2004 (the 5th grade wave of ECLS-K) and if the treatment effect is heterogeneous with age then

the results for 5th graders may not generalize to schoolchildren of other ages. In related work,

Cawley, Meyerhoefer, and Newhouse (2007) used PE unit credit requirements (i.e. mandates in

the form of semester courses rather than minutes per week) as instruments for PE time during

high school, and found no detectable impact of additional PE on high school students’ BMI or




                                                 18
the probability of obesity.10 As with gender, it is clearly a priority for future research to better

understand how the curriculum of PE, and the effect of PE, vary by grade and age.

        Our findings confirm earlier studies that found weak compliance by schools with state PE

mandates (e.g. IOM, 2012; IOM, 2006). Our estimates indicate that an increase of 100 minutes

in the state mandate translates into only 40 additional minutes of PE class time among 5th

graders. To some extent, the less than one-to-one correspondence may be driven by some

schools already satisfying the mandate, but we consistently find that only a minority of students

are compliant with state mandates. This suggests that states wishing to increase youth physical

activity may wish to enforce existing PE mandates, in addition to raising the number of

mandated minutes (IOM, 2012).

        The results of this paper indicate that increased PE leads to greater overall participation

by elementary schoolchildren in structured physical activity and more physical activity overall.

Beyond its impact on youth weight, this is important because increased physical activity by

youths is associated with cardiovascular benefits such as a reduction in low-density lipoproteins

(bad cholesterol) and the prevention or delay of hypertension; musculoskeletal benefits such

as increased bone-mineral density and increased strength and endurance; mental and emotional

benefits such as reduced stress and anxiety; and prevention of chronic disease (IOM, 2005).

        This paper finds no evidence that additional PE time crowds out academic subjects. We

also find no evidence that PE has any spillover effects onto achievement test scores. These

findings are consistent with those of Dills et al. (2011).



10
  Cawley, Meyerhoefer, and Newhouse (2007) used PE credit units, rather than minutes per week, as an instrument,
because the former are the way in which state requirements for high school students are expressed: in terms of
semesters of coursework needed to graduate. This paper uses minutes per week as an instrument because state
requirements for elementary school students are expressed in terms of minutes per week rather than credit units for
graduation. That is, in each paper the instrument matches the way state laws express requirements for the grades
involved.

                                                        19
       Concerned by the possibility of policy endogeneity that might bias the IV estimates, we

control in our models for a host of state characteristics related to income, education, and health,

including per capita income, education levels, prevalence of obesity, pupil-to-teacher ratio, tax

revenues per student, expenditures per teacher, and participation in subsidized school meal

programs. Moreover, we conduct several falsification tests and find no evidence that increased

PE time affects weight-related variables that it shouldn’t, specifically: birth weight, BMI z-score

in the fall of kindergarten, and height z-score. In summary, we find no evidence that policy

endogeneity biases the IV results, but caution that evidence from falsification tests is only

suggestive, not definitive.

       A limitation of this paper is that the weight-related outcomes we examine (BMI z-score,

overweight, obesity) are based on body mass index, which is a flawed measure of fatness

because it ignores the distinction between fat and muscle (Burkhauser and Cawley, 2008).

Physical activity that builds muscle and burns fat will have an ambiguous impact on BMI. An

ideal dataset would include measures of both fat mass and lean mass (which can be calculated

using technology such as Bioelectrical Impedance Analysis or Dual X-Ray Absorptiometry),

allowing researchers to measure the effect of PE on muscle and fat. However, this limitation is

less relevant for elementary school students, whose PE involves less muscle-building exercise

and who are less prone than adolescents to adding muscle mass.

Notes: State mandates are based on the year and the applicable grade of students in the ECLS-K data, so that the
decrease in states without a mandate from 1999 to 2000 is due to state mandates that do not apply to kindergarten
students. Figure 1 shows the geographic distribution of state laws in 2004. Additional details about the state laws
are included in the appendix.

relationship. Additional variables included, but not shown, are: sex, age, grade, race/ethnicity (black, Hispanic, and
other race/ethnicity, with white excluded), family income, family size, parent’s education, parent’s education is
missing, birth weight, birth weight is missing, population density (urban or rural, with suburban excluded),
population density is missing, the percent of free and reduced-price eligible students, the type of school (magnet,
charter, special education, and early education, with regular excluded), real per capita income in the state, the
percent of adults with a bachelor’s degree in the state, the prevalence of childhood obesity among boys and girls in
the state, the average pupil/teacher ratio in public schools in the state, real total state tax revenue per student in the
state, real state instructional expenditures per student in the state, and the percent of students in the state
participating in the National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program, and Summer Food Service
Program.
