               THE STATES' EXPERIENCE WITH INCOME TAX INDEXING


                                     ABSTRACT


     Prior to 1985, ten states adopted some kind of indexing provisions for

their personal income tax systems.     Seven of these states subsequently

suspended their indexing laws for one or more years.     In this paper we

examine the states' experience with income tax indexing and see what

lessons can be drawn from it.    We describe the indexing statutes,    and

estimate simple econometric models of both the decisions to adopt indexing

and to renege on a promise to index.

1.   Introduction
     When an income tax is based upon nominal income, then in general, the
real burden of taxation depends upon the rate of inflation. The most
popularly understood way in which inflation affects taxes is "bracket creep."
As nominal income     increases, the individual is pushed into brackets with
higher marginal tax rates. Hence, the proportion of income that is taxed
increases despite the fact that real income stays the same. Another effect of
inflation occurs because exemptions and the standard deduction are set in
nominal terms. Increases in the price level decrease their real value, again
increasing the effective tax rate.1
     Inflation, then, leads to unlegislated increases in the real burden of the
income tax.     Aaron [1976, p.   points out that for the federal income tax,
                                  101

historically these effects have been mitigated by a series of ad hoc
reductions in statutory rates. Such cuts in the federal income tax were
enacted in 1969, 1971, 1975, 1976, 1977, and 1981. An alternative to such ad
hoc arrangements is to index the tax system, i.e., to legislate a formula which

automatically removes the influence of inflation from real tax liabilities.
     Whyshould it matter whether the effects of inflation are mitigated by ad
hoc measures or by an indexing formula? The key distinction is that

indexing    is supposed to represent a serious commitment by the government to
a given real tax schedule, i.e., a relationship between real income and real
tax burdens. Although the tax schedule might change in the future, it would
be a consequence of explicit legislative changes, and not the vagaries of the
inflation rate. Ex ante, a series of ad hoc adjustments does not provide the
same kind of certainty.2
     With   legislation passed in 1981, the federal government made its first
move toward indexing-—bracket widths, the personal exemption, and      the


                                          1
standard deduction are now adjusted annually by the rate of change in the
consumerprice index. As is well known, these provisions went into effect in
1985. Somewhat less well known is that prior to 1985, ten states adopted
some kind of indexing provisions for their own personal income tax systems.
And even   less well known is that of these ten states, seven suspended their
indexing laws for one or more years. So much for commitment.
    The purpose of this paper is to examine the states' experience with
income tax indexing and see what lessons can be drawn from it.     Section II

provides a description of the relevant statutes. Section III examines the
circumstances that led some states to adopt indexing, and why some of them
subsequently reneged on their promises. Section IV concludes with a
summary, suggestions for future research, and discussion of possible
implications for federal   tax reform.
II. State Indexing Laws
     This section provides summaries of the various   state indexing laws.   We

begin with descriptions of the relevant statutes, and then provide a
quantitative summary. The information was culled from various editions of
the State Tax         published by Commerce Clearing House; the state
                Review,
income tax forms; and, in some cases, direct communication with the various
state revenue offices.
    A.     The Indexing Statutes.
     State tax systems differ widely with respect to the items that are
indexed, and how these items are adjusted in response to changes in the
price level. Generally, indexing statutes apply to one or more of the
                                                   standard deductions,
following items: bracket widths, personal exemptions,
and the ranges over which vanishing deductions and credits are phased out.
Before discussing the specifics of the various statutes, we should note one


                                         2
important feature that they have in       common——no      attempt at all is made to
index capital income. Thus,  the important distortions due to the inclusion of
inflationary gains and losses in the computation of the tax base are ignored.
       Arizona's income taxes were    first indexed     in 1978 on a temporary basis;
the arrangement was made permanent in           1980.    Indexing is quite
thorough——the tax      brackets, standard deduction, personal exemptions, a
property tax credit and a rent credit are all included. (However, a ceiling
on the deduction for child care allowances is unindexed.) The price index
used is the Phoenix Consumer Price Index (CPI) for the fiscal year ending in
the tax year. The implied changes in bracket widths, etc., are rounded down
to the nearest $10.
        One   peculiarity of the Arizona law is that the standard deduction is
over-indexed.      En 1978,   the standard deduction was      10   percent of Adjusted
Gross Income, with     a minimum of $500 and     a maximum of $1000. The Arizona
statute indexes not only the minimum and maximum amounts, but also the
percentage rate used in the calculation. By 1985, the percentage rate was
18.3   percent, with a minimum of $917, and a maximum of $1834. When we
contacted the Arizona tax authorities to confirm our understanding of their
law, apparently no one realized what was happening. At the time of this
writing, a modification of the statute is under consideration.
       California began indexing income brackets in 1978. The same law
prescribed indexing of the personal exemptions, dependent deductions and
low income  credit beginning in 1979. The limit on capital losses, the child
care credit, and the rent credit remained unindexed. For 1978 and 1979, the
adjustment factor was the California CPI minus three percent (but not less
than zero). For 1980 on, the factor was the change in the California CPI for
the    12   months ending in June of the tax year. Bracket widths are rounded


                                            3
to the nearest $10, and other items to the nearest $1. This brings us to a
feature of California's law that is shared by a number of other
states--rounding errors are not carried forward. Suppose, for example, that
according to the change in the CPI, bracket widths should be increased by
$9.     Then no change in       the bracket widths occur.            Now      suppose that the next
year's experience also implies a $9 increase. Again there is no change. In
short, the cumulative effect of several years of low inflation can lead to
substantial increases in real tax burdens.
      Colorado's indexingstatute went into effect in 1978. Personal exemptions,
income brackets and the standard deduction were covered; food, fuel and
property tax credits were not. The index amount was to be set annually by
the legislature. If the legislature failed to take action, the law specified a
default amount:      6   percent for the period          1978—85,   and   3   percent starting in
1986.

      Does Colorado's law       represent true indexing? Clearly, if the legislature
can set the adjustment factor without reference to any external standard, the
commitment to keeping   the real tax function unchanged is weakened. On the
other hand, the law does embody a commitment to review the inflation
situation annually, a commitment that is backed up by the presence of the
default option.          In any case, in 1983 these considerations became moot for
the citizens of Colorado when the           law was       suspended for each of the years
1983,   1984   and   1985.

      Iowa   adopted indexation       temporarily       for 1979 and 1980, and made it
permanent in     1980.       Only the income brackets and an annuity exclusion were
indexed; the standard deduction, personal exemption and general                       credit were
not. The adjustment factor used for 1979 was                  25    percent of the change in
the CPI for the entire         U.S.   For 1980 and subsequent years, 50 percent of


                                                    4
the change in the    GNP     deflator was specified.    Interestingly, indexation was
made conditional on the presence of an unobligated general fund surplus of
sixty million dollars     at the close of the fiscal year.     This event has not
occurred since    1978.     In effect, then, Iowa built reneging     rig   into   its
statute. One should note, however, that the law indicating the size of the
surplus is also subject to change.
    Maineadopted an indexation law for 1981 and subsequent years via a
referendum held in 1982. The years specified in the preceding sentence are
not typographical errors. Indexing was passed in a voter initiative held
early in 1982, and the initiative stipulated that indexing would apply to taxes
on 1981 income due in 1982. The initiative was challenged in court on the
basis of its retroactivity. The Supreme Court of Maine ruled that the
initiative was legal, but meanwhile the legislature managed to postpone
application of the law until 1983. The personal exemption and the standard
deduction were indexed, but only for those        in income brackets below $15,000
for single individuals and separate       returns,   $22,500   for heads of households,
and $30,000 for joint     returns. These limits were also indexed. The property
tax credit was not indexed.        The adjustment factor was 50 percent of the
increase in the U.S. CPI during the twelve months ending in June of the tax
year, but not more than 7 percent. Values were rounded to the nearest $10,
and roundoff    errors were not carried forward.
    Minnesota adopted indexing for 1979. Brackets were to be indexed for
1979 onward; and    the low income deduction, standard deduction and general
credit for   1981 onward.     In 1980, indexing was repealed for the low income
deduction, a slightly curious move for a state with a reputation for being
liberal. At the same time, brackets were to be adjusted by a different factor
than other amounts: the bracket adjustment was 85 percent of the change in


                                             5
the Twin Cities CPI of the 12 months ending in August of the tax year; other
items wereadjusted by 100 percent of that change. The standard deduction
was rounded to the nearest $100; the rounding error was not to be carried
forward. Other items were rounded to the nearest one dollar.
    A   number of important changes were made in Minnesota's law         in   1981; i)
Hach year, every taxpayer's taxable income is multiplied by a "Taxable          let
Income Adjustment Factor" (TNIAF), a number which, when multiplied by each

taxpayers taxable income, ensures that average taxable income will grow at
the same rate as average gross income. The TNIAF is bounded below by
one. This factor was introduced to meet concerns that the 1979 law was
leading to a reduction in the real value of the tax base. (The main element
in this erosion was the fact that (unindexed) federal tax payments are
deductible on Minnesota tax returns, so as federal tax liabilities grew,
Minnesota tax collections fell.) ii) The adjustment factor was based on the
change in the CPI for urban consumers      (CPI—U)   for the   12   months ending in

September of  the tax year. However, the adjustment factor could not exceed
the rate of increase in Minnesota gross income. iii) Brackets were to be
indexed at 100 percent of the adjustment factor, not the previous figure of
85 percent. iv) Brackets were to be rounded to the nearest $10, with

rounding errors not carried forward. Taking items i) through iv) together,
we can infer that making  the system comprehensible was not a major
consideration in the design of the Minnesota indexing law.
    Another feature of the 1981 law was a provision for automatic suspension
of indexing in periods of financial stringency. However, this section was
repealed in 1985 when it became apparent that it might actually go into
effect.   A   new rate schedule was introduced at that time.
    Montana adopted indexing for 1981 onward via a referendum held in


                                          6
 1980. Bracket widths, the personal exemption and the maximum standard
 deduction were to be adjusted each year by the change in the U.S. CPI-tJ
 for the months ending in June of the tax year. Brackets were rounded to
 the nearest $100, and other items to the nearest $10. Rounding errors were
carried forward.
       Oregon adopted indexation in 1979 for tax years 1981 onward. Only     the
personal exemption was indexed. In 1982, the law was suspended
retroactively to 1981. Moreover, during the years 1983—1985, the personal
exemption itself was temporarily removed, and replaced by a general credit,
which was not indexed. In effect, then, indexing was removed. In 1985, the
change from an exemption to a credit was made permanent, and the credit
was indexed to the Portland CPI, beginning in 1986.
    South Carolina adopted indexing in 1980, effective in 1982. Only bracket
widths were affected. However, in 1983, before 1982 taxes were paid, the
effective date was postponed to 1984 and the adjustment factor reduced to 25
percent of the CPI. For 1985, the adjustment factor used was twenty—five
percent of that in the federal tax law for bracket widths, and 100 percent
for the standard deduction and personal exemptions.
                      an indexing statute in 1979, effective for 1980. Only
       Wisconsin adopted
income brackets were indexed; the personal exemption, standard deduction,
rent, property, and general credits were not. The adjustment factor was the
June to June change in the CPI for the entire U.S. minus 3 percent.
Indexing was suspended in 1983.
       B.   Summary.
       Table 2.1 summarizes some of the information from   this discussion. For
the period           it shows for each state the adjustment factor applied to
              1978-1985,
whatever items were indexed. Thus, for example, Arizona's figure of 16.0 for


                                         7
 1980 means            that the
                           tax parameters were determined by applying a 16
                                      1980

 percent adjustment factor to their 1979 values. For purposes of reference,
 the last line records the percentage change in the U.S. CPT as a whole. An
 asterisk (*) indicates that indexing was promised for that year, but was then
 suspended.
        Table 2.1 does not do justice to                   the heterogeneity of the various indexing
 statutes across states; however, a tabular representation of all the provisions
 would be unwieldy. In any case, if we seek to assess the impact of a
                                                                          given
 state's indexing statute, we must view it in the context of the rest of that
 state's tax code. However, the tax codes themselves differ dramatically from
 state to state, both with respect    the tax base and tax schedule. (See
                                                      to

 Feenberg and Rosen [1986].) These considerations suggest that a sensible
 characterization of the extent of indexing must embody some sort of
comparison between the revenue yield of the actual (indexed) tax system, and
what the yield would have been in the absence of indexing.
                                                            Specifically,
let     H,0
               be a state's revenue during a given year.                            Now suppose that

prices and incomes increase at rate '                           . Let        H.   be the associated
revenues given that year's indexing law, end                                 R    the revenues that would
have been generated without indexing. Thus, under the
                                                       indexing law, real
revenues increase from      to  R/(l+t)   while
                        Rb                      without indexing, they
                                                                 ,

Th.i, I       measures the proportion of the inflationary increase in real taxes

that is       returned to the taxpayer by the indexing law.                           Note that
with a perfectly indexed tax, real tax burdens are
                                                   unchanged by inflation,
i.e.,
            R1/(l+n)       R.,
                                  .       In    this case, I         I

       Because the tax schedules are nonlinear, a state's value of I

in a given year will in general depend upon              it.   If one wants to examine
the evolution of the various indexing statutes over time,                   it makes sense to


compute       I   using the same value of   ii   for   each year.        In this way, one

does not confound changes induced by statutory modifications with changes

induced by inflation.        On the other hand, if one is interested in how a

state's statute actually operated in a given year,                  ii   should be the actual

inflation rate.        The figures in Table 2.2 show values of              I   for 1978—84

calculated both ways.        The figures without brackets are computed conditional

on " =      0.06;   the figures within brackets are based on the actual inflation

experience of that year.

       As expected from our earlier description of the statutes, there are

considerable differences across states.                A striking and unexpected

result is that a number of state income taxes are over—indexed——I > 1

This phenomenon is explainable by the facts that:                 a) federal income

taxes paid are deductible on some state income tax returns, and b) during

the time period under consideration in the table, the federal tax system

had no indexing.         Hence, when nominal income goes up, nominal state income

tax payments decrease due to indexing and a greater federal tax deduction.

Both effects taken together can result in a lower real state income tax

burden.

III.   To    Index or Not to Index?
       A.     The Characteristics of Indexing vs. Non-Indexing Sates
       Thie section examines the factorsthat influence a state's indexing
status. Our first goal is to see if there are any obvious differences between
the states which at any time chose to index and those that did not. A glance
at Table 2.1 suggests that geography is not a major factor. Each major


                                                 9
 region is represented by at least one state. Similarly, states with varying
 political traditions are included in the table——Minnesota and Oregon, for
 example, are generally considered to be liberal, while Arizona and South
 Carolina are conservative.
      Table 3.1 shows the differences between states that   ever voted for
indexing and those that did not with respect to the 1982 values of a number
of important fiscal and demographic variables.4 (Data sources are
documented in  the Appendix.) The table indicates that with respect to
population, personal income per capita, general expenditures per capita, per
capita debt, and deficits per capita, the differences between indexing and
non—indexing states are not very great. The income and deficit figures are

virtually identical.Indexing states have somewhat larger populations and per
capita government expenditures, and smaller per capita debts, but these
differences are not statistically significant.5
     On the other hand, the revenue structures of the indexing and
non-indexing states are quite different. First, indexing states raised 36
percent of tax revenues from the personal income tax; the comparable figure
for non—indexers was 27 prcent. The difference is statistically significant
Are the income tax systems themselves different? As is well—known, for
complicated non-proportional tax schedules, in general there is no single
number that can characterize the entire schedule. Table 3.1 therefore
presents several different measures: the elasticity of revenues with respect
to income; and the marginal tax rates on individuals with $10,000, $20,000, and
$40,000 incomes. On average, the elasticity is higher in indexing than
non—indexing states, as are the marginal tax rates at each income level.
      The last entry in the table is a dichotomous variable which indicates
whether the state had a tax or expenditure limitation (TEL) statute in place


                                       10
in 1982. (See Kenyon and Benker [1984].)              Sixty percent of indexing states
had TEL's;    the comparable figure for the non-indexers was            27.2   percent.
This perhaps suggests that states which sought to curtail              the size of the
public sector were using several instruments.
     Of   course, the figures in Table 3.1 reflect only the status of the various
states as of 1982. They reveal little about the states' situations at the time
that indexation was adopted.       What   factors might affect this decision? In
particular, what effect might a state's tax structure have on its indexing
status?     There is no standard theoretical framework to           rely upon for
generating hypotheses on how various variables influence the indexing
decision. This is because, as Atkinson and Stiglitz [1980, Chap. 10] and
others have noted, there is no generally accepted theory of how public
sector decisions are made.
     We     have found it useful to think of indexing in the context of an
informal model in which legislators seek         to   maximize   the likelihood of staying
in office over a given time horizon.       Since      voters like tax reductions (ceteris
paribus), a legislator can enhance the probability of wining his next election
by supporting indexing.6 However, once indexing is passed, it reduces the
scope for tax reductions in future years. And if voters              are   myopic   as
suggested by Fair [1982], Feldstein [1980] and others, then legislators cannot
expect to be rewarded in the relatively distant future for earlier support of
indexing.     Hence,   the legislator's choice between indexing and a series of ad
hoc reductions in the future depends upon, inter alia: i) the legislator's
discount rate and time horizon; ii) the extent to which voters in the next
election will be influenced by support for indexing; iii) the extent to which
voters in future elections will reward legislators who voted for indexing in
the past; and iv) the extent to which votes in future elections are influenced


                                            11
by a series of ad hoc    Lax    decreases.
    Thus, as a state's income tax structure becomes more progressive,7 there
are two effects that work in opposite directions. First, as progressivity
increases, so does the cost of indexation in terms of lost opportunities for
future tax reductions. This tends to reduce support for indexing. The
second effect of increased progressivity is to increase the present value of
the stream of tax reductions implicit in the indexing law. This tends to
increase support for indexing. In short, the tradeoffs inherent in the
decision to index    are made   more dramatic when
                                               progressivity increases.
Whether this tends to increase or decrease the probability of indexing cannot
be known a priori.
     Another variable that might affect the indexation decision is    the
importance of the personal income tax in the state's revenue system.
Suppose that the costs to legislators of enacting a tax indexing statute do
not vary proportionately with      the size of the income tax. In particular, there
might be fixed costs in terms of time spent organizing a coalition, putting the
statute through the legislative process, etc. If such is the case, then it
would be less worthwhile to enact an indexing statute when the income tax is

relatively unimportant. In short, we expect that as the proportion of state
tax revenue attributable to the personal income tax increases, so does the
probability of indexing, ceteris paribus.
     The state's financial environment might also affect the indexing decision.
One expects that when a state is under financial stress, its legislators will be
unlikely to abandon a potentially important source of revenue, ceteris
paribus. Hence, we expect states with large debt burdens to be less likely
to adopt indexing.
     We    consider next variables that might be reflective of a state's "tastes"


                                             12
for indexing. income levels might affect the political views of voters and
their elected representatives; hence    we will examine   the impact of per capita
income on the indexing decision.   As suggested earlier, another indicator of
the political environment is the presence of a tax or expenditure limitation
(TEL) statute. Perhaps a TEL is indicative of an underlying desire to
curtail government, in which case the presence of a TEL would increase the
probability of indexing. Alternatively, it could be that if a state has adopted
a TEL , its citizens require no additional instruments to control the size of
the public sector. In this case, the presence of a        TEL would   reduce the
probability of indexing. In any case, however, care must be taken in
assessing the relationship between TEL's and indexing, because the
decisions to adopt them may be made jointly.
     A final variable that might affect the indexing decision is the inflation

rate itself. rndexing would not be an issue at all if-inflation were always
zero. Perhaps the "correct' model is simply that states adopt indexing when
the inflation rate is high, and then drop it when the inflation rate is low.
     With   respect to the reneging decision, we expect the same variables to
operate as in the decision to index. Nevertheless, we note in passing that in
a number of conversations with state government officials, we were told that
the main reason for reneging was to deal with a financial crisis. Issues of
tax structure never came up in these discussions.
     B.   An Econometric Model of Indexing Status
     In this section we construct a Markov model of states' indexing and
reneging decisions. In any given year, a state's income tax system can be
characterized by one of three conditions: it is indexed; it is not indexed
and has never been indexed; or it is not indexed, but the state has reneged
on an earlier promise to index. The probabilities of moving from one


                                          13
condition to another (transition probabilities) are defined in Figure 3.1.
Thus, the first row indicates that if                               a   state fails          to   index      initially,   the
probability that it will stay non—indexed is (1—p) with probability p                        ;




then, it will join the ranks of the indexing states. The third cell in the first
row         is   zero because by definition, a state                             that has never promised to index
cannot           renege. Similarly, from the second row, the probability that an

indexing state retains                      indexing is           (1—q) ;         the probability that              it reneges is
q   .       The    third row implies that reneging is an absorbing condition--once                                                a

state        reneges,     it       never goes back to indexing.                          Obviously,          from   a   theoretical

point        of   view this need not be the case, and indeed, there are several

counterexamples in Table                         2.1.      As a practical matter, however, so few

reneging states have actually returned to indexing that                                                 it   would be infeasible

to estimate the probability of that event.

            We assume          that transitions from period                         t    to       t   + 1    depend on        variables

dated period t                 .    While we             could make      p        and    q        functions     of different

variables, in practice we could think of no basis for including some

variables in one decision and not the other.                                            Hence, Pt =                     and

        =                where x             is a row vector.                Assuming the convenient logit

        At first glance the maximization of (3.3) appears to be a messy

nonlinear problem.                 However, due to the Markov independence assumption,

L   separates into two conventional logit equations, so that standard

software routines can be used.                              Logit 1 selects observations which

are not indexed in period t                           ,
                                                          and computes the probability that they become

indexed in period                  t + 1    .        A state that becomes indexed is assigned a one;

a state that remains non—indexed receives a zero.                                            Logit 2 selects all

observations which are indexed in period                                        t   ,
                                                                                        and computes the probability

that    they renege in period                        t + 1    .       A state that reneges is assigned a

one; a state that remains indexed receives a zero.9

        Implementing the statistical model requires that the

vector be apecified.                     As noted earlier, we use debt per capita to

                "fiscal stress;" per capita income and a                                      TEL   dichotomous variable
represent

to represent "political tastes;" and the share of the income tax in total




                                                                       16
revenues to measure the importance of income taxation.                    As also observed

above, the income tax structure itself can be characterized by several

different variables, e.g., the elasticity of revenue with respect to

income, or the marginal tax rate at each of several                 income levels.'0

Ideally,    one would want to include all of the tax structure variables

simultaneously in                and ao determine   their   relative
                         x   ,                                            importance.

However,    due to multicollinearity among the various measures and

the small nunber of transitions          into indexing,     this strategy proved to be

infeasible.       Instead, we estimate the equations         several times, each with an

alternative measure.         Finally,   in order to estimate the impact of the

inflation rate on the indexing decision,            in some variants we include it in



        All equations are estimated using data from 1977 to 1984.                     That

is, the first transition is from 1977 to 1978, and the last from 1983 to 1984.

The indexing equation has observations on 258 transitions;                    the reneging

equation has 32.

    C.     Results

           1.   The Indexing Decision.       To begin, we estimate models with only

tax structure and fiscal stress variables. The first column of Table 3.2

shows the results when the probability of indexing is a function of the

elasticity of the income tax system (e), the ratio of income tax revenue

to total revenue (s), and per capita debt              (DEBT)   .      The positive

coefficient     on   s   indicates    that the more important the income tax

is in a state's tax structure,          the higher the probability that it will

adopt    indexing.   This is consistent with our earlier argument that there are
fixed costs     to enacting indexing statutes, and hence indexation is less likely
to be adopted when the income tax is a relatively unimportant component of


                                               17
the state's revenue system.
             The   positive coefficient       on    e shows that more elastic
tax   systems have a higher probability of being indexed.                The coefficient

on    s   exceeds its standard error by a factor of 2.1; for              a     the t—ratio

is 1.93.     In terms of our earlier discussion of the two effects that

increasing progressivity can have on the probability of indexing,                   apparently

the second is dominant.           That is, the increased likelihood of a success

in the next election more than outweighs the costs of diminished chances

for success in future elections.             The state's financial position

as measured by        DEBT   also has      an impact-—the larger   its    per capita debt,

the less likely that a state will adopt indexing. This coefficient, moreover, is
significant at conventional levels (t —2.14). We defer to later a discussion
of the quantitative significance of the coefficients.
     We conjectured earlier that the impact of the form of the income tax

structure should depend on the relative importance of the income tax in the
state's revenue system. This conjecture is examined in column (2) of Table
(3.2), which shows the outcome when a is omitted from the indexing logit.
As expected, failure to control for the relative importance of income taxation
renders the income tax structure insignificant as a determinant of
the indexing decision. Omission of a is a serious specification error. Note
also that the coefficient on DEBT falls both in absolute terms and relative
to its standard error when a is omitted from the equation.
      In order to assess the robustness of the results in column (1), we
re—estimated the logit equation entering the "taste" variables mentioned
above, i.e., TEL and         Y .     The   results, shown in column      (3)   of Table 3.2,
indicate the following:      1)    Neither    TEL'1 nor      Y   adds significantly to the
explanatory power of the equation (although              Y   is "close" with a t—statistic


                                                   18
of 1.83). However, the point estimates suggest that the probability of
indexing varies positively with each variable. 2) The coefficients on the tax
structure and debt variables are fairly robust with respect to the inclusion
of TEL and Y . Compared to their counterparts in column (1), the
coefficients on e and DEBT are larger in absolute value, and the
coefficient on a is smaller. But the basic story is unchanged.
     Thus far, our main substantive conclusion is that the more progressive
the income tax structure, the greater the probability of indexing,
ceteris paribus.          investigate whether this conclusion holds up under
                     We now

several alternative notions of "progressive. Specifically, we characterize the
states' income tax structures by their marginal tax rates at the $10,000,
$20,000 and $40,000 income levels.               In each case, we include a and            DEBT

in the equation, but omit TEL and                  Y •12

     The outcomes     with   t10   ,
                                       t20   ,    and t40    are   reported in   columns   (4),   (5)

and (6) of Table 3.2, respectively.                The point estimates suggest that income

tax systems with high marginal tax rates at any given income level are more

likely to index, ceteris paribus.                However,   the coefficients are imprecisely

estimated:          is only 1.08 times its standard error,                       has a t—ratio of
              t10                                                        t20

1.72, and           a t—ratio of 1.81.
              t40

      In short,     the results from Table 3.2 indicate that whether we

use marginal tax rates or elasticities as measures of tax structure,

the main qualitative result is the same.                 Namely, tax systems that are

more prone to produce increasing real tax rates in the presence of

inflation are more likely to be indexed.                 This effect shows up most

strongly when the income tax system is characterized by its overall income

elasticity.




                                                    19
       We   also experimented with an alternative measure of fiscal stress,   the
state's deficit in the year prior to which indexing was adopted. In all cases,
DEFICIT did "worse" than DEBT in the sense of having smaller

t—statistics. (These results are available upon request.) Apparently, one
particular year's fiscal experience looms less important in the indexing
decision than the cumulative effect of all past fiscal decisions as measured by
the debt.
        Next, in   order to investigate the possibility that the inflation rate
affects the indexing decision, each of the equations in Table 3.2 was
re—estimated including the inflation rate as a right hand side variable. The

results, reported in Table 3.3, suggest that: a) the inflation rate is not
statistically significant; and b) its inclusion does not affect the qualitative
results in the rest of the table very much. Of course, it would be silly to
interpret Table 3.3 as saying that inflation has nothing to do with indexing
decisions. What the Table does say is that during our sample period,
variations in the inflation rate do not do a very good job of explaining when
states chose to index.
        far we have confined our discussion to the qualitative aspects of the
        So
results. To obtain a sense of their quantitative significance, we assumed that
the indexing decision was governed by the parameters in column 1 of Table
3.2,and simulated the response of the probability of indexing in a given
year, p , to changes in the various right hand side variables. To
begin   we evaluated equation (3.1) at the mean values of the       xs
and found p = 0.00636.13       We then re—computed (3.1) several times, each

time increasing a single right hand side variable by one standard

deviation, and leaving all others at their means.




                                            20
     The simulations are reported in Table 3.4. The tax        structure variables
have very powerful effects on     p   •   A change in   the elasticity from 1.59 to
2.03 almost   doubles the probability of indexing. An increase in the share of
income   taxes in total revenues from 0.26 to 0.39 more than triples the
probability of indexing. The effect of fiscal stress is also important.
Increasing per capita debt from $500 to $885 cuts the probability that a state
will index by a factor of about 7.
      2.   The Reneging Decision.     We   next turn to states' decisions to renege
given that they have adopted indexing. As noted above, to be included in
the sample for this equation, a state must commit itself to indexing.
Consequently, the number of observations is much smaller than that for the
indexing equation. Mechanically, the dependent variable for each observation
is determined as follows: After the time the indexing commitment is made, a
state is assigned a value of zero for each year the state continues to index,
and a one if it reneges. Once a state reneges, it is out of the sample.
     The estimates are presented   in Table 3.5. As one would hope, they
tend to mirror the results for the indexing equations in Table 3.2. Consider
first columns (1), (2), and (3), where the income tax structure is
characterized by e    , theelasticity of revenues with respect to income. In
each equation, the coefficient on e is negative, suggesting that the more
elastic the tax structure, the less likely is the state to abandon indexing. As
progressivity increases, the short run 'punishment" from abandoning
indexing exceeds the series of   future 'rewards generated by the ability to
 rant more ad hoc tax decreases. However, unlike their counterparts in
Table 3.2, these coefficients are not statistically significant. We conjecture
that there are two reasons for this. First, as just noted, the sample size is
quite small, which tends to make it difficult to estimate parameters precisely.


                                           21
Second, the sample consists of states that have chosen to index, and we
already know from Tables 3.1 and 3.2 that such states have higher
than average elasticites. Within this group there may simply not be enough
variation in e to pin down its coefficient.14
       The coefficients on the debt variablesin columns (1), (2) and (3)
indicate that the larger a state's per capita debt, the more likely it is to
renege on its promise to index. In the reneging decision, fiscal stress is
more   'important' than tax structure in the sense that its coefficient has a
higher t—ratio. Even here, however, it falls a bit below conventional levels
for statistical sigmificance.
       The results from column (3) indicate that states with TEL's are less
likely to renege than states without them, ceteris pribus. Also, the higher
is per capita income, the less likely is reneging to occur. As is the case
with the indexing decision, however, these variables are not statistically
significant, and they do not have much of an impact on the estimates of the
other parameters.
    Columns (4), (5) and (6), indicate that the higher are marginal tax        rates
at any given income level, the lees likely the state is   to renege on   its
promise  to index. However, like the elasticity variable in column (1), the
coefficients on the marginal tax rates are statistically insignificant. Also as
in column (1), greater levels of debt increase the probability that a state will

renege on its promise. rn these equations, the t—statistics on the debt
variables are borderline significant by conventional criteria.
       Table 3.6 shows the results when the various specifications in Table 3.5
are augmented with the inflation rate. As was the case for the indexing
equation, the inflation rate is insignificant, and does not have much of an
effect on the coefficients of the other variables.


                                        22
       To   assess the quantitative significance of the estimates of the reneging
logit estimates, we follow a procedure analogous to    that used to generate
Table 3.4.     We   assume that behavior is governed by the coefficients in the
first column    of Table 3.5; evaluate q of equation (3.2) at the mean values of
the right hand side variables; and observe        how   q changes when each of
the variables is allowed to vary by one standard deviation.         The   results are
reported in Table 3.7.      A   change in the elasticity from 1.85 to 2.20 reduces
the probability of reneging in a given year from 0.14 to 0.07, a very strong
effect. On the other hand, changing the proportion of revenue collections
attributable to the personal income tax has a negligible effect on the
probability of reneging. Relatively high levels of debt per capita have a
substantial impact on the likelihood of reneging; increasing per capita debt
from $288 to $534 would increase the probability of reneging to almost 44
percent.
       To summarizethe discussion surrounding Tables 3.5 through 3.7: A
small sample size plus insufficient variation in the right hand side variables
make   it impossible for us     to obtain precise estimates of the determinants of

reneging. On the basis of the point estimates, however, the two main
conclusions are: (1) The more sensitive that real tax burdens are to
increases in nominal income, the less likely is a state to renege on a promise
to index; and (2) Debt burdens play an important role in states' decisions to
abandon indexing.
IV.   Conclusions
       This paper has examined      the  experience with the indexing of
their personal income taxes. The main findings are:
       1.   Most of the states   that committed themselves to indexing reneged on
their promises.


                                            23
      2.   Among indexing    states, there is considerable heterogeneity with
respect to the items that are indexed, and the adjustment factor used to
change these items when the price level increases.
      3.   In the period         several states were over-indexed. That is,
                           1978—1984,

when nominal incomes rose, real tax revenues fell. This phenomenon was due
to the deductibility of (unindexed) federal tax liabilities on state   returns.
      4.   Astate's indexing status depends on its tax structure, inter alia.
The more that real tax burdens increase with income, the more likely is a
state to index, and the less likely it is to renege.
     5. States with high levels of per capita debt are less likely to index,

and more likely to renege on a promise to index.
      Do   these results tell us anything about the prospects for continued
federal income tax indexing? Clearly, it is not necessarily true that federal
and  state decision—makingare governed by the same process. Suppose,
however, that similar considerations do come into play. If so, the current
high levels of federal debt together with the decrease in marginal tax rates
associated with the Tax Reform Act of 1986 suggest a strong possibility that
indexing will be repealed. In this context, it is interesting to note that at
various times, Sweden, the Netherlands, France, the United Kingdom, and
Canada adopted some form of ". . automatic adjustment of individual income
                                     .



tax rats brackets and exemptions for inflation. Yet the adjustments were
either omitted or reduced frequently to avoid the revenue reductions that
would otherwise take place."      (Pechman [1986, pp.   2-3   Apparently, reneging
on promises to index is not a practice confined     to sub—national levels of
government.
      Finally, our paper has discussed the response of states' indexing
decisions to the structures of their tax systems, but it has not attempted to


                                          24
account for differences in the tax structures themselves. Recently, several
papers have examined cross sectional differences in the choice of tax
instrumentsJ5   Such papers attempt   to explain why, for example, some
jurisdictions rely more heavily on income taxation than others. They pay
little attention to the fact that the tax instruments themselves vary
substantially with respect to their progressivity. Investigating the sources
of tax structure heterogeneity is an important topic for future research.

b Minnesota adopted a new rate schedule in 1985. This schedule is indexed.

                                     NOTES


1.   Less well understood, but also important, is the fact that even with a
     simple proportional tax, inflation changes the effective tax rate on
     capital income.   This is because the inflationary components of capital
     gains and interest income are subject to tax. We do not deal with this
     issue in the present paper.

2.   For a discussion of the macroeconomic consequences of tax indexing, see
     Pierce and Enzler [1976].

3.   Six states (Idaho, Nebraska, New Mexico, North Dakota, South Carolina,
     and Utah) base their taxes, in part, on indexed portions of the federal
     law, thus indirectly imparting an element of indexation into their own
     statutes.  However, these changes become relevant only after the time
     period under consideration in this paper.

4.   Since the question of indexing vs. non—indexing is relevant only for
     states with a personal income tax, those seven states without one are
     excluded.  (Alaska, which abandoned its income tax in 1979, is excluded
     from the sample.)

5.   Statistical significance is determined on the basis of the usual t—test
     for the hypothesis that the difference between two means is zero.
     Because the number of indexing states is small, the test is only
     approximately correct.

6.   The "other things" include the level and composition of state expenditure.
     Although explicit consideration of the spending side would complicate our
     discussion, we do not think that it would change its tenor.

7.   As suggested above, "progressivity" can be measured in several ways.
     For present purposes, it is sufficient to think of progressivity
     loosely as the extent to which real tax burdens increase in response
     to changes in nominal income.

8.   As an alternative to equation (3.3), one might consider employing a
     hazard model, which explicitly considers the length of time required
     for some event to occur. However, specification of a hazard model
     requires that the initial condition of the process be known. For the
     indexing decision, however, there is no obvious birth date. For the
     reneging decision, the date that indexation was adopted might be used
     as the starting point.  But given the small number of observations,
     it is unlikely that the parameters of a reneging hazard function could
     be estimated with any precision.   Note that it is necessary to include
     all states in the sample, not just those with tax legislation in a given
     year. The decision to modify the tax law is endogenous, and selecting
     on an endogenous variables renders the coefficients inconsistent.

 9. Recall from our discussion of Table 2.1 that some states reneged on
    their promise to index even before indexing was implemented.  In this
    context, we view the vote for indexing rather than its implementation
    as the crucial event. Hence, these states are assigned a value of 1


                                        35
      in each logit equation.  However, our substantive results are not
      sensitive to these observations being omitted.

10.   One might argue that the progressivity of the tax structure is
      determined jointly with the decision to index. However, our earlier
      calculations (see Feenberg and Rosen [1986]) indicate that the states'
      tax structures change very little over time; hence, we regard the
      possibility that progressivity is endogenous to the indexing decision
      as a remote one.

11.   However, given the possible endogeneity of   TEL   ,   this result must be
      viewed cautiously.

12.   When analogues to the specifications in columns (2) and (3) of Table 3.2
      were estimated with the various marginal tax rates inatead of e    the,


      results were qualitatively similar: omitting a renders the tax struc-
      ture variable insignificant; and Y and TEL are statistically insigni-
      ficant.

13. Means are taken only over the obaervetiona used to estimate the indexing
    logit.  Hence, they differ from those presented in Table 3.1. One might
    wonder why the value of p evaluated at the means is so small (0.00636)
    in light of the fact that 10 states chose to index.  In effect, p
    measures the probability that any given transition is from non—indexing
    into indexing.  In the indexing logit, there are many more observations
    in which states remain non—indexed than those in which they choose to
    index.

14.   lnthe aample used to estimate the indexing equation, the coefficients of
      variation for e and a are 0.280 and 0.472, respectively.     In the re-
      neging equation, the corresponding figures are 0.191 and 0.287. The com—
      parison indicates that there is less variation in the sample used to
      estimate the reneging equation.

       This Appendix documents the sources of data employed in the statistical
analysis.
        figures on state public finance (expenditures, revenues, deficits, and
       All

debts) are from various editions of U.S. Department of Commerce, State
Government Finances. Data for 1977 are found in the 1978 edition, 1978 data
in   the   1979   edition, etc. Population data for 1977 through 1979 are in the
1979   through 1981 editions of U.S. Department of Commerce, State Government
Tax Collections. The 1980 through 1983 population figures                are from Current
B2jpulation Report, Series        P—25. 1944,   "Estimates of the Population of States
1980—1983,"       January 1984.
   Total personal income by states for 1977—83 is from Department of
Commerce, Survey of Current Business, August 1984.
                                              the income tax structures are
       The marginal tax rates and elasticities of

updated versions of the figures in Feenberg and Rosen (1986]. They are
calculated using individual income and deduction data from a stratified
random sample of actual income tax  returns. Marginal tax rates are found by
incrementing the wage income of each household in the sample by $100, and
calculating the associated change in tax liabilities. Similarly, elasticities are
calculated by examining the consequences of a one percent increase in
income. Nominal dollar values for income were converted into 1977 terms by
use of regional price deflators found in various editions of the Statistical
Abstract of the United States. The price deflator for state and local public
goods is from various editions of the U.S. Department of Commerce, Survey of
Current Business. (September 1981, July               1983 and   July 1984.)
