                       A "Gold Standard isn't Viable Unless
          Supported by Sufficiently Flexible Monetary and Fiscal Policy



                                    ABSTRACT




     The paper studies an idealized gold standard in a two—country
setting. Without flexible national domestic credit expansion (dce)
policies which offset the effect of money demand shocks on international
gold reserves, the gold standard collapses with certainty in finite time
through a speculative selling attack against one of the currencies.
Various policies for postponing a collapse are considered.

     When a responsive dce policy eliminates the danger of a run on a
country's reserves, the exogenous shocks disturbing the system which
previously were reflected in reserve flows, now show up in the behaviour
of the public debt. Unless the primary (non—interest) government
deficit is permitted to respond to these shocks, the public debt is
likely to rise (or fall> to unsustainable levels.

     For the idealized gold standard analysed in the paper, viability
can be achieved only through the active and flexible use of monetary and
fiscal policy.

 1.   Introduction

      This paper is a theoretical study of the viability of a fixed

exchange rate regime which for brevity I refer to as a gold standard.

In a two—country world the monetary authority of each country guarantees

the convertibility of its non—interest bearing fiat currency into gold

at a fixed price. There is an exogenously given global stock of gold,

which has no non—monetary uses.   I therefore abstract from one feature

of the historical gold standard, under which the international reserve

asset had uses as a private consumption good and as an industrial

intermediate good and raw material, and could itself be produced through

an extractive production process. The essence of 'gold' in this model

is that it is an "outside" non—interest bearing fiduciary asset whose

aggregate quantity is exogenous to each private and public agent in the

global economic system and1 to the system as a whole.

      By viability of the gold standard I mean its probability of

survival and the expected duration of its survival. Special attention

is paid to the way in which particular monetary, financial and fiscal

policy actions, or rules, affect the viability of the system.

      The paper extends to a two—country setti;ig the single country

analyses of a collapsing managed exchange rate regime by Kruqman £1979),

Flood and Garber [1983, 198'+a, b], Obstfeld E1984a, b, c) and others.




   For a more descriptively realistic analysis of certain aspects of the
historical Gold Standard see e.g. Barro [1979), Eichengreen [1984,
1985a,b), Barsky and Summers [1985), Bordo and Schwartz £1984).
                                                                    2



These papers in turn were macroeconomic applications of the seminal

paper by Salant and Henderson E19781 on collapsing commodity stockpiling

schemes. My approach owes a lot to the work of Grilli (1986] who

analysed buying and selling attacks on the same currency in a small

country model.   I use his idea of specifying two shadow floating

exchange rates, one governing a buying attack and one governing a

selling attack, although for the formal analysis in this paper I reduce

these two to a single shadow floating exchange rate between two

absorbing barriers. Flood and Garber (1983) use a log—linear continuous

time stochastic two—country model to analyse a different class of

problems (stochastic process switches) which could be formalized in

terms of the beha';iour of a stochastic process and a single absorbing

barrier.

     Section 2 outlines the model. Section 3 develops the

characterization of the "shadow floating exchange rate' as a Wiener

process, with or without drift, between two absorbing barriers. s long

as the shadow floating exchange rate stays between the barriers (in the

viable or safe range) the gold standard survives. When the shadow rate

reaches either barrier, the gold standard collapses through a

speculative selliig attack on one of the two currencies.

     Section 4 looks at the various ways in which policy actions can

affect the shadow floating exchange rate process and thus the viability

of the gold standard. It considers in detail those policy actions that,

(leaving unchanged the nature of the shadow floating exchange rate

process as a Wiener process with drift -between two absorbing barriers
                                                                      3



     and leaving unchanged the variance of that process), alter the width of

     the viable range, the drift paramer (the instantaneous mean of the

     process) and the initial value of the shadow rate. Section    considers

     feedback policies that turn the (non—stationary) Wiener process into a

     stationary stochastic process. Section 6 looks at policies that can

    alter directly the variance parameter of the original Wiener process.



    2. The Model

          The two country model to be analysed is a linearized version of the

•
    model given in equations (1) to (lO).2



    1) j, ', =                            =   < 0;   =   >   0

    2) e(i*,   y*) =

    8) R>RMIN
    9)

    10) R > RMIN +
                     RIN



       Because the model include.s accounting identities as well as relative
    price levels, there is no convenient log—linear specification.
                                                                   4




The two countries are assumed to have identical demand for money

functions (equations (1) and (2)). This permits us to analyse exchange

rate behaviour without having to specify a goods market equilibrium

condition. Starred variables refer to foreign country variables.       i is

the nominal interest rate, y real output, M the nominal money stock, P

the price level, B the stock of government bonds, R the stock of foreign

exchange reserves, LI the primary (i.e. non—interest) government deficit

and S the spot exchange rate (the domestic currency price of foreign

currency). We assume i, i > 0. Interest is not paid on reserves, a

realistic assumption under a gold standard, when the domestic and

foreign currency prices of gold are fixed.

     There is a single traded good. (3) is the law of one price.

Financial markets ar efficient and there are risk—neutral speculators,

so uncovered interest parity (UIP) holds, as given in (4).Et is the

expectation operator conditional on information available at time t.

     The total stock of gold in the world economy is exogenously given.

Consumption and production of gold are therefore ignored.

     Each country maintains convertibility of its currency into gold as

long as its stock of reserves exceeds an exogenously given critical

minimum value (RMIN for the home country, RJN for the foreign

country). If either country's stock of reserves falls to its lower

threshold, the fixed exchange rate regime collapses and a free float of

indefinite duration begins. Equation (10) states that there are enough
                                                                                 5



    global reserves to satisfy the two countries' minimal reqt.firements

    simultaneously.3

         Linearizing the model and evaluating it at the fixed exchange rate

S which, without loss of generality, can be set equal to unity, we

obtain the following first order differential equation for the floating

exchange rate:4



11) E dS(t) =
         t         s
                       S(t>d(t)   —   c.[M(t)   —   M*(t))dt   +   Z(t)dt

  Most of the analysis is concerned only with differences between the
values of country—specific variablessuch as domestic credit expansion,
money demand groth etc. It may be helpful to think of country—specific
or global variabes (real output, the world price level under a fixed
exchange rate) as not having any long—run trend. This makes the
standard convention in this literature of specifying reserve floors or
ceilings in nominal terms (rather than in real terms or relative to some
nominal scale variable such as nominal income, trade or financial
wealth) less objectionable. The analytically most convenient way of
specifying the world commodity market equilibrium condition required to
solve for individual countries' price levels and nominal interest rates,
is to postulate a fixed ex—ante real interest rate.

D and      are the home and foreign stocks of domestic credit

respectively, i.e. dD =          (z   +   iB]   dt — dB

(13b) M*(t) = D*(t) +



       Following Grilli [1986], equation (14a) describes the evolution of

9, the shadow floating exchange rate that would prevail for t    r if the

fixed exchange rate regime collapses at t =                   r as the result of a
speculative selling attack against the home country's currency.

Equation (l4b) governs S, the shadow floating exchange rate that would

prevail for t           r   if the fixed exchange rate collapses at t                   r as the

result of a speculative selling attack against the foreign currency.

        An important simplifying assumption is that D(t) and D*(t) (and

indeed Z(t)) are unaffected by the occurrence and timing of a collapse

of either currency.


        Choosing convergent forward—looking solutions for S and S we find

        The fixed exchange rate regime collapses through a speculative

selling attack on the home currency when the home currency shadow

floating exchange rate equals the fixed rate for the first time, i.e.
                                                                   8




when




(16a) S(t) =   9;     S(t') < 9, t' < t



        It collapses as the result of a speculative selling attack on the

foreign currency when the foreign currency shadow floating exchange rate

equals the fixed rate for the first time, i.e. when



(16b) 9(t) =   9;     S(t') > 9, t' < t



       The fixed exchange rate regime survives as long as




(17) S<SandS>S
       Note from (15a, b) that




(18a) 9(t) =   S(t)   ÷ K

(18b) K =   —         - MIN   +
                                  RMIN)]


       From the assumption of minimal global reserve adequacy (eqn(lO)) it

follows that K > 0 and therefore that
                                                                    9




 (18c) 5(t) > 5(t)




      We therefore rewrite condition (17) for viability of the fixed

 exchange rate system as:



     9(S (S+K


     Without loss of generality we can choose the lower bound to equal

zero.5 Formally, the exercise we are performing can therefore be seen

as the analysis of a continuous time stochastic process S between two

absorbing barriers; the lower barrier 0 and the upper barrier K > 0.



(19) 0<S<K


This is illustrated in Figure 1. S(t) represents a realization which

is absorbed at the upper barrier at t0. S1(t) is absorbed at the lower

barrier at t1.

     Except in Section 5 we assume that dD, dD* and dZ are each governed

by mutually serially independent Brownian motion with drift t, i.e.




   We can always replace expressions such as prob(S < S < S + K) with

the equivalent prob(0 < S — S < K), if we also change the initial
condition of the stochastic process involved in an appropriate manner.

3. The Gold Standard as a Wiener Process With Two Absorbing Barriers.

    From the characterization of S as a Wiener process between two

absorbing barriers, a number of propositions follow immediately.

     Proposition 1. Under the conditions specified in Section 2, the

gold standard collapses in finite time (with probability 1).

     Proof. A Wiener process, with or without drift (i.e. with

     0), between two absorbing barriers is absorbed with probability 1

in finite time. See e.g. 3. M. Harrison [1985, p. 43].



     Note that the variante of the shadow floating exchange rate

increases without bound as t increases. Any gold standard with a finite

global stock of gold reserves will be non—viable, in the sense that a

speculative attack will exhaust one country's reserves with probability

one in finite time.

     It is important to note that, at a point in time, the 'fundamental'

shocks to domestic credit and money demand are infinitesimal, i.e. of

measure zero compared to the stock of reserves at that instart. It

always takes a finite amount of time to achieve a finite change in the

stock of reserves through the cumulative effect of these shocks. The

finite, stock—shift rundown in a country's stock of reserves at the

moment a speculative attack occurs, reflects the .endogenous behaviour of

speculators, not the occurrence of an exogenous shock that is large

relative to thc existing stock of reserves.
                                                                     1k




         An implication of this specification of the exogenous shocks is

    that neither currency will ever be at a forward discount or premium, as

    long as the gold standard survives. At the instant a speculative attack

    brings down the gold standard, a forward discount or premium consistent

    with UIP may of course emerge.

         Let r be the time at which the gold standard collapses, either

•   because S reaches K > 0 or because it reaches 0. Let 5(0)   S0 €[Q, K)

    be the initial value of Sat t = 0 and let     and   be the drift and

    variance parameter of S. p(S0, s; U is the conditional probability

    that S is at S at time t > 0 given.that it starts at S0 at time t =   0,
    when there are two absorbing barriers, at K > 0 and at 0, and with

    0 < S0 < K. Then (see Cox and Miller t1965, p. 219—234])

Finally   (see e.g. Cox and Miller [1965, p. 233]), the probability of

absorption at the upper barrier (i.e. the probability                              of   the gold

standard collapsing through a speculative selling attack on the home

country currency) zr(S0)                  is   given by

                          exp(—2p9K1<Y5) —              1




The probability of absorption at the lower barrier 21(S0), is then of

course given by



(30b> u(S0) =         1
                               u(S0).




4. Monetary, Financial and Fiscal Policy ctLons and the Viability
    of the Gold Standard.

     No attention is paid in this paper to strateg2c behaviour by the

monetary and fiscal authorities of the two countries. It is probably

easiest to think of the various policy actions as being implemented by
                                                                     18




 mutual agreement or co—operatively; formally, we simply vary policy

parameters in an exogenously given manner without worrying about

conjectured and actual responses of other policy makers, time

consistency of the actions or rules etc. Consideration of those very

important issues is beyond the scope of this paper.

     We distinguish 5 different kinds of policy actions.

a> Policies that change the initial value or starting value of the

shadow floating exchange rate process at t =    0, S.
b) Policies that change the drift of the shadow floating exchange rate

process, p.
C) Policies that change the width of the "safe or viable band", K.

d) Policies that change the S process from a Wiener process with drift
                            2
   and variance parameter       to a stationary first order linear

stochastic process whose "forcing variable" is a Wiener process without

drift, i.e. to



(31) dS =
            Sdt   1-

                       dw


      dw NIID (0, adt)


e) Policies that change the variance parameter of the S process,



     It will become clear that any given policy action or rule change

may bring about several of these five consequences atthe same time.

    A number of results are immediately established.
                                                                           19

                             exp(—2i.K/o5)


Clearly, policies that raise S increase the probability of the collapse

of the gold standard occurring throuqh a selling attack on the home

currency.

        Clearly, policies that widen the viable band by raising the upper

limit reduce the probability of the collapse of the gold standard

occurring through a selling attack on the home currency.

        Note from the definition of K in (1Gb) that an increase in Krneans

an increase in the global stock of reserves and/or a reduction in the

countries' critical reserve thresholds. Since the e>periment holds S0

constant (and            the increase in A or reduction in RMIN or RIN must
                                                                               20



be accompanied by a reduction in D(O) or an increase in D*(0) (see 24c>.

Such a combination of events obviously makes it more likely that the

collapse, when it occurs, will occur through a run on the foreign

currency. The increase in world reserves is allocated to the home

country.

       That a higher value of the variance parameter reduces the expected

A higher value of the drift parameter p6 appears to have an ambiguous

effect on E0(r). Without uncertainty,.an increase in p6 will raise

E0(r) if p6 is negative,, lower E0(r) if                 is ositive. With

uncertainty, the two terms in the square brackets on the RHS of (33d)

       We now consider alternative policy actions at t =            0,   that maximize

the expectation of the survival period of the gold standard.



Policies that Increase K.

       From (l8b> it is apparent that, given the values of the parameters

     and    the viable range of S can be increased only by an increase in

the exogenous global stock of reserves R or a lowering of the critical

reserve thresholds R      and R*. .       From (24c) we note that an increase
                     mm             mm

                               12
in R or a reduction in R*.           will raise S by half as much as K. 9(0)
                          mm                         0

reduced by half the amount of the increase in R. If the lower bound of

the viable range were L < K rather than zero, we could represent a

"symmetric" increase in the viable range by an eqeal increase in the

upper bound K and reduction in the lower bound L. Such a policy would

leave S0 unchanged for given values of D,                 and p6•




12                                                  *
     It was assumed, in (24c) that R            R

      In our model, an increase in K accompanied by an increase in S0 of

half the magnitude of the rise in K can be achieved either by equal


reductions in A        and        or by an increase in R that is distributed
                  mm         mm
equally between the two countries. An increase in K with constant S0

and constant       requires an increase in D*(0) and/or reduction in 0(0).

Take the example of an increase in 0 (0) which neutralizes the effect of

an increase in R on S. earring helicopter manoeuvres, such a

stock—shift increase in D* can only be brought about through an open

market purchase of bonds by the foreign government, since

lowered, resulting in increases in          and     Indefinite   government

bond purchases (or sales) are not feasible. (n increase in K with

constant S0 and p5, therefore, represents a combination of an increase

in world reserves (or reductions in reserve thresholds), an open market

sale by the home country government (or an open market purchase by the

foreign government) and a reduction in the home government's primary

deficit (or an increase in the foreign government's primary deficit).

(See Buiter [1976] for a discussion of these issues in a small country

setting).
                                                                        26



       We can summarize the main findings of the. discussion of increases

in K as follows.




       Proposition 2. A larger global stock of gold reserves raises the

length of the expected survival period of the gold standard. Collapse

in finite time remains a certainty, however, with any finite stock of

reserves.



Policies That Change S

       I now consider policies that change S0 without causing changes in

K,      or c. It is easily seen from (24c), (18b) and (24a) and (24b)

that such policies are redictributions of the given global stock of

gold. An increase in D(0) — D*(0) redistributes reserves from the home

country to the foreign country and raises            Such stock—shift changes

in D(0) or D*(0) are brought about by open market sales or purchases.

To prevent changes in           from resulting from such open market sales or

purchases, fundamental fiscal corrections, i.e. changes in the primary

deficit must be brought out, as discussed in the preceding subsection.

Given K,       and     there exists a unique value of S0,        (and therefore

a unique value of D(0) —        D*(0)) that maximizEs E0(r). This is obtained
               13
from (33a ).

       The problem with such redistributions of world reserves is that

even when they raise E0(r) (something both countries can agree on), the

probability of the collapse of the gold standard, when it occurs,

occurring through a speculative selling attack on currency X always

increases (decreases) when country X gives up (acquires) reserves

through the open market sales and purchases outlined above.         If there is

any opprobrium attached to succombing to a speculative selling attack,

countries that have excessive reserves (from the point of view of the

survival of the gold standard) may yet be loath to give them up. This

leads to Proposition 3.



       Proposition 3. There exists an E0(r) maximizing initial

distribution of reserves defined by (34,     34'),      '24c) and
           *
R(0) =D(0) — D(0) +    R   14
                                Since any reserve ridistribution tncreases




14
   With identical money demand functions, identical initial income
levels, a fixed exchange rate S   1 and UIP, it follows that M(0) =
M*(0).    Since M = D + R and M*    D* +   R —   R, Proposition 3 follows.
                                                                          28



the likelihood of the collapse of the gold standard, when it occurs,

occurring through a selling attack on the currency of the country that

has given up reserves, co—operative redistributions of reserves may be

difficult to achieve without a mechanism for compensating the loser.



Policies that Change .

     From (24a) it is apparent that an increase in the difference

between the expected rates of change Of the home country's and the

foreign country's stocks of domestic credit, increases .             An increase

in p —     which raises    would, however, also raise S0 (see (24c)),

which is an increasing function of the "present discounted value" of all

future expected dce differentials.

     To raise    without also raising S0. the increase in p —            must be

accompanied by a reduction in D(0) —   D*(0),    i.e.




(35) d(D—D ) =




     Note that an open market sale by the home government (say) which is

not acompanied by a reduction in the primary deficit and is not

followed by further borrowing, lowers D but, through the increased debt

service requiremtnts, raises p by dp —i0dD. A once—off open market

sale by the home government therefore raises p5 and will raise (lower)

   if i0 > a3 (i0 < a9).
     It does not appear to be correct that p5        =0     always maximizes

E0(r) for given values of S0 (and K and         ).   E.g.   with a value of
                                                                                                             29



very close to the lower end of the viable range, 0, a positive value of

     might well raise E0(T).                     I conjecture, but have not been able to
p9
prove, that when both                       and S0 are the subject of policy choice,

however, E0(r) is maximized when p5 = 0 and S0

       Note that this requires

with a constant variance parameter

nonstationary even if          =   0.
       We maintain the assumption that Z(t) is governed by the Wiener

process with drift given in (2Cc), but permit the policy instruments to

be governed by linear feedback rules that relate dce to the state

variable S. For simplicity we assume that the feedback rules are exact

or non—stochastic, i.e. that the only sources of noise in the system are

the money demands in the two countries, Z(t>. D(t) and D*(t) can be

           It   is therefore rather straightforward (technically) tc design dce

 feedback rules that turn the original non—stationary shadow exchange

 rate process into the stationary process given in (39). The fact that

 (39) is stationary does not, however, resolve the problem of

 non—viability of the gold standard.



 Proposition 5.

           The gold standard whbse shadow exchange rate is governed by the

 stationary process in (39) will collapse in finite time with probability

•1.

           Proof: The first order linear stochastic differential equation

whose forcing variable is a Wiener process is known as the

Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (O.U.) process. In Cox and Miller Cl95, p. 23343 it

 is shown that the stationary O.U. process is recurrent, i.e. any state

 is reached from any other state in finite time with probability 1.

•Hence given any nitial state S0, 0 <              < K, the barriers will be

reached in finite time with probability one. This proposition can be

extended to higher order stationary linear stochastic processes with

constant coefficients.

6. Flexible dce Rules and the Viability of a Gold Standard

       From equation (15b) it is apparent that there exist policies for D

and         that ensure that the shadow floating exchange rate will never

break through its upper or lower barrier. Policies that fix S at any

value between 0 and K preclude a speculative run on either currency. To

achieve this, both the drift p5 (given in (2'+a) and the variance

parameter o (given in (24b)) must be set equal to zero. To set the

drift equal to zero does not require any special technical ability of

the policy makers. Any values of p and                 satisfying p —       = —will
do, and the policy can be specified in an open—loop or non—contingent

manner.

       To reduce the variance parameter to zero, however, requires a

highly contingent or conditional policy rule. It is e.g. not sufficient

for the authorities merely to refrain from adcing additional 'noise' to

the systern, by following a non—stochastic open—lpop rule with

00

                                          0.

       From (24b> this would leave the variance of the shadow exchange

rate process at --     4>     0 if, as seems certait,, there are stochastic


shocks to relative money demand growth. For                 to equal zero, D(t)

and/or D11(t) must be stochastic, (a2 and/or                > 0) with one or more of
                                               p

                                     ww
     = 0 in (24b'. Equivalently, instantaneous feedback rules must be

designed which ensure that the forcing variable in the shadow exchange

rate process is constant over time, i.e. that dF(t) = 0 or
                                                                                       35




(40) d(D(t> —      D*(t))        —dZ(t) for all t.



        This perfect automatic stabilizer instantaneously matches any

(random) excess of home country money demand growth over foreign country

money demand growth with an equal excess of home country domestic credit

expansion over foreign country domestic credit expansion. There never

is any net movement of reserves between the two monetary authorities.




Fiscal fspects of DCE Rules Consistent With the Survival of a Gold
Standard

     From the two government budget identities (5) and (6), it follows

that, as long as the fixed exchange rate regime survives and i =                       i,
d(D —
         *
        D ) =    (   —   * )dt   +   i(B   —
                                                *             *
                                               B )dt — d(B — B )



    Under the dce rule given in (40), this means that



(41) d(B —      B*) =    E( —    A*) +     i(B   —   B*))dt   —     dZ(t)


     Even if the authorities follow the very conservative fiscal policy

of matching (differences in) debt service i(B — B*) with (differences

in) primary surplu'es (( —                 icr, relative          stocks of public sector debt

will still Hget out of hand," since in that case
                                                                        36



 (42) d(B — B*) = ——dZ




 i.e. relative public debts is a Wiener process (without drift). The

stabilization of the shadow exchange rate appears to be achieved only at

the expense of the destabilization of the public debts of the two

countries.

      We assume that each country has an upper bound on its public debt,

B for the home country and B* for the foreign country. B > B means a
                                              *   —*
home country default on its public debt; B > B means insolvency of the

foreign government.

      Thus far we have characterized, in (40) and (42), the behaviour of

D —    and B — B*.        benchmark 'tsymmetric' specification of the

behaviour of each of the national authorities which is consistent with

(40) is that each country's dce equals the growth in the demand for that

country's money due to real output growth, i.e.



(43a) dD(t) =   — —- (&1e )     dy(t)
                 c
                  m   1    yO




18
   Such an upper bound exists when there is no Ricardian debt
neutrality, the nominal interest rate exceeds the growth rate of nominal
taxable capacity and there are limits on the magnitude of the future
primary surpluses and the future flow of seigniorage revenues that can
be achieved.    more general model would specify these limits in terms
of e.g. public debt — national income ratios, but nothing crucial is
lost if we interpret our model as one characterized by zero long run
real growth and inflation [see also fn3].

        A policy of accommodating shocks to money demand due to variations

 in real output (thus avoiding any net flow of international reserves and

 fixing S) and of balancing the budget (44       a,b)    will therefore result in

 the national debt following a Wiener process if real output follows a

 Wiener process.

        If the Wiener process for y (y*) has no drift, then B (B*) will

exceed any finite upper limit with probability 1 in finite time, and the

authorities will have to default on their debt. If y (y ) has negative

drift, it is true a fortiori that any finite upper bound on B (B*) will

be reached in finite time with probability 1.           If y (y*) has positive
drift        > 0 (* > 0)      then the probability that, starting from B (B)

the upper bound B (B*) will be reached in finite time is
                 —                     -

this probability is less than 1, the probability that B (B*) wIll reach

an arbitrarily low (even negative) value in finite time is 1 when

   > 0           > 0). This possibility of the government becoming an

arbitrarily large creditor to the private sector is certainly an unusual

one.

       If the government were to run a budget deficit (surplus) equal to

the trend growth in money demand due to real output growth, (44 a, b)

would be replaced by

        Such a financing policy (a balanced budget policy corrected for

non—inflationary seigniorage) takes the drift out of the national debt

processes (45 a, b) which now become Wiener processes without drift. As

was pointed out already, this. liconservativehl open—loop rule entails

government default in finite time with probability one.                    The risk of a

foreign exchange crisis is eliminated, but an eventual government

solvency crisis has become a certainty.

        To ensure that the critical gold reserve thresholds will not be

 violated and that debt default is ruled out, the primary deficit 1

 will have to be varied in response to exogenous shocks. The simplest

 policy that guarantees survival of the gold standard and government

 solvency is one where the primary deficit adjusts continuously to

 accommodate all real income—related changes in money demand, i.e.

tinder this set of policy rules (43 a, b); (44 a", b") dR           _dR* = 0 and

dB = dB*    =   0.   International liquidity and public sector solvency are

made certain by adopting a set of highly contingent or conditional dce

and primary deficit rules.

     While the rule given here is not the only one consistent with a

viable gold standard and government solvency, any viable rule must be

capable of eliminating the posibility that independent shocks will

cumulate in ways that threaten lower or upper bounds on certain asset

stocks. Another policy which rules out the possibility of running out

of gold reserves and which does not require the instantaneous matching

of dce and money demand changes, is to let reserves decline freely to

some given level a5ove the minimum threshold level (RMIN +          r,   r > 0 for

the home country, say) and to engage in a stock—shift open market sale

of government bonds whenever RMIN +          r   is reached. The open market—sale

would restore reserves to          +   r',   r' > r, say. If both countries

were to pursue such a policy, the process governing the shadow floating

exchange rate would become a Wiener process between reflecting barriers.

To prevent these discrete open market sales from cumulating into

unsustainable public debt growth, the primary deficit will have to

respond to variations in debt service. This mean that all viable rules

are feedback, contingent or conditional rules.           I summarize this as:



     Proposition .

     In   order to rule out both the collapse of the gold standard and a

public sector solvency crisis, both monetary policy (dce or stock—shift

open market operations) and fiscal policy (variations in the primary
deficit) will have to be specified through contingent or conditional

r u I es.




Cone lus ion

        The idealized two—country gold standard studied in this paper turns.

out to lack long—run viability unless monetary and fiscal policy are

used very flexibly to offset the effects of independent exogenous shocks

on international reserves and the public debt.

        Absent a flexible dee policy which offsets the effect of money

demand shocks on the stock of reserves, the gold standard collapses in

finite time with probability 1. This collapse occurs through a

speculative selling attack against one of the two countries' currencies,

which brings that country's stock of gold reserves to its critical

minimal threshold level. 4hen this happens the monetary authority ends

convertibility of the currency ircto gold at a fixed parity and a period

of free floating commences.

        Even when an eventual collapse is certain, there are once-off

monetary and fiscal policy actions that can raise the expected duration

of the li-fe of the gold standard. An increase in the exogenous stock

o-f international reserves (through a gold discovery or through the

issuing of 'paper gold" (S.D.R.'s) by a supranational monetary

authority> raises the expected survival period of the gold standard.

For any given global stock of reserves, there exists an initial

distribution of reserves that maximizes the gold standard's expected
                                                                    42



 lifetime. This distribution can be achieved through (stock—shift) open

market operations and adjustments in public sector primary non—interest

deficits. Expected dce (the 'drift" of the domestic credit stock

process) can be adjusted by the monetary authorities to alter the

Hdriftl• of international reserves and of the "shadow floating exchange

rate" whose behaviour determines the timing of the collapse and the

currency that will be the subject of a selling attack.

     The behaviour of international reserves in the "viable range" where

each country's stock of reserves exceeds its critical threshold value,

can in general be mapped into the behaviour of a shadow floating

exchange rate between two absorbing barriers. The results summarized

thus far hold for a world in which the exogenous variables (domestic

credit and money demand) follow Wiener processes with or without drift.

When the exogenous variables are governed by Wiener processes, the

shadow exchange rate is also a Wiener process. Since Wiener processes

are non—stationary, it may be thought that the certainty of collapse in

finite time is duet to that specific feature of the model. This is not

the case. Fairly simple dce feedback rules relating national dce

differences to the level of the shadow floating exchange rate can

transform the shadow floating exchange rate proces into a stationary

stochastic process. The proposition that a critical reserve threshold

will be breached in finite time with probability 1 remains valid even

for stationary shadow exchange rate processes.

    Finally, I consider flexible dce rules which permit domestic credit

expansion to respond instantaneously to real income—related money demand
                                                                   43



shocks. While this stops the movement of reserves, it will create

public debt problems. If e.g. the authorities follow a balanced budget

policy, money demand shocks will, when matched by variations in domestic

credit, be reflected one-for—one in the public tebt. If there is an

upper bound on the level of public debt consistent with government

solvency, this upper bound is likely to be breached eventually. If the

authorities follow a budgetary policy of running a deficit or surplus

equal to the trend growth of money demand (i.e. equal to the trend

non—inflationary seigniorage that can be raised) a solvency crisis is

certain in finite time.

     To prevent both reserve thresholds and public debt ceilings from

being breached, flexible dce policy and a flexible use of the primary

(non—interest) public sector deficit are required in this model.

Viability of the idealized gold standard analysed here requires the

active and flexible support of monetary and fiscal policy. Even prima

facie 'sound' unconditional monetary and fiscal rules such as : no

sterilization of balance—of payments deficits or surpluses and a

balanced budget, are inconsistent with the gold standard's long—run

survival. This vulnerability of the gold standard should not come asa

surprise of those who have studied the theory and history of commodity

stabilization schemes which attempt to stabilize the price of some

commodity by purchasing for or selling from a. buffer stock. Formally,

the gold standird is essentially an extreme version of such a commodity

stabilization scheme, as it aims not merely to stabilize but to fix the

price of a commodity. The same laws of probability that cause the
                                                                   4,4




eventual collapse of commodity stabilization schemes, most   recently    in

the case of tin, jeopardize the long—run viability of a gold standard.

     An issue which remains to be investigated is the extent to which

the conclusions of this paper carry over to the case where international

reserves consist (perhaps in part) of the liabilities of one or more of

the national monetary authorities and carry a market—determined rate of

interest. .Jhen reserves can be borrowed with little or no financial

penalty, the distinction between liquidity crises and solvency crises

becomes blurred, and we should only expect to see a run on a nation's

currency as one aspect of a default crisis affecting the whole of that

nation's public debt.
