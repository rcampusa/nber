    International trade policies are often compared across countries and over time for a variety of

purposes. Analysts use such measures as arithmetic or trade-weighted average tariffs, Non-Tariff

Barrier (NTB) coverage ratios and measures of tariff dispersion. All such measures are without

theoretical foundation. In this paper we develop and characterise a theoretically-based index number

of trade policy which is appropriate to trade negotiations. We also present a sample application

which demonstrates the operationality of our index and shows that it differs significantly from

previously employed atheoretic indexes.

    We call our index the Mercantilist Trade Restrictiveness Index (MTRI), since it takes as its

starting point the Mercantilist preoccupation with the volume of trade.           Modern avatars of

Mercantilist thinking are everywhere, and their concern with trade volumes plays an important

constraining role in policy formation. For one example, successive GATT rounds of reciprocal trade

negotiations have interpreted reciprocity in tariff negotiations to mean equivalent import volume

expansion. The WTO goes further, sanctioning retaliation by the offended party to displace a volume

of trade equal to that displaced by the original offending protection. (See Bagwell and Staiger (1997)

for discussion.) For another example, interest group pleading and even U.S. government negotiators

have focused in recent years on trade volumes in auto parts and in semiconductors, as well as on

aggregate U.S.-Japanese bilateral trade volumes. The ubiquity of such examples shows that there is

a demand on the part of practical trade policy makers for measures of trade restrictiveness which hold

trade volume constant.1 Such measures thus have a useful role to play both as an input to

  An index of home country tariffs which holds constant the real income of the foreign country is an
appealing alternative for a two-country world. In a many-country world, this loses its appeal because
an index of Japan’s trade distortions can hold constant only one of its trading partners’ real incomes.
Thus there would be N!1 different indexes of each country’s trade policies, differing from each other
in complex and unintuitive ways. A single constant-volume index treats no one trading partner as
special and is appealing as a summary of a country’s restrictiveness relative to the rest of the world.
negotiations and as a performance measure of negotiations.

    The MTRI is defined as the uniform deflator which, applied to the undistorted traded goods

prices, yields the same trade volume (valued at external prices) as the initial set of distortions.2

Defining the MTRI as a deflator makes clear its connection with ideal price deflators in general

equilibrium (see Anderson and Neary, 1996). The MTRI is the general equilibrium version of an

index earlier proposed by Corden (1966), which in a quantity index form was independently proposed

by Leamer (1974).3

    In Anderson and Neary (1996), we addressed the policy index number problem in the context of

the welfare effect of trade restrictions. We provided a rigorous theoretical foundation for the Trade

Restrictiveness Index (TRI), which operationalises the idea of finding a uniform tariff which yields

the same real income as the original differentiated tariff structure. We advocated its use in studies

of openness and growth and in other applications where it is desirable to have a measure of the

restrictiveness of trade policy which is independent of real income.

    For purposes of trade negotiations, however, comparing levels of protection with an index which

holds constant the level of real income is less appropriate. Nations care about the effect of their

partners' policies on their own interests, not their partners' interests. This need is addressed by the

MTRI, which operationalises the idea of finding a uniform tariff which yields the same trade volume

as the original differentiated tariff structure.



2
 This definition of the MTRI compares an arbitrary tariff structure with free trade. More generally,
when two different tariff structures are compared, the MTRI is defined as the uniform deflator which,
applied to the new set of distorted prices, yields the same trade volume as the initial set of distortions.
3
 Neither the Corden nor the Leamer indexes include the disposition of tariff revenue in the analysis.
Hence they are not full general equilibrium indexes.

                                                    2
    The main objective of the theoretical section of the paper is to relate the MTRI to the TRI and

to standard atheoretic measures. In particular, we show how changes in both indexes can be

characterised fully in terms of changes in two summary measures of the tariff structure, which we call

the generalised mean and generalised variance of tariffs. These theoretical linkages are of interest in

themselves, especially since they imply that the MTRI must exceed the TRI when trade policies are

compared with free trade. In addition, the theoretical results help to explain the clear patterns which

emerge from the empirical comparisons of these measures.

    For the practitioner, this paper offers a consistent index number of trade restrictiveness which

meets the Mercantilist concern with trade volume. The practical analyst is confounded at present by

the thousands of different trade barriers and the absence of a theoretically based index number to

summarize them. The paper concentrates on tariffs, but also offers an approach to the evaluation of

quotas.4 By offering the first application of the MTRI, the paper shows that use of a proper index

makes a great deal of difference.

    Section 1 sets out the basic model of the economy and defines the MTRI. Section 2 derives the

properties of the MTRI and relates them to the properties of the average tariff and other indexes,

especially the TRI. Section 3 extends the MTRI to cover the case of quotas. Section 4 presents the

empirical analysis, which uses a 25-country cross-section of data from around 1990, and a 5-country

panel of year-on-year changes from the late 1980’s. The MTRI differs from standard indexes in its

implications, often dramatically. It also differs substantially from the TRI.


4
  Domestic taxes and subsidies in goods and factor markets can also affect trade significantly, as
shown by their prominence in recent policy negotiations. Anderson, Bannister and Neary (1995)
extend the TRI to take account of such domestic distortions. A volume-equivalent index of the trade
restrictiveness of domestic distortions is readily constructed by combining the methods of this paper
with that one.

                                                  3
                                             1. Theory

   The economy is assumed to be in competitive equilibrium, to have no distortions other than tariffs,

and to be characterized by a single representative consumer. Traded goods prices are fixed on world

markets. (Relaxing these assumptions leads to well-understood complications without adding any

insight. In practice, the index we develop can be calculated in the context of any operational model

economy.) Section 1.1 lays out the basic formal model of a tariff-distorted open economy, Section

1.2 introduces the import and import volume functions and Section 1.3 defines the MTRI.

1.1 The Model of a Tariff-Distorted Open Economy

   The behaviour of the private sector is described by the trade expenditure function E(B,u). This

function gives the expenditure needed by the representative consumer to attain the utility level u

facing the price vector B of traded goods subject to tariffs, net of the income it receives from its

ownership of the factors of production. Both of these in turn are represented by standard expenditure

and GDP functions respectively:

                  E(B,u)    '     e(B,u) & g(B) .                                                (1)



In the background are factor endowments, prices of non-traded goods and factors (which are

endogenous given B and u), and prices of traded goods not subject to tariffs. Standard properties of

the underlying functions (Shephard's and Hotelling's Lemmas) allow us to identify the price

derivatives of the trade expenditure function as the economy's general-equilibrium utility-compensated

(or Hicksian) import demand functions:

                    EB(B,u)     '    m c(B,u) .                                                  (2)



                                                    4
For later use, we note the derivatives of these functions:

       c                                                c
    mu     ' eBu ' euxI               and           mB      ' EBB .                                 (3)


In words, the utility derivatives of the import demand functions equal the Marshallian income

derivatives of demand xI scaled by the marginal cost of utility eu; while the matrix of price derivatives

equals the Hessian of E and so is negative semi-definite (which for convenience and with little loss

of generality we strengthen henceforth to negative definite).

    The trade expenditure function completely summarises private-sector behaviour in our model

economy. In the presence of tariffs, we must add to this the behaviour of the government, whose sole

activity is to collect tariff revenue and rebate it to the representative consumer in a lump sum. The

outcome of both public and private behaviour is summarised by the balance of trade function:5

           B(B,B(,u)     /    E(B,u) & (B&B() . EB(B,u) .                                           (4)


This differs from the trade expenditure function by the tariff revenue term, where the vector B!B*

denotes the tariff wedge between domestic and world prices. The derivative of the balance of trade

function with respect to the level of utility is:

                    Bu ' eu [1 & (B&B() . x I ] .                                                   (5)


This equals eu times the inverse of the shadow price of foreign exchange, which measures the welfare

gain to a unit increase in the economy's purchasing power. We assume throughout that it is positive,



5
 All vectors are column vectors; a prime (N) denotes a transpose; and a dot (.) denotes a vector inner
product.

                                                    5
since otherwise the economy is initially so distorted that welfare would rise if some of its endowment

were destroyed. (See Anderson and Neary (1992) for more discussion and references.) As for the

derivatives of the balance of trade function with respect to domestic prices, they equal:

                      BB)   '    & (B&B()) EBB .                                                  (6)


This vector gives the marginal welfare effects of domestic price changes. Since the balance of trade

function equals the amount of foreign exchange needed to sustain utility u facing domestic and world

prices B and B*, the fall in B following a tariff increase (which raises the corresponding element of

B) is a money metric measure of the resulting welfare cost.

     The general equilibrium of the economy is reached when utility is at the level consistent with the

balance of trade constraint. This requirement equates the balance of trade function to any lump-sum

income received from abroad, denoted by b:

                        B(B,B(,u)     '    b.                                                     (7)



The balance of trade function thus allows us to summarise the equilibrium of an economy subject to

tariffs in terms of a single compact equation.

1.2 Import and Import Volume Functions

     As with an individual consumer, we can relate the economy's Hicksian import demand functions

(2) to their Marshallian equivalents.6 The latter depend on domestic and world prices and on

exogenous income b: m = m(B,B*,b). In equilibrium (given by the balance of payments condition

(7)), the Hicksian and Marshallian import demand functions coincide:


6
    For a more formal derivation, see Neary and Schweinberger (1986).

                                                   6
               m c(B,u)         '      m[B,B(, B(B,B(,u)] .                                          (8)



Differentiating this "Slutsky Identity" with respect to u and using (3) and (5) yields:


                   mb       '       [1&(B&B().xI]&1 xI .                                             (9)


Thus an increased transfer from abroad raises demand for imports to an extent determined by the

marginal income responses xI, grossed up by the shadow price of foreign exchange. Differentiating

(8) with respect to B gives a standard Slutsky decomposition of the effects of price changes into

substitution and income effects:

                                          c
                       mB       '      mB & mb BB) .                                               (10)


Of course, world prices are fixed, so income effects of domestic price changes arise only to the extent

that tariffs are in place. This is seen more clearly by eliminating BB using (6), to obtain an alternative

expression for the price derivatives:

                                                        c
                  mB        '       [ I % mb(B&B()) ] mB .                                         (11)


where I is the identity matrix.

   Finally, since we are concerned with the volume of tariff-restricted trade (measured at world

prices), it is convenient to express its equilibrium level as a function of the variables characterising

the general equilibrium of the economy. This leads to two scalar import volume functions, one

compensated:




                                                             7
                  M c(B,B(, u)      /         B(. m c(B,u) .                                   (12)



and the other uncompensated:


                  M(B,B(, b)        /        B(. m(B,B(,b) .                                   (13)



The derivatives of these functions are easily derived from the corresponding derivatives of the import

demand functions. Here we note only that the derivative of the Marshallian import volume function

with respect to exogenous income is:


b   '    B(. mb     '     [1&(B&B(). xI]&1 B( . xI ,             0 < Mb <                      (14)


This can be interpreted as the marginal propensity to consume tariff-constrained imports, valued at

world prices, and it plays a crucial role in the analysis below. We assume throughout that it lies

between zero and one. Finally, the Slutsky decomposition of the import demand functions given in

(10) implies a corresponding decomposition of the price derivatives of the Marshallian import volume

function. By analogy with (8), we can relate the Hicksian and Marshallian import volume functions

by a Slutsky identity:

             M c(B,B(, u)       '       M [B,B(, B(B,B(, u)] ,                                 (15)



which, on differentiation, gives the required decomposition:

                                         c
                     MB     '       MB & M b BB) .                                             (16)


Armed with these results, we are ready to define the MTRI and to investigate its properties.


                                                           8
1.3 The Mercantilist Trade Restrictiveness Index

   We wish to compare the restrictiveness of trade policy between two equilibria, denoted by "0" and

"1" respectively.    Following Anderson and Neary (1996), we define the Mercantilist Trade

Restrictiveness Index (MTRI) as the uniform price deflator µ which, when applied to the prices in the

new equilibrium, B1, yields the same volume (at world prices) of tariff-restricted imports as in the old

equilibrium, M0:

             µ(B1,M 0)     /    {µ: M(B1/µ) ' M 0}.                                               (17)



We simplify notation by dropping the explicit dependence of the trade volume on the exogenous

variables B* and b, which are set at their period-0 values.

   The interpretation of the MTRI depends on the policy stance in the new equilibrium. If B1 equals

its free trade value B*, µ equals the inverse of the uniform tariff factor which is equivalent in volume

to the initial distortion structure. The Mercantilist uniform tariff equivalent is defined as 1/µ!1. For

other values of B1, µ equals the uniform tariff factor surcharge which is volume-equivalent to the

changes in trade policy.

   Reflecting policy concerns similar to those leading to the MTRI, it may be useful to define other

members of a group of trade-balance-constrained trade restrictiveness indexes based on the same

logic. For example, in U.S.-Japan trade negotiations, the bilateral trade balance is often a focal point.

In this case the relevant constraint for the index number for Japan might include both Japanese

imports and exports to the U.S., both distorted and undistorted.            Alternatively, U.S.-Japan

negotiations have also focused on bilateral trade in particular product groups, such as motor vehicles

and parts or electronics. All cases in this class can be straightforwardly developed using the tools


                                                   9
above.



                                      2. Relation to Other Indexes

   Useful insight into the meaning of the MTRI is gained by analyzing its relationship with other

index numbers. The analysis also helps put in perspective the empirical results in Section 4. We first

lay out the MTRI, the TRI and the trade-weighted average tariff in a comparable local rate of change

format in Section 2.1. We then show in Section 2.2 that changes in both the MTRI and the TRI can

be fully characterised in terms of changes in the generalised mean and variance of the tariff schedule.

Finally, Section 2.3 compares the levels of the MTRI and TRI.

2.1 The MTRI, the TRI and the Average Tariff

   Following Anderson and Neary (1996), the TRI is defined as:

              )(B1,u 0)    /    {): B(B1/), u 0) ' b 0} .                                       (18)



This has a similar uniform tariff deflator interpretation to the MTRI. The difference is that its

reference point is the base-period level of utility rather than the volume of trade. The value of ) is

the uniform tariff deflator which, if applied to the new prices B1, would ensure balance-of-payments

equilibrium at the initial level of utility.

   Both the MTRI and the TRI are defined in implicit form, so comparing their levels is difficult in

general. However, we can say a great deal if we first consider local changes. The proportional rate

of change (denoted by a circumflex) of the MTRI is:




                                                   10
                                         MB . dB
                            µ̂       '             ,                                          (19)
                                         MB . B

with MB evaluated at (B1/µ). Similarly, the proportional rate of change of the TRI is:

                                         BB . dB
                            )
                            ˆ        '             ,                                          (20)
                                         BB . B

where BB is evaluated at (B1/),u0). Each of these in turn may be compared with the change in the

trade-weighted average tariff, Ja:

                                          EB . dB
                            dJa      '                 .                                      (21)
                                          EB . B

   Considering these three expressions, we see that, multiplying and dividing by prices in the

numerator, each can be written as a weighted sum of the proportional changes in prices dBi /Bi. The

change in the MTRI in (19) weights proportional price changes by their marginal volumetric shares,

MiBi /MB .B. The change in the TRI in (20) weights the proportional changes in prices by their

marginal welfare shares, BiBi /BB .B. Finally, the change in the average tariff in (21) weights

proportional price changes by their average trade shares, EiBi /EB .B.

   An important feature of the MTRI change is that it incorporates the effect of real income changes

on trade volume whereas the TRI change does not. To deal appropriately with this, it is convenient

to define a "compensated" MTRI:


       µ c(B1, u 0, M 0 )        /   {µ c: M c(B1/µ, u 0 ) ' M 0},                            (22)



whose rate of change is:




                                                           11
                                         c
                               c
                                       MB . dB
                          µ̂       '                .                                           (23)
                                          c
                                       MB . B



Once again, this is a weighted sum of proportional price changes, where the weights can be

interpreted as marginal trade shares.

   Now, suppose the initial levels of µ, ) and µ c are the same. Then we can write the rate of change

of µ as a weighted average of the rates of change of the other two indexes:


                     µ̂        '   8µ̂ c % (1&8)),
                                                ˆ                                               (24)



where the weight is simply:

                                         c
                                       MB . B
                           8       /            .                                               (25)
                                       MB . B



The weight 8 is the ratio of the compensated to the uncompensated effect on import volume of a 1%

rise in domestic distorted prices. It is ordinarily between zero and one and it is smaller the more

important are income effects relative to substitution effects. (Recall from (11) that 8 is unity in the

neighbourhood of free trade.)

2.2 Generalised Tariff Moments

   Next, we wish to relate changes in the MTRI and the TRI to changes in the mean and variance

of the tariff distribution. This turns out to be possible provided, following Anderson (1995), we work

not with trade-weighted tariff moments but with generalised tariff moments, weighted by the

elements in the substitution matrix EBB.


                                                        12
    At this point it is convenient to switch notation. Define the ad valorem tariff on good i as Ji

=(Bi!B*i )/B*i. Let x denote a diagonal matrix with the elements of the vector x on the principal

diagonal. Then the level of and the change in domestic prices can be written as:

     B    '    B( (4%J)                and                dB      '         B( dJ,                 (26)



Next, define the matrix of substitution effects normalised by world prices as:

                                           B(EBB B(
                          S        /                  .                                            (27)
                                           B()EBBB(



By construction S is a positive definite matrix all of whose elements sum to one: 4NS4=1, where 4 is

a vector of ones. We can now define the generalised average tariff:


                              J̄       /     4)SJ,                                                 (28)



and the generalised variance of tariffs:


           V     /    (J&4J̄)) S (J&4J̄)        '         J) S J& (J̄)2 .                          (29)



V must be positive (since it is a quadratic form in the positive definite matrix S) but J̄ can be negative

if tariffs are non-uniform and disproportionately higher on goods with relatively large cross-

substitution effects.7 The changes in these generalised moments are:


7
  Equation (28) for the generalised average tariff can be written as Ei wiJi, where the weights are
defined as: wi/Ej Sji . Recalling that S is defined to be positive definite, the weight on a given tariff
rate is more likely to be positive the higher the own-substitution effect for that good and the more
it is complementary with rather than substitutable for other goods. A sufficient condition for all
weights to be positive is that the normalised substitution matrix have a dominant diagonal.

                                                                13
 dJ̄    '   4)SdJ             and                dV    '      2(J) SdJ&J̄dJ̄) .                  (30)



The change in the variance of tariffs can also be interpreted as twice the (generalised) covariance

between initial tariff rates and their changes:


  Cov (J, dJ) ' (J&4J̄))S(dJ&4dJ̄) ' J)SdJ&J̄dJ̄ ' ½dV .                                         (31)



   It is now straightforward to express the changes in the three indexes of interest in terms of dJ̄ and

dV. From (23) and (27), the change in the compensated MTRI is:


                                    4)S dJ             dJ̄
                 µ̂ c   '                         '           .                                  (32)
                               4 S(4%J)
                                )
                                                       1%J̄

Thus the change in the compensated MTRI is identical to the proportionate change in the generalised

average tariff. Similarly, the change in the TRI can be expressed as:


                            J) SdJ                J̄dJ̄ % ½ dV
            )
            ˆ     '                          '                    .                              (33)
                        J) S (4%J)                 J̄(1%J̄) % V

and the change in the MTRI as:


                (4%MbJ))S dJ                     (1%MbJ̄) dJ̄ % ½ Mb dV
   µ̂   '                               '                                   .                    (34)
              (4%MbJ))S(4%J)                     (1%MbJ̄) (1%J̄) % M b V



The role of income effects, represented by the marginal propensity to spend on imports Mb, is clearly

crucial: they affect the sensitivity of the MTRI but not of the TRI to changes in the generalised mean

and variance of the tariff schedule.

   The significance of equations (33) and (34) is that they are completely general, with no restrictions


                                                             14
on the types of tariff changes or on the structure of the economy. Their implications can be set out

in terms of three propositions and a diagram. First, it is immediate that:



Proposition 1: Assume the denominators of )ˆ and µ̂ are positive. Then, both the MTRI and the TRI

are increasing in the generalised mean and variance of the tariff schedule.



Note that, from (33) and (34), an over-strong sufficient condition for the denominators of both )ˆ and µ̂

to be positive is that J̄, the generalised average tariff, be positive.

    Next, consider the relative sensitivity of the two indexes to changes in the generalised mean and

variance. This is best understood by writing the changes in both indexes as weighted averages of the

changes in the two tariff moments. For the TRI, (33) implies:


     ˆ ' " dJ̄ % (1&") dV ,                            J̄(1%J̄)
     )                                        "/                 .                                (35)
           1%J̄        2V                           J̄(1%J̄) % V

Similarly, for the MTRI, (34) implies:8


           dJ̄         dV                          (1%MbJ̄) (1%J̄)
    ' $        % (1&$)    ,             $/                                                        (36)
          1%J̄         2V                     (1%MbJ̄) (1%J̄) % M bV

Using D" and D$ to denote the denominators of " and $ respectively, the difference between the

weights is:

                                     (1%J̄) V
                        $& " '                ,                                                   (37)
                                      D"D$



8
  From (24), it may be checked that 8=($!")/(1!"). Moreover, from (29) and (31), dV/2V equals
the slope coefficient from a generalised least squares regression of dJ on J.

                                                    15
Assuming the two denominators are positive, " is always less than $. Thus the TRI is less sensitive

than the MTRI to changes in the generalised mean tariff but more sensitive to changes in the

generalised variance of tariffs. Finally, the difference between the changes in the two indexes is:


    ˆ & µ̂ ' ($&") dV & dJ̄                  &VdJ̄ % (1%J̄)½ dV
    )                                    '                      .                              (38)
                   2V   1%J̄                       D" D$

This may be expressed more compactly by defining the generalised coefficient of variation of tariff

factors and its rate of change as follows:

                      V½                  dV    dJ̄
                C /           Y   Ĉ '       &      .                                          (39)
                      1%J̄                2V   1%J̄

Hence, recalling from (37) that $!" is positive provided the denominators of )ˆ and µ̂ are positive,

we may conclude:



Proposition 2: Assume that the denominators of )ˆ and µ̂ are positive. Then, starting from the same

point, the TRI increases by more than the MTRI if and only if the generalised coefficient of variation

of tariff factors rises:

                             dV    dJ̄
            )
            ˆ > µ̂     ]        >            ]   Ĉ > 0 .                                      (40)
                             2V   1 %J̄

   The full relationship between changes in the TRI and MTRI on the one hand and changes in the

generalised tariff moments on the other is illustrated in Figure 1, drawn in the space of (dV, dJ̄).

From Proposition 1, both indexes increase together in the north-east quadrant and fall together in the

south-west quadrant. The upward-sloping dashed line is the locus along which )ˆ =µ̂. Only in the

regions denoted I and II (which lie between the )ˆ =0 and µ̂=0 loci), do they move in opposite


                                                   16
directions. In Region I, the fall in the generalised average tariff is sufficient to offset the rise in the

generalised variance as far as µ is concerned but not as far as ) is concerned: µ falls and ) rises.

Exactly the opposite configuration applies in Region II. (From (24), the µ̂=0 locus lies between the

)ˆ =0 locus and the µ̂ c=0 locus, which from (32) coincides with the vertical axis.) Note that a rise in

) is equivalent to a fall in welfare and a rise in µ is equivalent to a fall in import volume. Hence

Figure 1 gives a complete characterisation of the effects on welfare and import volume of arbitrary

changes in the generalised tariff moments.

2.3 Comparing the Levels of the MTRI and TRI

   Having derived the relationships between changes in the MTRI and the TRI, we can now relate

their levels, at least for the comparison with free trade. The key result is:



Proposition 3: The MTRI exceeds the TRI for comparisons with free trade, provided the generalised

average tariff is positive. The ranking is strict except when tariffs are uniform, in which case all

tariff indexes are equal.



Proof: By definition, µ(B0,M0)=)(B0,M0)=1. In words, when the initial tariff policy does not

change, both indexes equal one. Hence, comparing the initial tariff policy (B0) with free trade (B*),

the difference between µ and ) is the same as the difference between their proportional rates of

change, provided this is one-signed over the relevant interval:

                                       B(

                                       m
     lnµ(B(, M 0) & ln)(B(, u 0) '             µ̂(B, M 0) & )(B,
                                                            ˆ u 0) .                                (41)
                                       B   0




                                                       17
To find a path in price space from B0 to B* along which the expression in brackets is always non-

negative, we proceed in two stages:

(i) First, we eliminate the dispersion in the initial tariff structure by radial steps:

                   dJ ' & (J&4J̄)d,,        d,>0.                                                  (42)



Substituting from (42) into (30), we see that, along this segment of the path, the generalised average

tariff is constant (dJ̄=0) and the generalised variance is falling, provided it was strictly positive to

begin with (dV=!2Vd,<0). Hence the generalised coefficient of variation is also falling and

Proposition 2 applies. With the initial generalised average tariff J̄0 assumed to be positive, it also

follows from (19) and (20) that both indexes are falling. Hence, along this segment of the path, we

have 0>µ̂>)ˆ . Continue in this fashion from B0 to B*(1+J̄0), i.e., until all the dispersion in the tariff

structure is eliminated.

(ii) Next, with C=V=0, we implement a uniform radial reduction in tariffs: dJ=!Jd,. Again, from

(30), this must reduce the generalised mean tariff (dJ̄=!J̄d,) and leave the generalised variance

unchanged (since it was zero to begin with): dV=!2Vd,=0. Hence, from (33) and (34), both indexes

fall by the same percentage amount along this segment of the path: 0>µ̂=)ˆ . Proceeding along this

segment of the path until we reach free trade, the proposition follows immediately.

                                                                                                       ~

   To interpret the proposition, recall that for comparisons with free trade, µ and ) equal the

inverses of the uniform tariff equivalents which are import-volume-equivalent and welfare-equivalent

to B0 respectively. So, the facts that µ exceeds ) and that both are less than one means that the

welfare-equivalent uniform tariff exceeds the import-volume-equivalent uniform tariff. Thus the tariff


                                                    18
levels calculated according to the MTRI logic generally under-estimate the tariff levels which would

be appropriate for welfare comparisons.



                                     3. Quotas and the MTRI

   Quotas are an important form of trade intervention in many countries. Moreover, other kinds of

non-tariff barriers may often be represented as quotas. The application of Section 4 includes many

examples of non-tariff barriers treated in this way. Thus it is important to extend the definition of the

MTRI to incorporate quotas. For simplicity, we continue to assume that all distortions are in trade

only.

   Let q denote the vector of quota-constrained goods, with domestic prices p and world prices p*;

while m, B and B* continue to denote the quantity and prices of tariff-constrained imports. As before,

we seek a scalar deflator which, when applied to the policy variables in the new equilibrium, {q1,B1},

will yield the same import volume as the old equilibrium, M0. However, it would not make sense to

deflate the quota vector directly. Instead, we apply the deflation factor to the domestic-market-

clearing prices of the quota-constrained goods.

   To formalise these ideas, we adapt the techniques developed for the analysis of quotas in

Anderson and Neary (1992) and applied to derive the TRI in the presence of quotas by Anderson and

Neary (1996). The net expenditure on non-quota-constrained goods, called by Anderson and Neary

(1992) the distorted trade expenditure function, is:


              Ẽ(q,B,u)    /   max{E(p,B,u) & p.q},                                               (43)
                                 p



where the undistorted trade expenditure function E is defined in a similar manner to (1). The


                                                   19
derivatives of Ẽ with respect to B give the compensated import demand functions for goods subject

to tariffs, as in earlier sections; while the derivatives with respect to q give (minus) the "virtual" prices

of the quotas:


 ẼB(q,B,u) ' m c(q,B,u)         and       Ẽq(q,B,u) ' & p(q,B,u) .                                  (44)


Of course, when {q,B,u} relate to the same equilibrium, the virtual prices equal the market-clearing

domestic prices. The distorted balance of trade function can now be defined as:


B̃(q,B,u)    /    Ẽ(q,B,u) % p.q & (B&B().m & (p&p ())(I&T) q                                        (45)


where m and p are determined from (44) and exogenous variables are suppressed to economise on

notation. This is more complex than the corresponding undistorted function (4), since there are now

two sets of trade restrictions, and (following standard convention) we assume that the rents generated

from each are disbursed differently. The private sector receives all the tariff revenue, as in Section

2, but only some of the quota revenue, with the elements of the T vector (0<
                                                                           _ Ti<
                                                                               _ 1) denoting the share

of quota rents on good i lost to foreigners. Finally, equilibrium utility is determined implicitly by the

balance of payments equilibrium condition:


                         B̃(q,B,u)     '    b.                                                        (46)



   These functions allow us to determine the appropriate virtual prices and characterise the

equilibrium in the presence of quotas. Next, to define the MTRI itself, we need to define the

uncompensated volume-of-trade function given the prices of the quota-constrained goods. The steps

in doing this are similar to those followed in Section 1.2. First, the compensated volume-of-trade


                                                     20
function is an extension of (12):


            M c(p, B, u)       /    p.E p(p,B,u) % B(.EB(p,B,u) .                             (47)


To derive the uncompensated volume-of-trade function from this, we must specify the undistorted

balance of trade function. We do this by noting that the undistorted and distorted functions can be

equated when the former is evaluated at the appropriate virtual prices. Thus:


B(p̃,B,u)     '     B̃(q,B,u)           when       p̃   /     & Ẽq(q,B,u)                    (48)


As in (15), the uncompensated volume-of-trade function, M(p,B,b), can now be defined implicitly as

follows:

                  M c(p,B,u)        '    M [p,B,B(p,B,u)] .                                   (49)



   We are finally able to define the MTRI itself:

             µ(q 1, B1, M 0)       / {µ: M(p̃/µ, B1/µ) ' M 0} ,                               (50)



where the virtual prices p̃ are determined endogenously by the requirement that domestic markets for

quota-constrained goods clear, i.e., by equations (46) and (48) evaluated at (q1,B1). With the quotas

reduced to their price equivalents, the interpretation of the MTRI now proceeds in exactly the same

way as in the case of tariffs only.




                                                        21
                                      4. A Sample Application

   The MTRI can be made operational with only slight modifications of any standard Computable

General Equilibrium (CGE) model. All that is necessary is to define the virtual prices p̃ and the

volume of distorted trade M. Then the deflator µ can be calculated. Ideally, the CGE model should

be disaggregated with respect to trade distortions (and those domestic distortions which are important

in considering trade policy). Most CGE models are highly aggregated with respect to trade and so

are not ideally suitable for this purpose. It should be possible, however, with strategic use of nested

CES structures, to disaggregate many existing CGE models appropriately.

   Applications are chiefly constrained by the paucity of detailed distortion data. While limits on

information are notorious for non-tariff distortions, there is also surprisingly little systematic detailed

information on tariffs and associated import volumes across a broad spectrum of countries and years.

Here, we draw on Anderson’s (1998) application of the TRI and use the same data and CGE model

as a basis for calculating the MTRI and comparing it with the TRI and the standard indexes.

   Anderson (1998) develops a tractable CGE model with a highly aggregated CES/CET industrial

structure and a very disaggregated trade structure, and calculates the TRI for both a cross section of

countries and for a few cases of year-on-year changes. The model's main virtue is that it requires

relatively little information about the domestic production structure, so a standard model framework

can be used across a large group of countries. At the same time, it permits the use of as detailed trade

distortions data as the analyst can find.

   Limits on detailed trade and trade distortion data dictate the scope of the results presented below.

The data were obtained by the World Bank from the TRAINS (TRade Analysis and INformation

System) database (UNCTAD (1996)), supplemented by trade and trade distortions data supplied by


                                                    22
country economists at the Bank. Non-Tariff Barriers (NTB's) are treated as binding quotas in the

model. To obtain consistent trade flow and trade distortions data, more detailed data are aggregated

to the four-digit Harmonized System level using trade-weighted average tariffs, and for NTB's using

the procedure that a four-digit category is counted as NTB-constrained if 75% or more of its

elements are "hard-core" NTB-constrained.9 Some such atheoretic aggregation procedure is

unavoidable due to inconsistencies in classification systems of the most detailed distortion and trade

data.

      A key practical issue is the treatment of quota rents, bearing in mind that information on domestic

prices (and hence on quota premia) are not available. In simulating the move to free trade (i.e., in

Table 1 and Figure 2 below) we assume that rent-retaining tariffs capture all the quota rent, so all

NTB's are non-binding at the margin in the initial equilibrium.10 Hence the policy regime is assumed

to be one of tariffs only, with quotas replaced by their tariff equivalents. In evaluating year-on-year

changes (Table 3 below), we assume instead that binding quotas generate rents which are entirely lost

to foreigners or to rent seeking, apart from the fraction which is retained by tariffs. Alternative

expedients (discussed in Anderson (1998)) lead to similar qualitative results.

      Table 1 presents the results of calculating the TRI and MTRI using the CGE model for a cross-

section of 25 countries. In this table we are comparing the actual data for the country and year

indicated with free trade (so B1=B* and J1=0). Hence we present both the TRI and MTRI in terms

of their uniform tariff equivalents (i.e., 1/)!1 and 1/µ!1) to facilitate comparison with the trade-

     Tariffs on NTB-constrained goods are in practice usually quite high.

weighted average tariff, Ja0. To see why this makes sense, we can rewrite the definition of the MTRI

from (17) as follows:

            M[B((4%J1)/µ] ' M[B((4%J0)] ' M 0 .                                                   (51)



With J1=0, we seek a scalar measure of the vector J0. The atheoretic measure is the trade-weighted

average tariff Ja0, while the theoretically correct measure is 1/µ!1, the uniform tariff that is import-

volume-equivalent to J0. A similar argument applies to the uniform tariff equivalent of the TRI,

1/)!1, which gives the uniform tariff that is welfare-equivalent to J0. To facilitate comparison of the

columns in Table 1, Table 2 presents the results of simple regressions and rank correlations between

the columns. Figure 2 illustrates the data from Table 1, with countries ranked by their trade-weighted

average tariff.

   The first observation suggested by Tables 1 and 2 and Figure 2 is that the MTRI and the trade-

weighted average tariff tend to move closely together on average. (The correlation and rank

correlation coefficients between the two are 0.987 and 0.972 respectively.) However, for individual

countries involved in trade negotiations, this does not mean that the two measures are

interchangeable. On the contrary, the average tariff underpredicts the MTRI in all but three of the

twenty-five cases. The effect is not statistically significant (as Table 2 shows) and the underprediction

is only 8.9% on average. However, it is important in a number of individual cases, exceeding 15%

for Austria, Indonesia, Morocco and the U.S.A. This suggests that in trade negotiations, most

countries would prefer to use the MTRI to evaluate their own trade policies but average tariffs to

evaluate their partners'. On the other hand, for India, the average tariff underpredicts the MTRI by

7%. So the choice between the two measures is significant and of unpredictable sign in individual


                                                   24
cases.

     The second observation suggested by Table 1 and Figure 2 is that the TRI exceeds the MTRI by

a significant margin: 48.7% on average. We know from Proposition 3 that µ must be greater than

) (and hence 1/)!1 must be greater than 1/µ!1), for comparisons with free trade (at least when both

indexes are generated by the same utility-consistent model, as here). This theoretical prediction is

borne out for every case in the table.11 The relationship between the two is weaker than that between

the MTRI and the average tariff (with correlation and rank correlation coefficients of 0.886 and 0.800

respectively). The percentage divergence also varies considerably, ranging from over 100% in three

cases to less than 10% for Bolivia, Mexico and Peru. Here too the theoretical results of Section 2

provide some insight. Proposition 2 showed that, for small changes, ) rises by more than µ if and

only the generalised coefficient of variation of tariffs increases. This suggests that the actual

coefficient of variation of tariffs might help predict the divergence between the two indexes (since the

generalised coefficient is not available in practice). The last column in Table 1 give the coefficient

of variation of tariffs and the final regression in Table 2 confirms that the percentage excess of the

TRI over the MTRI is positively and significantly related to the coefficient of variation of tariffs.

Overall, it is clear that the two different purposes of evaluating tariff structures yield very different

pictures of the relative restrictiveness of nations’ trade policies.

     Table 3 turns to consider a small sample of year-on-year changes. We now wish to have a

measure of the change in the tariff structure from J0 to J1. Referring back to (51), the theoretically

correct measure is simply µ (rather than its uniform tariff equivalent), while the corresponding


11
  The numbers in the table are given to only three significant digits, so in one case, Bolivia, the values
shown for the two indexes are equal to one another. From the raw data, the percentage excess of the
TRI over the MTRI for Bolivia is 0.22%, while the next smallest differential (Peru) is 0.88%.

                                                   25
atheoretic measure is (1+Ja1)/(1+Ja0). Thus, a value greater than one in any of the first six numeric

columns of the table indicates that, according to the measure in question, trade policy became more

restrictive between the two years indicated. Because tariffs on NTB-constrained goods serve the

positive function of retaining rent rather than the negative one of restricting trade, we report average

tariffs for these separately. We also distinguish between the average tariffs on intermediate and final

goods categories. In addition, Table 3 reports the (arithmetic) change in the coefficient of variation

of tariffs, and gives information on two measures of NTB restrictiveness: the initial level of and the

(arithmetic) change in the NTB coverage ratio, and the (percentage) change in the volume of NTB-

constrained imports.

   In dramatic contrast to the results of Table 1, the MTRI in Table 3 differs considerably from the

standard indexes. This echoes the finding of Anderson (1998), where the TRI was shown to differ

dramatically from the average tariff and from all the other standard indicators in evaluating year-on-

year changes in policy. There is a good reason for this. In the hypothetical leap to free trade, all

standard indicators of trade policy move in the same direction. By contrast, in most real-world trade

reforms there are conflicting tendencies which make it much more important to take the structure of

index numbers into account. In all cases except the disaggregated average tariffs on intermediate

goods, the tariff measures and the MTRI are negatively correlated. As might be expected,

comparison of the MTRI and the two direct quantitative NTB measures (the change in the NTB

coverage ratio and the proportional change in volume of NTB-constrained goods) shows a closer

relationship. Many of the countries analysed had a high initial incidence of NTB's and were

liberalizing NTB's in the years considered.

   Comparing the changes in the MTRI and the TRI, the first columns of Table 3 show that they


                                                  26
always have the same sign, but no consistent ranking emerges between them. Surprisingly, in the

year-on-year changes, the MTRI and TRI changes are quite highly correlated, with a correlation

coefficient above 0.95.

   The results overall show that the MTRI is much different from standard measures in practice,

enough to matter to practical policy-making. In future tariff negotiations it should be useful to come

equipped with MTRI measures of proposed changes in policy. Our results also throw light on the

appropriateness of using trade-weighted average tariffs as measures of trade restrictiveness in

empirical studies. Table 1 suggests that they may be appropriate in cross-section regressions.

However, Table 3 suggests that in panel data studies, such as the estimation of cross-country growth

regressions, they are likely to be very poor proxies for the two theoretically based indexes of trade

restrictiveness.

   Of course, all our estimates of the TRI and the MTRI are dependent on the model used to

calculate them. Anderson (1998) reports that results are not very sensitive to elasticity values, a

finding which applies here as well. This is consistent with the folklore of CGE modelling, that

elasticities do not matter much but that specification of the model does matter. (For an illustration

in the TRI context, see O'Rourke (1997).) Where MTRI measures are important, it would be useful

to have several different calculations based on differing CGE models. Despite these caveats, the case

seems to be made that the standard measures are likely to be very seriously misleading in practice.



                                           5. Conclusion

   In this paper we have presented a theoretical analysis of the Mercantilist Trade Restrictiveness

Index and compared its empirical performance with other measures of trade policy. The MTRI is


                                                 27
defined as the uniform tariff which yields the same volume of imports as a given tariff structure.

Since it is a true index number for tariffs, the performance of empirical measures should be evaluated

in terms of how closely they approximate to the MTRI. We also showed how the properties of the

MTRI can be related to changes in the tariff structure, summarised in terms of two parameters, the

generalised mean and variance of tariffs. These techniques seem likely to prove useful in many other

contexts. Finally, we have shown how the MTRI can be extended to allow for quotas for tariffs; and

it can easily be extended further to account for the trade effects of domestic taxes and subsidies, using

the methods of Anderson, Bannister and Neary (1995).

   As for our empirical results, we found that on average the MTRI is correlated with the trade-

weighted average tariff in comparisons with free trade and with changes in NTB restrictiveness in

year-to-year comparisons of trade policy. However, it diverges significantly from both in individual

cases, to an extent which makes standard atheoretic measures highly suspect in practice. Especially

if tariffs are far from uniform, it seems highly desirable to use the MTRI rather than standard

atheoretic measures to evaluate the restrictiveness of real-world protective structures.
