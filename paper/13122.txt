                                             ABSTRACT

We study political dynasties in the United States Congress since its inception in 1789. We document
historic and geographic patterns in the evolution and profile of political dynasties, study the extent
of dynastic bias in legislative politics versus other occupations, and analyze the connection between
political dynasties and political competition. We also study the self-perpetuation of political elites.
We find that legislators who enjoy longer tenures are significantly more likely to have relatives entering
Congress later. Using instrumental variables methods, we establish that this relationship is causal:
a longer period in power increases the chance that a person may start (or continue) a political dynasty.
Therefore, dynastic political power is self-perpetuating in that a positive exogenous shock to a person's
political power has persistent effects through posterior dynastic attainment. In politics, power begets
power.

1     Introduction

A recent article in The Economist complained that the last two US presidential elections have

been dominated by descendants of former presidents or senators. President Bush is the son

of a president and grandson of a senator, Mr. Gore is the son of a senator and the exception

is John Kerry, who, according to the article, is “thanks to a rich wife, the richest senator

in a Senate full of plutocrats.”1 Political dynasties are present in other democracies as well,

such as India, where the Gandhi dynasty has spanned three generations and produced four

national leaders. The main concern with political dynasties as voiced in the popular press

is that they are somehow un-democratic.2 Theorists of elites have had similar concerns.

Michels (1999 [1911]), writing on “the iron law of oligarchy,”stated that even in democratic

organizations the leadership, once elected, would entrench itself in power, undermining the

democratic principle of a level playing …eld. Writers like Pareto and Mosca saw a complex

set of forces behind the persistence of elites. Mosca (1966 [1896], p.74) argued that “every

class displays the tendency to become hereditary, in fact if not in law (our translation).”Ac-

cording to Mosca, even when political positions are open to all, a family tie to those already

in power would confer various advantages. All three main theorists of elites, Mosca, Pareto,

and Michels, thought that political elites are largely self-perpetuating (Putnam 1976, p.4).

But the observation of persistent political elites does not necessarily indicate that any kind of

self-perpetuation has taken place. Mosca himself considered (skeptically) the di¤erent argu-

ment that persistent inequalities in political attainment could re‡ect hereditary inequalities

cember 29th 2004.

     One concern regarding political dynasties is that inequality in the distribution of political power may
re‡ect imperfections in democratic representation. Conventional wisdom considers that access to resources,
key people, or name recognition–rather than merit–boost the chances of a particular person to attain political
power. Media articles have reported on why members of the National Congress party thought Sonia Gandhi
was a good candidate: “The Congress Party thinks the Gandhi name is a vote winner.” (“Rallying the
masses,” Time South Paci…c 09/13/99). In a similar vein, The Economist noted that “The party has better
politicians than she but none with her star quality (more an emanation of her pedigree than her personality).”
(“Sonia, of course”; 11/18/2000)

in talent and drive. If traits such as talent run in families, this may yield persistent ad-

vantages to some families over others that are not due to their already occupying positions

of authority. The question then arises: does the existence of political dynasties reveal that

self-perpetuation operates in democratic politics (and therefore the classic theorists were

right), or does it just re‡ect original di¤erences in ability across families?

   The main contribution of this paper is to show the existence of self-perpetuation, using

the particular case of the Congress of the United States. We de…ne self-perpetuation as a

power-treatment e¤ect, whereby holding political power for longer increases the probability

that one’s heirs attain political power in the future regardless of family characteristics. We

start by showing that there is a signi…cant correlation between the tenure length of a legislator

and the probability of her relatives attaining congressional o¢ ce in the future. However, this

association could be driven by unobserved heterogeneity across families. Original dynasty

traits (old money, genetic endowments, etc.) may explain both why a person had a long

career and why her relatives gained legislative seats later on.

   In order to prove that self-perpetuation is present, we need to establish a causal relation-

ship between length in o¢ ce and posterior dynastic success. For this we use two instrumental

variables approaches. Our …rst approach uses a regression discontinuity design relying on

the (presumably random) outcome of close elections as an instrument for tenure length (see

Hahn, Todd and Van der Klaauw 2001, and Butler, Lee and Moretti 2004 for an application

of regression discontinuity to elections). We …nd that legislators who barely won their …rst

reelection have a signi…cantly higher chance of having a relative entering Congress later in

time than legislators who barely lost their …rst reelection. In the second approach we in-

strument for whether a legislator’s …rst reelection attempt is successful using the reelection

rate of fellow party Representatives in the same state and year. The second instrumental

variables approach corroborates our …ndings. Overall, we …nd that holding legislative power

for more than one term increases the likelihood that a politician will have a relative entering


                                                3
Congress in the future by about 70%. Therefore, in politics, power begets power.

   A second contribution of the paper is to provide a historical description of political

dynasties in the US Congress. This description highlights the type of society in which

dynasties tend to thrive, and is also useful when assessing the possible channels through

which political power is transmitted. We show that the percentage of dynastic legislators

has signi…cantly decreased over time (a “dynastic”legislator is one who belongs to a family

that had previously placed a member in Congress). Dynastic legislators were signi…cantly

more prevalent in the South and in the Senate, consistent with the notion of the South

displaying lower sociopolitical mobility and openness, and the Senate being a more exclusive

body. While the regional di¤erence disappeared after World War II, the di¤erence across

chambers remains. We also provide evidence suggesting that dynastic e¤ects are stronger in

politics than in other occupations. Finally, we …nd that dynastic legislators are less common

in congressional delegations coming from states (and times) where there is more political

competition. One possible explanation is that when a party safely controls a state, those in

control of a party can a¤ord to favor candidates to whom they are connected by family or

social ties. Under more severe competition, party elites cannot a¤ord strategies other than

…elding the best possible candidates, regardless of family connections.

   Our results shed some light on the channels through which the dynastic transmission

of political power takes place. Because exogenous shocks to dynastic power have an e¤ect

on dynastic permanence, superior …xed traits (i.e., original endowments in terms of genes,

for instance) cannot be the whole explanation for political dynasties in the US Congress.

Cumulative factors that depend on previous power attainment must be at play, possibly

through various channels. The descriptive part of the paper o¤ers some guidance at assessing

the likelihood of di¤erent possibilities. It could be that a longer tenure induces a public

service vocation in some family members of a legislator. However, we …nd that dynastic

politicians are less likely to have previous public o¢ ce experience. Another possibility is


                                             4
that a longer tenure allows a legislator to accumulate an asset that he then bequests–like

…nancial or human capital, name recognition, or contacts. In this paper we do not attempt to

disentangle these various channels. However, the fact that political competition is negatively

correlated with the prevalence of dynastic politicians suggests that dynastic transmission of

political power may be more related to superior contacts with party machines –for example–

than to features valued by voters, such as higher human capital.

       Our …nding that shocks to political power have persistent e¤ects through posterior fam-

ily attainment has multiple implications for our understanding of political dynamics. First,

while the inheritance of political power is considered by many to be un-democratic, we …nd

that existing democratic processes still allow for the de facto inheritance of political power.

This inheritance is potentially troublesome for those concerned with the legitimacy of the

process by which representation is achieved, regardless of any impact on policy.3 Second,

granting political power to new social groups may entail a transfer of power to their descen-

dants. As a result, institutions that extend political representation–even if temporarily–may

have long-lasting e¤ects and therefore be hard to reverse. This in turn o¤ers an explana-

tion for why democratization may work as a commitment device. Acemoglu and Robinson

(2006a) explain the rise of democracy in Western nations relying on the key assumption

that democratization yields a commitment to future redistribution. Self-perpetuation o¤ers

one justi…cation for that crucial assumption by showing that changes in representation may

be persistent. Lastly, political mistakes by confused electorates may impose costs that are

more long-lasting than simply conferring o¢ ce to a bad candidate (see Wolfers 2002 on how

voters reelect lucky, but not necessarily talented, incumbents). More generally, and similar

to work on political selection and incumbency advantage (discussed below), our paper con-

tributes to the understanding of forces shaping the political class. This is important given

recent evidence that the identity of political o¢ cials matters in terms of the policies they
   3
   Dal Bó, Foster and Putterman (2007) show in an experimental setting, that given the same rules, subjects
behave di¤erently depending on the process through which rules were selected.

        The next section discusses related literature. Section 3 contains our descriptive contri-

bution. First we describe our data and document patterns in the evolution and pro…le of

dynastic legislators. Then we compare dynastic e¤ects in Congress to those in other occu-

pations, and examine the connection between political competition and dynastic prevalence.

Section 4 contains our analysis of self-perpetuation. First we present a simple framework that

clari…es our de…nition of self-perpetuation and the challenges to its empirical identi…cation.

Then we present the empirical results. Section 5 concludes.



2         Related literature

Work on the link between family relations and political power is to our knowledge scarce.

Camp (1982) documents that high percentages of Mexican political leaders between 1935 and

1980 belonged to politically established families. Clubok, Wilensky and Berghorn (1969) use

biographical data of US legislators and look at the percentage of legislators belonging to

politically connected families. They describe the evolution of that magnitude over time and

across regions of the US until 1961, and argue that the observed decrease cannot simply

be explained by population growth. In their view, the decrease re‡ects modernization.

Brandes Crook and Hibbing (1997) look at the impact of the election mode of Senators on

a number of dimensions, including the percentage of Senators coming from families that

had placed a legislator before. Washington (2005) examines another connection between

family and politics: she shows that US legislators who have relatively more daughters take

more progressive stances on women issues. Our work is also related to recent advances on

the theory and evidence of legislative careers (Diermeier, Keane and Merlo 2005, Merlo and
    4
    Jones and Olken (2005) show that national leaders appear to have large impacts on national growth.
Pande (2003) shows that the group membership of legislators a¤ects targeted redistribution. Chattopadhyay
and Du‡o (2004) show that the gender of village leaders a¤ects the composition of public goods. Besley,
Persson and Sturm (2005) report substantial impacts of governors on the economic performance of states.

class (Besley, Persson and Sturm 2005, Caselli and Morelli 2004, Dal Bó and Di Tella 2003,

Dal Bó et al. 2006). Also related is a paper by Acemoglu and Robinson (2006b) who o¤er

a model of the persistence of elite power through investments in political in‡uence.

       Our paper is related to the incumbency advantage literature in that we attempt to mea-

sure the e¤ect of political attainment on future political prospects (see, among many others,

Erikson 1971, Gelman and King 1990, Levitt and Wolfram 1997, and Ansolabehere, Snyder,

and Stewart 2000). An important di¤erence with the incumbency advantage literature is that

we identify a spillover e¤ect that is interpersonal rather than intrapersonal. As such, our

work underscores the social network dimension, given by family ties, of the e¤ects that cur-

rent political selection has on the future political class. As most papers in the incumbency

advantage literature, we focus on identifying the e¤ect, and abstract from the interesting

problem of its direct consequences (an exception is King and Gelman 1991 who speci…cally

investigate the impact of incumbency advantage on political responsiveness and partisan

bias).

       Finally, our work is also related to a vast empirical literature measuring within family

income correlations across generations (see for instance Solon 1999, and references therein),

and to a vast literature in sociology that has measured intergenerational mobility across

occupations and status levels (see Ganzeboom, Treiman, and Ultee 1991 for a survey).5

Our inquiry is analogous but focused on correlations in political power attainment within

families (although our approach contains intragenerational e¤ects as well). Dynastic self-

perpetuation represents a way in which (political) inequality across families is reproduced

over time. Although our results do not necessarily imply that the reproduction of political

inequality contributes to the reproduction of economic inequality, our paper does expand the

    There is also a large theoretical literature on the intergenerational transmission of income (see, inter alia,
Becker and Tomes 1979, Loury 1981, Galor and Zeira 1993, Fernández and Rogerson 2001, and Mookherjee
and Ray (2003); for a network-based perspective, see Calvó-Armengol and Jackson 2005).

study of the reproduction of inequality to a new dimension. Going beyond the measurement

of correlations, we also show that shocks a¤ecting the political power of a person will have a

causal e¤ect spilling over to family members (see Currie and Moretti 2003 for how education

shocks have intergenerational spillover e¤ects).



3     Data and description

3.1    Data sources and key variables

The data for this project come from multiple sources. First, the Congressional Biographical

Database (ICPSR study 7803) contains data on every legislator from 1789 to 1996. This

dataset contains basic biographical information such as year of birth, prior experience, and

whether or not a legislator had relatives that were also in Congress. These data were checked

against the Congressional Biographical Directory, which has detailed information on the

family connections of legislators. Our dataset does not detail all of a legislator’s family links,

but the ICPSR study includes a selected family tie for each legislator. This information is

captured in Table 1, which gives an idea of what type of connections are more frequent. We

observe that almost 95% of the reported family relationships can be categorized as close.

    We create two indicator variables to characterize political dynasties: Postrelatives and

Prerelatives. The former is equal to one whenever a legislator has a relative entering Congress

after he did, and zero otherwise. The latter is equal to one whenever a legislator had a

relative enter Congress before he did, and zero otherwise. Even when these variables may

be considered coarse, in the next subsection we show that their historical and geographic

variation is intuitive. This suggests that our key variables do capture useful information.

Approximately 8:7% of legislators had previous relatives in o¢ ce (Prerelatives) and 8:5% had

relatives entering Congress later (Postrelatives) –see Table 2). Table 2 also shows that 65%

of legislators stay in Congress for more than one term. A term for House Representatives is


                                                8
one congress (two years), and three congresses (six years) for a Senator. The average tenure

length (in congresses) is 3:73. We now de…ne two variables that will be used frequently:

Longtermi is a dummy variable equal to one if legislator i stayed in Congress for more than

one term, and T otal tenure is a variable recording the total number of congresses served by

a legislator.

       Table 3 displays information on notable congressional dynasties. The Breckinridge family

is the ‘largest’political dynasty in terms of both the number of members placed in Congress

(17) and the total number of congresses served (72). Its presence in Congress spans the

period from 1789 to 1978. Other notable families in Congress are associated to the names

Aldrich, Frelinghuysen, Hiester, Kennedy and Lodge.

       In order to instrument for tenure length in our study of self-perpetuation in Section 4, we

merged the biographical data with data from the Candidate and Constituency Statistics of

Elections in the United States (ICPSR study 7757). Since these two databases do not have

common individual identi…ers, we employed a complex merging procedure which is detailed

in the appendix. For the universe of House elections we were able to match 28; 560 elections

out of the possible 30; 028 that occurred.6

       In subsection 3:3 we use data from the General Social Survey (ICPSR study 4295) in

order to compare dynastic e¤ects across occupations.

       Finally we merged in an additional data set that was used to construct the measure of

political competition used in subsection 3:4. This dataset contains the party a¢ liations of

members of state houses and senates from 1880 until 1994 and was merged by state and

congressional term.7
   6
     We only found minor di¤erences among observables between elections that merged and those that did
not, save for the fact that elections that did not merge correctly seemed to occur earlier in our sample.
This is consistent with the quality of recording being poorer earlier in time. Otherwise the missing elections
appear to be random. In our instrumental variables studies we restrict our sample to House elections only.
This is done mainly because before 1910 very few Senators were directly elected, but were selected into o¢ ce
by state legislatures. Thus for the most part including them in our sample would add only a few data points
and introduce comparability issues.

3.2     Historical evolution

We document the presence of political dynasties in Congress across time, regions, chambers

of congress and the two main political parties. Consistently with Clubok, Wilensky and

Berghorn (1969), we …nd that the proportion of legislators with relatives in Congress has

signi…cantly decreased over time (see Figure 1A). We also …nd that this is true for the

proportion of legislators with previous and posterior relatives (see Figure 1B and 1C). We

refer to legislators who had a previous relative in congress as “dynastic legislators.”As shown

in Figure 1B and Table 4 there has been a signi…cant decrease over time in the presence of

dynastic legislators: while 12% of legislators were dynastic between 1789 and 1858, only 6%

were dynastic after 1966.

   There are regional di¤erences in the presence of dynastic legislators. Dynastic legislators

used to be more prevalent in the South than in the rest of the country. This di¤erence is

signi…cant before the Civil War and between the end of Reconstruction and World War II (see

Figure 2A and …rst panel of Table 4). Contrary to the trends portrayed by Clubok, Wilensky

and Berghorn (1969), we …nd that regional di¤erences in the presence of dynastic legislators

have disappeared over time. The …rst panel of Table 4 shows that regional di¤erences in

the presence of dynastic legislators are not signi…cant after World War II. However, the

di¤erences across regions regarding the entrance to Congress of dynastic politicians only

disappeared after the civil rights movement -see the second panel of Table 4. The contrast

suggests that the immediate postwar years generated a substantial exit of senior dynastic

politicians.

   There are important di¤erences across chambers of Congress. The Senate has a greater

share of dynastic politicians than the House and this di¤erence has not disappeared with time

(see Figure 2B and Table 4). Finally, dynastic legislators were signi…cantly more prevalent

in the Democratic party than in the Republican party until the end of Reconstruction, but
Brian Gaines. It has been used in De Figueiredo (2003) and De Figueiredo and Vanden Bergh (2004).



                                                 10
there are no signi…cant di¤erences across parties since then (see Figure 2C and Table 4).

The higher dynastic component of the Democratic party in the 19th century disappears if

one excludes Southern legislators.


3.3       Dynastic prevalence across occupations

Even when looking at legislators elected in the 1990s, we …nd that nearly 5% of legislators

have previous legislators in the family, but one may ask whether dynasties are any more

prevalent in politics than in other professions. While a full comparative study of the inter-

generational transmission of occupations is beyond the scope of this paper, in this subsection

we o¤er some evidence suggesting that dynastic prevalence among legislators is indeed high

when compared to other occupations.8

       Table 5 presents data for the years 1972-2004 from the General Social Surveys (ICPSR

study 4295) corresponding to a selected group of occupations. Column (1) reports the

percentage of respondents in each occupation whose father was in the same occupation.

According to this data more than 12% of doctors have fathers who were doctors, while less

than 2% of economists have fathers that were economists. But to compare the importance

of dynastic e¤ects across occupations one must control for the share of the population in

each profession (i.e. the fact that economists are much less common than doctors). Column

(2) reports the percentage of fathers in each occupation (note that, indeed, economists are a

lot less common among fathers than doctors). Column (3) then reports the ratio of column

(1) over column (2), which controls for the relative frequency of occupations among fathers.

This ratio represents the odds that both son and father are in the same profession relative

to the benchmark situation where the professions of respondents are independent from those
   8
    Sociologists have written extensively on correlations of socioeconomic status (see for instance Ganzeboom
et al. 1991). These studies tend to focus on coarse categories (manual workers, say), status, or income
rather than on particular occupations. Galor and Tsiddon (1997) o¤er a theory linking skill premia and
intergenerational occupational mobility.




                                                     11
of their fathers.9 Notice that the adjusted dynastic prevalence index in column (3), or what

we call ‘dynastic bias,’ is higher for economists than for doctors: although doctors have

fathers who were doctors roughly six times more often than economists have fathers who

were economists, doctors were roughly ten times more common among fathers, so dynastic

e¤ects appear to play a larger role in economics than in medicine.10

       The last row contains data for legislators. Column (1) presents the percentage of legis-

lators elected in the 1990s who had fathers who were legislators. In column (2) we report

a conservative estimate of the percentage of fathers who were legislators. We explain in

the appendix our calculations to estimate this …gure.11 The dynastic bias is strongest for

legislators relative to all other selected occupations. The dynastic bias is more than seven

times stronger for legislators than for economists, the second most “dynastic” occupation

in our group, and more than ten times stronger than for doctors, the third most dynastic

profession in our sample. Even if we assumed that, among fathers, legislators were exactly

as common as economists, we would obtain a dynastic bias that is almost twice as strong

for legislators than for economists.
   9
    To see why column (3) can be read this way, consider a matrix where we have the profession of sons
in rows and the profession of fathers in columns. Denote the content of cell (i; j) with F (i; j), which
captures the fraction of individuals where the son has profession i and the father has profession j. Denote
with F I (i; j) = f (i) g (j) what that fraction would be if the professions of fathers and sons were selected
independently, where g (j) is the fraction of fathers with profession j, and f (i) is the fraction of sons with
profession i. The chance that both son and father will be in profession i relative to what that same chance
would be if professions of fathers and sons were selected independently can be calculated as FFI(i;i)
                                                                                                 (i;i)
                                                                                                       = fF(i)g(i)
                                                                                                             (i;i)
                                                                                                                   .

Column (1) reports the magnitude       f (i) ,   column (2) reports the magnitude g (i), and column (3), being the

                                                                                .
  10
     This is not to say that our measure of dynastic bias is driven by the rarity of the profession. Note that
a profession’s rarity a¤ects both the numerator and the denominator of its dynastic bias index fF(i)g(i)
                                                                                                     (i;i)
                                                                                                           .
  11
     We used a methodology that takes an extremely conservative position at every step. In fact it yields an
estimate indicating that, among fathers, there was a legislator for every four economists. This is clearly a
gross overestimation. For example, US universities granted nearly 24; 000 Masters and PhDs in Economics
between 1910 and 1952 (Bowen 1953, p. 23), while only 2; 410 legislators were elected in the same period.

3.4       Personal characteristics and political careers of dynastic politi-

          cians

In this section we study how the personal characteristics and the political careers of dynastic

legislators di¤er from those of other legislators. We study the following characteristics. House

is a dummy variable equal to one if the legislator entered through the House. Age of entry

is the age of the legislator the year he/she entered Congress. Previous public experience is

a dummy variable equal to one if the legislator had public experience at the time of entry

to Congress. College degree is a dummy variable equal to one if the legislator had a college

degree. Outsider is a dummy variable equal to one if the legislator was from a di¤erent state

than the one he represents. Female is a dummy variable equal to one if the legislator is a

woman.

       Given the di¤erence across regions and times in the number of dynastic politicians, simple

comparisons of means of the previous variables may be misleading. It is necessary to control

by year and state in which the legislator is observed.12 Table 6 shows OLS regression results

of how legislator characteristics relate to having a previous relative in Congress, including

state and year …xed e¤ects.13 We …nd that dynastic politicians are less likely to start their

career in the House, suggesting they have the ability or means to enter directly through the

Senate, a much smaller and more prestigious body. This di¤erence cannot be attributed

to a later entry into Congress: dynastic legislators enter Congress at about 44 years of

age, just like non-dynastic legislators. Dynastic legislators are not more likely to come

from a state di¤erent than the one they represent and are signi…cantly less likely to have

previous public experience, although they are more likely to have a college degree. Moreover,
  12
     The “year” e¤ects are in fact the years in which each congress was elected, so they are a dummy for
every two years corresponding to the same congress. The …rst one corresponds to the year 1788 (the year
in which the 1st congress, which began operations in 1789, was elected). The second one corresponds to the
year 1790, etc. For brevity, we refer to congress e¤ects as year e¤ects throughout.
  13
     A norm in the US Congress has allowed for close relatives like wives to enter Congress and occupy
the seat of a legislator who died in o¢ ce. We exclude these cases wherever appropriate to ensure that the
dynastic e¤ects we study do not depend on this obvious form of dynastic transmission.


                                                   13
dynastic legislators with a college education are signi…cantly more likely to have attended

an Ivy League school than the rest of the college educated legislators (unreported in the

table). It may be interesting to note that dynastic legislators are signi…cantly more likely

to be female than nondynastic ones. In other words, dynastic membership seems to have

facilitated the di¢ cult progress of female political representation. In addition, we …nd that

dynastic legislators do not have longer careers in Congress. Table 7 shows that dynastic

politicians are equally likely to stay in Congress for more than one term and have similar

tenure lengths to those of other legislators.


3.5    Dynastic prevalence and political competition

In this section we study the connection between political competition and political dynasties.

We …nd that increases in political competition are associated with fewer political dynasties,

suggesting that political competition reduces the dynastic transmission of political power.

   For this analysis we use a political competition index constructed upon party dominance

of state legislatures between the years 1880 and 1996. This index has a minimum value of

 0:5 when 100% of the seats in the state legislature in a given year belong to the same

party. This index increases as the percentage of seats held by a majority party decreases.

The maximum value of the index is zero, corresponding to the case when the total number

of seats (including the two chambers) held by the two largest parties is split 50-50 between

these two parties. More formally, the political competition index for state i and year j is
                             LHDij +U HDij
given by P Cij =      LHDij +U HDij +LHRij +U HRij
                                                      0:5 , where LHDij (LHRij ) and U HDij

(U HRij ) represent the number of seats that Democrats (Republicans) hold in the lower and

upper chambers of the state legislature that was elected in year j. This measure of political

competiton is superior to simply using the vote shares of national legislators which may

depend on the characteristics of those legislators.

   Figure 3 shows the (uncontrolled) association between political competition and the pro-


                                                14
portion of legislators coming from families that had placed legislators before. This …gure

shows that as the index moves from -0.5 to 0 (i.e., as political competition increases) the

percentage of politicians coming from politically established families decreases. Table 8

presents estimates of the association between the percentage of legislators who are elected

to Congress in year j in state i, and the political competition in the same state-year. The

…rst two speci…cations, in columns (1) and (2) respectively, capture the political competition

index through a quadratic polynomial and show that political competition is a signi…cant

predictor of the prevalence of dynastic politicians even after controlling for year and state

e¤ects.

   In columns (3) and (4) we report estimates from a regression of the percentage of leg-

islators with Prerelatives on a dummy variable that takes the value 1 when the political

competition index takes a value in the upper half of its support (i.e., above       0:25). The

omitted dummy is the one corresponding to the …rst, or less competitive, half of the sup-

port. These estimates suggest that moving from districts with less competition to districts

with more competition lowers the prevalence of dynastic politicians in about two percentage

points. In the speci…cations where we exclude observations lying within thirty years of the

constitution of the state we eliminate a censoring problem, as states with no previous politi-

cal elite will tend to have low levels of dynastic politicians. The speci…cations in columns (2)

and (4) take care of that problem and the constant indicates that the proportion of dynastic

politicians in the less competitive states is around 10%. Thus, the reduction in dynastic

prevalence brought about by an increase in competition that moves a state from the lower

half to the upper half of the support amounts to almost 20% of the baseline proportion.

   One possible explanation of our …ndings is that when a party safely controls a state, the

state and national leadership of the party can a¤ord to favor “elite”candidates with whom

they are connected by family or social ties. Because these candidates may not always be

the best, favoring them costs the party leadership some extra probability of not winning a


                                              15
seat. In very safe states, this cost is negligible, however, while the private returns to favoring

friends and family may be substantial.14 The party leadership at the state and national level

can favor particular legislative candidates is various ways, such as by directing resources

to those candidates at the primary campaign stage. Under more severe competition, the

party leadership may not be able to a¤ord any strategy other than …elding the best possible

candidates, regardless of their family connections. Doing otherwise may cost the party too

much in terms of a larger likelihood of losing seats in Congress, which damages the party’s

power both at the state and national level. In other words, dynastic prevalence may re‡ect

the prevalence of lower quality politicians due to constraints on political competition (this is

compatible with the results and explanation of Besley, Persson and Sturm 2005, who study

how political competition relates to the quality of governors in the United States).



4     Self-perpetuation

Mosca (1966 [1896]) observed that even representative regimes would comprise a tension

between a “democratic tendency” and an “aristocratic tendency.” Representative systems,

while eliminating the legal inheritability of political rights, could be vulnerable to the emer-

gence of de facto nobilities. This observation speaks squarely to the concern that is often

voiced by the media in connection with the prevalence of political dynasties in the United

States. Mosca saw the aristocratic tendency associated with the persistence of political

elites as the result of various factors, including personal contacts, notoriety, and insider

information–which helped well connected individuals in their rise to power. But such per-

sistent inequality in political attainment across families may also follow from di¤erences in

talent and drive that run in families. Therefore, substantiating the idea that representative
  14
     A related problem occurs in family …rms. Burkart, Panunzi and Shleifer (2003) study a model where
…rm owners can decide to place a heir as manager, rather than a professional, at the cost of worse managerial
performance. Bennedsen et al (2006) estimate that cost to be large using a sample of Danish …rms. See also
Bertrand and Schoar (2006) and references therein.



                                                     16
systems embody an aristocratic tendency that is a result of previous access to power requires

showing that the persistence of elites is not wholly due to heterogeneity across dynasties. In

other words, we need to show that self-perpetuation e¤ects are present.


4.1      Self-perpetuation: de…nition and main estimation challenges

We de…ne self-perpetuation as a power-treatment e¤ect, whereby holding political power

increases the probability that one’s heirs attain political power in the future regardless of

dynastic characteristics. In other words, political self-perpetuation means that power begets

power.

   We now present a simple model that clari…es the nature of the self-perpetuation e¤ect

and highlights challenges in its empirical identi…cation.

   Assume that the amount of political power yi enjoyed by citizen i depends on the amount

of political capital ki available to him,


                                         yi =    + ki +     i;




where     is a positive scalar and   i   is a random shock. Political capital is de…ned as any

personal characteristic that has an e¤ect on political attainment, from human capital to

name recognition. Citizen i has a successor, whose amount of political power is determined

as follows,

                                         yis =   + kis +    s
                                                            i;



where kis is the political capital of the succesor and vis is an independent shock a¤ecting the

successor. We assume that the political capital of the successor depends on the political

capital ki and the political power yi of her predecessor. In particular, the process of political

capital is,

                                            kis = ki + y;


                                                 17
where    and   are scalars. From the previous two equations we …nd the relationship between

the political power of the successors and the political capital and attainment of predecessors,


                                 yis =   +    ki +     yi +    s
                                                               i:                               (1)


The last equation says that the political attainment of a successor depends on the political

capital of her predecessor, and the contribution to her own political capital made by her

predecessors’political power yi . In this simple world, our hypothesis that political elites are

self-perpetuating would be true whenever        > 0, indicating that the political capital of a

successor, and hence her political power attainment, is augmented by her predecessor’s power.

This is the precise sense in which self-perpetuation implies that power begets power. Even

if   = 0, it might still be true that in some dynasty both the predecessor and the successor

have high levels of political attainment yi and yis due to a high level of original political

capital ki . The last equation then clari…es the distinction between the idea that persistence

in dynastic political attainment re‡ects inheritable heterogeneity in dynasty types ( > 0)

from our hypothesis of self-perpetuation ( > 0).

     The possibility that di¤erent families may have di¤erent and unobserved amounts of

political capital poses a problem when attempting to test the idea of self-perpetuation. A

researcher intending to estimate whether power begets power may run the following, naive,

regression,

                                     yis = a1 + a2 yi + ui ;                                    (2)

where ui is the error term. The researcher may interpret a positive estimate of a2 as evidence

of self-perpetuation ( > 0). However the estimation of the e¤ect of yi on yis will be biased

given the omitted variable ki , the political capital of the predecessor. To better understand
                                                                    yi
what an OLS estimate of a2 would re‡ect, we can write ki =               i
                                                                             , and therefore, using




                                               18
(1) we get,

                            yis = (1      )+( +      ) yi         i   +       s
                                                                              i;



which indicates that the naive regression would yield an estimate of a2 = +                          . It follows

that even if there is no cumulative e¤ect of power on political capital (i.e.,                   = 0) we would

obtain a2 =       > 0 due to the fact that the predecessor’s political capital ki that a¤ects

power attainment is inheritable ( > 0). Thus, our estimation strategy needs to control for

characteristics of the predecessor that may a¤ect the power attainment of both predecessors

and successors.

   Note that self-perpetuation ( > 0) a¤ects the forces behind the formation of the political

class. We can write the political attainment of successors as,


                         yis =    +      ki +   [ + ki +     i]   +       s
                                                                          i                                   (3)
                                                                                    s
                            =     (1 +     )+ ( +       ) ki +            i   +     i:                        (4)


   This last expression reveals that when power augments political capital ( > 0) the po-

litical power of successors is enhanced through three channels: …rst, by enhancing the e¤ect

of the constant that a¤ects power through the term          (1 +              ); second, by enhancing the

e¤ect of the predecessor’s political capital through the term         ( +                ) ki ; and third, by cap-

italizing on the good luck of predecessors through the term                    i.   A positive estimate of

would provide evidence that holding political power reinforces the e¤ects of other sources of

elite persistence such as di¤ering dynastic traits, and that past luck matters for the future

distribution of power.


4.2    Self-perpetuation: OLS estimates

Because of data limitations, we focus not on the universe of citizens but on the universe

of politicians who served in the US Congress. The variation in legislators’ political power

                                                19
is measured by their tenure length since it is typically argued that tenure in congressional

o¢ ce is associated with more political power (more senior legislators develop more name

recognition, become more deeply embedded in party networks, and obtain more in‡uential

committee positions). We construct measures of political power by seeing whether the leg-

islator was reelected at least once and by counting the number of total congresses served

(through, respectively, our variables Longtermi and T otal tenurei , both introduced in the

descriptive section of our paper). As a measure of the political power of the succesors we

consider whether the legislator has relatives attaining congressional o¢ ce in the future at

all.15 This is captured by the the variable P ostrelatives, which we also introduced in the

descriptive section of the paper.

    In this section we study the relationship between tenure in Congress and the probability

of having relatives in Congress in the future by estimating the following OLS regression:



                     P ostrelativei = a1 + a2 Longtermi + a3 Xi + bs + by + "i :

    Recall that P ostrelativei is a dummy variable equal to one if legislator i has a relative

in Congress in the future, and as said before, Longtermi is a dummy variable equal to one

if legislator i stayed in Congress for more than one term, and Xi is a vector of legislator

i’s personal characteristics. The coe¢ cients bs and by are state and year …xed e¤ects that

are used in certain speci…cations. The symbol "i represents the error term.16 As explained

in the previous section, a2 is likely to be a biased estimate of , but the reporting of OLS

estimates is useful to establish whether there is at least the potential for self-perpetuation
  15
     The reason for using this measure instead of the average tenure of a legislator’s successors is that each
legislator typically has many relatives most of whom will not enter Congress and therefore are not in our
data.
  16
     The use of binary outcome variables would suggest that non-linear maximum likelihood methods would
be desirable. However, the consistency of these estimators is dubious in the analysis of panel data; this is
the well known incidental parameters problem (see Neyman and Scott, 1948, or Lancaster, 2000). Therefore
we focus on the analysis using ordinary least squares; however, the results are robust to using a potentially
inconsistent probit estimator.




                                                     20
to be present. A coe¢ cient a2 that is not signi…cantly larger than zero would make self-

perpetuation unlikely.

   Table 9 column (1) shows that 7:1% of the legislators that were in Congress for only one

term had a relative entering Congress after them while that percentage increases to 9:3% if

the legislator stayed in o¢ ce for more than one term; the di¤erence is signi…cant at the 1%

level. Columns (2) and (3) show a similar comparison when we eliminate people born after

1910 and those who died in o¢ ce. We eliminate people born after 1910 so as to account for

the censoring that occurs because legislators at the end of the sample period have less time

to establish dynasties. We omit individuals who died in o¢ ce to ensure that our results are

not driven by the convention that when an individual dies in o¢ ce a relative might step in

to take his place. The coe¢ cient estimates remain largely unchanged and are statistically

equivalent.

   Column (4) reports a regression controlling for state and year …xed e¤ects. The …xed

e¤ects do not change the results markedly. When further controls are added in column (5)

the estimate of a2 does not change. This suggests that omitted variables are unlikely to bias

upwards our estimate of the e¤ect of tenure on having relatives in future congresses.

   Other personal characteristics correlate with having relatives in future congresses. Leg-

islators with Prerelatives are 16% more likely to have Postrelatives. Senators and legislators

whose chamber of entry was the House but eventually moved to the Senate have a 5% and

6:8% higher probability, respectively, of having a relative entering Congress relative to leg-

islators who were only members of the House. These …ndings suggest that more successful

career patterns (politicians who are always Senators or who start as Representatives but

eventually ascend to the Senate) are associated with a higher likelihood of starting or con-

tinuing a dynasty. One potential problem with the speci…cation used so far is that the

error terms of legislators belonging to the same family may not be independent, a¤ecting

the standard errors. To address this issue we report in column (6) estimates with only one


                                             21
observation per family (we eliminate all legislators who have themselves previous relatives

in o¢ ce). The results are unchanged.

   We obtain similar results if we use the total number of congresses served, total tenure, as

a measure of political power. Figure 4 shows the proportion of legislators with Postrelatives

by the number of terms they served. There is a clear positive relationship between total

tenure and Postrelatives with the impact of terms decreasing with the number of terms

served. Table 10 presents the regression estimates, which are similar to those in Table 9.

Starting in column (6) we also run the results using a quadratic term of total tenure. The

quadratic term is negative and signi…cantly di¤erent from zero, re‡ecting the fact that there

are decreasing marginal returns to tenure in terms of future relatives in o¢ ce. The marginal

impact on the probability of a relative entering Congress in the future of going from one

term to two terms is between 1:3% and 3%.

   Overall, the OLS results yield evidence consistent with self-perpetuation. However, as

argued before, the fact that legislators with longer tenures are more likely to have relatives

in future congresses could be due to unobserved family characteristics such as their political

capital. In the following two subsections we employ two strategies to determine whether

tenure in o¢ ce has a causal impact on the probability that a legislator’s relative will enter

Congress in the future. First, we focus on House Representatives that attempted a reelection

and compare those that barely won their …rst reelection with those that barely lost, that

is, we use a regression discontinuity approach. Second, we use the re-election rates of a

legislator’s cohort as an instrument for a legislator’s re-election.


4.3    Establishing a causal link: Close elections

To identify the causal impact of tenure we start by using a very simple approach that relies

on a comparison between legislators who barely won their …rst reelection with those who

barely lost. The identifying assumption in this regression discontinuity analysis is that close


                                               22
elections provide a random assignment of legislators across the categories of winners and

losers, instead of being driven by family characteristics. This assumption could be criticized

if elections were rigged such that winning could depend on personal characteristics that are

also correlated with having Postrelatives. Snyder (2005) …nds evidence consistent with the

idea that the vote counting process is biased in favor of long-time incumbents in the U.S.

House. However, there is no evidence of such manipulation taking place in …rst re-election

attempts, which is the focus of this study. It could also be argued that legislators with

relatives previously in Congress may be more able to rig election tallies. To eliminate this

possibility we focus on legislators without Prerelatives for the rest of this section. We also

exclude legislators who died in o¢ ce or were born after 1910 as in the previous section.

   Table 11 shows the percentage of Congress members with Postrelatives conditional on the

results of the …rst reelection attempt (barely lost vs. barely won). Of the legislators that lost

by less than a 2:5% margin of the vote, 2:8% have Postrelatives in Congress. Instead, of those

that won by up to a 2:5% margin, 7:12% have Postrelatives in Congress. A similar increase

is observed for the 5% window and both di¤erences are statistically signi…cant (p-values of

0:024 and 0:01 respectively).

   We argue that in such a small window winners and losers are identical so that any dif-

ference in Postrelatives should be attributed to the di¤erent outcome in the …rst reelection

and not to personal or family characteristics. The data support this assumption. As Table

11 shows, at the 2:5% and 5% windows, only one characteristic out of eleven is signi…cantly

di¤erent at the 10% level between winners and losers. This suggests that it is not an un-

observed family characteristic that causes both long tenures and Postrelatives for legislators

winning close reelections, but that staying in power for longer increases the probability of

forming a dynasty.

   However, the previous analysis fails to consider that not all losers of a …rst reelection were

one-term legislators: some ran again and reentered Congress after losing their …rst reelection


                                               23
attempt. Therefore, the di¤erences in Table 11 underestimate the e¤ect of being a long term

legislator on the chance of having relatives in Congress later in time. To solve this problem

we implement an IV regression in which we estimate the probability of serving more than

one term in Congress as a function of the …rst reelection outcome in the …rst stage. In a

second stage, we estimate the e¤ect of Longterm on P ostrelative using the predicted value

of Longterm from the …rst stage.

       We estimate the following equation in the …rst stage:


             Longtermi = b1 + b2 Wi + b3 Xi (1     Wi ) + br (1   Wi ) + bd (1    W i ) + "i ;


where Longtermi is an indicator equal to one if legislator i was in Congress for more than one

term, Wi is an indicator equal to one if the legislator won his …rst reelection attempt and Xi

is a vector of personal characteristics. The coe¢ cients br and bd are region and decade …xed

e¤ects. All controls including the region and decade …xed e¤ects are interacted with losing.

This is done to adjust for the fact that all winners of the …rst reelection attempt had long

term careers, but not all losers had short term careers; in other words, controls are used to

explain variation across losers.17 The default decade is the 1880s and the default region is the

North-East (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont,

Delaware, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania). The coe¢ cient on Wi measures the

average impact of winning on the probability of being a long term legislator conditional on

region and decade e¤ects.

       Table 12 shows the estimated coe¢ cients for the …rst stage. Winning the …rst reelection

and its interactions are a good predictor of staying in Congress for more than one term at the

2:5% and 5% windows, after controlling for various legislator characteristics. The explanatory

variables of the …rst stages are jointly signi…cant with F statistics always greater than 60.
  17
    Since all winners have Longterm = 1 and all personal characteristics and …xed e¤ects are interacted
with losing, b1 + b2 = 1.



                                                  24
The instruments are strong.

   The equation we estimate in the second stage is as follows:


                                              \ i + a3 Xi + ar + ad + "i ;
                   P ostrelativei = a1 + a2 Longterm


        \ i is the estimated probability of having more than one term in o¢ ce as
where Longterm

predicted by the …rst stage. In these regressions we use region and decade …xed e¤ects in

order to minimize problems with statistical power. We do however incorporate state and

year …xed e¤ects in subsequent speci…cations with more observations.

   Table 13 shows the estimated coe¢ cients for the second stage. Being in Congress for

more than one term has a signi…cant e¤ect on the probability of having a Postrelative in

Congress. This is the case for both the 2:5% and 5% margin of votes windows and whether

or not we control for observable characteristics or we include legislators with Prerelatives.

The magnitude of the e¤ect ranges from 3:1% to 5:2%.

   We obtain similar results if we use the total number of terms served and its square. In

the …rst stage we estimate the following equations:


T otaltenurei = b1 + b2 Wi + b3 Xi + b4 Xi (1         Wi ) + br + bd + cr (1    Wi ) + cd (1    W i ) + "i ;

T otaltenure2i = b01 + b02 Wi + b03 Xi + b04 Xi (1    Wi ) + br + bd + c0r (1   Wi ) + c0d (1   W i ) + "i ;


where T otaltenure2i is the square of T otaltenurei . We present the estimates from the …rst

stage in Table 14. The explanatory variables of the …rst stages are jointly signi…cant with F

statistics always greater than 20. Again, the instruments are strong.

   In the second stage we estimate the following equation:


                                                  \ 2 i + a3 Xi + ar + ad + "i :
                                    \ i + a02 T otaltenure
       P ostrelativei = a1 + a2 T otaltenure




                                                 25
       Table 15 shows the estimated coe¢ cients from the second stage. The linear e¤ect of an

extra term in power on the probability of having a Postrelative ranges from 3:9% to 6:3%.

The marginal e¤ect of a second term in power (denoted as TE(2-1) in Table 15) is positive,

ranging from 2:8% to 4:2%, and always signi…cant at the 10% level.

       The results presented this far are based on legislators within a small window of victory or

defeat in their …rst reelection (vote margins of 2:5% or 5%). We next include more legislators

(within 25% margin of victory or defeat).18 This sample includes legislators that won or lost

by large margins and therefore the reelection outcome cannot be thought to be random. We

then control for the direct e¤ect that the margin of votes may have on whether a legislator

has Postrelatives by including a high order polynomial in the margin of votes. In other

words, we apply the global polynomial estimation technique developed by Hahn, Todd and

Van der Klaauw (2001) (see also Van der Klaauw 2002).

       Figure 5 shows the proportion of legislators with Postrelatives in Congress depending

on the margin of votes by which they won or lost their …rst reelection attempt. The …gure

also shows the estimated quartic polynomial on vote margin with a 95% con…dence interval

allowing for a discontinuity at the 0% margin of votes. There is a clear discontinuity at that

value: winners are more likely to have relatives coming into Congress later on even when

the polynomial is absorbing any direct e¤ect that the margin of votes (or the variables that

cause it) may have on Postrelatives.

       However, Figure 5 fails to control for other observable characteristics and the fact that

not all losers had only one term in o¢ ce. To solve this problem we utilize, as before, the

result from the …rst reelection to estimate the probability of being a long term legislator.

Figure 6 shows the relationship of Longterm and Total tenure with the margin of votes

that legislators obtain in their …rst reelection attempt. The …gure also shows the estimated
  18
    We chose the 25% window a priori since a large fraction of the observations fall in this interval and data
with extreme vote margins seem less reliable. As we will show, the results that follow are not speci…c to that
window.



                                                     26
quartic polynomial with a 95% con…dence interval. There is a clear discontinuity at 0%:

winners go on to have a longer tenure than losers. Thus, we can use the result from the …rst

reelection attempt as an instrument for tenure and be able to identify the e¤ect of tenure on

Postrelatives as before.

   The equation we estimate in the …rst stage is as follows:

                                        X
Longtermi = b1 +b2 Wi +b3 Xi (1    Wi )+ qs Marginvote s (1        Wi )+br (1    Wi )+bd (1    Wi )+"i ;
                                         s=1


where the q 0 s are coe¢ cients in the vote margin polynomial (set to a quartic).

   Table 16 shows the estimated coe¢ cients. Win predicts becoming a long term legislator

in the 25% window when controlling for the margin of votes. This is robust to including

state and year …xed e¤ects, legislators with Prerelatives and larger margin of vote windows.

Again, the F statistics for joint signi…cance are large.

   In the second stage we estimate the following equation:

                                                      X
                                  \ i + a3 Xi +
       P ostrelativei = a1 + a2 Longterm                    ts Marginvote s + ar + ad + "i ;
                                                      s=1


where the t0 s are coe¢ cients in the (quartic) vote margin polynomial.

   The second stage results in Table 17 show a clear positive e¤ect of Longterm on Postrel-

atives. In the 25% window, Longterm is signi…cant with a magnitude ranging from 4:7%

to 6:6%. In the 40% window the e¤ect of Longterm is also signi…cant and with similar

magnitude.

   These results are robust to considering Total tenure instead of Longterm –see tables 18

and 19. The linear e¤ect of an extra term in power on the probability of having a Postrelative

ranges from 2:2% to 4:9%. The marginal e¤ect of a second term in the House is positive,

ranging from 1:6% to 3:7%, and always signi…cant.

   These results suggest that the longer one’s tenure, the more likely one is to establish


                                               27
a political dynasty, and that this relationship is causal. The identifying assumption in our

analysis is that close elections provide a random assignment of legislators across the categories

of winners and losers. We provided evidence of this for small windows in Table 11. To provide

further evidence in support of this assumption, we estimate the relationship between tenure

and all personal characteristics using the regression discontinuity design. The estimated

model always includes a quartic polynomial on vote margin.19 We present the estimates in

Table 20 with region and decade …xed e¤ects. First, we …nd that the estimates of the impact

of Longterm on Postrelatives are robust to considering large windows (in small windows the

coe¢ cients remain high but the much higher standard errors damage signi…cance). Second,

for some windows one out of nine observables appears unbalanced. However, such imbalances

are not robust to using larger windows. Another robustness check is to introduce state and

year …xed e¤ects (instead of region and decade …xed e¤ects). When we do this (unreported)

we …nd that while the e¤ect of Longterm on Postrelative continues to be signi…cant for most

vote margin windows with many observations, the imbalances in predetermined observables

disappear almost completely. Overall, the e¤ect of a long term career on having posterior

relatives in o¢ ce appears fairly robust and not the result of noisy data in a particular vote

margin window. On the contrary, the imbalances in the other observables of our sample are

few and not robust.20
  19
     The exercise can be explained thus. If, say, the military are much more prevalent among winners (indi-
cating that the assignment may not be random), then the close connection between winning and Longterm
should make Longterm as instrumented by W in a signi…cant variable in a model where M ilitary is the
dependent variable.
  20
     Going beyond our default sample, the examination of Prerelatives across winners and losers does suggest
an imbalance. Legislators with prerelatives tend to be overrepresented among winners. The regressions ran
to check that the results are robust to including legislators with prerelatives control for that characteristic,
however, suggesting that it does not drive the result in those regressions.




                                                      28
4.4       Establishing a causal link: Using the reelection rates of a leg-

          islator’s cohort

In this section we implement an alternative instrumental variables strategy to estimate the

causal e¤ect of congressional tenure on having a relative attaining legislative o¢ ce. We use

the reelection probabilities of any given legislator’s current cohort, by state and party, as an

instrument for his reelection probabilities.21 For example, consider a House member going

for his …rst reelection in California in the year 1892. The instrument for this legislator’s …rst

reelection is the reelection rate of legislators of the same party in California in the year 1892.

The idea is that there is an underlying common shock to all of the individuals in this cohort

that is independent of the characteristics of the individual attempting to get reelected. We

use this common shock as a source of exogenous variation in congressional tenure to identify

the impact of tenure on having relatives follow into o¢ ce. In our preferred speci…cation we

include …xed e¤ects by state-decade combinations, so we identify the reelection shock relative

to a given state-decade.22 In the example of the legislator from California in 1892, we would

only compare the shock in California in 1892 to other shocks in California in the 1890’s.

       The identifying assumption is that the current electoral shocks to an individual’s cohort

will a¤ect his probability of having a relative coming into o¢ ce only through the channel of

whether the legislator stays in o¢ ce or not.

       We use the following formula to construct the instrument for legislator i within a state/year/party

with a cohort of size N :

                                             P
                                            [ N
                                              j=1 (reelectj )] (reelecti )
                         Electinstrumenti =                                ;
                                                       N 1

where reelectj is a dummy variable equal to one if j, in the same state/year/party, was
  21
      A similar strategy was used by Levitt and Snyder (1997) to examine the impact of federal spending on
electoral outcomes.
   22
      One speci…cation looks at state-quarter pairs. We do not have enough observations so as to try state-year
…xed e¤ects.


                                                      29
reelected. This formula gives the probability of an individual in the cohort being reelected.23

In our preferred speci…cation, we estimate the …rst stage equation:



                      Longtermi = b1 + b2 Electinstrumenti + b3 Xi + bsd + "i ;

where bsd captures state-decade …xed e¤ects. Thus we obtain the impact of the instrument

on Longterm only within a given state-decade group. In general the …rst stage is quite strong

(Table 21). We …nd a highly signi…cant impact of the reelection instrument on Longterm.

We then proceed to estimate the second stage equation with the instrumented Longterm:


                                                   \ i + a3 Xi + asd + "i :
                        P ostrelativei = a1 + a2 Longterm

We include the state-decade e¤ects to restrict identifying variation to that in small region-

time groups. Table 22 presents the second stage estimates. Across all of the speci…cations we

…nd that the estimate of Longterm is largely consistent with estimates from the regression

discontinuity design approach. In column (1) we use state-quarter of the century e¤ects while

in column (2) we use our preferred speci…cation with state-decade e¤ects. We …nd that in

both speci…cations the results are positive, signi…cant, and of the same order of magnitude as

our previous regression discontinuity estimates. However somewhat surprisingly in column

(3) we …nd that when we exclude individuals with previous relatives the results become

weaker and the estimate becomes insigni…cant. This stands in contrast to our previous

regression discontinuity speci…cation. However we cannot refute that any of the estimates

di¤er within Table 22 or across the di¤erent approaches. Column (4) reports our overall

preferred speci…cation, which excludes individuals whose Postrelatives entered within ten

years of the …rst individual’s …rst reelection. This exclusion attempts to rule out cases where

the shock to a legislator’s reelection could have a direct e¤ect on the entry of a posterior
 23
      This of course subtracts out the result of the individual for whom the instrument is being created.




                                                      30
relative through a channel other than the legislator’s tenure. For example, if shocks are

serially correlated, it could be that a high rate of reelections for Democrats in California

in 1892 is associated with more power accruing to Democrats in general in the immediate

years. Therefore, the Postrelative of a Democratic legislator, being likely to be a Democrat

in California himself, may be more likely to attain power soon afterwards. Given our use

of state-decade e¤ects, when we focus on relatives that enter more than a decade after the

…rst reelection attempt occurred, we sever that potential channel. The result in column (4)

is signi…cant at the 5%. Finally in column (5) we exclude legislators with previous relatives

and exclude entry of posterior relatives within ten years and …nd a weaker, though signi…cant

result. Taken together, these results are consistent with those obtained from the regression

discontinuity approach.



5    Conclusion

We document patterns in the evolution and pro…le of political dynasties in the Congress

of the United States since its inception in 1789; and provide some evidence that dynastic

e¤ects are stronger for legislators than for other occupations. We also show that dynastic

legislators are less common under greater political competition. The basic emerging picture

is that dynastic politicians are more prevalent in less open, mobile, and competitive societies,

as well as in the Senate, the more exclusive of the two congressional chambers. We then

explore the dynastic transmission of political power with a focus on the presence of self-

perpetuation. A simple model helps us distinguish between self-perpetuation and other

sources of elite persistence, such as persistent heterogeneity in dynastic traits. We show that

the tenure length of legislators is correlated with the probability of their having a relative

entering Congress in the future. While this correlation could be due to unobserved family

characteristics, two di¤erent IV strategies allow us to determine that there is an important



                                              31
causal component: having a long tenure in Congress increases signi…cantly the probability of

establishing a dynasty (the e¤ect is around 70% of the baseline probability). Put di¤erently,

shocks to political power have persistent e¤ects. An implication is that the political class is

partly shaped by the luck of previous politicians, and that holding political power reinforces

the e¤ects of other potential sources of elite persistence such as di¤ering dynastic traits.

   Our results shed some light on the channels through which the dynastic transmission of

political power takes place. First, the fact that there is a causal relationship between tenure

length and the probability of starting or continuing a dynasty shows that superior original

endowments (in terms of genes, for instance) cannot fully explain the observed political

dynasties. Second, the fact that dynastic politicians are less likely to have previous public

o¢ ce experience suggests that dynastic politicians may not be characterized by a stronger

vocation for public service. This is contrary to the idea that relatives of successful politicians

may develop a vocation for public service. Finally, the fact that more political competition

is associated with less dynastic politicians suggests that dynastic transmission may be more

related to advantages such as superior contacts with party machines than to features valued

by voters, such as experience or superior human capital. These …ndings lay out a interesting

agenda for future research, namely undertaking a full analysis of the various mechanisms

driving the dynastic transmission of political power.

6        Appendix

6.1       Merging

We merged the biographical dataset and the Candidate and Constituency Statistics of

Elections in the United States, 1788-1990 (ICPSR study 7757) by matching each candi-

date/Congressional term observation in the Biographical Database with the subsequent re-

election attempt from the elections data. For example when Newton Gingrich served in the

96th Congress we would attempt to merge that observation with a reelection attempt to

enter into the 97th Congress. Unfortunately the data from the elections database is not

comprehensive and many elections are missing. Additionally merging between the Congres-

sional Biographical database and the elections database is complicated by the fact that they

only common identi…ers between both data sets are the year, state, and names of the candi-

dates. After removing elections where there are multiple winners24 and elections where no

names were associated with the candidates25 we are left with 30,028 house elections.26 This

stands in contrast with the 34,271 House member/Congress observations in the Biographical

Database.

       To merge the data sets we employed a multi-stage merging procedure. We …rst merged on

state/Congressional term/last name and kept all of the merges that were unique. For the re-

maining unmerged observations we then merged on state/Congressional term/last name/…rst

letter of …rst name27 and kept all of the unique merges. Finally we iterated the same process

for state/Congress/last name/…rst and second letter of the …rst name. At this point the
  24
     Historically there have been elections where the top two or more candidates were elected to Congress.
Upon inspection we found that these elections tend to have results that are confusing and do not match with
results from other sources. For the time being we have decided to drop these elections out.
  25
     This makes merging on candidate name quite di¢ cult.
  26
     We have decided to focus on House elections since for our purposes the Senate will not add a substantial
amount of data since Senators were not elected until the beginning of the twentieth century, are much less
in number than House members, and have less frequent election cycles.
  27
     We only merged on the …rst letter of the …rst name because the …rst names in the elections dataset were
often garbled and incomplete.



                                                     33
merging yield a mere 55 unique matches. After these merges we were able to match 23,016

observations from the elections database and the biographical database. Beyond the fact that

many elections were not recorded, this gap can be substantially attributed to the fact that

many candidates decided not to run for reelection, which would make a merge impossible

since they would not show up in the elections data set. For instance had Newton Gingrich

decided to retire after serving in the 96th Congress no entry would appear in the elections

database. Not surprisingly, the data that failed to merge disproportionately comes from the

earlier years where recording was markedly more sporadic.

       To further assess the e¢ cacy of the merge, we merged the data again, but by matching

the Biographical data with the election prior to entry. For example when Newton Gingrich

served in the 96th Congress we would attempt to merge that observation with the election in

1978 to enter into the 96th Congress. Despite the fact that this is not the type of merge that

we use in the paper, it is informative since it will enable us to conduct a diagnostic of whether

there are systematic biases in the sample.28 When conducting the merge in this manner we

were able match 28,560 elections out of the possible 30,028. To analyze whether our sample is

systematically biased we regress the probability that there is a successful merge on a large set

of legislator characteristics as well as …xed e¤ects for each state and decade (i.e. a California

1890 …xed e¤ect). In the unreported analysis we …nd suggestive evidence that there is little

systematic bias in the sample, with some notable exceptions. We …nd that elections where

women won are 7% less likely to be matched to results. Individuals who go onto to further

civic service are also 1.5% less likely to be matched to election results. However important

variables such as whether an individual has family members in Congress do not appear to

be systematically biased in the sample, conditioning on the state-decade …xed e¤ect. As
  28
    The problem with analyzing the data that was merged as explained above is that characteristics of
politicians (such as gender, age, etc.) would be correlated with the decision to retire from o¢ ce. Thus if we
observed women were much less likely to have a successful merge it would be impossible to determine if that
was due to data being less likely to be recorded or women being less likely to choose to run for re-election.
This problem does not occur in the alternative merging technique.



                                                     34
mentioned above, while merges are markedly more successful in later years, conditional on

the year we do not see systematic di¤erences in most of the variables of interest, which

suggests that data omission is essentially random. These merge considerations only apply

to the analysis in Section 4:4 where we use the elections data as an instrument.


6.2    Calculations for subsection 3.3

Because the General Social Survey does not report information on legislators, the row for

legislators in Table 5 follows calculations by the authors that exploit census information

and biographical data on legislators. Our objective was to do the calculation in the most

conservative manner possible, in order to estimate a lower bound for the dynastic prevalence

of legislators. While the information for the other professions comes from the period 1972-

2004, we only considered legislators elected in the 1990s, the last decade of our biographical

sample, which is conservative given that the trends of dynastic prevalence in Congress are

decreasing. The main challenge then lied in estimating how common legislators could have

been (as a proportion of total population) among the generation that spawned the mod-

ern generation of professionals. This requires estimating both the population size of the

generation of fathers, and the number of legislators within that generation. A conservative

calculation would be one that tends to underestimate the heritability of the legislative pro-

fession by overestimating how common legislators were in the generation of fathers. A simple

approach to determine how common legislators are among the fathers in an age cohort is to

see how many legislators belong to a typical class, and then determine the number of fathers

in that class. A conservative calculation should then overestimate the number of legislators

and underestimate the number of fathers. To do this we identi…ed the class that placed the

highest number of legislators. That is the class of 1840, which placed 94 legislators. We then

estimate the number of fathers in a cohort that could have spawned the legislators of the

1990s, and to err on the side of underestimating that number we take the population size


                                             35
of 1900 (earlier than when the 1990s legislators were conceived). In particular, we took the

number of males in fertile ages (20 to 44 years of age) in 1900 (1; 993; 708 people), and then

took only the percentage of them that would have become fathers. To do this we used the

47% paternity rate reported in the 2002 Survey of Family Growth in the United States. This

is conservative given that paternity rates tend to be lower in modern days. This method

yields that 0:01% of fathers were legislators.

Note: (3) = (1)/(2).
     The methodology for computing the legislator figures is explained in the
       appendix and was designed to provide a lower bound on the dynastic bias
       ratio for legislators.
     The data for non political occupations comes from the General Social Surveys
       (ICPSR study 4295).

Sample: Excludes individuals who entered Congress before 1879 due to lack of political competition
 data for earlier years.
The political competition index ranges from -0.5 (all seats in the state legislature held by one
 party, or least competitive) to 0 (seats held evenly by the two major parties, or most competitive).
The High competition dummy takes the value 1 whenever the political competition index is higher than
 the mid point -0.25.
