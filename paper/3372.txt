               CAN SEVER FISCAL CONTRACTIONS BE EXPANSIONARY?
                    TALES OF TWO SMALL EUROPEAN COUNTRIES


                                  ABSTRACT

According to conventional wisdom, a fiscal consolidation is likely to contract
real aggregate demand. It has often been argued, however, that this conclusion
is misleading as it neglects the role of expectations of future policy: if the
fiscal consolidation is read by the private sector as a signal that the share of
government spending in GDP is being permanently reduced, households will revise
upwards their estimate of their permanent income, and will raise current and
planned consumption.
   Only the empirical evidence can sort out which of these two contending views
about fiscal policy is more appropriate —— i.e how often the contractionary
effect of a fiscal consolidation prevails on its expansionary expectational
effect. This paper brings new evidence to bear on this issue drawing on. the
European exercise in fiscal rectitude of the 1980s, and focusing, in particulars
on its two most extreme cases —— Denmark and Ireland.
   We find that at least in the experience of these two countries the
expectations' view has a serious claim to empirical relevance.

1. Budget cuts in Europe: contractionary or expansionary ?
In most European countries, the high real interest rates of the early 1980s
combined with the large stock of public debt inherited from the 1970s to create

a potentially explosive debt problem. As governments started to tackle the

problem with contractionary fiscal policies, public officials and economists

voiced different beliefs about the likely effects of these measures. In Denmark,

for example, while the Parliament was discussing a package of severe budget cuts

in January 1983, the Ministry of Finance anticipated that the fiscal contraction

would "dampen private consumption", in truly Keynesian fashion:


  "Curtailing domestic demand will lead to a temporary increase in unemployment
   [...] and will have a dampening effect on business fixed investment. [...]
   It is to be expected that the Government's policy will secure a marked
   reduction in the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments"
   (Danish Ministry of Finance, 1983).


The German Council of Economic Experts, on the contrary, proposed the view that

the impact of budget deficits on demand was predominantly negative

(Sachverstandigenrat 1981), so that fiscal retrenchment should be seen as the

premise for an expansion, rather than a recession. In their retrospective

account of the German fiscal consolidation, Eels and Froehlich (1987) summarize

this anti—Keynesian view:


  "fiscal consolidation had a benign impact on expectations .. [An] important
   explanation is the way fiscal consolidation was actually brought about.
   Rather than raising taxes, the deficit was reduced by keeping a lid on
   expenditure growth ... By absorbing a smaller share of GNP, the public sector
   made room for the private sector to expand" (p. 184—5).


In a later reappraisal of that experience, Ilellwig and Neumann (1987) take an

eclectic stance, merging the Keynesian and the "German" views on budget cutting:



 "According to conventional wisdom, any policy of consolidation is likely to
  contract real aggregate demand in the shorter run. This Keynesian
  conclusion, however, is misleading as it neglects the role of expectations.
  A more adequate analysis differentiates between the direct demand effect of
                                         2




    cutting the growth of government expenditure and the indirect effect of an
    induced change in expectations. The direct demand impact of slower public
    expenditure growth is clearly negative .. The indirect effect on aggregate
    demand of the initial reduction in expenditure growth occurs through an
    improvement in expectations if the measures taken are understood to be part
    of a credible medium—run program of consolidation, designed to permanently
    reduce the share of government in GDP ... [and thus] taxation in the future"
    (p. 137—8).


   Only the empirical evidence can sort out which of these two contending views

about fiscal policy is more appropriate ——   or,   in Hellwig and Neumann's terms,

 how often the contractionary Keynesian effect of a spending cut prevails on its

expansionary expectational effect. The aim of this paper is precisely to bring

new evidence to bear on this issue: we draw on some of the data generated by thi

European exercise in fiscal rectitude of the 1980s, and focus on its two most

extreme cases —— Denmark and Ireland.

   The European experience is especially rich, not only because the severity of

budget cutting varied widely across countries, but also because the relative

contributions of taxes and spending to the final outcome were quite different.

Figure 1 shows that some countries were able to implement a very substantial

turnaround of the budget over the years 1981 to 1989 (for the UK, that was an

"early starter", the interval is 1979—89). In Ireland, Denmark; Sweden, Belgium

and the U.K. the budgetary position of the public sector improved by amounts

ranging from 6.6 to 3 Z of GOP. In others, like Germany and France, the

improvement in the budget was negligible, while in the Netherlands the deficit

actually increased. The contribution of taxes was relatively more important in

Ireland, Denmark, Sweden and Belgium, while most of the action in Germany came

from cuts in current spending. In the Netherlands the effect of reduced

government expenditure was more than offset by tax cuts; Italy and Spain,

instead, raised spending while relying entirely on tax revenue to improve the

budget —— a policy that resembles that of the United States.

   Table I describes the response of real private consumption to these fiscal

shocks. The regressions in the table are not to be seen as estimates of a

structural model, but rather as a way to summarize the main correlations in the

data. In raw (1) the regressors are a constant, cyclically—corrected taxes net

of transfers and subsidies 1 •   government consumption, and a proxy for the

international cycle; in regressions (2) and (3) real money balances are also

added to the list of regressors. All variables (except for the international

cycle proxy) are measured relative to potential GDP.

   Taxes appear to correlate negatively with private consumption: in regressions

(1) and (2), where the coefficients on the policy variables are constrained to

be the same across countries, the coefficient on taxes is negative and

significant; and it is generally negative (though often imprecisely estimated)

also in regression (3), where it is left unconstrained across countries. Real

money balances are positively correlated with private consumption and are often

significant.

   So far, the data are consistent with the predictions of a Keynesian textbook.

However, increases in government spending display a negative relationship with

consumption. This result hides considerable cross—country variation: the

unconstrained estimates in regression (3), show that this negative correlation

is strong and significant in some of the countries where, according to figure 1,

there were sharp cuts in public spending ——    Ireland,   the UK and the Netherlands.

In no country the coefficient of public spending is positive and significant.

endogeneity of taxes. Figures for cyclically—corrected taxes were provided by
the EC; their construction is described in European Economy, no. 22, 1984

a All regressions use 170 observations. In each regression the dependent
variable is real private consumption C as a share of potential output Y'
(obtained by fitting an exponential trend on 1973-89 real GOP). T are
cyclically—corrected taxes net of transfers and subsidies, C is public
consumption. In regressions (2) and (3) the regressors include also real money
(M2) as a share of potential output, (M/P)/r: in (2) its coefficient is
constrained to be the same for all countries, in (3) it is left unconstrained
across countries.   In addition, each regression includes a constant, a proxy
for the international cycle (deviations of OECD growth from trend) and country
dummies on these two regressors. The corresponding estimates are not reported
to save space. One (two) asterisk(s) indicates that the regressor is
significantly different from zero at the 10 Z (5 2) level. Data sources: OECD
National Income Accounts, except for T' that was provided by the EC.

    Figure 2 provides an alternative way to describe the relationship between

 spending cuts and private domestic demand. The figure plots yearly changes in

 the sum of private consumption and investment against changes in public

 spending, both measured relative to potential GDP. Data referring to the early

 and late 1980s are displayed separately, since in many countries the two

subperiods have coincided with two distinct waves of spending cuts. Dates vary

somewhat across countries to capture the years when fiscal action was more

evident. The figure shows that the recession of the early 1980s was equally

severe in countries that cut public spending and in those that did not. The

only exception is Denmark, where the ratio of public spending to potential

output fell dramatically in 1983—4, but private domestic demand grew vigorously.

Instead, in the recovery of the late 1980s, there seems to be a negative

relationship between private domestic demand and public consumption: all the

observations for this subperiod lie in the second and fourth quadrants of the

figure (with the only exceptions of Spain and the US). Among these, Ireland

stands out as the most prominent example of an expansionary cut in public

spending.

   This negative correlation between private and public spending can hardly be

credited to an endogenous response of public spending to the cyclical behavior

of income: our spending variable is defined as purchases of goods and services

by the public sector, and does not include such cyclical components as transfers

and subsidies.   In addition, most accounts of the spending cuts that have

occurred in Europe in the 1980s point to an exogenous shift in policy, often




(chapter 6).

associated with a change in government, rather than to an endogenous response of

policy makers to an improved economic performance.

   This suggests that the "German view" of negative fiscal multipliers cannot be

easily dismissed ——   at   least for the countries where spending cuts were

sharpest. According to this view, however, what should make a difference is not

only the magnitude of current spending cuts, but also their expected

persistence: only reductions in spending that are expected to persist can yield

permanently lower taxes (Barro 1979, 1981, Feldstein 1982). To assess the

expected persistence of spending cuts, we have fitted rolling univariate AJUMA

processes to real government consumption series of Denmark, Ireland and Germany;

the forecasts have then been used to compute the present discounted value (PDV)

of predicted public consumption, that provides a measure of "permanent

spending".2 The results are reported in figure 3.       For all three countries the

spending cuts of the 1980s are associated with lower permanent spending. The

drop is more sudden in Germany and in Denmark, where it is concentrated in 1981

and in 1982—84 respectively; it is more gradual in Ireland, where it spreads

almost over the entire decade.

   This evidence consistently points to the experiences of Denmark and Ireland

as the two most striking cases of "expansionary stabilizations" in Europe. In




2 The ARfl4A processes were selected on the basis of a standard Box—Jenkins
identification search. After analysing the correlation and partial
autocorrelation functions of the series, we discriminated among the models on
the basis of the adjusted R2, of the Q—statistics for the first ten lags of the
residuals, and of in—sample predictive efficiency. This search was repeated for
each year, after adding the corresponding observation. We have then used each
estimated process to generate dynamic forecasts of public consumption for 150
steps (years) ahead at each date, and then computed the PDV of this flow using a
5 % discount rate. A similar procedure is followed in Abmed (1987). See also
Seater and Mariano (1985).

Denmark, the fiscal turnaround of 1982 was accompanied by an unusually strong

expansion in the subsequent 4 years. En Ireland a similar outcome occurred

during the 1987—89 stabilization, although a previous attempt in the early 1980s

had plunged the economy in a severe recession.

   Denmark and Ireland thus offer a good testing ground to sort out the issues.

Why the experience of Denmark so sharply contradicts the Keynesian prediction

about the effects of a fiscal contraction ? What accounts for the early failure

and later success of the Irish stabilization ? The challenge posed by these

experiences goes beyond the interpretation of "what really happened" in each of

these countries. It offers an opportunity to identify the conditions under

which severe fiscal contractions can be expansionary. This opportunity is all

the more valuable because, in spite of all the discussion about the "German

view" of fiscal policy, so far, to our knowledge, no evidence has been brought

to bear on its empirical relevance.

   We begin by reviewing the key facts about the Danish and Irish experiments

(section 2), highlighting the importance of the monetary and exchange rate

policies that accompanied the fiscal stabilization. Next, we discuss how the

surge of private consumption can be related to these policy shocks (section 3).

We attack the problem in two steps. First, we investigate to what extent the

increase in consumption can be explained by the direct effects of policy shifts,

acting via changes in current taxes, spending and asset prices. The three

channels that we examine are: (i) the fall in disposable income due to the

increase in current taxes; (ii) the wealth effect due to the fall in nominal and

real interest rates; (iii) the reduced provision of public services to
                                            7



consumers.     We then consider if the portion of the surge in consumption left

unexplained by the change in current variables can be attributed to changes in

expectations about future fiscal policy, along the lines of the "German view".

Finally, we discuss to what extent the extraordinary performance of private

investment in Denmark can be related to the stabilization package (section 4).



2.   Tales of two expansionary   contractions

The similarity among the stabilization policies adopted by Denmark and Ireland

in the 1980s does not reside only in the sheer magnitude of the fiscal

turnaround. In both cases, cuts in spending and tax increases were accompanied

by a shift in the balance of political power, and by complementary monetary and

exchange   rate policies: after an initial devaluation, both countries pegged
their currencies to the German mark, inducing a sharp monetary disinflation, and
                         V
liberalized capital flows.
     Each of these complementary policy moves had an important role in determining

the final outcome of the stabilization: the effects of the fiscal turnaround

cannot be understood if they are not placed against the backdrop of the

accompanying   monetary and exchange rate policies. In the 1970s, these countries
had experienced not only large budget deficits but also high rates of inflation

and currency depreciation.       In the stabilizations of the 1980s, monetary

tightening   was invariably the first step of the plan: Central Banks moved first,
while political parties were still wrangling to gather enough social consensus
in order to cut spending and raise taxes. The monetary contraction did not take
place by reducing money supply growth, as in the United States and Britain in
                                                8




 1979—80, but by using       the   exchange rate vis—â—vis the German Mark as a nominal
                         -

anchor.

   The sudden disinflation led to a deterioration of the financial position of

the public sector, through the loss of seignorage and the increase in the real

cost of servicing fixed—rate debt issued when nominal interest rates where high

This heightened the sense of urgency about the need for a fiscal correction.

Prompt fiscal action was required also for the success of the monetary

stabilization itself, since, for the currency to be successfully pegged to the

mark, the danger of future monetization of public debt had to be ruled out. A

sharp reduction of the deficit could contribute to the long—run credibility of

the exchange rate, providing a signal that the government would meet its

obligations via tax revenue or spending cuts, and dispense with seignorage.



2. 1 Denmark

In 1982 Danish public debt was growing rapidly (from 29 2 of GDP at the

beginning of 1980 to 65 2 at the end of 1982), fuelled by high real interest

rates and by large primary deficits (3.1 1 of GDP). The deficit was the result

of from the government's attempt to boost demand in the middle of the world

recession of the early 1980s. Despite the stimulus to aggregate demand,

unemployment was 4.2 percentage points higher relative to 1979, and the current

account had worsened, bringing external debt from 17.5 2 to 33 1 of GDP over the

same interval. In October 1982 long—term interest rates reached 22 1, while

inflation was only 10 2: in the presence of such astronomical real interest

rates, the public started questioning the sustainability of public debt, while

S&P added a "credit watch" to the .&AA rating of Danish foreign debt.
                                           9




   At that time, a Conservative coalition formed a new government, and adopted a

draconian program of fiscal retrenchment. Within 4 years, the turnaround in the

full-employment primary budget was as large as 10 % of GDP, of which 2.8 t

accounted for by a fall in government consumption, 0.4 t by cuts in government

investment, and the rest by discretionary increases in taxes net of transfers.

The improvement in the actual primary budget was an even more dramatic 15.4 %.

As a result, the debt—GDP ratio started declining.

   In the monetary area the fiscal package was accompanied by the announcement

that the exchange rate of the Danish kroner versus the German mark would

henceforth be fixed. The credibility of the commitment to a fixed parity was

enhanced by the gains of competitiveness that Denmark had attained since the

inception of the EMS   through   a sequence of devaluations. The new government

strengthened the credibility of its announcement with two signals. A few months

after coming to office (in March 1983) there was a general EMS      realignment:   for

the first time since joining the system, the Danish authorities refrained from

devaluing the kroner, and thus effectively abandoned the "weak currencies'

camp."3   At the same time, they removed exchange controls: restrictions on

capital inflows were abolished immediately, and controls on outflows were phased

out over the subsequent two years (Thygesen 1985).

  The term structure of Danish interest rates around the announcement of the

stabilization, shown in figure 4, offers some    evidence   on the credibility of the

Christensen (1986) and Andersen and Risager (1987).

new policy.   When the government passed the test of the March 1983 realignment,

the long term interest rate fell sharply —— by 5.5 t in two months. (The gap

with German rates, however, did not actually close: as late as 1986, the

differential was still 4.6 %).

   As mentioned in section 1, rather than reducing aggregate demand and income,

the severe Danish contraction was accompanied by an average growth of 3.6 t in

real GD? over the years from 1983 to 1986. Growth was driven by domestic

demand: private consumption increased rapidly in spite of the reduction of

disposable income due to higher taxes, and investment boomed spectacularly (see

table 2).

   In the econometric model of the Danish Central Bank, the increase in

consumption appears to be remarkably well tracked by its correlation with wealth

(Christensen 1988). In fact, as shown by figure 5, consumption and wealth

reacted with striking simultaneity to the announcement of the stabilization plan

in the fall of 1982. The increase in the market value of wealth 4 was mostly

due to the increase in house prices. Figures 6A and 6B suggest that the jump in

the value of equity (houses and shares) was related to the sharp fall in real

interest rates that occurred in early 1983, at the time of the EMS realignment.S

   As shown in figure Sb, also public debt played a role in the increase of

households' wealth. As we show in Section 3, there were two reasons for the




4 The data for total wealth, houses and government bonds, shown in figures 5a
and 5b, are at market value and constant prices.

S We constructed ex ante real rates by deflating nominal rates using the
forecast for inflation from a VAR for inflation, short and long nominal interest
rates, on quarterly data from 1970 to 1988. The VAR used to compute the forecast
was re—estimated each year. The horizon over which the forecast is taken is
synchronized with the maturity of the nominal interest rate.

increase in the market value of debt: the fall in expected inflation raised the

real value of the future interest payments on nominal debt; the fall in the real

interest rate decreased the discount rate applying to the real value of those

interest payments. This was compounded by the fact that most of the outstanding

debt had very long maturities; at the time of the stabilization, Treasury Bills

accounted for 15 % of the Danish domestic debt; 85 t were fixed—rate bonds with

maturities ranging from 3 to 20 years, mostly issued when nominal rates were

high. As shown in figure 7, the long maturity "froze" the average cost of debt

servicing at relatively high levels, even after its marginal cost —— the yield

on new issues —- had fallen by over 10 2.

   At the same time as asset prices jumped and consumption started to rise,

there was a sharp turnaround in "consumer confidence" (figure 6C).' The rise in

consumer confidence may have resulted partly from the increase in financial and

real wealth, and partly from optimism about future income: it is impressive that

this wave of consumer optimism occurred at a time when taxes were being

dramatically raised, and public services curtailed.



2.2 Ireland

The first Irish stabilization of the early 1980s provides instead an example of

the textbook case. In 1981 Irish public finances were in a much worse situation

than those of Denmark. As a share of GDP, the primary full-employment budget

deficit was 8.4 2, debt service absorbed 8.3 2, and total national debt was 87%.

The current account deficit exceeded 10 % of GDP. The first serious attempt at

fiscal adjustment began in 1982: by 198k the full—employment primary deficit had

been reduced by more than 7 percentage points of GDP, most of it through higher

discretionary taxes (5.5 percentage points). At the same time, the monetary

authorities embarked on a sharp disinflation plan, by pegging the value of the

Irish punt within the EHS and thus relative to the German mark. Although this

resulted in a drop in both nominal and real interest rates, house and share

prices declined, as shown in figures 8A and 88 -—   contrary   to what was happening

in Denmark at about the same time. The deflationary impact on domestic demand

was tremendous: real private consumption fell by 7.1 Z in 1982 and remained

almost flat in the following two years. Business investment decreased

dramatically from 1982 to 1984, despite the fall in real interest rates. The

recession was in no way connected with a slowdown in external demand: as shown

in table 2, in the 1982—84 period Irish exports fared exceptionally well on

international markets.

   In spite of this early failure, the new government elected in February 1987

decided to try again. Elections had brought back to office Charles Haughey, the

same prime minister who had attempted the stabilization in 1982, and had been

voted out of office after its failure. In contrast with his earlier attempt,

that had been carried out in the context of a weak and quarrelsome coalition

government, "this time Mr. Haughey flatly refused to enter deals with anyone and

launched his minority government on the toughest austerity program the country

had witnessed."7   Within two years the full—employment primary deficit was cut

 by an additional 7 2 of GDP. Real growth resumed, and for the first time since

 the early 1970s the debt—income ratio started to decline.

    This time, most of the cut in the primary budget came from lower government

 consumption and government investment, rather than from the increase in

 discretionary taxes as in 1982 (see table 2; see also Mckleese and Mccarthy,

 1989). Moreover, what increase in tax revenue did take place was obtained by

widening the tax base via a fiscal reform accompanied by a once—and-for-all tax

amnesty: in contrast with the experience of the early 1980s, marginal tax rates

did not increase, and actually fell slightly.5 Another difference with the 1982

experiment stems from the accompanying exchange rate policy: the 1987

stabilization was preceded by a sharp devaluation, while the earlier attempt had

occurred at a trough of Irish competitiveness. The behavior of the real

exchange rate relative to other EMS currencies is illustrated in figure 9.

   However, exchange rate policy eased the stabilization not so much via its

direct effect on external demand, but rather via its indirect effect on interest

rates and domestic demand. The devaluation stimulated domestic demand by

enhancing the credibility of the new parity and thus producing a fall in

interest rates: nominal and real rates dropped S and 3.4 percentage points

respectively in the course of 1987 (see figure 8) —— an indication of

"credibility effects in asset markets" (Dornbusch 1989). Export growth, on the

contrary, was the same as during the first stabilization (see table 2).




8 The marginal tax rate for a typical married employee with two children had
been raised from 39.5 2 in 1980 to 43.5 2 in 1983: it was reduced to 42.75 2 in
1988. Similarly, for a typical single employee the marginal tax rate went from
39.5 2 in 1980 to 68.5 2 in 1985, and declined to 65.75 2 in 1988. (Source: OECD

3.    Is there a constion puzzle 7
In   section 2 we have documented the importance of the monetary and exchange rate

policies that accompanied the fiscai stabilizations. By pegging the exchange

rate to a low—inflation currency, the authorities induced a sharp fall in

nominal and real interest rates. This is because, once the exchange rate was

credibly fixed, domestic nominal interest rates moved towards the lower level of

foreign nominal rates. The convergence of nominal rates occurred faster than

the convergence of inflation —— as price stickiness prevented the goods market

from adjusting at the same speed as financial markets, where the response to

foreign interest rates had been accelerated by the removal of capital controls.

The result was that real rates of interest fell along with nominal rates.9

     Households were thus subjected to two simultaneous policy shocks: a cut in

current disposable income, due to the increase in current taxes, and a wealth

effect, due to the unanticipated fall in nominal and real interest rates. These

changes in disposable income and wealth, and their relative importance, appear

as the natural explanations for the observed behavior of consumption. The

consumption boom that accompanied the Danish and the second Irish stabilizations

could have been produced by an increase in wealth large enough as to overcome




9 This channel, that relies on price stickiness, is quite different from the
reason why a fiscal stabilization may be accompanied by a fall in real rates
explained in Drazen and Helpman (1989). In their model, the real rate is driven
by the anticipated change in the marginal utility of consumption: if the fiscal
stabilization occurs through a cut in public spending, the post—stabilization
level of private consumption will be higher (because of the implied fall in
permanent taxes) and its marginal utility will be lower. In the presence of
uncertainty about the exact date of the fiscal stabilization, households will
not be able to avoid a jump in their consumption path when the stabilization
occurs: accordingly, to forgo consumption prior to the stabilzation they will
require a higher real rate.
                                        15




any possible contractionary effect stemming from the cut in current disposable

income. Conversely, the drop in private consumption that occurred during the

first Irish stabilization could be due the absence of a wealth effect, as the

fall in interest rates failed to translate into an increase in asset prices.

    If this interpretation were to be supported by the data, there would be no

reason to resort to the "German view" of fiscal policy to account for our

episodes of expansionary contractions. Consumption could be satisfactorily

explained by the direct effects of the policy package; there would be no

consumption puzzle to be solved by appealing to expectations, namely to the role

of current policy shifts as signals of future policies.



3. 1. The direct effects of the stabilization

The fiscal and monetary policies described so far could in principle have

affected consumption through four direct channels: U)     the   increase in current

taxes, (ii) the fall in expected inflation, (iii) the fall in real interest

rates, and (iv) the substitution of private consumption for services no longer

supplied by the government.



3. 7. 1.   Taxes and wealth

The first three channels are analyzed in the appendix using the eclectic model

of Blanchard (1982), that encompasses both a Ricardian world and a non—Ricardian

one as special cases. If households have finite horizons, a temporary increase

in taxes dampens private consumption: a fiscal consolidation designed to stop

the growth of public debt by raising current taxes is contractionary because,

even if the present value of taxes remains the same, a larger share of it is

paid for by the current generation. A fall in expected inflation can work in
                                        16




 the opposite direction: if households have finite horizons and public debt

 consists of long—term fixed—rate nominal bonds, a fall in expected inflation

 stimulates consumption. This is because the market value of debt goes up, but

only part of this capital gain is paid for by the current generation via higher

 taxes.   Finally, a fall in real interest rates raises wealth and consumption

whether or not consumers regard public debt as net worth. However, if debt is

considered as net worth and consists of long—term bonds, the positive wealth

effect on consumption works also through the capital gain on long—term debt that

is not fully offset by a corresponding increase in future taxes.

   Are these channels sufficient to explain the observed pattern of consumption

in Denmark and Ireland ? To answer this question, we estimate conventional

consumption functions for the two countries and inquire whether, conditioning on

the structure of these relations and on the observed path of disposable income

and wealth, we can track consumption during the stabilizations of the l980s.

   In the estimation of consumption functions we follow the specification

proposed by Hayashi (1982): households' consumption of non—durables and services

is a function of its own lagged value, of Lagged after—tax labor earnings, of

current and lagged wealth, and (to allow for the possibility that some consumers

are liquidity—constrained) of current and lagged disposable income. Public debt

is introduced as a separate regressor, along with other farms of private wealth,




10 This suggests that debt maturity can have a peculiar effect on the budget in
such circumstances. The conventional view of policy—makers is that, when the
maturity of public debt is long, rapid disinflation makes fiscal stabilization
more difficult, by raising the real burden of debt service. Thus, the longer
the maturity of the debt, the larger the required turnaround in the primary
deficit. This point, however, overlooks the fact that the wealth effect
associated with the fall in inflation raises private consumption, and thus tax
revenue, providing at least a partial offset to the increase in debt service.
                                       17




to avoid imposing a restriction on the degree of tax discounting. The appendix

shows the derivation of this consumption function, and the need to estimate it

by non—linear instrumental variables to account for the endogeity of wealth and

disposable income while imposing the non—linear restrictions implied by the

model.

   The results reported in table 3 show that the model's restrictions are always

accepted at conventional significance levels. As far as Denmark is concerned,

the magnitude of 0 and the precision of its estimate indicate that the path of

wealth (net of public debt), A(t), significantly affects that of private

consumption. For Ireland, instead, net wealth is significant only when

disposable income is omitted from the regressors.

   The coefficient on public debt, 3, is instead very imprecisely estimated for

both countries. This casts doubt on the proposition that capital gains on

public debt have driven consumption during the 1980s.    A warning however is in

order: here public debt should be measured at market value, particularly since

we know that there have been large capital gains on debt. Such a series is

available only for Denmark. For Ireland we have no choice but to use data on

public debt at book value, so that our estimates for this country should be

taken with some skepticism. Nevertheless, there is another piece of evidence

suggesting that in Ireland capital gains on public debt may have no effect on

consumption. We know that the average maturity of Irish public debt is long

(see Giavazzi and Pagano, 1989), and that both stabilizations were accompanied

by a sharp fall in nominal and real interest rates: the market value of Irish




ii Our results for Ireland appear to confirm the finding by Moore (1987) that
public debt has no role in the Irish consumption function.

 public debt must thus have Jumped in both stabilizations.        But the two fiscal

 corrections had opposite effects on consumption.t2

    The estimates of the coefficient i show that, while in Ireland anticipated

 changes in current disposable income have a substantial effect on consumption,

 in Denmark consumption and current disposable income seem completely decoupled.

 This difference between the two countries is consistent with the dissimilar

 response of consumption during the Danish and Irish stabilizations: in Denmark

wealth effects sheltered consumption from the fall in current disposable income;

 in Ireland1 instead, during the first stabilization conswnption took all the

brunt of higher taxes, while the consumption boom of the late 1980s was helped

by the rise in disposable income (see table 2).

   A significant value for the parameter j.i   is   evidence of a departure from the

permanent income hypothesis that can be interpreted as a symptom of liquidity

constraints or of consumers' myopia. Additional evidence on this point can be

obtained by estimating Euler equations for aggregate consumption of non—

durables. As shown by Hall (1978) and Hayashi (1982), under suitable

assumptions, the proportion of income accruing to liquidity—constrained

households can be measured by the excess sensitivity parameter in the Euler

equation. Estimates of this equation are reported in table           To correct for




 12 The only factor that could restore some credibility to the hypothesis that
public debt affects consumption is the fact that Irish households hold directly
only a negligible fraction of the outstanding debt: most of it is held in the
portfolios of pensions funds, insurance companies and other institutions, and
households cannot easily liquidate their position in pension funds or borrow
against their equity in insurance companies. These institutional constraints
can dampen the size of wealth effects on consumption: the financial
liberalization that has occurred in Ireland in the late 1980s could then go
somewhat towards reconciling the different outcomes that the capital gain on
public debt may have had in the two stabilizations.

the endogenejty of current disposable income, the equations are estimated by

non—linear instrumental variables (NLIV). Since the constraint a =   1   in most

cases is not rejected, we also re—estimate the equation by regressing the first

differences of consumption on those of disposable income. In addition, we

report the results obtained by using full information maximum likelihood (FIML)

to estimate the consumption equation jointly with a predictive equation for

disposable income, and imposing the relevant cross—equations restrictions. The

results confirm that consumption responds strongly to anticipated changes in

current disposable income in Ireland, but not in Denmark.'3

   It is natural to ask which structural differences between the two countries

lie behind these results. The answer may rest in the very different functioning

of credit markets in the two countries. In Denmark, lending to households plays

a central role in financial intermediation, and there is no rationing in the

market for credit to households. A survey conducted on behalf of the Central

Bank since 1981 reveals that only 2 % of households postpone purchases of

consumer durables because they have received or believe they would receive a

loan refusal (Kjaer 1987).14 In Ireland, instead, credit to households has

traditionally been less plentiful. Only in the late 1980s this has started to

change, as the mortgage market, formerly the preserve of building societies, has

been opened to competition by commercial banks.

  A reflection of this institutional difference between the two countries can




13 The only regression for Ireland which does not display excess sensitivity is
that estimated with FIML without imposing the constraint a = 1. In this case,
however, the other constraints on the model are rejected by the data at the
conventional S t significance level.
1+ These data are based on the "omnibus survey", conducted by Danmarks Statistik
on a sample of 1,400 wage and salary—earning households, three times a year.

Footnotes to Table 3:

  C is consumption of non—durables. For Denmark it is defined as total
consumption minus rent, fuel and power, furniture and household equipment and
personal transport equipment (source: OECD NIA). For Ireland it is total
consumption minus clothing and footwear, durable household goods, and transport
equipment (source: Central Bank of Ireland, as in Moore 1987). Y is disposable
income of the private sector for Denmark (source: Central Bank of Denmark) and
of the household sector for Ireland (source: Central Bank of Ireland). For both
countries, A is beginning—of—period wealth, net of public debt D, of social
security wealth, and of domestic assets held by foreigners; it includes houses
at market prices and business capital valued at replacement cost. For Denmark,
wealth is constructed by subtracting the entire stock of domestically held debt
D from private sector wealth (we subtract also public debt held by banks to net
out the portion of deposits which has public debt as counterpart on the balance
sheet of banks). The variable w is labor income, after—tax for Denmark and
before—tax for Ireland (source: Central Bank of Denmark, and OECD NIA for
Ireland). All variables are in real per capita terms (the deflator used is that
for non—durables consumption).

b The estimation method is NLIV, and the estimates reported in the table are
obtained by imposing the non—linear constraint on the coefficients of the
equation. The instruments are a constant, a time trend and one lag of net
wealth, disposable income, labor after—tax income, government consumption,
government investment, real money, investment, terms of trade (defined as the
ratio of import prices to the deflator of consumption of non—durables). Source:
OECD NIA.

  The test refers to the non—linear constraint on the coefficients of the
equation; the test statistic is the quasi—likelihood ratio of Gallant and
Jorgenson computed by TSP. The percentage value shown in the table is the
significance level below which the constraints are accepted: a higher
significance level is a tighter criterion on the null hypothesis, since it
corresponds to a lower probability of a type II error.

Footnotes to table 4:

a Variables are defined as in table 3. In the quarterly regressions for Denmark,
consumption of non—durables is defined as total consumption minus clothing and
footwear, housing equipment and personal transport equipment (source: Central
Bank of Denmark).

b In the regressions on yearly data, the instruments are the first lag of
disposable income, government consumption, government investment, net exports
and a time trend. In the equations that employ differences of consumption and
investment (dC and dY), the instruments are the same variables in differenced
form. In the regressions on quarterly data, the instruments are four lags of
disposable income and of consumption.

  In the NLIV estimates, the test refers to the non—linear constraint on the
coefficients of the equation for C; the test statistic is the quasi—likelihood
ratio of Gallant and Jorgenson computed by TSP. In the FIML estimates, we test
jointly this non—linear constraint and the cross—equation constraints between
the equations for C and 1; in this case we use a likelihood ratio test. For the
interpretation of these values, see table 3. In both cases, the results reported
in the paper refer to the constrained estimates.

d The set of regressors Z in the predictive equation for Y includes the same
variables used as instruments in the NLIV regressions.

 be found in the different size of the market for consumer loans documented in

 table 5: in Denmark total lending to consumers (the sum of consumer credit and

 housing mortgages) is about 3 times as large as in Ireland, as a percentage of

 total consumption. To put these numbers in perspective, consider that in the US

 in 1984 the ratio of consumer credit to consumption was 24 Z and the

 corresponding figure for housing mortgages was 57 t —— a total of 81 t to be

 compared with 150 2 in Denmark and 43 t in Ireland.15 Table 5 also documents

 the tremendous rise in consumer lendiM during the Danish stabilization.     The

second Irish stabilization was also accompanied by a rise in consumer lending,

 though to a much smaller degree.



3. 1.2 Substitution between public and private goods

The analysis conducted so far implicitly assumes that public consumption is a

pure waste of resources, yielding no utility to consumers —— an assumption

increasingly questioned in recent research (see e.g. Aschauer 1985). If

consumers value the public provision of services such as schools, health care

and the like, they will increase private spending on these items when they are

no longer provided by the government. Thus, substitution of private for public

consumption is an additional direct channel between fiscal policy and private

expenditure. To the extent that there is such substituion, the apparent

increase in private consumption reflects simply measurement error: if one could




15 The relationship between the size of the market for consumer lending and the
excess sensitivity of consumption that we find here parallels the results in
Jappelli and Pagano C1989) for other 7 OECD countries. Other evidence pointing
to the importance of the market for consumer lending in explaining consumption
behavior is reported by Kuellbauer and Murphy (1989), that analyze the UK credit
market liberalization of the 1980s, and by Bayoumi and Koujianou (1989), who
look at evidence from the US, Japan, Canada, the UK, France and Sweden.

measure true consumption, rather than consumer spending on private sector

output, one would find that it has not increased.

   To provide a rough assessment of the relevance of this measurement error, we

compare the increase in private spending with the reduction of public spending

on the items for which substitution is most likely. Table 6 shows that in

1983-84 the Danish government slashed spending on health care, education,

entertainment and provision of public transportation proportionately more than

other spending. On their side, Danish households increased private spending on

these services by more than their total consumption expenditure: this is

particularly evident in the case of education, entertainment and cultural

services. While this constitutes evidence in favor of the substitution

hypothesis, the empirical magnitude of this factor seems quite modest,

relatively to the total surge in consumption to be explained: the contribution

of spending on these classes of services to the total increase in consumption in

those two years is only 14.9 t.



3.2. The consumption puzzle and the role of expectations about future policy

Once we control for changes in disposable income and wealth, is there still a

large fraction of the observed changes in consumption that remains to be

explained 7 And do the forecast errors coincide with the years of the fiscal

contractions ?   For Denmark, we have used the consumption function reported in

line 1 of table 3 to construct out—of—sample dynamic forecast errors for the

years 1984—87. The equation significantly underpredicts consumption from 1985

onwards:

 error of 3.36 2 in 1986 implies a predicted growth rate of real per capita

 consumption of 1.8 2, while the actual growth rate in that year was 4.1 2.

Using quarterly data we can repeat this exercise with an added gain in accuracy:

 owing to the larger number of observations, we can estimate the same regression

with data up to 1983:1, so that the structure of the model reflects only

 information available at the time of the forecast.'' For comparability with the

forecast errors obtained on yearly data, we report averages of the quarterly

errors:

computed dynamic forecasts from a regression for total consumption, rather than




16 The equation used to produce the forecast uses the same variables and
instruments as that reported in line 1 of table 3, but does not impose the non-
linear restriction across parameters (using quarterly data, these restrictions
are rejected at the 10 2 significance level).
                                       23




for non—durable consumption (data for the latter were not available for 1988,

the first year of the successful stabilization). The regressors are the same as

in line 5 of table 317 [n 1988 the growth rate of real per capita consumption

was 2.65 t, while that forecasted by our regression is 0.6 Z.

   Since these forecasts are computed by conditioning on the actual realizations

of the exogenous variables, including wealth, these errors cannot be attributed

to the increase in wealth due to the fall in interest rates and the jump in

asset prices documented in figures 6 and 8. There is indeed a consumption

puzzle.

   Can the German view of fiscal policy help to resolve it 7 As discussed

above, this view turns on the idea that fiscal consolidation can be read by the

private sector as a signal that the share of government consumption in 01W is

going to be reduced permanently, so that also taxes will be permanently lower.

This would lead households to revise upwards their estimate of their human

capital (the discounted value of after—tax labor income), and to raise current

and planned consumption. In the appendix we show that the effect of permanent

spending cuts on private consumption is positive whether consumers have infinite

horizons or not (although the quantitative significance of the effect depends on

the length of their horizon, among other things).

   For this view to be consistent with the data, it must be true that households

perceived the spending cuts as permanent, and the concomitant tax increases as

temporary. On the first point, we already know from figure 3 that our proxy for




17 Also in this case, the forecasting equation was estimated without imposing
the restrictions maintained in table 3.
                                           24




permanent government consumption has declined after the inception of the

stabilization plans. On the other hand, actual taxes have started to come down

in Denmark after 1986 and in Ireland after 1987, although they are still well

above the level of the 1970s (see figure 10 that shows cyclically—corrected

taxes, net of transfers and subsidies).18

   A more refined test of the expectations view turns on the following point.

Under rational expectations, the error term of the consumption function reflects

innovations in permanent disposable income. Now, suppose that announcements of

spending cuts are indeed read as "good news" about future disposable income,

i.e.   as   a signal that the government is about to reduce taxes accordingly

further in the future. Then one should find a negative correlation between

consumption surprises and surprises in permanent spending by the government (see

appendix). We ran a simple OLS regression between the in—sample residuals of

our consumption function for Denmark (line 1, table 3) and changes in government

consumption, as proxy for the surprises in permanent public spending. The

relationship is negative, but it is significant (at the 10 2 level) only when

the regressor is the lagged change in public spending, not its current value:



        consumption residual r   constant — 0.197E—3   lagged change in
                                            (1.705)    government consumption


               0.11      OW = 2.36


This lagged response may reflect the institutional delay in the release of

revised figures for government spending, so that it is reasonable to suppose

that people update their estimate of permanent spending with a lag.

     In Ireland, instead, no significant correlation is found between consumption

residuals and changes in government spending. This may perhaps be due to the

presence of liquidity constraints, that we have documented in the previous

section: the positive impact on consumption of a fall in permanent taxes can be

dampened is consumers are unable to borrow freely against their human capital or

their equity.



3.3.    Summing up

It   may be useful at this point to summarize our findings about the consumption

puzzle. For Denmark, there is considerable evidence in favor of the view that

the consumption boom of 1984—86 cannot be fully explained by the fall in

interest rates and the implied wealth effects, and that the unexplained

component of the boom is related to cuts in public spending. This is consistent

with the view that cuts in current government cohsumption were seen as a signal

of lower taxes further in the future.

     For Ireland, instead, the main finding is that consumption is driven

primarily by disposable income ——   probably a reflection of the importance of
liquidity constraints in the Irish economy. This may explain the contractionary

effects of the first Irish stabilization, when the reduction in disposable

income translated directly into a corresponding drop in consumption. What then

explains the consumption boom that accompanied the second Irish stabilization ?

Probably a combination of factors: first, the axe of the new government fell




most the endogeneity of this variable.
                                          26




more heavily on public spending than on households' disposable income, unlike a

 few years before, and the increase in tax revenue was obtained while reducing

marginal tax rates; second, the liberalization of the Irish credit markets in

 the late 1980s may have increased the ability of households to borrow in

anticipation of higher future incomes. It is tempting to relate the large

forecast error of the Irish consumption function in 1988 with these two factors,

and to conclude that the "German view" may have something to say also for the

second Irish stabilization.



4.   Real interest rates and investeent

In section 3 we have argued that part of the expansionary effects associated

with the fiscal stabilization in our two "test countries" may actually stem from

the fall in real interest rates associated with the concomitant monetary and

exchange rate policies. Obviously, a fall in the long—term real rate of

interest stimulates investment. Nevertheless, this appears not to be enough to

explain the investment boom in Denmark in 1985—6: when we estimate a simple

reduced form equation for business investment, that includes one lag of

investment and of the real cost of capital, and two lags of real GDP, we find

that its dynamic forecasts significantly underpredict investment in these

years: 19




19 Investment, I, is defined as gross business investment; Y is real GIll'
(Source: OECD, National Income Accounts). The user cost of capital is defined as
(.JC r [(l+i)*(l_t)]J(1_cte)       is the Danish bank loan rate, t is the
                             where i
corporation tax rate, and ,re is expected inflation over a 5—year horizon, built
using the same methodology described in footnote 2. The regression is estimated
on yearly data from 1971 to 1988, and has a corrected R2 of .732, and a Durbin
Watson value of 2.33. Very similar results were obtained using data from 1961,
but omitting the user cost of capital, that is not available before 1971.

This evidence is consistent with two alternative explanations. As in the case

of consumption, investment decisions may reflect an increase in profitability

associated with the anticipated cut in future taxes. An alternative explanation

is suggested by the observation that the decision to peg the exchange rate and

to remove capital controls was accompanied by massive capital inflows: foreign

borrowing by private enterprises, in 1984 and 1985, accounted for 42 2 and 51 2

respectively of gross business investment expenditure.2° The reaosn is probably

that although, as we know, nominal interest rates fell considerably at the

announcement of the stabilization, they remained higher than German rates. In

the presence of a credibly fixed exchange rate, borrowing abroad became a very

convenient proposition: domestic firms suddenly faced lower realrates —— equal

to the German nominal rate minus the domestic inflation rate. In this context,

the removal of controls on capital inflows by the Danish authorities was

equivalent to a positive demand shock.

4. What have we    learned   1'




We started this paper by asking whether the European exercise in fiscal

rectitude in the 1980s sheds any light on two contending views about the effects

of a fiscal contraction: the Keynesian view, that focuses on its direct effects

on aggregate demand, and the "expectations" view ——     also   known in Europe as the

"German view" ——    that   stresses the role of current changes in taxes or in

government spending as signals of possible future changes. We have learned that

there are cases in which the German view has a serious claim to empirical

relevance. The Danish experience shows that cuts in government spending can be

associated with increases in consumption even after controlling for wealth and

income, and even in the presence of a substantial increase in current taxes.

The Irish case, however, highlights the potential importance of liquidity

constraints for the operation of this mechanism. When current disposable income

effectively constrains consumption, Keynesian textbook propositions seem to

recover their predictive power, as witnessed by the 7 % drop in real consumption

in 1982 during the first Irish stabilization.

  We have also found that part of the expansionary effects of the fiscal

contractions analyzed here must be attributed to the concomitant monetary

disinflation, that in these countries operated via the switch to fixed exchange

rates with a low—inflation currency (the German mark), and the liberalization of

capital flows. This produced a sharp fall of nominal interest rates: in the

presence of inflation inertia, the latter translated into a corresponding drop

of real rates and a rise in aggregate demand. This expansionary effect,

however, crucially hinged upon the credibility of the fixed parity chosen by the

monetary authorities: it is remarkable that in both our cases of "expansionary

contractions" the shift in fiscal and exchange rate policy was preceded by a

sizable devaluation.

 1. The response of private consumption to fiscal and monetary policy



 Consider the consumption function proposed by Blanchard (1985):



 (1)     C(t) = (p+Q) [H(t)+ K(t)÷ 0(1)]



where i/p is the horizon index (p —) 0 being the Ricardian case of infinite

horizon consumers), }i(t) is human capital, K(t) is private wealth net of

government debt, and D(t) is the market value of government debt, measured in

units of consumption goods. Human capital is the present discounted value of

after—tax labor income, discounted at the subjective rate of the representative

household, p+9:




                  1                             1•
(2)     H(t) r         Y(s)elr+p)ls.t)ds    —
                                                     T(s)e(r+P)(s_t)ds
                  it                            it


where the real interest rate r is assumed to be constant.

   To highlight the role of a long maturity of the debt, we assume that public

debt consists of B consols, each paying 1 dollar per period. Using the

government budget constraint, the real value of debt, i.e. the discounted value

of the flow of coupons on the B consols (measured in units of consumption),

equals the discounted value of future real budget surpluses:
                                          32




                 N                             N
(3)     D(t)          et(8t) (Be_1!(t))ds =        [T(s)_G(s)]er(s-t)ds
                  t                            t




Using these three equations, we can analyze the response of consumption to

changes in current taxes T(t), in the inflation rate t, in the real interest

rate r and in permanent spending GP(t), defined as the annuity value of the

future discounted flow of real government spending:




(4)     GP(t)     r        G(s)e(t)ds
                      it


As shown by Blanchard (1982), if the horizon of consumers is finite (p > 0)

consumption falls when, for given G(t), the government raises taxes

temporarily, offsetting such an increase by a tax cut at some future date t+r,


        oC(t)
                = - (p+O)    ci_e"n C 0
        oT(t)


In both equations (5) and (.6) the effect on consumption is an increasing

function of p: the shorter the horizon of consumers, the larger the fall in

consumption in response to higher transitory taxes, or inflation.

With incomplete tax discounting and long—term nominal debt, also an increase in

inflation reduces consumption, since higher inflation decreases the market value

of nominal debt D(t) by more than it increases human capital H(t). Assuming

that the increase in x is permanent and that the corresponding reduction in

taxes will be concentrated at some future date t+r, the effect is:
                                                     33




           oC(t)                B
(6)                = — (p+e)             (1—cPt) c        0




The effect of an increase in the real interest rate r, instead, is always

negative, whether the horizon of consumers is infinite (p                 0) or not. However,

in the presence of finite horizons, the negative effect of a rise in r works

also through the capital loss on the market value of long—term debt, that is not

fully offset by a corresponding increase in human capital (due to the fall in

future taxes). Assuming that real government spending and real taxes are

constant at levels 13 and T respectively, and that pre—tax labor and capital

income are also fixed at a level Y, the effect of a permanent rise in the real

rate of interest is:


           6C(t)                1—13                 T p (2r+p)
(7)                 — (p÷O)              —
                                             (pie)                <   0
            ôr                 (r+p)2                r2 (rip)2


where the term corresponding to the capital loss on long—term debt is the second

one, and vanishes for p =       0.

      Finally, consider the effect of a change in current spending 13(t). If this

is perceived as temporary,             i.e. permanent spending G(t) remains unchanged, it

can be shown that consumption will not change, irrespective of the value of p.

This is because a temporary change in current spending does not affect the path

of taxes. If however households regard the change in current spending as a

signal of a change in permanent spending, their consumption will be affected.

Suppose for instance that permanent spending increases and that in each future

period s taxes T(s) are going to be changed by an amount equal to the change in
                                                         34




permanent spending GP(t). Then current consumption c(t) falls:


                 8C(t)        p+8
(8)                       r   ——<0
                 oGP(t)       r+p


Viceversa, a cut in permanent spending has art expansionary effect on current

consumption. The effect of consumers' horizon (lip) is ambiguous: on the one

hand, a long horizon implies that the consumer will be around longer to enjoy

lower taxes; on the other, she will have to spread the increase in her permanent

income over a longer expected lifetime. If the individual consumption path is

flat (8 =      r),   these two effects cancel out, and the increase in consumption

exactly matches the fall in permanent spending. A longer horizon makes the

spending cut more expansionary if individual consumption is declining over time

(0 >   r),    and less expansionary if it is increasing over time (8 <                     r).   If 8 >

an increase in permanent disposable income translates more into higher wealth

accumulation than into higher current consumption; if 0 <                        r,   the reverse

happens.



2. Derivation        of the equation estimated in table 3


The equation is derived along the lines of Hayashi (1982). Aggregate

consumption behavior is characterized by the consumption function:



(9)          C(t) :8 [A(t) +        H(t)]   +   13   D(t) +   sY(t)   +   u(t)


where A(t) is real and financial wealth net of public debt, 11(t) is human
                                                       35




 capital, D(t) is public debt, Y(t) is personal disposable income and u(t) is a

 white noise disturbance that captures transitory consumption shocks arising from

 preference shifts and measurement errors. The parameter 13 on public debt can be

 smaller than the parameter e on other forms of wealth to reflect the degree of

 tax discounting by the private sector (J3                  0 in the Ricardian case). The

parameter i measures the share of income accruing to consumers who do not behave

 according to the permanent income hypothesis, due to liquidity constraints or

myopia, and simply consume all their disposable income.

   The law of motion of human capital is:



(10)    11(t)   (1+6) [H(t—1) — w(t—1)J +               e(t)


where 6 is the discount rate that consumers apply to their future after—tax

labor income w(t), and e(t) is the revision of the value of human capital —— a

white noise error under rational expectations. An unexpected fall in permanent

taxes at time t leads to a revision of the P1W of future after—tax earnings H(t)

and thus to a positive realization of e(t).

   Equation (10) can be used in (9) to substitute out the unobservable 11(t),

obtaining the equation estimated in table 3:



(11)    C(t) = (1+6)C(t—1) +         8{A(t)   —
                                                  (1+o)[A(t—1)       +   w(t—1)J}
                               —
                +   13[fl(t)       (1+6)D(t—1)]    +    s[Y(t)   —
                                                                     (1+8)Y(t—1)]   +   v(t)

The error term v(t)       u(t) —     (1+6)u(t—i)       +    Qe(t) reflects current and lagged
shocks to transitory consumption, u(t), and revisions of human capital and
                                         36




permanent taxes, e(t). Due to the non—linear restrictions among the

coefficients and to the correlation between Mt), Y(t) and v(t), the equation

must be estimated with NLIV, using variables in the information set of consumers

at time b-i as instruments. The MA(1) component involving u(t) can lead to

serial correlation in the error term, which in turn can make these instruments

endogenous (see Flayashi 1982); however, in our estimates this problem can be

neglected, since the sample autocorrelation of the residuals is not

significantly different from zero.

   To the extent that a reduction in current spending is perceived by households

as permanent, it will translate into an unexpected increase in their human

capital, H(t), and thus into a positive e(t). Thus we expect changes in

spending, if permanent, to correlate negatively with the estimated consumption

residual v(t), via its component e(t).
