     There are many potential explanations of the phenomenal increase in
stock prices in the United States during the past several years. One popular
explanation is that as baby boomers save for retirement, their aggregate
demand for capital is very large, which drives up the price of capital. This
explanation then goes on to predict that when the baby boomers retire, they
will sell large amounts of capital and drive down its price. Jim Poterba
uses the term ‚Äùasset market meltdown hypothesis‚Äù to refer to this predicted
decline in stock prices.
     Poterba examines data on asset holdings in several cross sections of the
Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) and raises an important challenge to
the asset market meltdown hypothesis. He points out that recent theoreti-
cal models of a market meltdown assume that baby boomers will sell all of
their assets during their retirement years,1 and he argues that this assump-
tion is inconsistent with the data on asset holdings in the SCF. Subject
to the di¬¢culty of disentangling time e¬§ects, cohort e¬§ects, and age e¬§ects,
Poterba concludes from his Tables 1 and 2 that although consumers rapidly
accumulate assets while they are of working age, they decumulate assets
during retirement much less rapidly than would be predicted by a simple
life-cycle model with no bequest motive and no lifetime uncertainty. He
extrapolates from these results to conclude that the baby boomers will not
sell all of their assets during retirement, and he further concludes that the
asset market meltdown hypothesis is incorrect in its prediction that the price
of capital will fall.
     Poterba also looks for empirical evidence of an e¬§ect of demographic vari-
ables on asset prices and returns. He ‚Ä¶nds a very weak e¬§ect of demographic
variables on asset returns, but he ‚Ä¶nds a more substantial e¬§ect of demo-
graphic variables on stock prices using data he generates on ‚Äùprojected asset
demands.‚Äù Poterba calculates projected asset demands by combining age-
speci‚Ä¶c asset holdings from his Table 2 with actual and projected age-speci‚Ä¶c
populations in each year. He ‚Ä¶nds (Table 13) some evidence of a positive
relationship between projected asset demands and the price-dividend ratio
over various historical sample periods dating back to 1926. Looking forward,
the projected asset demands reported in his Table 5 increase over the next
two decades and then remain fairly constant for the succeeding three decades.
   1
     Abel (2000) and Brooks (1999) both assume that consumers know precisely when they
will die and do not have bequest motives so that they optimally choose to have zero wealth
at the time of death.



                                            1
Because projected asset demands do not fall when the baby boomers retire,
Poterba rejects the asset market meltdown hypothesis while maintaining the
notion that the baby boom contributed to the increase in stock prices.
    Poterba has demonstrated that, in contrast to the predictions of a life-
cycle model with no bequest motive and no lifetime uncertainty, the projected
demand for assets will not decline sharply when the baby boomers are retired.
I will accept this conclusion, but I will argue here that the failure of the
demand for capital to fall in the future does not imply that the price of
capital will not fall. Speci‚Ä¶cally, taking account of the supply of capital,
as well as its demand, the equilibrium price of capital may fall when baby
boomers retire, even if the the demand for capital by retired baby boomers
remains high.
    In this paper, I present a general equilibrium overlapping generations
model with convex adjustment costs, which generate an endogenous price of
capital as in Abel (2000). I include a bequest motive so that consumers will
choose not to consume all of their wealth during retirement. The inclusion
of a bequest motive provides a framework for addressing the extent to which
the predicted meltdown in asset prices is attenuated by taking account of the
fact that consumers do not consume all of their wealth during retirement.
The equilibrium of the model has the following properties: (1) the price of
capital rises when a large cohort of consumers‚Äìbaby boomers‚Äìis young and
working, which is consistent with Poterba‚Äôs Tables 5 and 13; (2) the price
of capital is anticipated to fall when baby boomers retire; (3) young baby
boomers optimally choose to hold capital even with the anticipation that
its price will fall; (4) consumers do not completely decumulate their assets
during retirement, consistent with Poterba‚Äôs Tables 1 and 2; and yet (5) the
dynamic behavior of the equilibrium price of capital is una¬§ected by the
strength of the bequest motive, so that assets held by old consumers for the
purpose of making bequests do not attenuate the predicted drop in the price
of capital when baby boomers retire.
    I develop and analyze the formal overlapping generations model in Section
2. Before presenting this formal model, in Section 1 I present Poterba‚Äôs
heuristic model and augment it to include the supply of capital as well as
the demand for capital. The discussion in Section 1 provides an intuitive
preview of the formal results in Section 2.




                                     2
1     A Heuristic Model
Poterba presents a simple stylized, or heuristic, model to illustrate the e¬§ects
of demographic variables on the price of capital. I will begin by presenting
this model, with slightly modi‚Ä¶ed notation.
    Consider a closed economy with overlapping generations of consumers
who live for two periods. All consumers who are born in the same period
are identical. Let Nt be the number of consumers born at the beginning of
period t. They inelastically supply one unit of labor when they are young,
and they do not work when they are old, so the amount of labor employed
in period t is Nt . Let
                                                Nt+1
                                      ¬¥t+1 ¬¥                                           (1)
                                                 Nt
be the birth rate in period t + 1, and assume that the birth rate is a serially
uncorrelated random variable.
    To make the analysis transparent, Poterba makes additional simplifying
assumptions. He assumes that the capital stock cannot be augmented by
investment and does not depreciate. Therefore, Kt , the aggregate capital
stock held at the beginning of period t, remains constant over time. He also
assumes that in each period, the wage income of each young consumer equals
one unit of output2 and that young consumers save a constant fraction s of
their wage income. Therefore, the aggregate saving of the cohort of young
consumers born at the beginning of period t is Nt s. All of this saving is
used to purchase Kt+1 , the aggregate capital stock to be carried into period
t + 1, at a price of qt per unit of capital in period t. Therefore,

                                     qt Kt+1 = Nt s;                                   (2)

which is equivalent to Poterba‚Äôs equation (1).
    Equation (2) can be interpreted as the demand for capital, Kt+1 , at the
end of period t as a function of the price of capital, qt , given Nt and s. If the
capital stock remains constant, as in Poterba‚Äôs stylized model, then the price
of capital can be determined directly from this demand curve. In particular,
the price of capital, qt , is proportional to Nt , the number of workers in the
  2
    The aggregate production function implicitly underlying this model is Yt = Nt +f (Kt ),
where Yt is aggregate output. With this speci‚Ä¶cation of the production function, the
marginal product of labor always equals one, regardless of the level of the capital stock.


                                            3
economy. Thus, an increase in Nt will increase the price of capital, qt , as the
large cohort of workers bids up the price of the ‚Ä¶xed capital stock. Poterba
goes on to claim that when the large cohort of workers retires and sells its
capital, it will drive down the price of capital. This claim is based on the
implicit assumption that a baby boom in period t, which generates a large
cohort of workers, Nt , will be followed by a decrease in the size of the working
population in the following generation. That is, Poterba assumes that Nt+1
is smaller than Nt . Equivalently, he assumes that if the birth rate in period
t, ¬¥ t , is large, then the birth rate in the following period, ¬¥t+1 , must not only
be small, it must be less than one.3 This assumption requires strong negative
serial correlation in the birth rate across successive generations.4 However,
if the economy has a ‚Ä°uctuating birth rate that always exceeds one, so that
the population of workers always grows over time, then in the stylized model
introduced by Poterba, and represented by equation (2), the price of capital
increases in every period.
     In the presence of a growing population, the price of capital in equation (2)
can be prevented from growing in every period by allowing the capital stock
to grow over time. To preview the rational expectations general equilibrium
model that I present in Section 2, suppose the aggregate supply curve of
capital slopes upward so that the (gross) growth rate of the capital stock,
Kt+1
  Kt
       , is an increasing function of the price of capital. In particular, suppose
that

                                      Kt+1 = ¬∑Kt qt¬∏ ;                                      (3)

where ¬∑ > 0 and ¬∏ > 0.5 Equation (3) represents the supply of capital,
Kt+1 , at the end of period t as a function of the price of capital, qt , for a
given value of Kt .
   To determine the equilibrium price of capital, I will solve the demand
and supply curves in equations (2) and (3) simultaneously. First divide
both sides of equation (3) by Nt+1 , and use the de‚Ä¶nition of the birth rate,
   3
     A birth rate equal to one in the model corresponds to one child per person, which is
equivalent to two children per woman.
   4
     In contrast, if the birth rate is i.i.d. across successive generations, an increase in Nt ,
which increases qt , is no more likely to be followed by a decrease in the number of workers
or in the price of capital in the following period than at any other time.
   5
     If ¬∏ were equal to zero, and if ¬∑ were equal to one, the capital stock would be constant
over time, as in Poterba‚Äôs model.

                                                1

                                               ¬¥ t+1

where kt+1 ¬¥ Kt =Nt is the capital-labor ratio in period t. To express the
capital-labor ratio kt as a function of qt , use equation (3) to substitute for
Kt+1 in equation (2), and use the de‚Ä¶nition of kt to obtain
                                          1 ¬°(1+¬∏)

                                          ¬∑ t
To obtain an expression for the dynamic behavior of the price of capital, qt ,
substitute equation (5) into equation (4) to obtain
                           1             1          1
                ln qt =       ln qt¬°1 ¬°     ln ¬∑ +     ln ¬¥ t :                 (6)
                          1+¬∏           1+¬∏        1+¬∏
    Since ¬∏ > 0, if the birth rate, ln ¬¥ t , is serially uncorrelated with uncondi-
tional mean E (ln ¬¥), then ln qt follows a stationary AR(1) process with un-
conditional mean ¬∏1 (E fln ¬¥g ¬° ln ¬∑). Thus, starting from the unconditional
mean price of capital, an increase in the birth rate ¬¥ t causes an increase in
the price of capital qt . Consistent with the asset market meltdown hypothe-
sis, the price of capital, ln qt+1 , is anticipated to fall toward its unconditional
mean in the following period.
    In the heuristic model presented here, as well as in the general equilibrium
models in Abel (2000) and Brooks (1999), consumers spend all of their re-
sources in the ‚Ä¶nal period of life, contrary to the empirical ‚Ä¶ndings reported
by Poterba in his Tables 1 and 2. Poterba argues that since consumers
continue to hold assets throughout old age, the aggregate demand for capital
does not fall when the baby boomers age, and hence, contrary to the asset
market meltdown hypothesis, the price of capital will not plunge when the
baby boomers are retired. I was intrigued by Poterba‚Äôs argument that the
meltdown would be attenuated by the fact that people hold substantial assets
until death, and I set out to examine the extent of this attenuation in the
context of a rational expectations general equilibrium model that I present
in Section 2. To address this issue, I assume that consumers have bequest
motives, and thus hold assets at the time of death. In the speci‚Ä¶cation I use
in Section 2, the equilibrium dynamics of the price of capital are completely
una¬§ected by the presence of a bequest motive and the consequent holding of

                  Figure 1: Supply and Demand for Capital

assets at the time of death. Therefore, a bequest motive does not attenuate
the predicted decline in stock prices when the baby boom retires.
    Before proceeding to the general equilibrium model, I will use the analysis
in the current section to illustrate the invariance of the price of capital to the
strength of the bequest motive. Figure 1 illustrates the demand and supply
curves for capital, Kt+1 , in period t as a function of the price of capital,
qt . The solid downward-sloping curve, K1D , is the demand for capital in
equation (2) in the absence of a bequest motive. The solid upward-sloping
curve, K1S , is the supply of capital in equation (3) in the absence of a bequest
motive. Thus, in the absence of a bequest motive, equilibrium in the market
for capital in period t is represented by point E.
    Now consider an otherwise-identical economy with a bequest motive. The
amount of saving, and hence the demand for capital, in period t will be
higher in the economy with a bequest motive than in the economy without a


                                         6
bequest motive. Thus, the demand for capital in an economy with a bequest
motive is represented by K2D , which is to the right of K1D .6 If the supply
curve of capital were invariant to the strength of the bequest motive (which
is implicitly assumed by Poterba), the equilibrium in the economy with a
bequest motive would be represented by point G, where the price of capital
is higher than in the absence of a bequest motive. However, an economy
with a bequest motive will have a higher capital stock in each period than
an otherwise-identical economy without a bequest motive. Therefore, in
period t, the capital stock, Kt , is higher in the presence of a bequest motive
than in its absence, and hence the supply curve of capital in the economy
with a bequest motive, K2S , is to the right of the supply curve in the absence
of a bequest motive, K1S . The equilibrium in the economy with a bequest
motive is represented by point F , where K2D and K2S intersect, with a higher
capital stock, but the same price of capital, as at point E. In the parametric
rational expectations general equilibrium model in Section 2, I show that the
equilibrium price of capital, qt , is invariant to the strength of the bequest
motive, which means that rightward shifts of the supply and demand curves
in Figure 1 are of the same size. Since the equilibrium price of capital is not
a¬§ected by strength of the bequest motive, the asset market meltdown is not
attenuated by the introduction of a bequest motive.


2     A General Equilibrium Model with a Baby
      Boom and an Endogenous Price of Capital
In this section, I present a rational expectations general equilibrium model in
which the wage income of workers is determined endogenously, and the asset
demands of young and old consumers maximize expected lifetime utility.
This model is a simpli‚Ä¶ed version of the model in Abel (2000), except that it
includes a bequest motive so that consumers will not completely decumulate
their assets in old age.
    As in Section 1, consider a closed economy with overlapping generations of
consumers who live for two periods. At the beginning of period t, Nt identical
consumers are born, and they each inelastically supply one unit of labor in
period t and earn wage income wt , which I will derive after introducing the
   6
     The economy with a bequest motive can be viewed as having a higher value of saving
per worker, s, than does the economy without a bequest motive.


                                          7
production technologies below. These consumers do not work in period t + 1
when they are old.

2.1       Production Technologies
There are two production technologies. One technology, which I will call the
consumption goods technology, produces output that can be either consumed
or used as an input to the other technology, which is the capital adjustment
technology.
    The consumption goods technology uses capital and labor to produce
output. Let Kt be the aggregate capital stock at the beginning of period
t, let Yt be the aggregate output of the consumption goods technology in
period t, and assume that

                   Yt = AKt¬Æ Nt1¬°¬Æ ,        where 0 < ¬Æ < 1 and A > 0.                               (7)

    The capital adjustment technology uses output from the consumption
goods technology together with capital to produce capital for use in the
following period. Suppose that the capital adjustment technology is

                                        Kt+1 = aIt√Å Kt1¬°√Å ,                                          (8)

where a > 0, 0 < √Å < 1, and investment, It , is the aggregate quantity of out-
put from the consumption goods technology used in the capital adjustment
technology. Because the curvature parameter √Å is strictly between zero and
one, the capital stock in period t + 1 is an increasing and concave function
of investment, It . The concavity of this function captures convex costs of
adjustment.
    The price of capital at the end of period t, qt , is the amount of consump-
tion goods in period t that must be used¬≥ to produce
                                                   ¬¥        an additional unit of

      Equations (8) and (9) imply that     Kt    = a 1¬°√Å (√Åqt ) 1¬°√Å , which implies that in equation

The value, in terms of consumption goods in period t, of the capital stock
carried into period t + 1 equals the product of qt from equation (9) and Kt+1
from equation (8), which is
                                              1
                                  qt Kt+1 =     It.                           (10)

    Factor markets are perfectly competitive so that each factor of production
earns its marginal product. Thus, using equation (7) the wage rate in period
t, wt , is
                                                Yt

   Because capital is used in both the consumption goods technology and
the capital adjustment technology, capital earns rentals in both technologies.
The rental earned by a unit of capital in the consumption goods technology
in period t is ¬Æ KYtt . The rental earned by a unit of capital in the capital
adjustment technology in period t is the marginal product of capital in that
technology, @K t+1
             @Kt
                   , multiplied by the current price of next period‚Äôs capital, qt .
This rental can be calculated using equations (8) and (9) to obtain 1¬°√Å    √Å Kt
                                                                               It

Therefore, the total rental to capital is
                                      Yt   1 ¬° √Å It
                             ¬∫t = ¬Æ      +          :                         (12)

The (gross) rate of return on capital held from period t ¬° 1 to period t, Rt ,
equals the rental on capital, ¬∫ t , divided by the price paid for the capital in
period t ¬° 1, qt¬°1 . Therefore,

2.2    Consumer Behavior

young, ct , consumption when old, xt+1 , and a bequest, bt+2 , to be divided
equally among the consumer‚Äôs ¬¥ t+1 children at the beginning of period t + 2
when the consumer‚Äôs children are beginning the second period of life. Each
consumer born at the beginning of period t receives a bequest bt+1 ¬¥

of a consumer born at the beginning of period t is

A consumer born at the beginning of period t has the utility function

where 0 < ¬Ø ¬∑ 1, ¬∞ ¬∏ 0, and Et fg denotes the expectation conditional
on information available in period t. The consumer chooses ct , xt+1 , and
bt+2 to maximize the utility function in equation (16) subject to the budget
constraint in equation (15). It can be shown that the optimal value of
consumption when young is8

They acquired some of this capital by saving when they were young, and

    The investment-output ratio √É depends on the strength of the bequest
motive ¬∞. In the special case in which ¬∞ = 0, the investment-output ratio
          ¬Ø
is √É = √Å 1+¬Ø (1 ¬° ¬Æ) as in the laissez-faire special case in Abel (2000, Section
5). To determine the e¬§ect of ¬∞ on √É, di¬§erentiate the expression for √É in
equation (29) with respect to ¬∞ to obtain
                         @√É                √Å
                            = (1 ¬° √É)            > 0:                         (30)
                         @¬∞           1 + ¬Ø + ¬∞√Å
   Equation (30) implies that comparing two economies with identical tech-
nologies, and preferences that are identical except for the value of ¬∞, the econ-
omy with a stronger bequest motive (higher ¬∞) will have a higher investment-
output ratio, √É.

2.4     The Dynamic Behavior of Aggregates
The investment-capital ratio, KItt , is an important factor a¬§ecting the growth
rate of the capital stock as well as the price of capital. Use equation (7) to
substitute for Yt in equation (28) and divide both sides by Kt to obtain
                                  It
                                     = √ÉAkt¬Æ¬°1 :                              (31)
                                  Kt
where kt ¬¥ K t
            Nt
               . Now divide both sides of the capital adjustment technology
in equation (8) by Nt , and use the expression for the investment-capital ratio
in equation (31) to obtain
                                                 1¬°(1¬°¬Æ)√Å
                           kt+1 ¬¥ t+1 = a√É √Å A√Å kt          :                 (32)

Take logarithms of both sides of equation (32) to obtain an AR(1) process
for ln kt+1

      ln kt+1 = [1 ¬° (1 ¬° ¬Æ) √Å] ln kt + ln a + √Å ln √É + √Å ln A ¬° ln ¬¥ t+1 .   (33)

    Since 0 < ¬Æ < 1 and 0 < √Å < 1, ln kt+1 follows a stationary AR(1) process
if the birth rate, ln ¬¥ t+1 , is serially uncorrelated. To analyze the impact of

                                         13
a bequest motive on the accumulation of capital, recall from equation (30)
that the investment-output ratio, √É, is an increasing function of the bequest
motive parameter ¬∞. Equation (33) implies that an increase in ¬∞, which
increases √É, will increase the average value of the capital-labor ratio but will
not a¬§ect the variance or serial correlation of ln kt+1 . More precisely, an
increase in ¬∞ increases the mean of the stationary distribution of ln kt+1 but
has no e¬§ect on any autocovariances of ln kt+1 .
    The equilibrium value of the (logarithm of the) price of capital is deter-
mined by substituting equation (31) into equation (9) and taking logarithms
of both sides of the equation to obtain

    ln qt = ¬° ln √Åa + (1 ¬° √Å) ln √É + (1 ¬° √Å) ln A ¬° (1 ¬° ¬Æ) (1 ¬° √Å) ln kt :    (34)

Use equation (34) lagged one period to obtain an expression for ln qt¬°1 . Then
subtract [1 ¬° (1 ¬° ¬Æ) √Å] ln qt¬°1 from ln qt , and use equation (33) to obtain

ln qt = [1 ¬° (1 ¬° ¬Æ) √Å] ln qt¬°1 ¬° (1 ¬° ¬Æ) (√Å ln √Å + ln a) + (1 ¬° ¬Æ) (1 ¬° √Å) ln ¬¥ t :
                                                                              (35)

    If the birth rate, ¬¥ t , is serially uncorrelated, then the (logarithm of the)
equilibrium price of capital, ln qt , follows a stationary AR(1) process, with
the same serial correlation as ln kt+1 , and this AR(1) process is independent
of the strength of the bequest motive ¬∞. Suppose that in period t ¬° 1 the
price of capital equals its unconditional mean, and that the realization of
the birth rate, ¬¥ t , is unusually large. According to equation (35), this baby
boom in period t causes the price of capital, qt , to increase. If the birth rate
is serially uncorrelated, the price of capital is rationally anticipated to fall
back toward its unconditional mean in period t + 1. The magnitude of the
anticipated drop in the price of capital‚Äîor asset market meltdown‚Äîwhen
the baby boomers retire in period t + 1 is independent of the strength of the
bequest motive. Therefore, the introduction of a bequest motive does not
attenuate the asset market meltdown.


3     Concluding Remarks
Poterba‚Äôs examination of age-speci‚Ä¶c asset holdings in the Survey of Con-
sumer Finances leads him to conclude that consumers accumulate assets


                                        14
while they are of working age, but they hold on to these assets during retire-
ment much more than would be predicted by a simple life-cycle model with-
out lifetime uncertainty and without a bequest motive. He uses age-speci‚Ä¶c
asset holdings, together with age-speci‚Ä¶c population data and projections,
to calculate a time series of projected asset demand. He ‚Ä¶nds evidence that
the price-dividend ratio of stocks in the United States has been positively
related to his projected asset demand variable in various historical sample
periods. Looking into the future, Poterba‚Äôs projected asset demand variable
increases over the next twenty years, and then remains fairly constant. Be-
cause the projected asset demand does not decline when the baby boomers
retire, Poterba rejects the asset market meltdown hypothesis, which predicts
a decline in stock prices when the baby boomers retire.
    I have taken at face value Poterba‚Äôs ‚Ä¶nding about age-speci‚Ä¶c asset hold-
ings, and his ‚Ä¶nding of a positive e¬§ect of his projected asset demands on
stock prices in historical data. I have also taken at face value his ‚Ä¶nding that
projected asset demand will not fall when the baby boomers retire. How-
ever, I have shown that Poterba‚Äôs conclusion that asset prices will not fall
when the baby boomers are retired is not a necessary logical consequence
of continued high levels of projected asset demand. The ‚Ä°aw in Poterba‚Äôs
conclusion is that he tries to forecast the price of capital by focusing only on
the demand for capital, without taking account of the supply of capital. I
have developed a rational expectations general equilibrium model with a be-
quest motive, and this model is consistent with Poterba‚Äôs observations that
retired consumers continue to hold a substantial amount of assets at the time
of death and that a baby boom can drive up the price of capital. However,
contrary to Poterba‚Äôs conclusion, there is an anticipated decline in the price
of capital when baby boomers retire, and this decline is not attenuated at all
by the introduction of a bequest motive.
    My ‚Ä¶nding that the equilibrium price of capital is invariant to the be-
quest motive is a consequence of the particular parametric speci‚Ä¶cation of
preferences and technology that I use. I regard this invariance result as a
rhetorical device to make the point that one cannot predict the price of cap-
ital by focussing on the demand for capital while ignoring its supply. The
e¬§ect of asset demands by retirees on asset prices in a more general context
remains an open question worthy of further study. In considering the role
of asset demands by retirees in a more general framework, di¬§erent motives
for these asset demands might be analyzed. Instead of using the bequest
motive speci‚Ä¶ed in this paper, positive asset demands by retirees can be gen-

                                      15
erated by a bequest motive based on altruism. Alternatively, precautionary
saving to guard against longevity risk in the absence of perfect annuity mar-
kets would be a way to generate a demand for assets by retired consumers.
Another direction for exploration is to examine alternative forms of the ag-
gregate supply curve of capital, especially because this paper has illustrated
the potentially important role of the supply of capital in determining the
equilibrium price of capital.
