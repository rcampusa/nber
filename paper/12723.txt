                                            ABSTRACT

In this paper, we conduct a dynamic panel analysis of the determinants of the household saving rate
in China using a life cycle model and panel data on Chinese provinces for the 1995-2004 period from
China?s household survey. We find that China?s household saving rate has been high and rising and
that the main determinants of variations over time and over space therein are the lagged saving rate,
the income growth rate, (in many cases) the real interest rate, and (in some cases) the inflation rate.
 However, we find that the variables relating to the age structure of the population have the expected
impact on the household saving rate in only one of the four samples. These results provide mixed
support for the life cycle hypothesis as well as the permanent income hypothesis, are consistent with
the existence of inertia or persistence, and imply that China?s household saving rate will remain high
for some time to come.

1. Introduction

         China has attracted increasing attention because it is the world’s most populous

nation and because it has maintained phenomenal rates of economic growth in recent

years.   For example, the Asian Development Bank now projects that China will attain a

growth rate in excess of 9% in 2006 for the fifth consecutive year, thereby serving as the

engine of growth in the Asian-Pacific region (Nihon Keizai Shimbun, evening edition of

April 6, 2006, page 1).

         Moreover, another reason for being interested in China is that China introduced

a so-called “one-child policy” in 1979 as a way of controlling population growth.    This

is an interesting natural experiment that makes fertility largely exogenous and enables

us to assess the impact of the age structure of the population on the household saving

rate without worrying about endogeneity issues.       Moreover, because the one-child

policy was applied more leniently to ethnic minorities, the policy also led to substantial

variations among provinces in the age structures of their populations, and this will

enable us to more sharply estimate the impact of the age structure of the population on

the household saving rate.

         Yet another noteworthy aspect of China’s economy is its high saving rate.

China has had by far the highest overall saving rate in the world since at least 2000, and

her saving rate has increased even further since 2000—to nearly 50% of GDP.         Gross

capital formation (investment) is also high in China, but because saving exceeds

investment, China has been running a net saving surplus, which translates into a current

account surplus, and that surplus has been growing sharply--from 1.9% of GDP in 2000

to 3.6% in 2004 and a remarkable 7.2% in 2005--even though China is investing at a

staggering rate of 43-46% of GDP and even though China is still relatively poor. This



                                            2
has made China one of the world’s largest capital exporters and has exacerbated trade

frictions with the United States and other countries.      Moreover, China’s net saving

surplus shows no signs of abating (The Economist, September 24-30, 2005, edition,

page 13 of “A Survey of the World Economy”).１          Thus, it is important to understand

the determinants of, and future trends in, China’s saving rate, and the obvious

candidates are the rapid rates of economic growth alluded to earlier and the age

structure of the population, which has shown tremendous variation over time as well as

over space.

         In this paper, we conduct a dynamic panel analysis of the determinants of the

household saving rate in China using a life cycle model and panel data on Chinese

provinces for the 1995-2004 period from China’s household survey.

         At least two previous studies have conducted similar analyses.      Kraay (2000)

uses panel data on Chinese provinces from China’s household survey to analyze the

determinants of the saving rates of rural and urban households during the 1978-83 and

1984-89 periods and finds that, in the case of rural households, future income growth

has a negative and significant impact on their saving rates, that the share of food in total

consumption has a negative and significant impact on their saving rates, presumably

because households closer to the subsistence level have less ability to save, and that

neither the dependency ratio (proxied by the ratio of population to employment) nor

future income uncertainty has a significant impact on their saving rates. However,

Kraay (2000) finds that virtually none of the explanatory variables has a significant

impact on the saving rates of urban households. Modigliani and Cao (2004) conduct a

regression analysis of the determinants of the household saving rate using times series

data for the 1953-2000 period and find that the long-term growth rate, the reciprocal of



                                             3
the dependency ratio (proxied by the ratio of the employed population to the number of

minors), the deviation of growth from the long-term growth rate, and inflation all have

positive and significant impacts on the household saving rate.    Thus, the two studies

obtain somewhat conflicting results.    Kraay (2000) finds that the dependency ratio

does not have a significant impact on the household saving rate, whereas Modigliani

and Cao (2004) find that it does. Moreover, Kraay (2000) finds that future income

growth has a negative and significant impact on the household saving rate, whereas

Modigliani and Cao (2004) find that the long-term growth rate and the deviation of

growth from the long-term growth rate have a positive and significant impact on the

household saving rate.

        The current study improves upon these earlier studies in a number of respects:

(1) the data are much newer, (2) the dependent variable (the household saving rate) is

defined more carefully and includes household investments in real assets, (3) the

dependency ratio is defined more carefully and the young dependency ratio and the old

dependency ratio are entered separately, (4) we include variables not included by

previous authors such as the lagged saving rate and the interest rate, (5) we obtain

results for the sample of urban households, the sample of rural households, the sample

of all households, and a pooled sample of urban and rural households (unlike Kraay

(2000), who obtains results only for urban and rural households, and Modigliani and

Cao (2004), who obtain results only for all households), and (6) we use superior

estimation techniques.

        This paper is organized as follows: In section 2, we present data on household

saving rates and related variables; in section 3, we present our theoretical model; in

section 4, we discuss the estimation model and data sources; in section 5, we discuss the



                                           4
estimation method; in section 6, we present the estimation results; and section 7 is a

concluding section.

         To preview our main findings, we find that China’s household saving rate has

been high and rising and that the main determinants of variations over time and over

space therein are the lagged saving rate, the income growth rate, (in many cases) the

real interest rate, and (in some cases) the inflation rate. However, we find that the

variables relating to the age structure of the population have the expected impact on the

household saving rate in only one of the four samples.      These results provide mixed

support for the life cycle hypothesis as well as the permanent income hypothesis, are

consistent with the existence of inertia or persistence, and imply that China’s household

saving rate will remain high for some time to come.



2. Data on Saving Rates and Other Related Variables

         In this section, we present data on household saving rates and other related

variables.

         First, Figure 1 shows data on trends over time in the age structure of the

population during the 1949-2004 period, and as can be seen from this figure, there have

been pronounced trends over time in both the young dependency ratio (the ratio of the

population aged 0-14 to the population aged 15-59) and the old dependency ratio (the

ratio of the population aged 60 or older to the population aged 15-59).       The former

increased from 0.57 in 1950 to 0.77 in 1964 before starting to decline, falling to 0.28 by

2004 (due in large part to the “one-child policy” and other population control measures),

while the latter increased more or less steadily from 0.13 in 1950 to 0.18 in 2004.

Finally, the total dependency ratio (the ratio of the population aged 0-14 or 60 or older



                                            5
to the population aged 15-59) showed more or less the same trends over time as the

young dependency ratio, increasing from 0.70 in 1950 to 0.89 in 1964 before starting to

decline, falling to 0.46 by 2004 (also due in large part to the “one-child policy” and

other population control measures).     The life cycle hypothesis predicts that the age

structure of the population will have a significant impact on the saving rate and in

particular that the dependency ratios will have a negative impact on the saving rate, and

if we compare trends over time in the national saving rate with trends over time in the

dependency ratios, the upward trend in the saving rate that has been observed since the

1960s coincides with a downward trend in the young and total dependency ratios during

the same period, suggesting that the latter may be a cause of the former.

        Looking next at the age structure of China’s population in international

comparison, China’s young dependency ratio was higher than the worldwide level in

1975 (0.74 vs. 0.67) but fell at an unprecedented rate due to the one-child policy and

other population control measures.    As a result, it was far less than the worldwide level

by 2005 (0.32 vs. 0.46).２

        By contrast, the old dependency ratio was somewhat lower than the worldwide

level in 1975 (0.13 vs. 0.16) but has gradually increased due to the steady increases in

life expectancy and was just under the worldwide level by 2005 (0.16 vs. 0.17).

        However, because trends over time in the young dependency ratio have been

more pronounced than trends over time in the old dependency ratio, trends in the total

dependency ratio mirror trends in the youth dependency ratio: it was just over the

worldwide level in 1975 (0.87 vs. 0.83) but declined sharply thereafter, falling to far

less than the worldwide level by 2005 (0.48 vs. 0.63).

        The fact that the young and total dependency ratios were formerly relatively



                                            6
high by international standards can explain why China’s saving rate was formerly

relatively low by international standards, and the fact that the young and total

dependency ratios are now relatively low by international standards can explain why

China’s saving rate is now relatively high by international standards.

           Figure 2 shows data on trends over time in the saving rates of urban, rural, and

all households for the 1995-2004 period from China’s household survey, and as can be

seen from this figure, the saving rates of the three categories of households are roughly

comparable not only with respect to their levels but also with respect to trends over time

therein.    Looking first at the level of the saving rate, the saving rates of urban, rural,

and all households fluctuated in the 17.33% to 22.98%, 15.78% to 29.77%, and 16.29%

to 25.17% ranges, respectively, and averaged 20.3%, 24.7%, and 22.4%, respectively,

during the 1995-2004 period.       The fact that the saving rate of rural households is

considerably higher than that of urban households even though their income levels are

so much lower is surprising, but it could be due to the greater income volatility of rural

households, the vast majority of whom are farmers, as a result of which they save more

for precautionary purposes, or to the fact that differences in income levels largely reflect

differences in price levels, as a result of which the purchasing power of the incomes of

urban and rural households is not nearly as different as their nominal incomes.

           Turning to trends over time in the saving rates of urban, rural, and all

households, the saving rate of urban households showed an upward trend throughout the

1995-2004 period, while the saving rates of rural and all households showed upward

trends until 1999 before leveling off slightly. The upward trends in the saving rates of

all three categories of households coincide with the downward trends in the young and

total dependency ratios, and thus it is possible that the latter are one of the causes of the



                                              7
former.    Thus, the evidence presented thus far suggests that the age structure of

China’s population can explain not only the high level of China’s household saving rate

but also the upward trend therein.

          Table 1 shows data on the average saving rates of urban, rural, and all

households during the 1995-2004 period by province, and as can be seen from this table,

there has been enormous variation among provinces in their saving rates, with the

saving rate of urban households ranging from 10.7% to 25.7%, that of rural households

ranging from 10.0% to 43.7%, and that of all households ranging from 13.5% to 35.1%.

          Finally, Table 2 shows data on the age structure of urban, rural, and all

households by province during the 1995-2004 period, and as can be seen from this table,

there has been enormous variation among provinces in the age structure of their

populations as well.   For example, the young dependency ratio ranged from 0.17 to

0.39 for urban households, from 0.18 to 0.52 for rural households, and from 0.18 to 0.48

for all households, the old dependency ratio ranged from 0.07 to 0.18 for urban

households, from 0.07 to 0.16 for rural households, and from 0.07 to 0.18 for all

households, and the total dependency ratio ranged from 0.29 to 0.48 for urban

households, from 0.34 to 0.66 for rural households, and from 0.31 to 0.56 for all

households.    We will conduct a regression analysis in sections 5 through 7 to see if

variations in the household saving rate correlate with variations in the age structure of

the population.



3. Theoretical Model

          From the above sections, we know that the Chinese economy can be

characterized as showing a high saving rate, rapid economic growth, and a dramatic



                                           8
change in the age structure of her population.                In this section, we present a

theoretical model that provides the justification for our estimation model.                   In

particular, we present a two-period overlapping generations model based on the life

cycle hypothesis and use this model to show the impact of income growth and the

age structure of the population on the saving rate.

          Suppose that there is an endowment economy.                 The time horizon is from 0

to T.     The economy starts from time 0.               At time 0, n0 (=1) persons with an

endowment or human capital of y 0 (=1) enter the economy, and at time 1, they

become old and die.     This person earns no wages at time 1 but she has to consume

at both time 0 and time 1, so she has to save at time 0 to finance her consumption at

time 1.     The person has no bequest motive.              The variables n and y denote

population    growth    and    income       growth,       respectively,     and   are   positive.

Consequently, at period t, nt persons newly enter the economy with endowment

nt y t and live together with nt −1 old persons.          It is also assumed that the nt new

persons cannot lend to or borrow from the nt −1 old persons.                        All persons

homogenously have a log linear utility function with a subtractive stock of habits

and/or durability.    For simplicity, the rate of time preference and the interest rate

are assumed to be zero, but we have confirmed that the qualitative findings remain

unchanged even when a positive rate of time preference and a positive interest rate

are assumed.         Thus, the new generation solves the following individual

maximization problem at time t:
                              max      log(ct ) + log(ct +1 − γct )

                              s.t.   ct + ct +1 = y t

where ct , ct +1 denotes consumption at time t and time t+1, respectively.                γ is a



                                                9
parameter that represents the degree of durability or habit formation, with a negative

value of gamma indicating the existence of durability, a positive value indicating the

existence of habit formation, and a zero value indicating the absence of both

durability and habit formation.                We also assume that γ>-0.5 in order to insure that

ct > 0 , ct +1 > 0 .      Given these assumptions, we obtain the following solutions for

consumption at time t and time t+1:
           yt
  ct =          ,
         2 + 2γ
                                                                                              (1)
             (1 + 2γ ) y t
   ct +1 =                 .                                                                  (2)
               2 + 2γ
         Next, we derive the aggregate saving rate in this economy at time t (t>0) as

follows:
                                      ⎛       yt            (1 + 2γ ) y t −1 ⎞
                           n t y t − ⎜⎜ n t        + n t −1                  ⎟
                                      ⎝     2 + 2γ             2 + 2γ ⎟⎠
                      SR =                                                     ,
                                                 nt yt                                        (3)
                               1 + 2γ   ⎛     1 ⎞
                           =            ⎜⎜1 −     ⎟.
                               2 + 2γ    ⎝    ny ⎟⎠

             The impacts of y, n and γ on the aggregate saving rate are as follows:
  ∂SR       1 + 2γ
      =                 > 0,                                                                  (4)
   ∂y   ( 2 + 2γ ) ny 2
    ∂SR       1 + 2γ
        =                  > 0,                                                               (5)
     ∂n   ( 2 + 2γ ) n 2 y
  ∂SR      ny − 1
      =                ,
   ∂γ   2(1 + γ ) 2 ny

         > 0 for ny > 1,
                                                                                              6)
         =      for ny = 1,

         < 0 for ny < 1.

             These results imply that income growth and an increase in the working-age


                                                         10
population will raise the saving rate and that the strengthening of habits or the

weakening of durability will raise the saving rate in a booming economy but lower it

in a declining economy.     These implications from the theoretical model suggest that

China’s high and rising household saving rate may be due to rapid income growth,

the decline in the dependency ratio, and/or the uniqueness of utility parameters.

        Compared with the previous literature, the impact of γ on individual saving

(individual saving = ct +1 , ∂c t +1 / ∂γ = ( 2 + 2γ ) −2 > 0 ) is the same as that of, for

example, Lahiri and Puhakka (1998).          However, the impact of γ on aggregate

saving as expressed in equation (6) cannot be found in previous studies.



4. Estimation Model and Data Sources.

        In this section, we discuss the estimation model and data sources we use in our

empirical analysis.

        The dependent variable we use in our analysis is SR = the household saving

rate, defined as the ratio of household saving to household disposable income (net

household income in the case of rural households) and where household saving is

calculated as household disposable (or net) income minus household consumption.

        Following Loayza, et al. (2000) and Schrooten and Stephan (2005), we

estimate a reduced-form linear equation rather than adhering to a particular, narrow

structural model, but the theoretical literature offers guidance regarding what variables

should be included as explanatory variables. Since the life cycle hypothesis predicts

that the household saving rate will be a function of the growth rate of per capita income

and the age structure of the population (see section 3 above and also Modigliani (1970)

and Deaton (1992), Chapter 2), we include the following explanatory variables:


                                            11
        (1) CHY = the income growth rate, defined as the real rate of growth of per

capita household disposable income (net household income in the case of rural

households)

        (2) YOUNG = the young dependency rate, defined as the ratio of the

population aged 0-14 to the population aged 15-64３

        (3) OLD = the old dependency rate, defined as the ratio of the population aged

65 or older to the population aged 15-64

        (4) DEP = the total dependency rate, defined as the ratio of the population aged

0-14 or 65 or older to the population aged 15-64



        In addition, we include the following explanatory variables:

        (5) SR(-1) = the one-year lag of the saving rate

        (6) RINT = the real interest rate, defined as NINT – INFL, where NINT = the

nominal interest rate on one-year bank deposits and INFL = the rate of change of the

consumer price index

        (7) INFL = the rate of change of the consumer price index

        (8) RURAL = a dummy variable that equals 1 in the case of rural households

and zero otherwise (included only when the pooled sample of urban and rural

households is used)

        (9) A constant term



        The lagged saving rate is included to test for the presence of inertia or

persistence.   The real interest rate is included to test for the impact of financial

variables, and we would expect its coefficient to be positive if the substitution effect



                                           12
more than offsets the income effect. The inflation rate is included as a proxy for price

uncertainty and/or macroeconomic stability more generally (as done by Loayza, et al.

(2000) and Schrooten and Stephan (2005)), a rural dummy is included to see if there are

any systematic differences between urban and rural households in trends over time in

the household saving rate, and a constant term, which corresponds to the coefficient of

the time trend in the regressions in differences (see section 6 below), is included in

some variants

        Finally, the real growth rate of per capita gross provincial product is used as an

instrument in the level equation, as discussed below.

        The data we use in our analysis are panel data for 1995-2004 on Chinese

provinces. All variables are available for urban, rural, and all households with the

exception of the nominal interest rate, which is available only for the country as a whole,

and the real growth rate of per capita gross provincial product, which is available only

for each province as a whole. Thus, we are able to obtain separate results for urban,

rural, and all households and for a pooled sample of urban and rural households.

        All data from China’s household survey and national accounts data are taken

from the China Statistics Yearbook, all demographic data are taken from the China

Population Statistics Yearbook, and data on nominal interest rates are taken from the

International Monetary Fund’s International Financial Statistics.

        Data were available for all 31 provinces for the ten-year period from 1995 to

2004 with the following exceptions: data were not available for Chongqing Province

during the 1995-96 period because this province did not become independent of

Sichuan Province until 1997, and data on the CPI and/or on household income and

consumption were not available for Tibet Province during the 1995-98 period. These



                                           13
missing values caused the number of observations to decline from 310 to 304.

Moreover, one year’s worth of data were lost because the income growth rate was used

as an explanatory variable. This reduced the number of observations further from 304

to 273 and means that the sample period for most provinces was nine years (1996-2004).

Finally, because the lagged real growth rate of per capita gross provincial product was

used as an instrument, yet another observation for Chongqing Province (that for 1998)

had to be dropped, causing the final number of observations to be 272.

           Descriptive statistics on the variables used in our analysis for the final sample

of 272 observations are shown in Table 3.



5. Estimation Method

           In this section, we briefly describe our estimation method. Following Loayza,

et   al.      (2000)    and     Schrooten     and    Stephan     (2005),    we     use    a

generalized-method-of-moments (GMM) estimator applied to dynamic models using

panel data. We use this estimator for at least three reasons: (1) Inertia is likely to be

present in annual data, and it seemed desirable to use a dynamic specification to allow

for it. (2) Some of the explanatory variables (such as RINT and CHY) are likely to be

jointly determined with the saving rate, and it seemed desirable to control for the

potential joint endogeneity of the explanatory variables. (3) There is the possibility of

unobserved province-specific effects correlated with the regressors, and it seemed

desirable to control for such effects.

           Following Loayza, et al. (2000) and Schrooten and Stephan (2005), we use the

alternative “system GMM estimator” proposed by Arellano and Bover (1995) and

Blundell and Bond (1998), which reduces the potential biases and imprecision



                                             14
associated with the usual difference estimator by combining, in a system, the regression

in differences with the regression in levels.

         As Windmeijer (2005) notes, the estimated asymptotic standard errors of the

efficient two-step GMM estimator will be severely downward biased in small samples,

and thus we correct the standard errors for this bias using the method proposed by

Windmeijer (2005).４

         Following Loayza, et al. (2000) and Schrooten and Stephan (2005), the

demographic variables (YOUNG, OLD, and DEP) are the only explanatory variables

that we treated as being strictly exogenous and included as instruments in the level

equation as well as the first-difference equation. All other explanatory variables were

regarded as being weakly exogenous, and lagged values thereof were included as

“internal instruments,” with Bond’s (2002) method being used to select instruments.５

Finally, the one-period lag of the real growth rate of per capita gross provincial product

was used as an instrument only in the level equation. All of the instruments we use

passed all of the commonly used tests: the Hansen test, the AR(1) test, and the AR(2)

test. Tables 4-6 show the results of these tests and also show which instruments were

used in each equation.



6. Estimation Results

         In this section, we present our estimation results concerning the determinants

of the household saving rate.        The estimation results for urban, rural, and all

households and for a pooled sample of urban and rural households are shown in Tables

4, 5, 6, and 7, respectively.

         Looking first at the coefficient of SR(-1) (the lagged saving rate), this



                                                15
coefficient is always positive and highly significant, indicating strong inertia or

persistence. This coefficient ranges from 0.476 to 0.628, implying a long-run effect

that is 1.91 to 2.69 times the short-run effect, in the sample of urban households; from

0.476 to 0.844, implying a long-run effect that is 1.91 to 6.41 times the short-run effect,

in the sample of rural households; from 0.622 to 0.721, implying a long-run effect that

is 2.65 to 3.58 times the short-run effect, in the sample of all households; and from

0.604 to 0.710, implying a long-run effect that is 2.54 to 3.45 times the short-run effect,

in the pooled sample of urban and rural households.

         Looking next at the coefficient of CHY (the income growth rate), it is always

positive and highly significant (which is consistent with the life cycle hypothesis),

ranging from 0.192 to 0.270 in the sample of urban households, from 0.331 to 0.536 in

the sample of rural households, from 0.201 to 0.240 in the sample of all households, and

from 0.337 to 0.396 in the pooled sample of urban and rural households. These figures

imply that a one percentage point increase in the income growth rate causes a 0.192 to

0.536 percentage point increase in the household saving rate. Moreover, the long-run

impact of the income growth rate is 1.91 to 6.41 times these figures.

         Looking next at the coefficient of RINT (the real interest rate), it is

insignificant and usually positive in the sample of urban households, positive and

significant in two out of four cases in the sample of rural households, and positive and

significant in all cases in the sample of all households and the pooled sample of urban

and rural households. Thus, the real interest rate has a significant positive impact on

the household saving rate for every sample except for the sample of urban households,

which suggests that the interest elasticity of saving is positive and is consistent with the

permanent income hypothesis.



                                            16
         Looking next at the impact of the demographic variables (YOUNG, OLD, and

DEP), their coefficients are never significant in the sample of urban households and the

sample of rural households, the coefficients of YOUNG and DEP are positive and

sometimes significant but the coefficient of OLD is insignificant in the sample of all

households, and the coefficients of YOUNG and DEP are negative and at least

marginally significant but the coefficient of OLD is insignificant in the pooled sample

of urban and rural households. Thus, the only case in which the coefficients of the

demographic variables are significant with the expected sign is in the case of the

coefficients of YOUNG and DEP in the pooled sample of urban and rural households,６

and the coefficients of YOUNG and DEP are sometimes significant with the wrong sign

in the sample of all households.       The reasons for the mixed performance of the

demographic variables is a topic for future research.７

         Looking next at the coefficient of INFL (the inflation rate), it is insignificant in

the sample of urban households, the sample of all households, and the pooled sample of

urban and rural households, but it is negative and significant in three out of four cases in

the sample of rural households. These results suggest that the impact of inflation is not

always significant but that it is sometimes negative and significant.

         Looking next at the coefficient of the RURAL dummy in the pooled sample of

urban and rural households, it is positive and significant in all four cases, which

suggests that the saving rate of rural households have a more pronounced upward trend

than that of urban households after controlling for other factors.

         Looking finally at the constant term, which represents the coefficient of a time

trend, it is positive in all cases and is significant in five out of eight cases, which

suggests that there is an upward trend in China’s household saving rate.



                                             17
         We also tried adding year dummies and the level of per capita household

disposable income as additional explanatory variables, but we dropped them from the

final specification because their coefficients were not statistically significant.

         Lastly, we compare our results to those of previous studies. Our finding that

income growth has a positive and significant impact on the household saving rate is at

variance with Kraay’s (2000) finding that (future) income growth has a negative and

significant impact on the saving rate of rural households and does not have a significant

impact on the saving rate of urban households but is consistent with Modigliani and

Cao’s (2004) finding that (long run) income growth has a positive and significant

impact on the household saving rate. In order to shed light on why our results differ

from those of Kraay (2000), we tried estimating all of our equations using two-stage

least squares, the same estimation method used by Kraay (2000), and found that the

results are substantially different.     For example, the coefficients of the variables

relating to the age structure of the population, which had previously been insignificant,

are now significant, whereas the coefficient of income growth, which had previously

been positive and significant, becomes totally insignificant (which is consistent with

Kraay’s (2000) results for urban households) when two-stage least squares are used.

These findings suggest that the differences between our results and those of Kraay

(2000) are due largely to differences in estimation method and underscore the

importance of using dynamic panel techniques when using panel data.



7. Conclusion

         In this paper, we conducted a dynamic panel analysis of the determinants of the

household saving rate in China using a life cycle model and panel data on Chinese



                                             18
provinces for the 1995-2004 period from China’s household survey. To summarize our

main findings, we found that China’s household saving rate has been high and rising

and that the main determinants of variations over time and over space therein are the

lagged saving rate, the income growth rate, (in many cases) the real interest rate, and (in

some cases) the inflation rate. However, we found that the variables relating to the age

structure of the population have the expected impact on the household saving rate in

only one of the four samples. These results provide mixed support for the life cycle

hypothesis (with the positive and significant coefficient of income growth supporting

the life cycle hypothesis and the mixed performance of the demographic variables being

unfavorable to the life cycle hypothesis), provide some support for the permanent

income hypothesis (with the positive and significant coefficient of the interest rate

supporting this hypothesis), and are also consistent with the existence of inertia or

persistence.

        Turning to the implications of our findings, our finding that inertia or

persistence are strong implies that there will not be a dramatic decline in China’s

household saving rate, and our finding that the income growth rate has a positive impact

on the household saving rate implies that China’s household saving rate will remain

high as long as the growth rate remains high. However, if the growth rate tapers off,

we can explain a gradual decline in the household saving rate.

        Thus, it seems likely that China’s household saving rate will remain high in the

short to medium run, and to the extent that this causes China’s current account surplus

to remain high, this may cause continued frictions with the United States and China’s

other trading partners. In the long run, however, China’s household saving rate can be

expected to taper off assuming the growth rate tapers off, and thus, in the long run,



                                            19
China may well suffer from current account deficits rather than current account

surpluses.

        Turning finally to directions for further research, there are a number of factors

that we were not able to consider in this analysis due to data limitations, such as

borrowing constraints, precautionary saving, bequest motives, the distribution of

income, and old-age pensions, health insurance, and other social insurance programs,

and we hope to be able to incorporate these factors in our future research.

１   See Kuijs (2005, 2006) for data on the overall level and sectoral composition of
saving and investment and on the saving-investment balance in China.
２
    The demographic data in this paragraph and the two following paragraphs are based
on United Nations data and hence do not coincide precisely with the earlier data.
３
    It would have been preferable to use the population aged 15-59 since the retirement
age in China (for males) is 60, but we could not do so due to data limitations.
４
    All calculations were done using Stata, version 10. We used Roodman’s (2005,
2007) ”xtabond2” program in Stata to correct the standard errors.
５
    The “collapse” command in Stata was used to select instruments.
６   The fact that the coefficients of YOUNG and DEP are negative and significant only in
the pooled sample is presumably due to the fact that the one-child policy has been
enforced much more strictly in urban areas than in rural areas, as a result of which there
is much greater variation in YOUNG and DEP in the pooled sample than in the other
samples.
７   Chamon and Prasad (2006) analyze micro data from the same household survey we
use and find that saving increases with age and is highest for the elderly. This can help
explain why OLD and DEP do not have the expected impacts on the household saving
rate.
