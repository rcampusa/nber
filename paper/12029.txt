                                             ABSTRACT

This paper evaluates the first year of Harvard’s Financial Aid Initiative, which increased aid and
recruiting for students from low income backgrounds. Using rich data from the Census and
administrative sources, we estimate family incomes for the vast majority of plausible applicants from
the U.S. We find that the Initiative had a significant effect almost entirely because it attracted a pool
of applicants that was larger and slightly poorer. It appears that very similar standards of admission
were used for this group as had been used in previous years. This group, once admitted, enrolled at
a rate very similar to that of previous years. Thus, there are a greater number of low income students
in the Class of 2009 than in the Class of 2008 simply because more well-qualified, low income
students applied. Put another way, the initiative did not create a new form of affirmative
action–rather, there was an untapped supply of able, low income students. Many apparently
qualified students still do not apply, and a disproportionate share of these “missing applicants” come
from high schools that have little or no tradition of sending applications to selective private colleges.
Targeted outreach to such “one offs” – that is, students who are one of only a few qualified students
from their school in recent years – may be a way for selective private colleges to increase their
income diversity.

                                 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This paper evaluates the effect of the first year of Harvard’s Financial Aid Initiative. In
addition to the data from admissions and financial aid, we compile information on the
family background, neighborhood, and high school of every student who applied, was
admitted, or enrolled. We also compile this information for every student who appears in
the “Search File” that The College Board sends to Harvard because the Search File
approximates the pool of plausible applicants. Our detailed background information,
much of which is at the level of Census block where student resides, allows us to estimate
family incomes for students who do not apply. By using the estimates to supplement
actual income reports, we gauge how Harvard is doing relative to the population of
plausible applicants. We focus on students who reside in the U.S.

We find that the Financial Aid Initiative had a significant effect on the Class of 2009,
almost entirely because it drew in a group of applicants that was much larger and
somewhat poorer. It appears that the Admissions Office applied very similar standards to
this group as it had applied in previous years and that students, once admitted, enrolled at
a rate very similar to that of previous years. Thus, there are a greater number of low
income students in the Class of 2009 than in the Class of 2008 simple because more well-
qualified, low income students applied. Put another way, the initiative did not create a
new form of affirmative action–rather, there was an untapped supply of able, low income
students.

Specifically, the number of applicants to Harvard rose by a dramatic 15 percent between
the Classes of 2008 and 2009. Moreover, the extra applicants were disproportionately
likely to be low income: the share who qualify for the Initiative (family income of
$60,000 or less) rose from 12.3 percent to 14.5 percent. After admissions and enrollment
decisions, 16.5 percent of the Class of 2009 qualified for the Initiative, up from 14.9
percent for the Class of 2008.

Although the first year of Initiative induced students to apply who might otherwise not
have, many apparently qualified students still do not apply. Many of the “missing
applicants” come from high schools that have little or no tradition of sending applications
to Harvard. Thus, for years to come, a key way for Harvard and similar schools to
increase the income diversity of their classes will be raising the probability of application
among qualified students who do not currently set their sights on selective private
colleges. This may be achievable through targeted outreach to students who are “one
offs”—that is, students who appear in the Search File but are one of only a few qualified
students from their school in recent years. In addition, the Financial Aid Initiative (and
others like it at competing institutions) may motivate low income students to achieve at a
higher level so that, eventually, the pool of plausible applicants will contain more
students from families of modest means.

                             I. Why An Initiative on Financial Aid?

        In the early months of 2004, Harvard created a Financial Aid Initiative to
encourage students from families with low to moderate incomes to apply to The College.1
This paper evaluates the results of the first full year of the Initiative, which culminated in
the entry of freshmen in the fall of 2005 for the Harvard Class of 2009.

A. Financial Aid at Harvard Prior to the Initiative
         In 2004, when the Initiative was announced, Harvard had for many years
practiced need-blind admissions and provided very substantial financial aid to students
whose families could not afford the college’s full costs. For instance, in the 2003-04
school year, two-thirds of students received financial aid, and the average aid package
was $26,700. This package meant that the average student on financial aid paid about 30
percent of the total cost of attendance, which was $37,928 in 2003-04.2 Students from
lower income families paid a smaller share. For example, the average family with an
income of $40,000 or below paid $2,300 (about six percent of the total cost of
attendance). Prior to the Initiative, the Harvard Admissions Office also made
considerable effort—via recruiting trips, information sessions all over the country, letters
to prospective applicants, and an array of admissions material (both print and online)—to
reach out to students from disadvantaged backgrounds. When the admissions staff
assessed an application from a student appeared to be disadvantaged, they adjusted their
expectations in light of the fact that such students often have limited opportunities to take
advanced placement classes, engage in extracurricular activities, and obtain counseling
and help with their applications. Nevertheless, in 2004, The College was concerned
about whether it was sufficiently accessible to talented students from families to low to
moderate incomes. Its concerns were in four areas, and the Financial Aid Initiative was
designed to address each concern.
        First, although the contributions asked of low income families were modest
relative to Harvard’s cost of attendance, they might nevertheless have posed an obstacle
to such families. A contribution of $2,300 represented about seven percent of the after-
tax income of a family with income of $40,000 in 2004.3 A family struggling to make
ends meet might find it difficult to give up such a share of their disposal income.
        Second, some analysts believed that Harvard’s aid plan was sufficiently opaque to
be off-putting for low to moderate income families. That is, families could not easily
foresee what they would be asked to contribute and many may have foregone the
opportunity to find out. It was surmised that a simpler, more salient plan might better
convey Harvard’s commitment to making The College accessible to talented students
from all backgrounds.


1
  The Financial Aid Initiative was officially announced on February 28, 2004. Documents describing the
announcement and the initiative may be found on the website of the Harvard Gazette, especially the
following link: http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2004/03.04/01-finaid.html.

  The total cost of attendance includes tuition, room, board, fees, and other charges. Tuition was $26,066 in
the 2003-04 school year.

  The tax liability (including FICA taxes) in 2004 was approximately $8,000 for a family with $40,000 of
earnings and two dependents, one of whom was college-aged. The source is TAXSIM, National Bureau of
Economic Research, 2005.
                                                                                          5

         Third, low to moderate income students often come from households, schools,
and neighborhoods in which information about selective private colleges is scarce.
Information about Harvard and its accessibility may not reach them, and their counselors
and parents may be less likely to encourage them to apply. In some cases, a student
attends a school that has almost no experience sending applicants to colleges like
Harvard, so that there are no former students or counselors to credibly convey knowledge
about the application, aid, and college experience to prospective applicants.
         The final, related problem is that the schools that low to moderate income
students attend often lack the curriculum to fully prepare their most talented students for
the competitive application process and academic requirements of colleges like Harvard.
Some schools offer such modest academic and extracurricular opportunities that even a
student who takes advantage of every opportunity may find herself with little advanced
coursework and limited experience in leadership, athletic, and cultural positions. As a
result, applicants from low income backgrounds may appear to be less meritorious than
they truly are. Even if admissions staff attempt to adjust for disadvantaged students’
paucity of opportunities, their adjustments may be insufficient for students who attend
secondary schools that are unfamiliar to the Admissions Office. Logically, we expect the
adjustments to be calibrated best for schools, such as some inner-city magnet schools,
that regularly send applications from meritorious, disadvantaged students. (Below, we
return to this point.)

B. What the Financial Aid Initiative Did
        Harvard’s Financial Aid Initiative had one or more features that addressed each
concern described above. The initiative stated explicitly that parents with incomes below
$40,000 would not be expected to contribute at all to the cost of a Harvard College
education. Also, the initiative stated that parents with incomes between $40,000 and
$60,000 would be expected to contribute less ($1,250 less on average) than previously.
The announcement of zero cost for families with incomes lower than $40,000 was
particularly salient and easy to understand. As a result, it received considerable coverage
in the media. Although public knowledge of the policy may grow somewhat in future
years, it is the one feature of the Initiative that was fully fledged and widely understood
by applicants to the Class of 2009.
        The second feature of the Financial Aid Initiative was increased effort to reach
out to students from low to moderate income families. The Admissions Office focused
new recruiting efforts on students likely to benefit from the initiative. These efforts took
a variety of forms including school visits, letters from the admissions office, telephone
calls from current Harvard students, and outreach by Harvard alumni in their local areas.
Indeed, in a related study, we (the authors) are putting together indicators that will help
admissions offices, including Harvard’s, identify students from disadvantaged
backgrounds in a more accurate, multidimensional way. The increase in recruiting efforts
was intended to expand the size and diversity of the pool of applicants from which
Harvard draws. It is nature of outreach to improve with practice—contacts generate
contacts, successful targeting hones future targeting. Thus, we should expect the
prospective class of 2009 to reflect only a fraction of the long-term results that will
accrue to increased recruiting effort by the Admissions Office.
                                                                                           6

         The third feature of the Financial Aid Initiative addressed the issue that low
income students might be at a disadvantage in the admissions process because they lack
some of the academic and extracurricular opportunities enjoyed by students from higher
income families. In previous years, the Admissions Office gave special attention to
students from particular schools known to have limited extracurricular activities and to
students whose applications made it obvious that they come from disadvantaged
backgrounds. In 2004, the Admissions Office initiated a systematic procedure for
identifying disadvantaged students and assessing their applications in the light of these
disadvantages. Essentially, the goal is to make accurate adjustments for differences in
opportunities—so that students on how they will do at Harvard—even when a student
attends a high school that is initially unfamiliar to the admissions staff. Like recruiting
efforts, such analysis is only likely to improve with practice. Thus, we expect the class of
2009 to reflect only a fraction of the long-term consequences of admissions officers’
intensifying their scrutiny of the effects of coming from a disadvantaged background.
         The fourth and final feature of the Financial Aid Initiative is a summer program
for promising students from disadvantaged backgrounds. The program will directly
relieve some of the deprivation in the academic and extracurricular environments in
which low income students often grow up. The summer program, still in its infancy, is
very unlikely to have affected students in the Class of 2009, so an evaluation of its effects
must be left for future research.
         In short, by comparing Harvard admissions immediately before and after the
enactment of the Financial Aid Initiative, we are mainly evaluating the effect of increased
aid for families with incomes less than $60,000. We are also evaluating the new
recruiting and admissions efforts, but we expect our results to understate the long-term
effects of such efforts. We wish to emphasize that, in the very long-term, policies like
the Financial Aid Initiative may have effects that dwarf the short-term effects we study.
For instance, if all selective private colleges were successfully to advertise greater
accessibility to low income students, then low income students might be motivated to
prepare themselves academically for education at a selective college.


                                     II. Our Analysis

        In this paper, we evaluate how the Financial Aid Initiative affected the
composition and size of the pool of students who applied to Harvard, the composition of
the group of students who were admitted to Harvard, and the composition of students
who enrolled in Harvard’s Class of 2009. In each case, we are interested in whether the
students were more likely to be drawn from low to moderate income families, the
intended targets of the Initiative. Although we are mainly interested in direct measures of
family income, we are also interested in other indicators of students’ socioeconomic
diversity. In particular, we examine parents’ education, parents’ occupations, and the
neighborhoods in which families reside. We also investigate whether the Initiative has
drawn students from secondary schools that have little or no “track record” sending
applicants or matriculants to The College.
        Our method is to compare the Class of 2008, who applied before the Initiative
was announced, and the Class of 2009, who went through the admissions process with the
                                                                                                           7

Initiative in place. Because the initiative was announced before the Class of 2008 had
made decisions about whether to enroll, it might have affected their matriculation
decisions.4 However, the announcement could not have affected their decision to apply
for admission or their decision to apply for financial aid.
         In this paper, we employ three main types of data. First, we use “Search Files”
created by The College Board for Harvard’s use. The Search Files contain information
on individual students who—based on their admissions test scores, self-reported grade
point averages, and other criteria—have a non-negligible probability of being admitted to
Harvard. Roughly speaking, the search files may be thought of as the universe from
which Harvard can draw plausible applicants, at least among Americans.5
         Our second type of data is individual application and financial aid records, which
we obtained through the generosity of Harvard’s Office of Admissions and Financial Aid.
         We can only identify family income precisely for students who were admitted to
Harvard and who applied for financial aid. For this reason, we have a third type of data:
rich socio-demographic and administrative data for every census block and school (public
and private) in the United States. The key element of our analysis is that we match each
student to the census block in which his family resides and to the school that he attends.
A census block is a small area—a neighborhood in metropolitan areas. To put things in
perspective, the average census block in the United States contains 50 households, and
there are hundreds of census blocks in a typical metropolitan school district.6 Once we
know the census block where a student lives and the school he attends, we can use
information from those sources to estimate family income for students who are in
Harvard’s Search Files or group of applicants.7 Our income estimates are reasonably
accurate for the range of incomes at which students apply for financial aid.8 For instance,
we might predict that a family’s income is $90,000 when it is truly $100,000, but we are


4
  For this reason, we tried to obtain data that would allow us to compare the matriculation decisions of the
Class of 2007 and the Class of 2009. Unfortunately, this proved to be impossible.
5
  The Search File is created by The College Board and sent to the Harvard Admissions Office in the spring
of each year. The file includes addresses for more than 60,000 rising high school seniors whose test scores
are high enough to make them plausible candidates for admission to Harvard. Approximately 60% of the
U.S. applicants and approximately 75% of U.S. students enrolling at Harvard appear in the Search File for
the year in which they apply. Most other U.S. students who enroll at Harvard will have appeared in a
previous year’s Search File, most likely because they take the SAT test early and are thus “searched” in the
year prior to the year in which they will apply.
6
  A census block is the smallest geographic entity for which the Census tabulates data. It is often an actual
block in urban areas but larger geographically in rural areas (though not necessary larger in people).
Blocks are usually bounded on all four sides by visible features such as roads. Population-by-race and
other useful data are available at the block level. Household income and parents’ education is available at
the block group level, which we use when block level data are not available.
7
  For addition detail on our income estimation, we refer you to a related paper on which we are currently at
work.
8
  For a number of reasons—including the emphasis of this paper, data availability, and an explicit wish to
avoid the appearance that the Harvard Admissions Office is obtaining information with which they might
price discriminate among mid- to high-income applicants—we do not attempt to estimate very accurately
the income for students who are above the range of those who routinely require financial aid. Thus, readers
should assume that statistics associated with incomes above $120,000 are rough calculations only.
Moreover, we should note that we did not provide an income estimate to the Harvard Admissions Office
for any student unlikely to qualify for the financial aid initiative.
                                                                                                                 8

very unlikely to predict that the family is poor when it really has income of $100,000.9
Keep in mind that we use actual income data whenever they are available. We use
estimated income only to complete the picture for students for whom we have no data
from the Office of Financial Aid.10
         Our analysis focuses on students whose families reside in the United States. This
is for two reasons. We make this restriction because there is no one accepted way to
convert foreign incomes into American equivalents, and the results would be sensitive to
how individual foreign currencies were converted. Moreover, the Financial Aid Initiative
was clearly motivated by the circumstances of U.S. residents. The rich in many countries
have incomes lower than $60,000, but they enjoy lifestyles and local educational
opportunities that ensure that they are not deprived in the way envisioned by the
Initiative. Finally, we cannot get socio-demographic information on the neighborhoods
and schools of students who reside in foreign countries. In short, any picture we drew of
students who reside abroad would necessarily be sketchy and would probably be
misleading.


      III. Does the Class of 2009 Contain More Students from Low Income Families
                                 that the Class of 2008?

         The most straightforward method for assessing the success of the Financial Aid
Initiative is to compare, for the classes of 2008 and 2009, the share of students who come
from families with incomes below $40,000 or between $40,000 and $60,000. We
describe these students as “qualifying” for the Financial Aid Initiative, although it is
important to remember that the Initiative was not actually announced until the class of
2008 had applied.
         We put all income amounts, including the thresholds of $40,000 and $60,000, into
2004 equivalents.11 We do this so that the Class of 2009 does not automatically appear to
be richer than the previous class, as it would if we ignored the general rise in incomes
that occurred between the two years.
         We find that 6.6 percent (97 of 1459) of the students in the class of 2008 were
from families below the $40,000 threshold, but such students made up 7.9 percent (117 of
1478) of the class of 2009. Similarly, 8.2 percent (119 of 1459) of the students in the
class of 2008 were from families with incomes between $40,000 and $60,000, but such
students made up 8.7 percent (128 of 1478) of the Class of 2009. In short, there was an
increase of 1.8 percent (29 students) in the two low-income categories for the Class of

9
   In fact, there are no students for whom predicted income is less than $40,000 and actual income is
$100,000 or greater. Among students with predicted income below $60,000, only 0.2 percent have actual
incomes of $100,000 or greater.
10
   We have also done all of the analysis in this paper using estimated family income for all students. By
doing this, we eliminate any biases associated with the fact that actual income is available for a selected
group where the selection is not random but determined by application and admissions conduct. Because
we get results that are very similar for the purposes of evaluation and interpretation to the results we show
here, this paper does not present the analysis based solely on estimated incomes. However, the results are
available from the authors.
11
    Specifically, we use the change in per capita income for the state in which the student resides to inflate

  2009. The increases are shown in Figure 1 and detailed in Table 1. These numbers are
  consistent with, but not identical to, Admission Office reports about the Initiative because
  we have excluded international students and because we used state-by-state changes in
  family incomes method to convert all income amounts into 2004 equivalents. This is the
  most exact method of making the two income years comparable.

  A. What Accounts for the Larger Number of Low Income Students in the Class of 2009?
         It is important to understand the source of the larger number of low income
  students in the Class of 2009. Were there more qualified low income students in the high
                                                                                                         10

school graduating class than in the previous year? Did a higher percentage of qualified
low income students apply to Harvard? Did the Admissions Office favor low income
students in admissions decisions (relative to the previous year)? Were low income
students more likely to matriculate for the Class of 2009, conditional on having been
admitted? To answer these questions one at a time, we compare four separate
populations of students for these two years: 1) potential applicants in The College Board
Search File; 2) applicants to Harvard; 3) students admitted to Harvard; 4) students
matriculating to Harvard.

i. Potential Applicants
        We found that the income distribution of prospective students in The College
Board Search Files (whom we will call “searched” students for clarity) was
approximately the same for the two years once we took account of the overall rise in
incomes from one year to the next. Column 1 of Table 3 below lists the income
distribution for the first of the two years. Similarly, the distributions of searched students
in terms of neighborhood and type of high school were approximately the same for the
two years. This suggests that the high school graduating classes and the pool of potential
applicants to Harvard was largely the same in the two years. This should be no surprise
because the criteria by which students were put into the search file were approximately
the same.

ii. The Applicants
        We found that applicants for the Class of 2009 were significantly more likely to
students who qualify for the Financial Aid Initiative (family income less than $60,000)
than applicants for the Class of 2008. Harvard’s applications jumped dramatically from
16,821 for the Class of 2008 to 19,321 for the class of 2009,12 so our analysis compares
the percentages of applicants in each income category across the two years.
        Specifically, 4.6 percent of the applicants for the Class of 2009 came from
families with incomes below $40,000, whereas 3.6 percent of the applicants for Class of
2008 came from such families. Also, 9.9 percent of the applicants for the Class of 2009
came from families with incomes between $40,000 and $60,000, but 8.7 percent of the
applicants for Class of 2008 came from such families. These differences are shown in
Figure 2 and Table 2 and are statistically significant.
        Table 2 also shows the mean and several percentile values for the family incomes
of applicants for the Classes of 2008 and 2009. Indeed, 2009 applicants had lower mean
family incomes in 2009 ($120,015) than in 2008 ($124,111),13 and lower incomes at each
percentile value throughout the distribution.


12
   We do not include international applicants in our analysis, so these numbers are lower than the total
number of applications in each year – X for the Class of 2008 and Y for the Class of 2009.
13
   The income amounts given here are in 2004 equivalents, for both classes.
15
   To create the adjusted admission rates for the Class of 2008, we divide the admissions rate for each
income range for applicants for the Class of 2008 by the ratio of the admissions rates for the two classes.
This adjustment produces the admissions rate that would result from an equal proportional decline for every
income range. Since the adjusted admission rates for the Class of 2008 are approximately the same in
every income range as the actual admission rates for the Class of 2009, it appears that the admission rates
did in fact decline by a similar proportion in each group when applications increased for the Class of 2009.

        Figure 3 and Table 3 compare the income distribution for the applicant pools in
both years to the income distribution for students in the Search File. In the year prior to
the Initiative, a larger percentage (2.4 percent) of searched students had incomes below
$40,000 than Harvard applicants did (1.9 percent). This means that Harvard attracts a
disproportionately small number of applicants from students in the lowest range of
incomes. After the Initiative, Harvard applicants had about the same likelihood (2.5
percent) of being in the lowest income range as the searched students.
        Similarly, in the year prior to the Initiative, a larger percentage (31.7 percent) of
searched students had incomes in the range between $40,000 and $80,000 than Harvard
applicants did (23.1 percent), indicating that Harvard also attracts a disproportionately
small number of applications from this second range of incomes. After the Initiative,
26.3 percent of Harvard’s applicants came from families with income between $40,000
and $80,000. This is substantial progress, but Harvard still attracted a disproportionately
small number of applicants from this range.
        At the other end of the income distribution, Figure 3 and Table 3 also show that
Harvard attracts a proportionate number of applications from students in the $80,000 to
$120,000 income range and attracts a disproportionately large number of applicants from
families with incomes above $120,000. However, the disproportionality is not great,
especially after the Initiative.
        These numbers indicate that the increase in applications for Harvard’s Class of
2009 was disproportionately from students from families with low incomes. Of course,
the “extra” applicants were not all poor: if they had been, the number of applicants with
incomes below $40,000 would have quintupled between the Classes of 2008 and 2009.
Nevertheless, the extra applicants did have somewhat lower incomes, which generate the
downward shift in all measures of the affluence of Harvard’s applicants, and suggests that
the Financial Aid Initiative was successful in attracting exactly those applicants it
targeted.

  iii. The Admission Decision
          We found that the probability of admission for students in each income category
  fell by similar rates for the Class of 2009. With a 15 percent increase in applications for
  the Class of 2009, the admissions rate for the entire applicant pool had to fall by an
  analogous amount since that Harvard’s entering class was the same size in both years. To
  compare the admissions rates by income level across the two years, we first adjust the
  probabilities of admission for the Class of 2008 to reflect the smaller pool of applicants in
  that year.15 Given this adjustment, there was little change in the probability of admission,
                                                                                                                                                              14

    for a student from any income range, between the Class of 2008 and the Class of 2009.
    More precisely, none of the differences in the probability of admission that are shown in
    Figure 4 and Table 4 are statistically significant from zero at conventional levels of
    confidence.

    Notes: All incomes are put into 2004 equivalents so that the comparison of the Classes of 2008 and 2009
    could be on an even basis. Only students whose families reside in the U.S. are included. The adjustment
    accounts for the overall increase in the number of applicants between the Classes of 2008 and 2009.

           We have seen that the Financial Aid Initiative drew students from lower income
    families into Harvard’s pool of applicants. Without information on admission decisions,
    however, we have limited ability to assess the quality of applications from the low
    income students who would not have applied prior to the Initiative. For example, if the
                                                                                                         15

Initiative only attracted new applicants from low income backgrounds who had poor
qualifications and none of them could be admitted, then the admissions rate would have
to fall disproportionately for the low income range to reflect the decline in the quality of
applicants in that range.
         Since we found that the admission rate fell by similar proportions across income
categories after the introduction of the Initiative, it appears that the low income applicants
who were attracted to apply by the Initiative had similar qualifications to the low income
applicants who would have applied even without the Initiative. Indeed, a simple check of
class rank and SAT scores shows that they remained almost constant for applicants in
each income category. This indicates that Harvard may have expanded its applicant pool
without weakening the quality of applicants.
          However, admission to Harvard is not purely on the basis of class rank and SAT
scores, and the new applicants may have been relatively weak in other areas, such as
preparation in advanced material, demonstrations of leadership, or extracurricular
activities. Indeed, the idea that disadvantaged students would be weak on such
dimensions was the motivation of the third part of the Initiative. Thus, we think it
reasonably likely that the Admissions Office intensified its analysis of applications from
disadvantaged students to ensure that it maintained a similar admissions rate for low
income students as in previous years (after adjusting for the overall increase in
applications).
         In short, the Financial Aid Initiative appears so far mainly to have affected the
number and composition of Harvard’s applicants. In particular, the relative increase in
low income applicants also translated into a relative increase in low income admits for
the Class of 2009.

iv. The Matriculation Decision for Students
        We found that among admitted students from every income range, the probability
of matriculating was the same for the Class of 2008 and the Class of 2009. More
precisely, none of the differences in the probabilities of matriculating are statistically
significantly different from zero.
        Because the low income applicants who were attracted to apply by the Initiative
were probably less drawn to Harvard and/or more financially constrained than others, the
steady matriculation rates are interesting. They suggest that the Office of Admissions
and Financial Aid did a good job of addressing the financial needs and other concerns of
these new applicants.
        An interesting fact to take away from Table 5 is the matriculation rate is highest at
the two ends of the income distribution. Students from families with incomes below
$40,000 have about a 90 percent likelihood of matriculating, in both the 2008 and 2009
classes.16 The average matriculation rate for students from families with incomes above
$160,000 is 86 percent. Matriculation rates for students from families with incomes in
the $60,000 to $120,000 range are considerably lower: 71 percent to 75 percent. The U-
shaped pattern of matriculation probabilities suggests that students from middle income
families have alternatives to Harvard that, cost considered, they prefer. This may be

16
  We note that the matriculation rates for the Class of 2008 may already reflect the influence of the
Financial Aid Initiative, since the Initiative was announced between the application deadline and the date
when students received financial aid packages for the Class of 2008.
                                                                                                                                                    16

because middle income families contribute to the cost of Harvard education but pay little
or nothing if their child attends their state’s flagship university with a merit scholarship.
Low income families, in contrast, pay similarly small amounts at Harvard and state
universities. High income families receive little or no aid at Harvard but are also
relatively insensitive to merit scholarships offered by less selective universities (which
are often small in absolute size). For more discussion of families’ reaction to tuition and
aid packages, see Avery and Hoxby (2004).

v. Summary of Results on Family Income

         What are we to conclude? First, the main reason why there are relatively few low
income students enrolling at Harvard is that there are relatively few in the pool of
plausible applicants (searched students). Therefore, only long-term policies that
ameliorate the educational deficiencies of low income students can make the income
distribution of Harvard students echo the income distribution of the population of U.S.
students. We are necessarily referring here to government policy on elementary and
secondary education because, though the Financial Aid Initiative does attempt to address
long-term educational deficiencies, Harvard’s scale is tiny relative to the U.S. and even
the most successful Harvard policy could not possibly remedy national problems.
         Second, the Initiative has significantly improved Harvard’s recruiting of
applicants from low income families, but further improvements should be possible,
particularly in the recruiting of students from low-to-moderate income families ($40,000
to $80,000). Students from this particular range of incomes ($40,000 to $80,000) remain
underrepresented in the pool of applicants relative to the set of potential applicants from
the Search File.
         Third, our findings reflect the fact that Harvard already offered quite generous
financial aid packages to low income students before the introduction of the Initiative: the
matriculation rates for low income students admitted to the Class of 2008 were actually
higher than the matriculation rates for students from higher income ranges up to
$160,000. This suggests that Harvard has only limited ability to increase enrollment
from low income students by competing more aggressively to enroll low income students
who are admitted both to Harvard and to an attractive rival college.
         On the whole, it seems to us that the Initiative affected the admissions process in
exactly the right way. It drew students who were qualified but would otherwise have
thought Harvard unaffordable into the pool of applicants. The extra students were treated
fairly in the admissions process. They appear also to have had their financial needs met
because the matriculation rate for low income students who were admitted was about the
same in both years. Harvard’s initial surmise had been that there existed a group of
students whose “menus” did not include schools like Harvard solely because they did not
know about its aid or were put off by the need to make even a modest contribution
towards its cost. This group of students does evidently exist and they were
unambiguously made better off as their menus expanded to include Harvard and possibly
other selective private colleges as well.
         Although the new financial aid packages were fully rolled-out in the first year of
the Initiative, we expect the other parts of the Initiative (recruiting, analysis of
disadvantage in the admissions process, summer school) to increase in efficaciousness
over time. Thus, the first year effects, though significant in themselves, understate the
likely long-run effects of the Initiative.
                                                                                                         18


        III. Is the Class of 2009 More Likely to be Disadvantaged, based on Indicators
                                 Other than Family Income?

          Having made a careful study of family income, we now more briefly examine
  other indicators of disadvantage for applicants, admittees, and matriculants to the Classes
  of 2008 and 2009: 1) parental education; 2) neighborhood of residence; 3) high school
  history of applicants and admits to Harvard.

  i. Parental Education
          It is useful to examine parents’ educational attainment, partly because it indicates
  the likely degree of sophistication about selective colleges in a student’s home and partly
  because it is a good indicator of wealth (that is, parents’ education is more closely
  associated with a family’s usual income than with its income in a single year).
          Table 6 shows that applicants to the Class of 2009 were statistically significantly
  more likely to have parents neither of whom had a college education (2 percent more
  likely) or to have only parent with a college education (1 percent more likely).
  Applicants to the Class of 2009 were also statistically significantly less likely to have at
  least one parent who held a graduate degree (3 percent more likely). Similar differences
  show up among students who were admitted to or enrolled in the Class of 2009.
  Compared to their counterparts in the previous Class, they were statistically significantly
  more likely to have at least one parent with no college education and less likely to have at
  least one parent with a graduate degree.
          These findings mirror the results based on incomes. Where Table 1 indicated that
  the percentage of enrolled students qualifying for the Financial Aid Initiative based on
  family income increased from 14.8% for the Class of 2008 to 16.6% for the Class of
  2009, Table 6 indicates that the percentage of enrolled students with at least one parent
  who did not graduate from college increased from 16.8% for the Class of 2008 to 19.5%
  for the Class of 2009.

ii. Neighborhood of Residence
        We also compare the neighborhoods from which the Classes of 2008 and 2009
were drawn. As shown in Table 7, we find that applicants to the Class of 2009 came
from neighborhoods that have a variety of characteristics associated with financial
disadvantages and lower propensities to attend selective colleges. For instance, the 2009
applicants came from neighborhoods that had lower median family incomes, a greater
share of families with incomes below $40,000, lower median house values, a greater
share of homes valued at less than $100,000, a smaller share of adults with a college
degree, and a larger share of the population belonging to a racial or ethnic minority
group.17 Applicants to the Class of 2009 also came from secondary schools (both public
and private) in which racial and ethnic minorities formed a larger share of the student
body. All of these differences are statistically significant at the 90% level of confidence.
        When we compare the Classes of 2008 and 2009 in terms of 1) admitted students
and 2) matriculating students, we find smaller but otherwise similar differences in
neighborhoods of residence. For admitted and enrolled students, only some of the
differences are statistically significant, but we see an overall picture that is consistent
with the results on students’ family incomes. Members of the class of 2009 were a few
percentage points more likely to come from a neighborhood with characteristics that are
not propitious for enrollment in selective colleges like Harvard.

  Home values are an important measure of wealth, and—since home equity is an important source of
collateral—an indicator of a family’s ability to obtain loans to pay for college education. We define racial
and ethnic minorities as all people who are not white and non-Hispanic.

                                                 IV. “One-Offs”

          Many low to moderate income students in the United States come from regions
  and schools that do not have strong traditions of sending students to selective colleges in
  the Northeast, like Harvard. As a result, these students may lack information on how to
  get through the admissions process, what aid to expect, and what a Harvard education is
  like. If The College is to reach substantially greater numbers of students from
  disadvantaged backgrounds, it will need to recruit students from schools that have sent
  applicants to Harvard only occasionally in the past, if at all. Note that some schools,
  especially “exam” schools such as Stuyvesant in New York City and the North Carolina
  School of Science and Math, are traditional “feeders” and yet have substantial shares of
  their student populations coming from low to moderate income families. It is our view,
  however, that such schools experienced major recruiting efforts before the initiative and
  are unlikely to be a source of qualified, low income students who need to be reached.
          We classify high schools by their history with Harvard in terms of sending
  applications, getting students admitted, and having students enroll. Our history variables
                                                                                                     21

use information from the admissions process for the five Classes before the two we
study—that is for the Classes of 2003 to 2007.
        Table 8 provides a sense of the importance of school history. While 56 percent of
potential students (those in the Search File) come from schools that had between 10 or
more students apply to Harvard in the previous five years, 68 percent of the applicants
and 79 percent of matriculants came from these schools. At the other end of the
spectrum, 9 percent of potential students come from schools that had sent no applications
to Harvard in the previous five years, but only 2.8 percent of those enrolling in the Class
of 2008 came from such schools.

                                        Table 8:

    NOTE: This table includes only students whose families resided in the United States. Percentages in
    each column may not add to 100% due to rounding.

        Another way to think about the importance of a school’s history is to consider the
number of schools that were represented in the search file. For the Class of 2008, 10,555
high schools had at least one student in the Search File but only 5,368 schools sent at
least one application to Harvard. This suggests that there are more than 5,000 high
schools where Harvard could hope to attract applicants but no students applied. High
schools with little prior history of applying to Harvard tend to have a disproportionate
number of disadvantaged students. For example, more than 10 percent of the students at
schools with limited prior history of applying to Harvard qualify for free or reduced price
lunch. By contrast, fewer than 5 percent of students at schools averaging 10 or more
applications to Harvard qualify for free or reduced price lunch.
        In short, an important question is whether the Financial Aid Initiative expanded
the set of schools that are developing a “history” with Harvard. We find evidence that it
did, largely because the extra applicants to the Class of 2009 disproportionately came
from schools that had a slight or no admissions history. These results are shown in
Figure 6 and Table 9. For instance, 5.1 percent of applicants to the Class of 2008 came
from schools that had sent no applications to the Classes of 2003 through 2007, but 6.8
percent of applicants to the Class of 2009 came from such schools. 34.1 percent of
applicants to the Class of 2008 came from schools that had no student enrolled in the
Classes of 2003 through 2007, but 37.6 percent of applicants to the Class of 2009 came
from such schools. Figure 6 shows a consistent pattern: the Class of 2009 came from
                                                                                                                                                                                       22

schools that had fewer past applications, admitted students, and enrolled students than the
Class of 2008. Nevertheless, we can see that additional progress in expanding the reach
of recruiting is possible: compare the available students and the Class of 2009 in Figure
6.

        How does a selective private college create effective outreach to students who are
“one-offs”—that is, students who attend a high school that has sent no or few students (or
even applications) in the recent past? Traditional methods of outreach include high
school visits and local open houses, but these methods will have low efficacy with one-
offs. Simply because a high school has a qualified applicant this does not guarantee that it
will have one next year or the year after: this is the essence of a student’s being a one-
off. Thus, many school visits would potentially be wasted: admissions officers cannot
possibly visit all U.S. high schools so that many schools would necessarily be visited in
the “wrong” year and enjoy no visit in the “right” year. Instead, it is logical simply to
match application, admittance, and enrollment histories to the students in the search file,
identify the one-offs, and direct targeted recruitment efforts to them: telephone calls
from current students, emails, and specialized materials designed for students like them.
The specialized efforts should presumably be designed to compensate for the counseling
and informal advice that they lack because they are isolated.

                                         V. Conclusions

      Our analyses produce consistent positive findings for the effects of the first year of
  the Financial Aid Initiative. Enrollment of students qualifying for the Initiative
  increased by 11% in one year; enrollment of students with family incomes below $40,000
  increased by nearly 20%. The most conspicuous effect of the Financial Aid Initiative
  was that it attracted applications from students who qualified for it. After the
  introduction of the initiative, the percentage of applicants from families with incomes of
  $40,000 or below jumped by more than 20%. In fact, among potential applicants to
  Harvard (those appearing in The College Board Search File), those from families with
  very low incomes and those from families with very high incomes were about equally
  likely to apply.
      For both the Class of 2008 and 2009, applicants from low income families were about
  equally likely as applicants from high income families to be admitted to Harvard and to
  enroll. This indicates that the Admissions Office has been able to correct for differences
  in resources and extracurricular opportunities in evaluating applications. It also indicates
  that Harvard’s financial aid packages do make it possible for students from all
  backgrounds to attend Harvard; the publicity surrounding the Financial Aid Initiative
                                                                                        24

may have masked the fact that Harvard was already providing substantial financial aid to
students whose families could not afford the college’s full costs.
     Some commentators, when considering the Initiative, expected that it would create a
new form of affirmative action. This expectation does not seem to have been realized.
There appears to be an untapped pool of qualified applicants whose family incomes are
more diverse than those of past applicants.
     Looking forward, while we find that the Financial Aid Initiative was successful in its
first year, the underlying challenge is that the set of Harvard’s potential applicants is
disproportionately wealthy relative to the population. For Harvard to further increase its
enrollment of low income students in the short-run, it will have to reach ever further into
the untapped pool mentioned above. The students in this pool are, however,
disproportionately “one-offs.” That is, they are widely dispersed and many of them
attend schools that have never had anyone apply to Harvard. This suggests that recruiting
efforts that specifically target one-offs, who can be identified because their schools have
little or no “Harvard history,” may be more productive than recruiting efforts that are
broadly directed toward disadvantaged students.
