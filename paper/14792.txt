                                              ABSTRACT

The representation of a large number of students born outside the United States among the ranks of
doctorate recipients from U.S. universities is one of the most significant transformations in U.S. graduate
education and the international market for highly-trained workers in science and engineering in the
last quarter century. Students from outside the U.S. accounted for 51% of PhD recipients in science
and engineering fields in 2003, up from 27% in 1973. In the physical sciences, engineering and economics
the representation of foreign students among PhD recipients is yet more striking; among doctorate
recipients in 2003, those from outside the U.S. accounted for 50% of degrees in the physical sciences,
67% in engineering and 68% in economics. Our analysis highlights the important role of changes
in demand among foreign born in explaining the growth and distribution of doctorates awarded in
science and engineering. Expansion in undergraduate degree receipt in many countries has a direct
effect on the demand for advanced training in the U.S. Changes in the supply side of the U.S. graduate
education market may also differentially affect the representation of foreign students in U.S. universities.
 Supply shocks such as increases in federal support for the sciences will have relatively large effects
on the representation in the U.S. of doctorate students from countries where demand is relatively elastic.
Understanding the determinants – and consequences – of changes over time in the representation of
foreign born students among doctorate recipients from U.S. universities informs the design of policies
affecting the science and engineering workforce.

                           Internationalization of U.S. Doctorate Education

         The representation of a large number of students born outside the United States among

the ranks of PhD recipients from U.S. universities is one of the most significant transformations

in the international market for higher education in the last quarter century. Students from outside

the U.S. accounted for 51% of PhD recipients in science and engineering fields in 2003, up from

27% in 1973.1 The primary objective of this research is to understand the factors effecting this

growth. We wish to understand the pattern of flows into U.S. PhD programs both across

countries and over time.

         Variation across countries and over time in the demand for graduate study in the United

States affects the number and distribution of students by country of origin at universities in the

United States. It is also the case that the representation of foreign students in U.S. PhD programs

is a function of the resources available to these programs or the “supply side” of the PhD market.

In the post-war years, substantial federal and state subsidies increased both the excellence and

scale of U.S. graduate education. The growth of graduate education in the sciences at U.S.

research universities has fundamentally changed international access to doctorate level training

in the last half century.

         In motivating this analysis, we note that it is not uncommon to find rhetoric suggesting

that the relative erosion in the quality of education afforded to young people in the U.S. is a

primary cause of the decline in share of doctorate degrees in science and engineering awarded to

         1
           Tabulations presented in publications such as Science and Engineering Indicators show a somewhat
lower representation of students from outside the U.S. among PhD recipients in science and engineering for two
reasons. First, we include only engineering, life sciences, physical sciences and economics in our definition of
science and engineering, excluding social science fields like sociology and political science which have not drawn
substantial number of foreign students. Secondly, we classify students as foreign if they did complete high school in
the United States, which results in some overstatement of the aggregate counts of the foreign representation of
doctorate recipients as respondents missing information on high school location are included in this count. The
conclusions of the paper and the statements about trends are invariant to the choice of classification of cases with
unreported citizenship or high school location.


                                                                                                    Page 1
U.S. students.2 Our interpretation of the available evidence is that such claims have little

empirical basis. Natural economic forces of supply and demand, with these effects varying

considerably in magnitude across countries, go a significant distance in explaining the observed

changes in doctorate receipt among students from abroad and the U.S.

        In the first section, we outline the basic trends in PhD degree attainment and set forth the

institutional context of doctorate education in the United States. The second section considers

the differential cross-sectional representation of students by country at the graduate level in the

United States. The analysis of the determinants of the growth over time in foreign participation

in U.S. doctorate study in the sciences follows in the third section. The fourth section turns to

the analysis of the determinants of participation of U.S. students in graduate education in the

sciences.

        In understanding the substantial foreign share of doctorate recipients from U.S.

institutions, we address two related questions. The first concerns the distribution of doctorate

recipients by country of origin, as students from Asian countries tend to be overrepresented on a

per capita basis and distributed somewhat differently by type of institution than students from

Europe and other parts of the world. The second dimension of our analysis is to understand the

determinants of changes over time in the number of foreign students receiving doctorate degrees

in the U.S. Changes in demand – generated by increased undergraduate degree attainment abroad

and political shocks – and changes in research support for universities affect the flow of foreign

students to U.S. PhD programs.



        2
          Bowen, Kurzweil and Tobin (2005, p. 38) note that presidential and national commissions tend to urge
policy changes “to counteract the alleged rising tide of mediocrity.” A recently released report from the National
Academy of Sciences titled Rising Above the Gathering Storm: Energizing and Employing America for a Brighter
Economic Future notes, “Having reviewed trends in the United States and abroad, the committee is deeply
concerned that the scientific and technical building blocks of our economic leadership are eroding at a time when
many other nations are gathering strength.”


                                                                                                    Page 2
       Our interest in understanding the production of graduate education at universities is

ultimately an input to the study of the link between the graduate education process and the

employment of scientists and engineers in the U.S. and abroad. In turn, decisions to pursue

graduate study reflect variation over time and countries of origin in labor market opportunities

for the high-skill workers. A significant innovation of our work is the identification of trends in

doctorate awards by country of origin. First, even countries that are relatively similar to the U.S.

in socioeconomic circumstances and institutions (such as Canada and countries in Europe) send a

considerable number of students to U.S. doctorate programs. Second, as baccalaureate degree

receipt grows within countries so too does the attainment of PhDs at U.S. universities, with these

changes particularly marked among countries experiencing substantial changes in educational

attainment. Finally, political transformations involving either the opening or closing of trade with

the U.S. also lead to substantial changes in doctorate receipt in the sciences among students from

foreign countries.



Section 1. Basic Trends and Policy Context

       The U.S. education market has never been closed to foreign students, though the absolute

number of students from other countries enrolling in U.S. colleges and universities was relatively

modest until the 1970s. The post World War II strengthening of U.S. universities -- particularly

in the sciences and engineering -- made advanced study in the U.S. more attractive to foreign

students. In the two decades between 1936 and 1956, foreign students accounted for 19% of

PhDs awarded by U.S. institutions in engineering, 10% of PhDs awarded in the physical




                                                                                       Page 3
sciences, 12% of PhDs in the life sciences and 12% of PhDs in economics (National Academy of

Sciences, 1958).3

         The post World War II strengthening of U.S. universities -- particularly in the sciences

and engineering -- made advanced study in the U.S. newly attractive to foreign students.

Advances in air travel, global communication, and visa arrangements no doubt also reduced the

fixed barriers that might otherwise have limited the access of foreign students to U.S.

universities. Immigration reform through the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952 and

subsequent amendments formalized the status of students attending U.S. institutions from abroad

by creating categories of “non-immigrant visas” permitting temporary study in the U.S. The

most common designation is the F-1 visa, which is issued to students admitted to an approved

institution of learning with the demonstration of sufficient financial support.4

         Dramatic growth in doctorate education, as well as higher education more generally,

characterized the immediate post-World War II decades in the United States. Doctorate degrees

awarded increased from less than 10,000 in 1958 to nearly 35,000 in 1973 (Figure 1). Then, after

a period of stagnation, the overall number of doctorate degrees expanded again in many fields

during the 1980s and the number of doctorates awarded by U.S. institutions climbed to an

historic peak of 42,652 in 1998. The rise in the share of degrees awarded to students born




         3
            There is a small representation of foreigners in U.S. undergraduate programs as well, with temporary
residents representing about 3% of BA recipients from U.S. institutions. The distribution of foreign undergraduate
and professional students studying in the U.S. is quite different than the distribution of students pursuing doctorate
degrees in large part because undergraduate students and students in professional programs are generally expected to
pay their own way. As the size of the U.S. college-age population fell in the late 1970s many colleges and
universities actively recruited students from foreign countries to increase revenues. A 1979 report from the
American Council on Education identified foreign students as a potentially important market for undergraduate
colleges facing declining enrollment demand with smaller high school cohorts (Maeroff, 1979).
          4
            To obtain a student visa, an individual submits a letter of admission from a university and a certificate of
eligibility issued by the school (known as form I-20) to the American embassy or consulate in the home country.
The scope of education that F visas have historically included is not limited to degree-granting colleges and
universities but also includes profit-making technical training schools and proprietary language institutes.


                                                                                                       Page 4
outside the U.S. is a distinguishing feature of the last quarter century (see Figure 1), particularly

in scientific fields.

         Changes in federal funding for science, as well as direct public support for graduate

education,5 are an important determinant of both opportunities for graduate education and the

labor market demand for PhDs. Figure 2 shows the overall trend in federal research funding to

universities; the dramatic rise from the late-1950s to the late 1960s is followed by a period of

stagnation in the 1970s, before increases in federal funding for the sciences resume in the 1980s.

         The Survey of Earned Doctorates provides a comprehensive picture of PhDs produced by

U.S. universities by country of origin from the late 1950s to the present. The Survey of Earned

Doctorates is an individual-level census of recipients of doctorates at U.S. institutions. Because

survey participation is often coupled with the formal process of degree receipt, response rates

have been quite high. When we organize these data by country of origin, we focus on the

country where an individual completed high school as this measure does not include those

immigrating to the U.S. at young ages. This method also serves to “count” individuals in the

country where they resided at young ages.6 Access to the restricted microdata files is particularly

important for the analysis that follows.



         5
            Federal support for doctoral study came in the form of fellowships to individuals as well as project
support to researchers and universities. In 1952, the National Science Foundation established the Graduate Research
Fellowship program which provided generous multi-year support for those pursuing doctorate study in the sciences
and engineering. The annual number of awards grew from about 500 in the 1950s to a peak of 1373 in 1966, with
the number of awards offered then contracting back to about 500 in the 1970s and 1980s before rising to nearly
1000 awards in the 1990s (Freeman, Chang, and Chiang, 2005). In addition, the NDEA Fellowships for graduate
study were passed by Congress in 1958 as part of broader package of legislation intended to improve funding of
education in the sciences and other areas of national need (including foreign languages), partly in response to the
launching of Sputnik.
          6
            Country of origin was defined by the country in which the respondent attended high school (“hsplace” in
the the Survey of Earned Degrees). Out of the 1.35 million observations, 88,709 (6.6%) listed no hsplace. Among
respondents in fields classified as “science and engineering”, 6.0% listed no hsplace. Since “foreign” is defined as
simply “not US”, it is possible that people who went to high school in the U.S. but listed no high school country are
classified as “foreign”. However, of all those listing no hsplace, 15% list “United States” as their country of birth
(compared with 69% of the overall), while 75% list no birthplace. Since at most 6% (and probably much less) of


                                                                                                    Page 5
         Foreign students are more heavily concentrated in the sciences than in the humanities.

Moreover, the broad area of the social sciences masks considerable diversity in representation of

foreign students, as 51% of economics doctorates hold temporary visas though only 5% of

psychology PhDs are neither citizens nor permanent residents. The variation in choice of

specialization at the undergraduate level importantly affects demand for U.S. PhD programs by

field. In Asian countries, the majority of undergraduate degrees are awarded in science and

engineering fields with a reported share of 65% for Japan and 60% for China,7 while in the U.S.

(32%) and European countries including the U.K. (35%) the share of BA degrees awarded in

science and engineering fields is appreciably smaller (Science and Engineering Indicators, 2004,

Table A2-34).

         Within science fields, the growth since the mid-1970s in doctorates awarded among those

from outside the United States is particularly striking. Figure 3 shows the trend in doctorates

awarded to U.S. residents and individuals from foreign countries in engineering, the life

sciences, the physical sciences and economics. In all but the life sciences, the foreign share now

equals or exceeds the share of PhD recipients from the U.S. With some modest differences in

timing across fields, the expansion in degrees awarded to foreign students commenced in the

mid-1970s and slowed in the mid-1990s. Summarizing the broad developments from 1980 to

1996 (the peak year in recent PhD awards to foreign students), the total number of PhDs in

science and engineering increased from 12,126 to 21,253. If we engage in the accounting

exercise of holding constant the foreign share at the 1980 level, the total expansion in doctorates



the relevant sample can be mis-classified this way, the foreign/U.S. treatment of these individuals should not
materially affect this paper’s results.
          7
            While there is no question that the scale of undergraduate education has grown very dramatically in China
in the last decade, there is evidence that some of the widely reported data on the number and share of degrees
awarded in science and engineering are overstated, counting sub-baccalaureate training in trades as engineering or
science degrees. See Gereffi, G.; V. Wadhwa, B. Rissing, R. Ong (2008) for further discussion.


                                                                                                    Page 6
awarded would have been expected to be a more modest 2,619 degrees relative to the observed

change of 9,127 doctorate degrees awarded by U.S. institutions.

         Institutional context of U.S. Universities

         Universities in the United States award more PhD degrees than those in any other

country. In 2001, the U.S. awarded 40,744 PhDs relative to 24,769 awarded by Germany,

14,210 awarded by Great Britain and 16,078 awarded by Japan. In the science and engineering

fields, the U.S. continues to dominate but by a more modest margin – with the U.S. awarding

25,509 PhDs relative to 11,803 awarded by Germany, 8,520 awarded by Great Britain, 7,401

awarded by Japan and 8,153 awarded by China (Science and Engineering Indicators, 2004,

Table A2-36). Not only do U.S. institutions award more PhD degrees than those in any other

country, but U.S. universities also dominate at the highest levels of scientific accomplishment.

At the same time, the rate of growth of doctorate education in the U.S. has lagged other counties

(particularly those in Asia) over the last decade. The average annual rate of growth in doctorates

awarded in science and engineering fields was 3.2% in the decade of the 1980s and 1.6% in the

decade of the 1990s relative to annual rates of growth in doctorate production exceeding 20% in

South Korea and Taiwan in the 1980s and China during the 1990s.8

         The U.S market for doctorate education is also highly stratified. In 2002, 413 universities

in the United States awarded doctorates, with the mean number of degrees per institution 97, and

the median number 38 degrees. Overall, production is relatively concentrated with 20

institutions awarding 27% of the 2002 total of 39,955 degrees.9 Substantial subsidies from state,


         8
           See Science and Engineering Indicators (2004, Appendix Tables 2-38 and 2-39).
         9
           While this concentration is considerable, it is appreciably less than at the start of the century. Up until the
mid-1920s, five institutions (Columbia, Harvard, Johns Hopkins, Yale and Chicago, notably all private) awarded
about one half of the annual flow of doctorates; by the 1930s, there had been some dispersion as these five
institutions awarded about one third of new doctorates (Berelson, 1960, p. 93). By 1950, there were at least 30
institutions, including many large public universities, awarding a significant number of PhD degrees annually.
Focusing on the interval between 1958 and 1972, Bowen and Rudenstine (1992) document the extraordinary growth


                                                                                                         Page 7
federal and institutional sources to research universities affect the quantity and quality of

graduate education, while the concentration of federal support at a relatively small set of

universities adds to the stratification in graduate education. The National Academy of Sciences’

rankings show the wide difference in faculty publications and research funding between the top

and bottom quartile of graduate programs.10 Stratification is apparent in outcomes as well as

funding, as high achieving scientists come from a relatively small number of graduate

institutions. Top U.S. universities are often considered leaders at an international level, resulting

in a comparative advantage in the production of doctorate education.11 That research and

doctorate education are often complementary in production further strengthens the advantage of

elite U.S. universities, contributing to potential agglomeration effects in the location of science.



Section 2. Cross-sectional distribution by country

         A. Motivation

         There is considerable cross-country variation in doctorate attainment from U.S.

institutions. Asian countries – particularly India (736), Taiwan (423), South Korea (842) and

China (2452) – accounted for more than one-half the doctorates in science awarded to those from

outside the U.S in 2003. Students from France (77), Germany (168) and Great Britain (76) were

in the number of institutions and departments operating PhD programs. In economics, the number of PhD-granting
institutions increased nearly 90% from 57 to 108 while in mathematics the number of programs increased more than
130% from 60 to 139.
          10
             To give but one example, graduate faculties in the top quartile of doctorate-granting programs in
economics averaged 36 faculty members and nearly 13 citations per faculty member relative to 17.3 faculty
members and 1.36 citations in the bottom quartile. See Research-Doctorate Programs in the United States:
Continuity and Change (1995).
          11
             At least one effort has been made to compare universities through the creation of an index including
measures such as Nobel laureates, articles in major scientific publications and citations. The result of this effort is
that 15 of the top 20, as well as 35 of the top 50, universities are in the U.S. (Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 2003).
While the strength of U.S. universities at the top of the international rankings is widely recognized, it should also be
noted that there is considerable variance as well in the quality of U.S. doctorate programs. One British observer
comparing the U.S. and the U.K. notes: “The U.S., with 4,000 institutions of higher education, probably has 50 of
the best universities in the world and undoubtedly has 500 of the worst.” (Stevens, 2004, as cited in Bowen,
Kurzweil and Tobin, 2005).


                                                                                                       Page 8
less than 3% of the foreign degree recipients. Why students from some countries are particularly

likely to pursue doctorate education in the U.S. surely depends on opportunity costs. In general,

demand for doctorate education will be lower for those students with more abundant home

country opportunities and, in turn, students from countries with relatively substantial university

systems will be unlikely to study in the U.S. unless they can attend top-tier doctorate programs.

       What matters for students potentially pursuing study in the United States is the expected

return to a U.S. PhD program relative to the best alternative in the home country. In the cross-

section, individual students in each country face a choice based on the expected benefit to

doctorate study in the U.S. and an expected return to persistence in the home country, which may

include attending graduate school in the home country or pursuing some other vocation. It

follows that the opportunity cost of pursuing a doctorate degree at a U.S. university varies among

countries of origin. Alternative options for post-baccalaureate study as well as fixed costs of

foreign study will vary by country.

       Two presumptions about graduate study in the U.S. and abroad have implications for who

comes to the U.S. for graduate study. First, expected success in home country and anticipated

benefits from graduate education in the U.S. are correlated, implying that people likely to have

high returns from graduate study in the United States are also likely to have an absolute

advantage in home country graduate education or alternative activity. Second, U.S. programs

tend to be dominant in the top tail of the international distribution of program quality.

       For countries in which forgone opportunities are close to those in the U.S. – e.g.,

countries with large and well-established university sectors -- only a select few individuals will

pursue graduate studies in the U.S. These individuals will be among those with relatively high

ability and receive admission offers from some of the best programs in the U.S. In contrast,




                                                                                       Page 9
individuals from countries with much more limited higher education systems will have fewer

opportunities for graduate study in their home countries and will be much more likely to choose

to pursue graduate study at a U.S. university. In turn, these individuals may choose to come to

the U.S. to pursue studies at programs outside the most highly ranked departments.

         Moreover, part of the return to doctorate study in the U.S. may be future access to the

U.S. labor market.12 Foreign doctorate recipients from U.S. universities may be particularly

well-positioned to find employment in the U.S. and to receive H-1B work visas for employment

in specialty occupations.13 By one estimate (Lowell, 2000), nearly one-quarter of H-1B visa

recipients have changed from foreign student status. Completion of a PhD may be particularly

important to an individual’s prospects for receiving an H visa as educational requirements are

one way for firms to document that an individual has skills that are scarce and specialized in the

application process.

         The above considerations lead to two clear predictions. First, countries with relatively

modest home country options for doctorate study will be represented in greater relative numbers

in U.S. PhD programs than countries with significant home country university options.

Secondly, the average quality of students (and the graduate programs selected) receiving PhDs in

the U.S. is inversely related to the share of a country’s potential doctorate students completing

advanced study in the U.S.


         12
             Finn (2003) estimates that about 71 percent of foreign citizens who received science/engineering
doctorates from U.S. universities in 1999 were in the United States in 2001. For those receiving degrees in 1991,
about 58 percent were still in the U.S. in 2001. The attractiveness of the transition from graduate study to
employment with an H-status visa increased with the Immigration Act of 1990 allowing H-1B visas holders to also
apply for permanent resident status, where formerly H-1B visa holders were required to declare an intention to
return to their countries of residence.
          13
             The government defines as specialty occupation as: “A specialty occupation requires theoretical and
practical application of a body of specialized knowledge along with at least a bachelor’s degree or its equivalent. For
example, architecture, engineering, mathematics, physical sciences, social sciences, medicine and health, education,
business specialties, accounting, law, theology, and the arts are specialty occupations.”

         B. Cross-country differences in doctorate degree attainment

         In the cross-section, both the level of undergraduate degree attainment in foreign

countries and the extent to which there are established doctorate-level programs in these

countries has a substantial effect on the flow of PhD students to U.S. institutions. The data in

Table 1 provide a cross-sectional picture, combining undergraduate degree production in the

early 1990s with doctorate production at the end of the decade across countries. The number of

college-age individuals in each country receiving a science and engineering BA would seem to

represent a reasonable measure of the potential demand for doctorate level graduate study in

science and engineering. In column (1) of Table 1, we report data on this number for 1990 or

the most recent available year.14 In the third column we report the undergraduate degrees in

science and engineering relative to the 24 year old population in each country (column (2)

reports all BA degrees relative to population). While there are some cross country differences,

roughly 3 to 5% of the populations of North American and Western European countries received

an undergraduate degree in science or engineering. In the early 1990s a comparable or even

somewhat larger fraction of the population in Asian countries such as Japan, Taiwan and South

Korea did so. In contrast, just over 1 % of those form India and 0.6% of those from China

received a science and engineering BA, reflecting relatively low overall levels of undergraduate

degree attainment in these countries. Much of this observed difference across countries in the

representation of science and engineering BA degree recipients is representative of the scale of

higher education; in countries where only a small fraction of the population receives a BA degree




         14
            Note that these numbers would not be qualitatively different if we were to include BA degrees received
at U.S. institutions by foreign students. Particularly for countries sending large numbers of students to the U.S. for
graduate study, the proportion of PhD recipients who also received BA degrees from a U.S. institution was 4% for
those from India and less than 2% for those from China measured over the last 15 years.


                                                                                                     Page 11
(Column (2)), it follows that the overall number of science and engineering BA recipients will be

limited.15

         A second measure of the development of the higher education sector within a country is

the size of the doctorate granting sector of higher education – both in an absolute sense and

relative to the BA sector. Column (4) of Table 1 shows the number of PhDs awarded in each of

the listed countries.16 Column (5) presents the number of individuals from the country in

question receiving a Science or Engineering PhD from a U.S. institution. In the case of most of

the countries listed in the table somewhere between 5 to 10 % of college graduates in the

sciences and engineering go on to get a PhD, though the fraction of those awarded a PhD from a

U.S. institution varies dramatically.17

         A clear hypothesis is that countries with low domestic PhD production relative to

undergraduate degrees awarded and relatively less developed higher education systems will be

among those most likely to send PhD students to the United States. Columns (6) and (7) in

Table 1 underscore this point clearly, as European countries with long traditions in higher

education send relatively few students to the U.S. while Asian countries are much more likely to

send students to the U.S. to pursue PhD studies.18 In short, the international representation of



         15
            Nevertheless, there are large differences across countries in the relative share of degrees awarded in the
sciences. For example, less than one fifth of U.S. undergraduate degrees are awarded in science and engineering
fields while about one half of degrees in China are awarded in science and engineering fields. The United States – as
well as other countries with substantial service sectors – educates many people at the baccalaureate level in
professional fields such as accounting and business which are unlikely to provide the preparation for the pursuit of a
PhD degree in science.
         16
             In the cases where this is possible --the US, the UK, Germany, France and Japan -- we have netted out
foreigners obtaining a PhD in the country in question. In all other cases, the data refer to the total number of PhDs
granted, irrespective of whether the individual is or is not a foreigner
         17
            The, largely Asian, countries in Table 1 that send significant numbers of students to the U.S. to receive
their Ph.D.’s also send students to Canada, Australia and several European countries. For these countries, the
numbers in Table 1, to some extent, underestimates the total number of individuals from these countries receiving
PhD’s in the sciences.
         18
            Empirical verification of this point is provided by consideration of the correlation between measures of
U.S. PhD production and home-country BA degrees awarded. Using available data, there is a negative (-.2)


                                                                                                    Page 12
students in U.S. doctorate education depends appreciably on home country undergraduate and

graduate options.

         When we focus on top-ranked programs in the United States, the distribution of PhD

recipients by country of origin is much different than when the focus on PhD recipients in

aggregate.19 Students from European countries are represented in far greater proportions among

top institutions than in the overall pool of doctorate recipients. Moreover, within each country of

origin, countries that send a relatively high fraction of potential doctorates to the U.S. for training

have relatively lower concentrations of PhD recipients among the top-ranked U.S. programs.

        Table 2 presents these data on the proportion of a country’s PhD recipients receiving

degrees from top-5 programs and shows the distribution of degrees by country awarded by the

most highly ranked programs. What is clear is that for a number of Asian countries – notably

Taiwan, South Korea, and China – PhD recipients in science are underrepresented in the top-5

departments and are much less likely to receive their degrees from these programs than PhD

recipients from the U.S. in these fields. For example, while students from China are about

15.5% of all chemistry PhDs, they are only 5.3% of degree recipients from top-5 programs. At

the other extreme, students from Canada and European countries tend to be represented in the top

programs in shares in excess of their overall representation among PhD recipients from U.S.

universities.

        Countries that send a relatively high fraction of students to unranked or low ranked PhD

programs are those where home countries opportunities for graduate study in the sciences are

correlation between the ratio of PhDs awarded in the US and the ratio of BA degrees to population, indicating that
countries with relatively well–developed university systems rely less on U.S. institutions for PhD production.
          19
             We use the rankings at the discipline level assembled by the National Academy of Sciences at a point in
time in the early 1990s. While there have been some changes over time in rankings, there have been few large
movements (mobility from unranked to top 5) over the last three decades. See: Research-Doctorate Programs in the
United States: Continuity and Change, National Research Council, National Academy of Sciences, Washington,
D.C. 1995. It is, of course, true that there are changes in the relative rank of PhD programs over time; yet, these
changes tend to be modest relative to the overall correlation between rankings done in various years.


                                                                                                  Page 13
quite limited. Put somewhat differently, these data are indicative of the quality of “home

country” PhD programs; for countries like Canada where PhD recipients from U.S. institutions

are concentrated in relatively high quality institutions, the quality of home country PhD options

is relatively high. A related explanation is that the countries with the highest relative

representation among top programs in the U.S. are those countries where there is considerable

existing research exchange among scholars in the U.S. and abroad, providing a natural network

linking students from foreign universities to graduate study in the U.S.



Section 3. Growth in Foreign Share over Time

       The growth in the representation of foreign students among doctorate recipients from

U.S. universities captures changes on both sides of the market for graduate education. In

particular, the growth reflects some combination of the following circumstances: 1) shifts in

demand for graduate study among foreign born arising from changes in the sending country, 2)

shifts in demand arising from changes in institutions that affect the “costs” of matching students

with U.S. graduate programs, including the development of international networks, and 3)

adjustments in the supply-side or offerings of U.S. universities that differentially affect foreign

students.

       The forces affecting the representation of foreign students in U.S. doctorate education are

presented through a basic supply-demand framework. “Demand shocks” generated by increases

in the number of undergraduates (potentially) prepared for graduate study from abroad are one

dimension of change. Those countries with relatively high BA growth might be expected to

expand in the share of PhDs received from U.S. institutions. Growth in the size of cohorts

prepared for graduate study (for simplicity, those with the BA) is the most obvious type of




                                                                                      Page 14
demand shift varying across countries. Such shifts may include growth in the fraction of college

graduates or shifts in cohort size, varying in magnitude and timing across countries. Over the

course of the last half century, a number of political transformations such as the fall of

communism in the Soviet bloc or the normalization of relations with China have dramatically

altered the demand for graduate study in the U.S. among foreign students.

       Beyond changes in the number of students prepared for graduate work in a country, a

related change in demand comes from the development of networks that reduce the costs of

foreign study. Following dynamic models similar to the Carrington et al. (1996) of the South-

North migration of blacks in the first half of the 20th century, successful experiences of initial

migrants lead to dramatic reductions in information costs among those in later cohorts. Students

from specific regions or foreign universities may establish links with U.S. programs; in turn,

U.S. universities may use past experience in recruiting and selecting students. Such network

effects have the long term result of increasing the relative benefits of pursuing doctorate study

and the share of students from abroad pursuing graduate study in the U.S. By lowering the costs

and increasing the value of graduate education in the U.S., such networks serve to shift the

demand for graduate education in the U.S.

       The supply-side of the U.S. market for graduate education is by no means fixed over

time. Because doctorate-level students do not pay full tuition for their studies, the availability of

opportunities is likely to be determined by research funding and other institutional sources of

support, including state funding and demand for teaching assistants. These sources of support

have varied over time, with federal funding for science stagnant from the 1970s through the mid-

1980s. Then, beginning in the mid 1980s, there were quite substantial increases in federal

research funding to colleges and universities in both the physical sciences and the health




                                                                                      Page 15
sciences. As a result, we expect supply shocks affect the doctorate education market. Increases

in research funding or direct public support for graduate programs in the U.S. have the effect of

increasing the number of opportunities for study in U.S. graduate programs. If the elasticity of

demand for graduate study among those from abroad is greater than for the U.S. (perhaps

because the opportunity cost is study in another country rather than a different career), funding

shifts will yield relatively larger responses in degree attainment among foreign students,

resulting in increasing share with positive shocks and decreasing share with adverse shocks.

       When the fraction of a country’s potential doctorate students choosing to study in the

U.S. is initially small (or when there is excess demand among foreign students for U.S.

programs), expansions in U.S. opportunities could plausibly have proportionately larger effects

on the number of individuals pursuing a degree in the U.S. than when the share pursuing degrees

is already quite large. A second explanation is that when foreigners considering studying in the

U.S. have alternatives that are close substitutes (e.g., studying in Australia) elasticity of demand

will be much higher. For those from the U.S., the alternative to pursuing a PhD at a U.S.

university is unlikely to be a close substitute, demand will likely be more inelastic, and the

change in graduate study in response to a supply shock somewhat more limited.

       Evidence on changes in the share of foreign PhDs

       A starting point for understanding the dynamic in the variation in the representation of

foreign students among U.S. doctorate recipients is to examine how country and field specific

patterns differ from overall trends, which are presumably a function of secular changes. Table 3

illustrates country and field of PhD degree receipt relative to total degrees awarded by U.S.

universities at the start of each decade and during the peak 1994-96 interval. In terms of growth

rates, PhD receipt for U.S. residents has lagged overall university doctorate production,




                                                                                      Page 16
particularly since about 1980 (refer back to Figures 1 and 3). For foreign countries, several

“regimes” are apparent. Canada, as well as the U.K., represent one case where degrees awarded

by U.S. institutions largely echo the overall trend. South Korea, India (except in engineering),

China and Germany are cases where PhDs awarded by U.S. universities to students from these

countries far outstrip the secular trend through much of the 1980s.

        Doctorate Program Quality

        Expansion in doctorate attainment at U.S. institutions among foreign students is not

uniform among differently ranked graduate programs and, indeed, much of the growth recorded

from the mid-1980s to the mid-1990s occurred at PhD programs outside the most highly-ranked.

Figure 4 shows doctorates awarded to foreign students by rank of program. In physics,

biochemistry, and chemistry much of the expansion in doctorate receipt to foreign students

occurs at unranked programs or those ranked outside the top-50; while the growth in foreign

students is distributed more evenly among programs. Among students from China, Taiwan and

South Korea growth has been particularly concentrated outside the most highly ranked

institutions.

         Demand changes at the country level

        A basic proposition is that growth in undergraduate degree attainment is likely to

translate to increases in the overall demand for doctorate-level training and, specifically, growth

in the number of students pursuing PhDs at U.S. institutions. Figure 5 illustrates the time-trend

in BA degree attainment in the sciences by country relative to the U.S. The top two panels of

Figure 5 show the growth of undergraduate degrees relative to the base year of 1975 for

European (and Canada) countries and Asian countries, respectively, and the final panel shows

the number of degrees awarded by year in China. The top panel, which illustrates relative BA




                                                                                     Page 17
attainment for North American and European countries, shows near parity among countries from

the 1976 BA year through 1985. Then, there is retrenchment in the number of BA degrees

awarded in the US (and to a lesser extent the UK) as birth cohorts shrank markedly in subsequent

years. In the other countries in this panel, degree attainment continues to rise into the 1990s,

reflecting somewhat different demographic trends and net increases in collegiate attainment

within cohorts.

       The trends in North American and European countries are quite modest when seen in

comparison to changes BA degree receipt among Asian countries (second panel). Most

dramatically, BA degrees awarded in Korea grew by about 150% over the period shown in the

graph. Both India and Taiwan witness considerable growth in BA degree attainment during the

years in which BA degrees awarded in the U.S were stagnant. The most dramatic story,

however, is the case of China, with the number of science and engineering degrees shown in the

bottom panel. Although consistent data on the number of science and engineering degrees are

difficult to piece together for China until the mid-1980s, undergraduate degree attainment has

risen meteorically over the past quarter century in China, rising from near zero in the mid-1970s

to more than 330,000 BA degrees in science and engineering fields at the start of the 21st

century.

       What the trends in undergraduate degrees by country suggest is that those countries with

growth relative to the U.S. at the undergraduate level may translate to increased demand for

doctorate education from U.S. institutions. Figure 6 illustrates this point in a general sense, with

the annual rate of growth in BA degrees on the x axis and the annual rate of growth in PhDs

awarded by U.S. universities (7 years later) on the y-axis. While the link is by no means exact –

with some countries well above and below unity – the relationship is clearly positive. What is




                                                                                      Page 18
more, the figure makes clear the variation in the expansion of undergraduate degree attainment

across countries. At one extreme, the U.S., U.K., and Japan hover at growth below 2 percent

while South Korea evidences growth in BA attainment over 10%. China – as we discuss shortly

– is a case that is literally “off the chart” in terms of the growth in PhDs awarded between 1982

and 1992.

       That there are a number of countries such as Germany, Italy and India where the growth

in PhDs awarded by U.S. institutions outstrips the home country growth in BA degree receipt

suggests that growth in undergraduate degree production is but one factor determining the rise in

the representation of foreign students among doctorate recipients from U.S. universities. We

note that the growth in the presence of students from Germany and Italy in U.S. PhD programs

reflects ‘catching up’ to other European countries in U.S. doctorate receipt. We also suspect that

dramatic growth in PhD programs in Korea and Taiwan over the last decade (see Table 1) may

have recently begun to have an effect on the relative attractiveness of U.S. PhD programs for

students from these countries.

       While it would be hard, if not impossible, to quantify the importance of the growth of

networks for explaining the growing representation for foreigners in U.S. PhD programs,

anecdotal evidence points to their importance. Repeatedly we have been told of cases where

someone from, for example, Italy was encouraged to seek graduate education outside of Italy by

a professor who, himself, had been trained in the U.S. We also find the students from particular

countries tend to be over represented in particular PhD programs. Thus, for example, in

economics, Italians are over represented at MIT, Columbia and NYU, while students from India

are underrepresented at Harvard and over represented at Rochester, Columbia, Boston University

and Cornell. In contrast, in physics, Italians are again overrepresented at MIT, while students




                                                                                    Page 19
from India are overrepresented at Ohio, Stony Brook, Maryland, Rochester and Texas. Such

patterns are consistent with the importance of department and institution specific networks.



       Country-specific shocks

       Beyond gradual changes in the demand for U.S. doctorate training generated by

expansion in home-country BA production among countries with long-standing diplomatic and

trade ties with the United States, political shifts produce sharp changes foreign students’ access

to the U.S. education market. Two of the most dramatic examples include the entry to the U.S.

of PhD students from China in the early 1980s and the dramatic decline in the flow of PhD

students from Iran in the late 1970s. Figure 7 illustrates these transformations for China and

Iran. Representing the data by year of birth (in the right panels of figure 7) shows clearly the

cohort specific effects which tend to be somewhat attenuated when the data are arranged by year

of PhD given the natural variation in time to degree.

       China

       China represents the most extreme case. In the first part of the twentieth century there

was relatively extensive exchange between the U.S. and Chinese universities, with many of

China’s leading scientists trained in the U.S. Exchange with western universities changed

dramatically at mid-century. During Mao’s “Cultural Revolution” from 1966 to 1976 university

activity was largely disrupted. The establishment of diplomatic relations with the United States

in 1979 dramatically changed the level of educational exchange with China. China sought to

jump start its development process through access to science and engineering technology through

U.S. university education and, at least initially, most students and scholars visiting the U.S. from

China came on J or exchange visas. A disproportionate share of the first wave of exchange




                                                                                     Page 20
students coming to the U.S. were related to high-level Chinese officials, including the son of

Deng Xiaoping and the son of the Foreign Minister (Wong, 1981), though there was also

considerable competition among U.S. universities to identify the most talented among the

Chinese students.

        The establishment of networks early on was particularly important in opening doctorate

education. One important example was the China-United States Physics Examination and

Application (CUSPEA) program initiated in the fall of 1979 by the Chinese-American Nobel

Laureate physicist T.D. Lee of Columbia University. The intent of the initiative was to identify

gifted graduate students through examination in China and to place these students at U.S.

universities. During the course of the program from CUSPEA placed more than 900 students in

physics programs at U.S. universities.20

        When we look at the data for China organized by year of birth or year of college entry,

the cohorts born in 1962-63 and entering college in 1978 are extraordinary in representation

among U.S. PhD recipients in the sciences. These cohorts captured considerable pent up demand

for undergraduate education and represented the first full class of students admitted to Chinese

universities by competitive examination in the aftermath of the Cultural Revolution. Add to this

strong encouragement from the government to study abroad combined with relatively few

domestic opportunities, many students from this cohort received PhDs from U.S. universities.

To illustrate the unusual impact of this single cohort, we note that of the PhD degrees awarded to

students from China in the decade between 1985 and 1994, 46.6% of the 11,197 PhDs awarded




        20
           To put these numbers in perspective, the total number of PhD degree recipients from China receiving
degrees in physics between 1980 and 1992 was 1062. Of course, there were other channels through which Chinese
students could study physics in the U.S., but the CUSPEA program clearly had a substantial impact in generating a
network or link between leading U.S. and Chinese universities.


                                                                                                 Page 21
to students from China had started college in 1978. What is more, if one eliminates this cohort

the “downturn” in degrees awarded to students from China after 1995 virtually disappears.

         Iran

         While the case of students from China over the course of the last two decades is one of

increased involvement with U.S. universities, Iran represents a counterexample. In the late

1960s and early 1970s, Iranian doctorate attainment – particularly in engineering – rose rapidly,

reflecting movements of the country to modernize and improve technological infrastructure,

particularly in relation to the petroleum industry.21 The political upheaval associated with the

fall of the Shah in January 1979 and the hostage crisis at the American embassy in Tehran in

1979 brought an abrupt halt to the substantial participation of Iranian students in U.S. graduate

education. While entry of graduate students stopped largely after 1979, it is plain that many

students of Iranian origin chose to stay in the U.S. to finish their graduate studies. What is

apparent in Figure 7 is the sharp drop-off in degree attainment by birth cohort and the more

gradual decline by year of degree receipt.

         Eastern Europe and Former Soviet Union

         In the years before 1989, barely a trickle of students from the Soviet Union completed

doctorate degrees in the United States, with most of those students likely related to political

émigrés. Then, perestroika in the Gorbachev years initiated modest exchange of graduate


         21
            In Iran, the oil boom of the early seventies brought a half a dozen new universities and an increased
premium on western-trained academics (Pace, New York Times, 1976). In addition, many relatively affluent Iranian
families paid to send their children to U.S. universities and, by one estimate, as many as 50,000 Iranian students
were attending educational institutions in the U.S. before the fall of the Shah, accounting for one-fifth of the foreign
student population in 1979. With the crisis following the Iranian revolution in the U.S., Iranian students were
severely limited in their capacity to finance studies in the U.S. and student visas were unattainable as diplomatic
relations ceased. At the extreme, institutions like the University of Southern California had as many as 1,000
students from Iran. While many universities were able to make accommodations fro Iranian students, it was the
small colleges that suffered financial setbacks with the political shock. For example, the small Windham College in
Vermont depended on Iranians for 30% of its enrollment and went out of business when these students were unable
to make tuition payments (Hechinger, 1979).


                                                                                                      Page 22
students and scholars (Chronicle of Higher Education, October 11, 1989). But the collapse of

the former Soviet Union also led to significant declines among the traditional Soviet universities,

which had long standing strengths in the physical sciences and had been generously supported by

the government during the Cold War. By one estimate, funding for science in Russia declined

44.2% between 1989 and1991 (Shkolnikov, 1995). The result was an exodus of scholars and

graduate students to the United States and universities in Europe and Israel. In the Eastern

European countries of Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, Romania, Hungary and Poland, there are

similar shifts in the flow of doctorates students to the U.S. corresponding to political transitions

of the late 1980s and early 1990s.

         In summarizing the country-specific trends in doctorate attainment at U.S. universities, it

is clear that both secular growth in home country undergraduate education and the sharp changes

produced by political transformations in countries like China affect the representation of foreign

students at U.S. universities. It is also the case – if somewhat more difficult to measure directly

– that the establishment of networks providing information about U.S. universities and

opportunities builds the floor of foreign students to U.S. universities. Yet, the flow of students to

U.S. doctorate programs need not reflect a permanent exodus of the highly skilled from the

sending country to the U.S. (what is sometimes described as “brain drain”); there is clear

evidence that the initial flows following political transitions capture considerable “pent up

demand” which subsides, particularly with investment in home-country universities (Blanchard,

Bound, and Turner, 2008).22

Section 4. Stagnation in degree receipt among U.S. students

       While funding for science at U.S. universities has increased in the last two decades, the

number of PhDs in the sciences awarded to students from the U.S. has been largely stagnant over

the last two decades, falling somewhat in economics and rising only modestly in the life

sciences. The number of PhDs awarded to those from the U.S. in 2003 in the physical sciences,

engineering, and economics remains below corresponding numbers from 1970. How do we

explain the relatively anemic participation of students from the U.S. in doctorate level science?

       Undergraduate degree attainment in the U.S.

        As we indicated before (Figure 5), the growth in the number of individuals receiving

undergraduate degrees in the sciences has been quite muted in the US. Change in cohort size

plays a central role in these trends. In the U.S., the size of the college-age population (and, by

extension the broad pool of potential PhD recipients) grew rapidly with the college entry of the

baby-boom cohorts, peaked in the mid-1970s, and then declined through the early 1990s. Thus,

despite the fact that the fraction of cohorts obtaining undergraduate degrees in science and

engineering during the 1980s and early 1990s rose at an average rate of 2 % per year, the number

of science and engineering BA’s hardly rose at all. As Figure 6 suggests, the growth in the

number of science and engineering PhDs being granted to U.S. residents is in line with the

growth in the number of BAs awarded in science and engineering fields in the U.S. Indeed,

Figure 6 would suggest that the slow growth in the number of Science and Engineering BAs

being awarded in the U.S, relative the growth in other countries can go a long way towards

explaining the drop in the U.S. share of science and engineering PhDs in the country.

       Beyond overall changes in undergraduate degree attainment, the progression from

baccalaureate attainment to PhD completion has varied appreciably over the last four decades.




                                                                                      Page 24
The ratio of PhD receipt to BA receipt organized by year of BA rose during the early 1960s, fell

through the 1970s and has subsequently maintained a plateau. This ratio peaked at 0.056 in 1964

and had fallen to about 0.025 percent by 1974. Figure 8 makes this presentation at the level of

field of study, aligning PhDs by the year in which individuals received BA degrees in relation to

the number of BA degrees awarded in a given year. While the number of PhDs awarded in these

sciences and engineering fields rose over the 1980s and early 1990s (Figure 3), the ratio of PhDs

to BAs did not change appreciably for those completing their undergraduate work (and

potentially considering graduate study) in the 1980s.

       The growth of foreign students among overall PhD recipients and PhD recipients from

U.S. institutions affects the flow of potential U.S. doctorate students through two potential

channels. First, U.S. students may face increased competition for “slots” or admission to the

most highly ranked programs, which typically have considerable excess demand. Second,

beyond potential “crowd out” effects in higher education, the overall growth in the number of

foreign doctorates (both those who obtained their degrees in the US and those who migrated after

receiving their degrees) is likely to have had a substantial effect on the labor market returns to

PhD awards in science (Bound and Turner, 2006).

       Direct Crowd Out of U.S. Students by Foreign Students

       An important question is how changes in demand for U.S. doctorate education from

foreign students affect the level and distribution of doctorate attainment among U.S. students.

Changes in the rate at which U.S. students complete PhD programs may reflect both student

demand and the availability of opportunities in graduate programs. It is surely possible that, with

a limited supply of places in graduate programs, the presence of foreign students may change




                                                                                      Page 25
opportunities for U.S. born students, potentially initiating “crowd out” at the doctorate level.23 It

is hard to estimate the counter-factual of how large the growth of PhD programs would have

been in the absence of this substantial inflow of foreign students. Some “crowd out” – with

foreign students lowering degree attainment among U.S. residents is likely to follow as U.S.

students become less likely to receive admission offers from the top programs and expansion in

the total number of degrees awarded reduces expected wages. Yet, estimates of “crowd out” are

inherently difficult to estimate because it is necessary to separate increases in demand among

foreign students from other factors such as funding shocks which would lead to increases in scale

of graduate programs.

         The magnitude of crowd out effects ultimately depends on the elasticity of supply in U.S.

doctorate programs. We suspect that at least in the short run, additional foreign students reduce

the number of U.S. students 1:1 in the most highly ranked programs where nearly all students

enter with full funding and class size is essentially fixed. Somewhat further down the

distribution of program quality, programs appear to be much more elastic in scale. Indeed, for

the programs that are unranked or ranked very modestly, the period of growth in the 1960s and

early 1970s represented both expansion in scale and the entry of new programs; the entry of new

programs in this category was extraordinary, with a threefold increase in the primary science

fields. As the market contracted in the 1970s and then expanded in the 1980s, the adjustment




         23
            Some previous research attempts to estimate the extent to which foreign graduate students tend to crowd
out U.S. students. In general, there is little conclusive evidence to support substantial crowd-out effects. Using data
from the Survey of Graduate Students and Postdocs and variation within academic departments, Regets (2001) finds
a largely positive association between enrollment of U.S. students and foreign students. Borjas (2007) uses within
institution variation in graduate student enrollment measured in the IPEDS surveys and finds a negative effect of
foreign enrollment on the level of enrollment of white men, though little effect on domestic enrollment in aggregate.
This previous research is limited to the extent that increases in the representation of foreign students in U.S.
graduate programs may well be endogenously related to other factors such as the availability of funding
simultaneously affecting the demand for graduate students.


                                                                                                     Page 26
came in terms of the scale of programs, with apparently few programs either exiting or entering

the market.

       The case of the sharp increase in demand among Chinese graduate students beginning in

the early 1980s presents a clear opportunity to assess the adjustment of the U.S. market to a

sharp demand shock. Figure 9 illustrates using the example of the field of physics with the data

on doctorates awarded by year of graduate school entry, which makes the magnitude of the

change among the Chinese students all the more striking. At top ranked programs, the number of

additional students from China is small and there is little discernable change in the overall

number of PhDs awarded. At the other extreme (bottom right panel), the number of Chinese

students receiving PhDs from universities outside the top-50 increased from 7 to 202 between the

1980 year of graduate entry and the 1985 year of graduate school entry. Notably, this large

“shock” produced no notable decline in PhDs awarded to U.S. students at these institutions, with

this number actually rising slightly from 164 to 199, while the number of students from other

countries receiving PhDs also rose over this interval of graduate school entry. Data for other

fields show similar patterns. Remarkably, this large cohort of Chinese students had no

discernable impact on the number of U.S., or for that matter, other foreign students receiving

PhDs in the sciences.

       We found this evidence that the large influx of Chinese students in the early 1980s

seemed to have no noticeable crowd out effects surprising. We suspect a combination of factors

may have been at work. This was a period of time in which funding for the sciences in general

and the physical sciences in particular, was expanding rapidly. One senior physicist described

how the influx of Chinese students at his research university met a need and allowed the

department to expand, as funding for physics remained glowing in the 1980s with the persistence




                                                                                     Page 27
of Cold War federal funding. At the same time the number of undergraduates from the U.S.

obtaining degrees in the physical and life sciences was stagnate or declining and the size of

college age population in the U.S. was declining.24 Thus, the capacity for U.S. graduate

programs to expand rapidly had they relied on U.S. students might have been quite limited.

Thus, it is unclear whether under different circumstances a similar demand shock would work in

the same way (i.e. have no impact on other groups).25 With this in mind we did similar analyses

using data from the former Soviet Union and Iran. Unfortunately, these shocks were not large

enough for them to provide useful information with respect to crowd out. Our analysis suggests

that substantial changes in the doctorate study of foreign students have not led to direct crowd

out of the best and brightest U.S. students in top programs, as much of the expansion in study

among students from abroad has come in less highly ranked programs.

         The Opportunity Cost of PhD Attainment for U.S. Students

         Examination of the trends in the labor market rewards for PhD scientists in the U.S.

relative to other high-skill workers over the last quarter century suggests that the relative returns

to advanced study in the sciences have not increased.26 Earnings of those early-career advanced

degrees in the sciences have actually decreased in relation to the earnings of other college-

educated workers, with the latter having risen overall in the last two decades as is well-known.

         24
             Note that the decline in the number of science and engineering BA degree recipients is largely a
reflection of the decline in cohort size from its peek in the late 1970s.
          25
             It is worth also considering whether the absence of crowd that we see among doctorate recipients would
also be apparent if we were able to examine first-year enrollment by country of origin over a long horizon. One
hypothesis is that the new foreign students – particularly in the case of the Chinese – replaced relatively weak
domestic students, many of whom might have been expected to bow out of doctorate programs with MA degrees
after experiencing difficulties at the stage or qualifying or preliminary exams. Because the entering Chinese
students were often extremely well technically prepared, the examinations in early stages of graduate study were less
likely to be substantial hurdles to completion.
          26
             Our data on the earnings of early career advanced degree recipients in the sciences come from two
sources, which tell similar stories. First, the Survey of Doctorate Recipients is a stratified random sample of PhD
recipients from U.S. universities across potential cohorts and provides earnings observations in odd years from 1973
to 2001, with data from the precursor National Register of Scientific and Technical Personnel providing evidence
from 1958 to 1970. In addition, the Faculty Salary Survey series provides salaries by field and rank for public
universities.


                                                                                                   Page 28
       Before turning to the earnings evidence, an important structural shift in the expected

career paths of advanced degree recipients in science and engineering fields is the increasing

reliance and expectation for post-doc appointments. Freeman, Weinstein, Marincola, and

Solomon (2001) note that the time between graduate school entry and completion of training in

the life sciences has increased from less than 10 years in 1970s to over 11.8 years in the 1990s,

largely reflecting the increased expectation of post-doctorate appointments and the extended

duration of these appointments. Similarly, National Science Foundation data show a dramatic

increase in the number of PhDs holding post-doctorate appointments in university departments of

science and engineering between 1981 and 1998, rising from approximately 18,000 to 39,000.

Relatively low wages associated with post-doc appointments combined with the increased

uncertainty about permanent employment prospects detract from some of the attractive features

of investment in doctorate level training and careers in the sciences. Further, it may be that

beyond the decline in relative earnings associated with science and engineering, these careers

may be particularly unattractive given the long hours and difficulties in accommodating two-

career families in university labor markets.

       The labor market provides considerable clues in understanding why there has not been a

larger response among U.S. students to opportunities for doctorate study. Figure 10 shows the

trends in salaries by field for those within ten years of doctorate receipt, from 1973 to the

present. The dashed line represents the corresponding trend for BA recipients (ages 25-34) more

generally, calculated from the CPS. To be sure, real earnings of doctorate level scientists have

increased over the last decade. Yet, as indicated by the dashed line to the field-specific series,

the increases in the earnings of scientists have risen less rapidly than BA recipients more

generally, with the exception of the physical sciences where the changes are near equal.




                                                                                      Page 29
       Focusing just on faculty labor markets, the rate of growth for young academics in the

sciences has lagged that realized by college educated workers. Examining faculty salaries at

public institutions by rank and field in all of the broad science fields, the average annual rate of

growth in academic salaries is less than 2% in both the 1980s and the 1990s, based on data from

the Faculty Salary Survey (Oklahoma State University, various years). In comparison, the rate

of grown in real earnings across all young workers with a BA degree was about 2.6% from 1994

to 2003.27 In effect, scientists employed in academics have done less well than college-educated

workers more generally in the last decade.

       Moreover, there is some evidence that there have been changes in the profile of academic

salaries by rank over the course of the last three decades. The ratio of earnings of junior faculty

to senior faculty has decreased over time, with the ratio of assistant to full salaries in the physical

sciences falling from .62 in 1974-1975 to .57 in 2003-04 and the ratio of assistant to full salaries

in the physical sciences falling from .69 in 1974-1975 to .59 in 2003-04 in the life sciences based

on data from the Faculty Salary Survey. [Economics is an exception, presumably as the non-

academic market remains strong in economics, with the ratio of junior to senior faculty salaries

holding roughly constant over the interval.] Because reaching full professor is not guaranteed,

this shift works to reduce incentives to enter science as rewards appear to have become more

concentrated toward the senior level.

       What is striking is that growth in the earnings of new advanced degree recipients in

science and engineering fields in the last two decades is muted relative to the overall market for

college-educated workers. In contrast, during the scientific boom years of the late 1950s and the

early 1960s, the increases in the salaries of scientists with advanced degrees tended to outstrip


       27
            This rate of growth in earnings is yet larger if the comparison group is advanced degree recipients in the
CPS.


                                                                                                     Page 30
overall changes in earnings of college graduates (see Table 4 as well as Freeman (1975)). It

seems likely that other factors in addition to the rise in relative salaries were increasing the

demand for graduate education during the 1950s and 60s. Academic jobs were relatively

plentiful in this period owing to the expansion of undergraduate education through the early

1970s and the federal government continued to provide substantial resources for the funding of

scientific research. Moreover, the availability of student deferments provided an incentive for

men to enter graduate school and persist toward the PhD as a means to avoid military service in

the late 1960s.28

         Suggested by this comparison is a case that there has been a structural change in the labor

market for those with advanced degrees in science and engineering. Where there were once only

a modest number of potential students from foreign countries there are now, literally, thousands

of potential students from countries like China. The resulting shift in the demand for U.S.

doctorate programs over the last quarter century is surely central to the rising representation of

foreign students among doctorate recipients from U.S. institutions. In turn, funding shocks (refer

back to Figure 2) in the sciences appear are accommodated by foreign students as well as U.S.

students, leading to much smaller changes in the wages of scientists and engineers in recent years

relative to the 1950s and 1960s.

          Analysis of the science and engineering labor market of the 1960s and 1970s found

considerable empirical support for cob-web cycles in the labor market, with changes in labor


         28
            For cohorts graduating from college in the early 1960s, the availability of 2-S deferments from military
service for graduate study encouraged many students to seek out doctorate programs as a refuge from the risk of the
draft. Then, in 1967, the provision allowing exemption for graduate study was eliminated. Under the Selective
Service Act of 1967, which became effective June 30, 1967 and Executive Order 11360, there would be a one-year
grace period through the end of academic year 1967-1968 and then no more 2-S deferments would be granted to
graduate students (except as specifically written into the law). Support for the proposition that the incentive to avoid
military service inflated doctorate enrollment and attainment during this period is provided by the much larger
relative decline in the progression of men relative to women into graduate education (Bowen, Turner, and Witte;
1992).


                                                                                                     Page 31
market demand resulting in sharp fluctuations in wages. Boom periods led to substantial

increases in the returns to science, where declines in funding brought about sharp downturns,

resulting from the relative inelastic supply of scientific labor associated with the long time lag to

doctorate production (see, for example, Blank and Stigler, 1957 and Freeman, 1975). Yet,

funding changes for science in the 1980s and 1990s did not lead to sharp increases in wages for

scientists.

         One explanation is that the labor market drew in lots of foreign-trained scientists, in

addition to retaining a number of foreign students educated in the U.S., resulting in few

incentives for U.S. students to change investments in scientific training. Many foreign-born

workers among the highly skilled enter the U.S. having completed graduate study abroad.

Indeed, a substantial number of foreigners first enter the U.S. as post doctoral scholars (National

Academy of Sciences, 2005).29 According to the 2000 Census, close to 20% of foreign born

PhDs in the U.S. had immigrated within the last four years, too short a time to obtain a PhD.

         Where the supply of those trained at the highest level in science and engineering

disciplines in the United States might have accurately been described as inelastic in the short-run

during the 1960s, this structural feature of the science and engineering labor market appears to

have eroded.30 As such, our hypothesis is that the science and engineering labor market is much

more internationally integrated now than three decades ago. The result is that changes in the

labor demand for scientists are much more likely to be accommodated in the near term. The


         29
            Data presented in a recent National Academy of Sciences report showed that of the 60 percent of
academic postdocs who hold temporary visas, about 80 percent have non-U.S. doctorates (p. 35), implying that
about one-half of all U.S. postdocs in academic institutions have PhD degrees from abroad.
         30
            The detailed evidence on the earnings of those in faculty position in the sciences and PhD recipients
employed in the U.S. makes clear that this group of workers did not capture the rents to increases in federal funding
for sciences in the last two decades as suggested by Goolsbee (1998). Instead, we believe the measures employed in
this analysis capture essentially the secular changes in wages to the college-educated in this period (which, in turn,
are correlated with science funding) rather than the effect of federal funding on the earnings of advanced degree
recipients in science and engineering fields relative to other college-educated workers.


                                                                                                    Page 32
decision to stay in the U.S. by those from other countries receiving PhDs from U.S. institutions is

one mechanism for adjustment. In addition, the U.S. remains a “net importer” of doctorate

degree recipients from other countries, which can be seen in the comparison of the number of

doctorates awarded by U.S. institutions by country and year of birth and the representation of

doctorate recipients by country in the decennial Census files.



Section 5. Conclusions and Discussion

       An undisputed empirical point is that there has been a dramatic rise in the share of

doctorate degrees awarded by U.S. institutions to students from other countries. How do we

explain the determinants of this change and the resulting variation in the countries of origin of

these doctorate recipients in science and engineering fields? There is no single explanation for

this quite dramatic change. And, perhaps more significantly, there is considerable variation

across countries in the magnitude of the change in U.S. doctorate receipt and the underlying

causal forces.

       A substantial part of the increased representation in foreign students can be explained in

terms of growth in the demand for U.S. PhD programs generated by the expansion of

undergraduate degree attainment in countries like South Korea with relatively modest university

systems (particularly as they existed two decades ago). Changes in political circumstances – as

with the cases of China and the former Soviet Union – also produce sharp changes in the flow of

doctorate students to the U.S. university system. With substantial differences in home country

opportunities, it is natural that students from countries where options are more limited will be

distributed at a broader range of institutions (and less concentrated at the highest quality

programs) than students from countries where opportunities are closer to those found in the U.S.




                                                                                      Page 33
       Still, increases in demand for doctorate study among foreign students cannot account for

the full expansion of foreign doctorate attainment or the relative stagnation in attainment among

U.S. students, particularly in the 1990s. Substantial increases in public support for science and

engineering research fueled supply-side expansion in many fields. It is quite plausible that

elasticity of demand and associated response to such shocks among foreign students may be

somewhat larger than for U.S. based students. Beyond direct supply-side shifts, the role of

international networks and the process by which they have expanded over the last quarter century

surely contributes to the internationalization of U.S. doctorate education.

       That growth in PhD receipt among U.S. students in the sciences has not kept pace with

the outcomes for foreign students is also likely a response to the labor market for advanced

degree recipients in these fields. Despite what is perceived as a relative “boom” period for

scientific fields in the 1990s, the earnings gains for advanced degree recipients in the sciences

actually trailed those of college educated workers more generally. To this end, it should the

educational choices of U.S. students should be no surprise.

       A change that is remarkable, nevertheless, is the increased internationalization of the

labor market for advanced degree recipients in science and engineering fields. One immediate

effect of this transformation is the reduction of the large swings in the earnings of scientists

associated with changes in federal support for research.

       Much more work is yet to be done before one can present a full analysis of the welfare

effects of the “internationalization” of both doctorate education and the science and engineering

labor market. We suspect that the resources of U.S. research universities are a lure for the best

and the brightest across the world. If there are benefits to concentrating talent (agglomeration

effects), then international output is expanded. With some foreigners trained in the U.S.




                                                                                      Page 34
returning to their home countries, there are surely home country benefits if these scientists are

able to spur development of science, while also engaging in the exchange of ideas internationally

through networks developed in the U.S. Benefits also accrue in the U.S., as the influx of

scientists –trained in both the U.S. and abroad – reduces labor costs and increases the flexibility

in the supply of science and engineering workers. Yet, all these benefits come with some costs

and it seems clear that some individuals would have pursued advanced degrees in science and

engineering in the absence of the substantial foreign flow in to graduate education and the labor

market.
