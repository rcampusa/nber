                                               ABSTRACT

Were the U.S. to persistently earn substantially more on its foreign investments ("U.S. claims") than
foreigners earn on their U.S. investments ("U.S. liabilities"), the likelihood that the current environment
of sizeable global imbalances will evolve in a benign manner increases. However, using a monthly
dataset on the foreign equity and bond portfolios of U.S. investors and the U.S. equity and bond portfolios
of foreign investors, we find that the returns differential for portfolio securities is near zero, far smaller
than previously reported. Examining all U.S. claims and liabilities (portfolio securities as well as direct
investment and banking), we find that previous estimates of large differentials are biased upward.
The bias owes to computing implied returns from an internally inconsistent dataset of revised data;
original data produce a much smaller differential. We also attempt to reconcile our finding of a near
zero returns differential with observed patterns of cumulated current account deficits, the net international
investment position, and the net income balance. Overall, we find no evidence that the U.S. can count
on earning substantially more on its claims than it pays on its liabilities.

1. Introduction

         Substantial global imbalances are a central influence on the current international

economic order. Whether and how these imbalances might unravel have important implications

for economic stability in general and for the future path of the U.S. dollar in particular.

         One aspect of this situation that has attracted a great deal of attention recently is the

returns differential, the difference between the rate that the United States earns on its foreign

claims and the rate it pays on its foreign liabilities. It is presumed that the returns differential is

sizeable, in large part because of two pieces of evidence: (i) the fact that the U.S. net international

investment position is not as negative as the large, persistent U.S. current account deficits would

suggest (and, relatedly, that even with a negative net international investment position the income

balance remains positive), and (ii) the striking finding—most explicit in Gourinchas and Rey

(2007a) but also found in Obstfeld and Rogoff (2005), Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2005a), and

Meissner and Taylor (2006)—that over the past few decades the United States has enjoyed the

‘exorbitant privilege’ of paying foreign investors roughly 3 percent per year less than it receives

on its foreign investments.1

         Understanding the size and source of the returns differential is important in part because

the returns differential plays an important role in determining the path of the net international

investment position. For example, with gross claims and liabilities positions each at roughly 100

percent of GDP, a one percent differential will result in a one percent of GDP improvement in the

net position. Indeed, a positive U.S. returns differential vis-à-vis the rest of the world would be a

source of stability in the presence of large U.S. current account deficits. In the model of Cavallo

and Tille (2006) a more positive returns differential impacts the dynamics of current account

adjustment in a way that lessens the probability of a disorderly unraveling of global imbalances.

Similarly, for a given size of the returns differential, its likely persistence is important (Hausmann

1
  Although each uses a different sample period, the average annual returns differentials across these papers
are very similar, ranging from 3.1% from 1983 to 2003 in Obstfeld and Rogoff (2005) to 3.9% from 1980
to 2004 in Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2005a).
and Sturtzeneger, 2007). Should a positive returns differential exist, the likelihood of a relatively

benign continuation of global imbalances would increase. In its absence, one barrier to an

unsavory adjustment in the world economic order would be removed.

        In some sense, a sizeable and persistent exorbitant privilege would not be surprising. For

example, it is well known that U.S. claims are weighted toward equities and U.S. liabilities are

weighted toward debt. Because equity returns tend to be higher than bond returns, this portfolio

composition naturally produces a somewhat higher return for U.S. claims. But in Gourinchas and

Rey (2007a) (henceforth GR) a large portion of the exorbitant privilege (2.45 of the overall 3.32

percent) owes not to this composition effect but to what is termed a return effect: Within each

asset class, U.S. investors earn more abroad than foreigners earn on their U.S. investments. For

example, GR reports that since 1973 returns on U.S. investors’ foreign equity and bond portfolios

have exceeded foreigners’ U.S. returns by 6.1 percent and 3.7 percent, respectively, per year.

They attribute this result to the U.S. position as the major issuer of the international currency. As

discussed more fully in Portes and Rey (1998), this prominent position results in a liquidity

premium that enables the exorbitant privilege.

        In this paper we argue that existing estimates of the returns differential are biased

upward. We proceed in three steps. First, we note that for the two types of assets that have readily

observable data on returns—bonds and equities—the returns embedded in GR are exceptionally

high for foreign equities and exceptionally low for U.S. bonds. We realize that portfolio returns

can differ from value-weighted returns, so our second step is to examine returns differentials for

portfolio investments using the Bertaut and Tryon (2007) dataset of monthly international equity

and bond portfolios. The dataset contains the cross-country composition of U.S. equity and bond

investments abroad and the equity and bond composition of foreign investments in the United

States, including the composition of foreign investments across U.S. Treasury, Agency and

corporate bonds. During 1994-2005 we find no evidence of a substantial positive return




                                                 2
differential within each asset class and an overall differential on portfolio investments that is

close to zero.

        In the third step, we extend our analysis to all asset categories and identify the source of

the bias in the existing literature. We show that existing estimates use data that are not internally

consistent. These estimates typically calculate implied capital gains as the difference between the

change in positions and capital flows. While in principle this could lead to an accurate estimate of

capital gains, in practice it does not because the data on positions and flows are collected from

different sources at different frequencies and are often out of sync with each other. For example,

for portfolio debt and equity, flow data are collected on a monthly basis and remain more or less

as originally reported even when reporting errors become apparent because it is difficult for the

firms reporting cross-border transactions to go back and restate past flows. In contrast, portfolio

debt and equity positions, initially estimated using flows and estimates of capital gains, are often

substantially revised years later when measures from infrequent but high quality surveys become

available. The difference in revision policies leads to a disconnect between the revised position

and flow series.

        The inconsistency between revised positions and flows is responsible for a good portion

of the returns differential bias. Revisions to U.S. claims positions tend to be large and positive, as

portfolio surveys have frequently identified much larger holdings of foreign assets than originally

estimated. Large positive revisions to claims positions with only limited corresponding upward

revisions to flows produce large implied capital gains on U.S. claims. The opposite bias exists for

U.S. liabilities. While there is nothing pristine about the original data series, they are internally

consistent and, we argue, produce a more accurate measure of the returns differential. In contrast,

because flows are only partially revised, the revised data on positions are not consistent with the

revised data on flows.2


2
 The agency responsible for publication of these data is the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). From
our discussion of original and revised BEA datasets the reader might infer that we find fault with BEA


                                                    3
         We show that the returns differential is not only much smaller using the original data

(1.0%) than using the revised data (3.4%), but that it also has a different composition. The revised

data produce an aggregate differential that arises primarily from a large differential in returns on

portfolio bond and equity investment. In contrast, the original data produce a much smaller

aggregate differential that owes almost entirely to foreign direct investment returns, with—similar

to our results from the monthly portfolios—an essentially zero differential in stocks and bonds.

         Our finding of a very small aggregate returns differential might appear inconsistent with

two empirical facts: the U.S. net international investment position (IIP) is not as negative as the

large, persistent U.S. current account deficits would suggest and, relatedly, even with a negative

net IIP the income balance has remained positive. Because the overestimation of the returns

differential owes almost entirely to an overestimation of capital gains rather than income yields,

our results are entirely consistent with the observed relationship between the IIP and the income

balance. In both the revised and original series, the large yield differential on direct investment

offsets the net payments the U.S. makes on debt and equities. We also show that the net position

can deviate substantially from cumulative current account balances even if the average

differential is zero. As long as the differential is negative when gross positions are small and

positive when gross positions are large, cumulative total returns can be positive even if the

average rates of return on claims and liabilities are equal. However, about two-thirds of the gap

between the net IIP and the cumulative current account cannot be reconciled with our returns

estimates.

         One implication of our results is that inflows into U.S. securities are overestimated,

outflows into foreign securities are underestimated, and, hence, net financial inflows into the

United States are overestimated. This in turn suggests that one or more other components of the



revision policies—this is not true. Flows are only partially revised in large part because data providers
(such as banks and broker dealers for debt and equity flows) find it very difficult to recreate or revise
historical capital flows data. With essentially no revisions to the underlying source data for flows, BEA has
very little to base revisions on.


                                                      4
U.S. balance of payments is mismeasured. One prominent candidate is the current account deficit.

Indeed, that we can only partially reconcile our returns with the paths of net IIP and the

cumulated current account suggests the possibility that the current account might be

mismeasured. While a careful examination of this possibility is far beyond the scope of this

paper, we refer the reader to U.S. Census Bureau (1998), which argues that in the past U.S. goods

exports were systematically underestimated by as much as 10 percent, or 0.8 percent of GDP. It is

plausible that such a mismeasurement could be the current account counterpart to our findings.

        The paper proceeds as follows. In the next section we utilize a monthly dataset on cross-

border bond and equity portfolios to construct an estimate of the returns differential for portfolio

securities. In Section 3 we compute returns differentials for all U.S. claims and liabilities and for

a longer time period using BEA’s revised and original annual data. In Section 4 we compare the

returns differentials for debt and equity computed from different datasets (monthly portfolios,

BEA revised data, BEA original data, and GR) for an identical period, 1994-2003. In Section 5

we attempt to reconcile our finding of a near zero returns differential with observed patterns of

cumulated current account deficits, the net IIP, and the net income balance. Section 6 provides

concluding remarks.



2. Returns Differentials for Portfolio Debt and Equity

        Returns differentials found in the literature are typically calculated from implied

returns—that is, returns implied by BEA’s revised data on flows and positions, perhaps with

some adjustments—rather than measured. Extant returns differentials, calculated over different

time periods, are quite large at 3.1 percent from 1983 to 2003 (Obstfeld and Rogoff, 2005), 3.2

percent from 1981 to 2003 (Meissner and Taylor, 2006), 3.3 percent from 1973 to 2004Q1 (GR),

and 3.9 percent from 1980 to 2004 (Lane and Milesi-Ferretti, 2005a). Of these papers, only GR

breaks out the differential by asset class. For portfolio securities, embedded in the overall GR

differential are differentials of 6.1 percent on equities (19.8 percent average annual return on U.S.


                                                 5
investors’ foreign equity positions less 13.7 percent return on foreigners’ U.S. positions) and 3.7

percent on bonds (8.3 percent on U.S. assets less 4.6 percent on U.S. liabilities).

           Returns on portfolio securities can be measured, so backing out implied returns from

BEA’s revised position and flow series is not necessary. A simple comparison with market

returns suggests that GR returns are too high for U.S. equity assets and too low for bond

liabilities. For example, MSCI World ex U.S. equity returns for the 1973 to 2004Q1 period were

11.8 percent, 800 basis points per year lower than the returns embedded in GR. On the liabilities

side, U.S. bonds returned roughly 8 percent per year over that period, more than 300 basis points

per year higher than GR returns suggest.

           Such discrepancies with readily observed market returns are troubling, but it could be that

cross-border portfolios differ substantially from the composition of value-weighted indices. For

example, Thomas, Warnock, and Wongswan (2006) show that the country composition of U.S.

investors’ foreign equity portfolios differs from the global benchmark in a way that enabled U.S.

investors to beat the benchmark by about 100 basis points per year from 1977 to 2001. While this

is far less than the 800 basis points embedded in GR, it suggests that an examination of actual

cross-border portfolio holdings should be useful.

           Thus, in this section we compute returns differentials using a dataset of monthly bilateral

international portfolio positions in bonds and equities. The methodology we use is to observe

portfolio weights and calculate returns using indices that mimic (to the extent possible) the

composition of those portfolios. Note that, compared to most existing studies on the returns

differential, the analysis in this section is for a relatively short time period (the bilateral positions

data begin in 1994) and includes a more limited set of assets (only portfolio debt and equity).3

2.1 Monthly Bilateral Bond and Equity Portfolios

           Bertaut and Tryon (2007), following Thomas, Warnock, and Wongswan (2006), present

monthly bilateral positions of U.S. investors in the equities and bonds of a large set of foreign

3
    In Section 3 we extend the analysis using a dataset that covers a longer time period and includes all assets.


                                                         6
countries and of foreigners in U.S. bonds and equities. The country-level dataset includes, for

example, a monthly time series of U.S. holdings of German equities (as well as the holdings of

equities in 37 other foreign countries). Armed with time-varying monthly portfolio weights, in

this subsection we calculate the monthly returns of U.S. investors abroad and of foreigners in the

United States.

           Specifically, we calculate the average return on portfolio p (of, for example, foreign

equities) as the time series average of the sum of the products of lagged asset weights and current

returns:

                             1 T      N
                      rp =     ∑
                             T t =1
                                      ∑w
                                      j =1
                                             p
                                                   r  p
                                             j ,t −1 j ,t                         (1)


where wpj,t-1 is portfolio weight of asset j (for example, German equities) at the end of period t-1,

rpj,t is the period t return on asset j in portfolio p, and N is the number of assets (countries) in the

portfolio. For actual returns to deviate substantially from returns calculated using equation (1),

international investors would have to either (i) within asset classes, have securities weights that

differ substantially from those in major indices or (ii) earn substantial (positive or negative)

returns from intra-month trading.

           Crucial to this exercise is the selection of returns indices to calculate rpj,t. We use returns

indices whose securities composition closely mimic the composition of U.S. and foreign cross-

border holdings. Specifically, indices were chosen by comparing security-level holdings with

publicly available returns indices. For example, we compute the returns on a country’s U.S. bond

portfolio using a weighted average of Lehman Brothers U.S. Treasury, corporate and agency

bond indices, with the weights being that country’s portfolio weights in each respective bond

type. Within their U.S. bond portfolios, countries’ weights can vary substantially from the

weights in a market-capitalization benchmark such as the Lehman Brothers Aggregate U.S. bond

index, so it is important to use the actual weights of foreign investors in the three types of bonds

to produce an accurate measure of their returns on U.S. bonds. For returns on U.S. equities we use


                                                            7
the return on the gross MSCI U.S. index, a market-capitalization-weighted index comprised of

roughly 300 large and liquid U.S. equities (the type of equities international investors tend to

hold). For returns on foreign equities we use dollar returns on the gross MSCI equity index for

each country. MSCI indices are appropriate because MSCI firms represent almost 80 percent of

U.S. investors’ foreign equity investment (Ammer et al. 2006). For foreign bonds, to a large

extent U.S. investors tend to hold local currency bonds in developed countries and dollar-

denominated bonds in emerging markets (Burger and Warnock, 2007). Thus, for developing

countries we use J.P. Morgan’s EMBI+ indices (which are comprised of dollar-denominated

bonds); for those developed countries in which U.S. holdings of local currency bonds are

predominant, we use the MSCI bond index (which is an index of local-currency-denominated

bonds); and, in those developed countries where U.S. holdings of dollar-denominated bonds are

significant, we calculate returns as the weighted average of the MSCI bond index and MSCI

Eurodollar Credit index (which is an index of dollar-denominated bonds), with the weight on the

Eurodollar index being the share of dollar-denominated bonds in U.S. holdings of each country’s

bonds.4 When calculating returns on the aggregate foreign bond and foreign equities portfolios,

we weight each country according to U.S. bond (or equity) holdings in that country. The average

weight of each country in U.S. foreign equity and bond portfolios and the average returns on each

country’s equities and bonds appear in Appendix Table A.I.

        Our sample period covers the 144 months between January 1994 and December 2005.

The starting point is determined by the availability of MSCI bond indices, which begin in

December 1993. The ending point is determined by the availability of monthly data on U.S.

foreign asset positions, which are available through December 2005. We include the 38 countries

(nineteen developed countries and nineteen emerging markets) for which we have at least fifty

monthly observations on both equity and bond returns between January 1994 and December

4
 The developed countries where U.S. holdings of dollar-denominated bonds are significant include
Australia, Belgium, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Netherlands, Sweden, and the United
Kingdom.


                                                   8
2005. These countries account for the majority of U.S. portfolio investment abroad as well as the

majority of foreign investment in the United States.5 For some countries, equity or bond returns

data begin after January 1994. We add these countries to the U.S. asset and liability portfolios

when the data for both equity and bond returns become available (see the last column in

Appendix Table A.I). Countries added after January 1994 tend to have very low weights in both

U.S. claims and liabilities portfolios, so our results are nearly identical if we restrict our study to

countries with returns data for the entire sample period.

2.2 U.S. Portfolio Claims and Liabilities: Characteristics and Returns

        Table I shows the descriptive statistics for aggregate equity weights in U.S. cross-border

portfolio claims and liabilities (Panels A and B) and portfolio returns on U.S. and foreign bonds

and equities (Panels C and D). The “venture capitalist” capital structure of the U.S. external

balance sheet, as pointed out by GR, is evident from Panels A and B: U.S. claims (that is, U.S.

investors’ portfolios of foreign securities) are weighted heavily toward equities, while U.S.

liabilities (foreigners’ portfolios of U.S. securities) are weighted toward bonds. Specifically, the

equity-to-bond ratio in U.S. claims is 71:29 across all countries, with equities having a higher

weight in U.S. investors’ developed country portfolios (72:28 equity-to-bond ratio) than emerging

market portfolios (60:40). By contrast, the equity-to-bond ratio in U.S. liabilities is 42:58, roughly

that (46:54) for developed countries investor’ positions, but much lower for emerging markets

investor’ portfolios (9:91). We also note, but do not tabulate, that emerging markets investors’

U.S. bond portfolios are heavily weighted toward Treasury bonds and near substitutes (Agency

bonds), with only 4 percent of their U.S. bond portfolio being in corporate bonds. In contrast,

corporate bonds comprise 31 percent of developed countries investors’ U.S. bond portfolios.

        Panels C and D show that over the period from 1994 through 2005 data from monthly

portfolios indicate that for equities foreign investors earned higher returns in the United States

5
  In 2004, the countries in our sample account for 84% and 80% of U.S. equity and bond investment abroad
and 77% and 73% of all foreigners’ equity and bond investment in the United States. Of the international
investment that we do not cover, Caribbean financial centers account for more than half.


                                                   9
(11.88% per year) than U.S. investors earned abroad (9.59% overall, with 9.99% in developed

countries and 10.68% in emerging markets). This is despite the fact that as in Thomas et al.

(2006) the foreign equity portfolios of U.S. investors outperformed the MSCI All Country World

Index ex U.S., over this particular time period by almost one and a half percentage points.6 For

bonds (Panel D), average annual returns on U.S. investors’ foreign bond portfolios (6.08%) were

slightly higher than returns on foreign investors’ U.S. bond portfolios (5.89%). Foreign investors’

U.S. bond portfolios underperformed the Lehman Aggregate U.S. bond index by 51 basis points

per year, perhaps because of their overweighting of low-yielding Treasury securities.

2.3 Returns Differentials from the Monthly Portfolios

        From Table I it is clear that the monthly portfolio data show no evidence of substantial

positive returns differentials within each asset class. However, because equities return more than

bonds and U.S. claims are weighted towards equity while its liabilities are weighted towards

bonds, there can be a positive returns differential on the combined portfolio of equities and bonds

even if there is no differential within each asset class. In addition, as shown in Curcuru, Dvorak,

and Warnock (2007), foreign investors’ ill-timed switching between equities and bonds within

their U.S. portfolio contributes positively to the overall differential. In fact, the first column of

Table II shows that the portfolio returns differential for the 1994 to 2005 is 0.72 percent per year,

greater than zero but still much smaller than the differentials found in the existing literature. The

actual value of the differential depends on the time period, so to better enable a comparison with

existing estimates we also show the differential computed from the monthly portfolios together

with the differentials in GR for the same time period of 1994 through 2004Q1 (the end date of the

GR data).7 We leave until Section 3 a more complete discussion of the GR returns, but for now

we note that when examining identical time periods the monthly portfolios indicate much smaller


6
  The MSCI All Country World ex U.S. returned 8.13% per year over this period.

  Throughout our paper, for GR returns we convert their real returns to nominal using the PCE deflator.
For 1973-2004Q1, we use their published data. For shorter periods we calculate real returns using data
from http://socrates.berkeley.edu/~pog/academic/WB_data.xls, which was accessed on 15 August 2007.


                                                   10
differentials for equities (-4.66% vs. -1.92%), bonds (0.00% vs. 3.36%), and portfolio debt and

equity as a whole (-1.16% vs. 4.64%). As expected, the difference between the two sets of returns

owes primarily to a large discrepancy between returns on U.S. investors’ foreign equity positions

(7.76% per year in the monthly portfolios, compared to 12.32% in GR) and in foreign investors’

U.S. bond positions (6.65% compared to 1.89% in GR).8

         Returns differentials from the dataset on monthly bond and equity portfolios are much

smaller than representative differentials found in the literature. However, the portfolio dataset is

necessarily limited in terms of assets (only bonds and equities) and the length of the sample. In

the next section, to be more comparable to existing work, we use BEA data on all assets (bonds,

equities, direct investment, and other assets such as bank deposits) for a much longer time period.



3. Returns Differentials Using BEA Data

         In this section we extend our analysis to all asset categories and follow the literature by

utilizing BEA data to calculate differentials from implied returns. We identify that the source of

the bias in existing estimates stems from using internally inconsistent data on flows and positions.

3.1. Revised and Original Series Methods

         There are two methods to calculate implied returns differentials using BEA data. The

first, which uses revised series of U.S. international positions, capital flows, and income flows, is

straightforward to implement because the revised historical data is readily available on BEA’s

website. The second method uses the original flow and position data published by BEA in each

annual release of the U.S. IIP and balance of payments, and the corresponding original income

data reported in the annual IMF Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook.



8
 We note that the returns differential on portfolio securities is perhaps abnormally low over this period as
U.S. equities outperformed non-U.S. equities. Over longer time periods the relative performance of U.S.
and non-U.S. equity markets is closer to zero—for example, from 1973 to 2004Q1 they both returned
roughly 12 percent per year—and so the differential for equities and, thus, portfolio securities as a whole
would likely be slightly higher.


                                                     11
         Existing studies typically use the readily available revised series to calculate the implied

returns differential. The total return on U.S. claims or liabilities using the revised series can be

calculated as follows:



                         AtR − AtR−1 − FLOWt R INC tR
                rt R =                        + R                                       (2)
                                   AtR−1        At −1



where ARt is the position (claims or liabilities) at the end of period t, FLOWRt is flows (U.S. flows

abroad or foreign flows into the U.S.) during period t, and INCRt is interest and dividend income

during period t.9 The superscript R denotes revised, indicating that all variables are of the latest

vintage. The first term in (2) is returns owing to capital gains, while the second term is the income

yield. Capital gains are calculated as the change in positions minus the corresponding flows. Note

that measuring capital gains in this way includes changes due to price and exchange rate changes

(as one would expect) but also “other” changes in positions. As we explain in Section 5, these

“other” changes in the revised series can be quite large and including them in the capital gains

may not be appropriate.10

         We can use a similar methodology to compute implied returns using the series as

originally reported in individual IIP releases that are published every year in the June or July

issue of the Survey of Current Business. The IIP release indicates the position as of the end of the

previous year (AOt-1), the sources of the change in the position during the year, and the resulting




9
 Using ARt or ARt-1 +1/2 FLOWRt in the denominator of (2) would have no material effect on our results.
10
  For the revised series, BEA reports the breakdown between price, exchange rate and “other” changes for
aggregate claims and liabilities but not for individual asset categories. Thus, when using BEA’s revised
data, the “other” category can be excluded from the calculation of aggregate capital gains but it cannot be
excluded from individual asset categories. Perhaps it is for this reason that existing work includes the
“other” category as part of capital gains. Note that Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2007) propose a method to
break out the “other” component for individual asset categories.

preliminary estimate of the current year-end position (AOt). The total return on U.S. claims or

liabilities using the original series can be calculated as follows:11



                           AtO − AtO−1 − FLOWt O INC tO
                      rt =
                       O
                                                + O                                    (3)
                                     AtO−1        At −1



where AOt-1, AOt, and FLOWOt are all as reported in the original year t IIP release and INCOt is the

corresponding year t income flow as reported in the original balance of payments release. The

superscript O denotes original, indicating that all variables are as initially reported.

3.2. Revised and Original Series Results

           If revisions follow no systematic pattern we should not expect a substantial difference in

average returns (and average returns differentials) calculated using the revised or original series.

However, Table III shows that using annual data from 1990 through 2005 the differences are

substantial. The aggregate returns differential using the revised series is 3.4 percent, in line with

calculations found in the literature.12 The aggregate returns differential using the original series is

substantially lower at 1.0 percent. The difference is driven not by income yields, as the income

yield differentials are similar (1.2% using the revised series and 0.9% using the original series),

but by differences in capital gains (2.2% using the revised series but zero using the original

series).


11
   The original IIP releases include the breakdown between price, exchange rate and “other” changes not
just for aggregate claims and liabilities but also for individual asset categories. Therefore, when we use
original series we could in principle exclude the “other” category from the calculation of capital gains and
still calculate returns differentials for individual asset categories. We chose not to do so in order highlight
the impact of revisions on the calculation of the returns differential. In addition, the “other” changes in the
original series are quite small.
12
   As noted earlier, returns differentials calculated over relatively long time periods range from 3.1% for
1983 to 2003 (Obstfeld and Rogoff, 2005) to 3.9% for 1980 to 2004 (Lane and Milesi-Ferretti, 2005a). For
our purposes, we begin in 1989 since it is only then that the original IIP releases began reporting direct
investment at market value. Revised estimates of direct investment at market value, as used by others, are
available from 1982. Appendix Table A.II lists the sources of data as well as table and line numbers. Over
shorter time periods, returns differentials can be substantial, owing mostly (but not entirely) to short- to
medium-run exchange rate movements; see Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2005b) and Forbes (2007).


                                                      13
        The large discrepancy in capital gains differentials owes to the fact that, relative to the

original series, the revised series imply much larger capital gains on U.S. claims (4.2% vs. 2.4%)

and somewhat smaller capital gains on U.S. liabilities (2.0% vs. 2.4%). This discrepancy in

capital gains is especially evident in portfolio equities and bond investment. For bonds, the

revised series imply a total returns differential of 8.2 percent, while the original series imply only

a 1.6 percent differential. All of the difference between revised and original returns is driven by

capital gains, as yield differentials using the two methods are identical. One striking difference is

in capital gains on U.S. bond liabilities. The original series imply that capital gains on bond

claims and liabilities are nearly identical at 70 and 50 basis points per year, respectively. In

contrast, the revised series imply, somewhat implausibly, negative capital gains (-1.4%) on U.S.

bond liabilities. In other words, even in an environment of a secular decline in U.S. interest

rates—when all foreign investors needed to do to achieve positive capital gains was to hold their

U.S. bond positions for some time and then sell—the revised series suggests losses of 140 basis

points per year over the sample period. A similar capital gains disconnect is evident for equities:

The yield differential on equities is the same using the revised and original series (0.3%), but the

revised series implies very large capital gains on U.S. equity claims (13.1% vs. 7.7% in the

original series).

         The discrepancy between revised and original capital gains is not unique to the 1990-

2005 sample period. Because BEA began reporting direct investment at market value only in

1989, we cannot extend our sample back any further for all asset classes. We can, however,

recalculate returns differentials for equities and bonds beginning in 1984 (Table IV).13 As in the

1990-2005 sample, the revised series imply large positive capital gains on U.S. bond claims and

slightly negative capital gains on U.S. bond liabilities, while the original series imply modest

capital gains of similar magnitudes on bond claims and liabilities. That the revised series returns

  IMF data on cross-border equity and debt income, needed to compute total returns, are not available prior
to 1984.


                                                    14
are likely biased is evident from returns on U.S. equity claims: The revised series average annual

return is 23.2 percent per year, while over the same time period the MSCI World ex U.S. returned

only 12.9 percent per year, nearly identical to the 12.8 percent return implied by the original

series.14

3.3 Patterns in Revisions

            We have shown that the large returns differentials computed using the current vintage of

revised data do not exist in the original data releases. In this subsection we show that this is the

result of systematic patterns in revisions to positions and flows.

3.3.1 Revisions to Flows and Positions

            Figure 1 depicts the magnitude of revisions to U.S. net cross-border financial flows and

net international investment positions. It is immediately apparent that there tends to be substantial

positive revisions to net positions with much smaller (and at times negligible) revisions to net

capital inflows. For example, the 1994 net position was revised upward $424 billion, while flows

were revised by only $36 billion. As long as there are not one-for-one level shifts in positions

across all previous years—and Figure 1 shows no evidence that revisions to positions are carried

back one-for-one—large revisions to positions with only very minor revisions to flows will

substantially impact implied capital gains calculated using equation (2). Over our sample period,

the large upward revisions to positions combined with minor revisions to flows to produce overly

large implied capital gains.

            We can be more exact with this by combining equations (2) and (3) to express revisions

to the end-of-year position as the sum of the revisions to the end of the previous year’s position,

revisions to current-year flows, and revisions to capital gains, all expressed relative to the end of

the previous year’s position:




14
   The large difference between average annual returns on equity claims from 1990-2005 reported in Table
III (15.8%) and those for 1984-2005 (23.2%) owes to the sharp depreciation of the dollar in the late 1980s.


                                                    15
         AtR − AtO
                   =
                       (            ) (                          ) (
                     AtR−1 − AtO−1 + FLOWt R − FLOWt O + KGtR − KGtO                )             (4)
            AtO−1                            AtO−1



An upward revision to year-end assets (i.e., ARt - AOt > 0) owes to some combination of revisions

to the preceding year’s position (ARt-1 - AOt-1 > 0), unrecorded purchases during the current year

(FLOWRt - FLOWOt > 0), and unrecorded current-year capital gains (KGRt - KGOt > 0).

        Table V shows this decomposition of revisions for U.S. claims and liabilities and their

components.15 Focusing first on the aggregates, average revisions are positive for both claims and

liabilities but are substantially larger for claims (10.3%) than for liabilities (1.4%). As noted in

conjunction with Figure 1, there was not a level shift in past positions, but revisions to the year-

end positions are associated with somewhat more modest revisions to the previous year’s

positions (7.4 of the 10.3% for claims and 1.2 of the 1.4% for liabilities). Year t flows are revised

slightly on average (1.0% and 0.6% for claims and liabilities, respectively). Overall, these

patterns in revisions to At, At-1, and FLOWt translate into revisions to the residual (implied year t

capital gains) of 2.0 percent per year for claims and -0.4 percent per year for liabilities. Thus,

built into estimates of the aggregate returns differential calculated using the current vintage of

revised BEA data is a roughly 2.4 percent differential that owes primarily to the pattern of

revisions to positions and flows.

3.3.2 Revision Policies

        To better understand these systematic patterns in revisions, we next focus on revision

policies for bond and equity claims. Initial estimates of U.S. positions in foreign bonds and

foreign equities were revised upward an average of 24.6 percent and 46.3 percent per year from

1990 to 2005 (Table V). Figure 2 shows the times series behind these averages. For U.S. positions

in foreign equities, the incorporation of the first security-level measurement of U.S. portfolios


15
  Normalizing by period t positions instead of period t-1 positions would not materially change the
numbers in Table V.


                                                    16
abroad (from the Treasury Department’s 1994 benchmark survey) resulted in particularly large

upward revisions of 90 percent per year from 1990 to 1995. Prior to the 1994 benchmark survey,

positions were not measured but were estimated from capital flows data and approximations of

capital gains. The enormous revisions that were prompted by the benchmark survey were

described by BEA in Bach (1997, p. 47) as follows:

        “The differences between the two estimates can be attributed both to incomplete coverage
        of these transactions in the Treasury source data upon which BEA's position estimates are
        based and to inexact valuation of price and exchange rate adjustments applied to BEA's
        estimated positions. However, it is not possible to determine the amount of
        underestimation attributable to each part of the estimation process.” (emphasis added)


Because of the inability to definitively attribute the newly discovered claims to flows or valuation

adjustments, BEA made no revisions to flows (the “transactions in the Treasury source data”)—

financial flows are completely absent from Table 2 in Bach (1997), which shows all revisions for

the balance of payments and international investment positions—and put the difference between

estimated and measured positions in the residual “other” valuation adjustment category.

        These large upward revisions to positions without corresponding revisions to flows

results in an upward bias in the implied returns calculated with revised data. This is most easily

seen from the substantial upward revisions to implied capital gains for equity claims in Table V.

As noted, for U.S. positions in foreign equities, benchmark surveys led to revised estimates that

were on average 46.3 percent higher than initial estimates. BEA had to decide how to account for

these very large upward revisions to equity positions, which arose from new information on

positions at a particular point in time from high quality benchmark surveys. In the absence of

additional information on the reason behind these higher claims, it was attributed in some part to

the previous year’s position (revised up 34.6% on average from 1990-2005), some part to




                                                 17
revisions to flows (up 1.2%), and the rest to ‘other changes’ (up 10.5%). When equation (2) is

used by researchers to calculate implied returns, these other changes show up as implied returns.16

         Why does BEA only partially revise flows? One answer is that they do not collect

securities flows data and are, in a sense, downstream users of data compiled by the Treasury

International Capital Reporting System (TIC, the “source data” in the above quote). The

underlying TIC flows are often not revised even when it is known that newly found claims should

be attributed to capital flows because it is often unfeasible for the entities reporting cross-border

transactions to turn back the clock and revise their reported history. For example, a problem with

the reporting of the underlying TIC capital flows data on long-term foreign debt claims was

identified after the 2003 comprehensive benchmark survey:

         "As measured by the survey, U.S. holdings of foreign securities were considerably higher
         than would have been estimated using the estimation procedure discussed above,
         particularly for U.S. holdings of foreign long-term debt securities...It is now believed that
         incomplete information on monthly transactions in foreign long-term debt securities was
         a significant source of the observed difference."17

The TIC system originally reported U.S. net sales of foreign bonds in 2002 and 2003 that totaled

$55 billion, whereas security-level benchmark surveys showed that over that period U.S positions

in foreign bonds actually increased by $317 billion (Dept. of Treasury et. al., 2005), but to this

day the revised TIC data for 2002 and 2003 still show $61 billion in net U.S. sales of foreign

bonds. As reported in Bertaut et. al. (2006), an in-depth investigation revealed under-reporting of

U.S. investors’ purchases of newly issued foreign debt. While this reporting problem was

resolved starting in 2004, the majority of reporting entities did not revise their TIC reports for

2002 and 2003 to correct past omissions.

         In the absence of revisions to the TIC flows data to accompany unexpected survey

results, BEA is left with a dilemma: Deviate substantially from the underlying source data or put



16
   A similar pattern is evident in revisions to bond claims, with revisions to ‘other changes’ producing on
average a 6.1 percent upward revision to implied capital gains.
17
   Dept. of Treasury et. al. (2005, p. 8).


                                                     18
much of the changes in the “other” category. In the past, BEA tended not to deviate much from

the TIC flows data:

           “When BEA adjusted its international investment positions estimates last year using
           preliminary benchmark results, it attributed all of the discrepancy to valuation changes
           and none to the less than complete coverage of transactions…BEA is now changing that
           practice and attributing a large part of the discrepancy to transactions.”18


Even when BEA substantially revised flows—for example, from roughly $60 billion in net sales

to roughly $60 billion in net purchases in 2002 and 2003—they still attributed much of the

change in the year-end positions to “other changes”.

           The tendency not to fully revise corresponding flows when revisions to positions are

made also holds for U.S. liabilities. Speaking of U.S. liabilities, Bach (2002, p. 37) states:

           “In the past, BEA has assigned nearly all of the differences between the two estimates of
           the positions to either the prices change or the ‘change in statistical coverage’
           components of the investment position accounts, leaving data on financial flows as
           reported by the transactions reporting system little changed.”


In contrast to U.S. claims, the revisions to liabilities position were much smaller (an average of

1.4%) and, for some asset categories such as bonds, negative. Downward revisions in liabilities

positions without a corresponding downward revision in flows imply low capital gains.

According to Bach (2002, p. 38-39), BEA had tended to overestimate U.S. liabilities because the

transaction reporting system underestimates redemptions and paydowns of principle on mortgage-

backed securities. These redemptions should be recorded as outflows but are not recorded by the

existing transactions reporting system because they do not involve the typical data reporters

(brokers and dealers). As the above quote indicates, as a matter of practice BEA tended to revise

positions but not flows, implying low or negative capital gains on U.S. liabilities.

           Thus, the use of the current vintage of data on positions and flows to calculate implied

returns very likely overstates the size of the returns differential. The large capital gains on U.S.

claims implied by the revised series are a result of systematic gaps in statistical coverage and the
18
     Bach (2000, p. 71-72).


                                                   19
BEA practice of attributing unexpected position changes to the ‘other’ category in the absence of

corresponding revisions to the TIC flows. A similar bias on the liabilities side leads the revised

series to understate capital gains on U.S. liabilities. These biases are particularly large for bonds

and equities, the two types of securities that are at the heart of the Portes and Rey (1998) liquidity

discount and the GR exorbitant privilege.



4. Comparison of Returns Differentials for Debt and Equity

         We showed in Section 2 that returns differentials computed using monthly portfolios are

quite small. In Section 3.2 we showed that returns differential using original BEA data releases

are also quite small, while those computed from readily available revised BEA data are quite

large. However, our analysis of monthly portfolios used a different sample period. In this section

we compare returns differentials for debt and equity from the different methods as well as from

GR using an identical sample period, 1994-2003.

         In the first column of Table VI we present aggregate returns differentials calculated using

the monthly portfolios. As noted in Section 2, there is no evidence that U.S. claims have

substantially higher returns than U.S. liabilities; over this time period (1994-2003) the differential

on bonds is a negligible two basis points per year and the differential on equities is negative 5.1

percent per year.19 The second column shows that returns calculated using the BEA original series

closely match those using the monthly portfolios, with a very similar negative differential on

equity (-5.27%) and a differential on bonds that is close to zero (0.63%). The third column shows

that the revised series again imply much larger returns differentials: a very large positive

differential for bonds (6.74%) and a more modest negative differential for equity (-3.84%). That

the returns from monthly portfolios agree with returns from the original BEA series gives us

confidence that the revised series returns are biased, and that the original series returns are a


19
   As noted earlier, the recent period is somewhat abnormal. Over longer periods the differential on equities
is likely closer to zero.


                                                     20
better reflection of the actual returns differential.20 Arriving at a close to zero returns differential

on U.S. portfolio investment using two independent sources of data strengthens our conclusion

that the United States does not enjoy a sizeable return effect or, hence, an exorbitant privilege.

         Our finding that the United States does not earn substantially higher returns within each

asset class contrasts with that of GR, who use combination of the approaches discussed above.

Specifically, capital gains are calculated in GR by matching each asset class to corresponding

market returns and adding income yield from BEA data. The last two columns in Table VI report

GR returns on equities and bonds for 1994-2003 and, for completeness, for 1973-2004Q1.

         For the 1994-2003 period GR returns differentials are closer to BEA revised than to BEA

original or those from monthly portfolios. Compared to the monthly portfolios and the original

series, for both claims and liabilities GR report higher equity returns and lower bond returns. This

could be a result of GR’s distribution of income streams across asset classes. Because income is

not always available separately for each asset class, GR distribute aggregate income according to

the share of each asset class in total assets. However, the coupon yield on bonds is generally

much higher than the dividend yield on equities, so allocating income according to asset class

share will understate the income yield on bonds and overstate the income yield on equity. While

this biases the returns on each asset class, the bias is the same for claims and liabilities and

therefore should not materially affect the return differential.

         The most significant difference between our returns (and those from original BEA data)

and GR returns is that their return on U.S. bond liabilities is much lower (6.57% or 6.47% vs.

1.73%). This gives rise to GR’s 3.53 percent differential for bonds compared to 0.02 percent

using the monthly portfolios and 0.63 percent using the original series. The low return on U.S.

bonds reported by GR is in part due to the underestimation of income yield, as discussed above,

and in part due to the exclusion of corporate bonds from GR’s calculation of returns. Higher

20
  Note that we are not implying that original positions are more accurate than revised positions. Rather, our
point is that original positions and flows at least form an internally consistent dataset, which is vital if one
wants to back implied returns out of BEA data.


                                                      21
yielding corporate bonds make up as much as 42 percent of U.S. long-term debt liabilities (see

Table 1 in Dept. of Treasury et al, 2006), so excluding them will understate foreigners’ returns on

U.S. bonds. For example, had we treated all corporate and Agency bonds as Treasury bonds, the

average annual return on U.S. bond liabilities would have decreased almost a full percentage

point. However, the exclusion of corporate bonds explains only part of the low return on U.S.

bonds reported by GR. Even when we consider only Treasury bonds, GR estimates fall short of

standard measures of returns on U.S. bonds. For example, for the 1994-2003 period Ibbotson’s

Stocks, Bonds, Bills, and Inflation reports total returns of 4.2, 6.6 and 8.7 percent per year for

short-, medium- and long-term Treasury bonds, respectively. This is significantly higher than

GR’s 1.73 percent per year. And, for the 1973-2004Q1 period, GR report total real return on U.S.

bonds of 0.32% per year which implies nominal return of about 4.6% per year (shown in the final

column of Table VI). This is substantially lower than standard measures of returns on U.S. bonds

for that period; for that period Ibbotson’s reports total returns of 6.2, 8.3 and 9.0 percent per year

for short-, medium- and long-term Treasury bonds, respectively.21

         The implication of this and the previous two sections is that over the period from 1994 to

2005 there is no evidence that U.S. portfolio claims provided substantially higher returns than

U.S. portfolio liabilities. For the broader set of assets and longer time periods, any differential

that exists is small and concentrated in foreign direct investment. A large positive returns

differential, and the stabilizing influence that it would lend to the global economic system absent




21
  For equities, we believe that the GR equity differential for the 1973-2004Q1 period is biased upward due
to their use of fixed country weights in the U.S. foreign equity portfolio. GR use constant country weights
as of 1997, although country weights in U.S. investors’ equity portfolios can change dramatically over time
(Kho, Stulz, and Warnock 2006; Thomas et al. 2006). Applying 1997 weights to their entire 1973-2004Q1
period will naturally overstate returns, as all else equal 1997 weights will tend to be larger in countries that
experienced high returns prior to 1997. For example, had we used fixed weights from the end of 2003, the
1994-2005 average annual return on U.S. equity claims in the monthly portfolios would have jumped from
9.6 percent (reported in our Table I) to 11.6 percent. There are also other more minor differences in the
calculation of returns on U.S. equity assets. For example, we use information on 38 countries, whereas GR
use only 12. Also, we use MSCI indices which tend to include the large firms that international investors
tend to hold, whereas GR use local market indices that tend to be broader than the MSCI.

a sustained dollar depreciation, is not apparent when one examines actual bond and equity

portfolios or original BEA data releases.



5. Cumulated Current Account Deficits and the Net Foreign Position

        There are two empirical stylized facts that reinforce the perception that the U.S. earns a

higher return on its claims than on its liabilities. The first is that despite a negative net IIP the

U.S. continues to earn positive net investment income, suggesting high yields on claims relative

to liabilities. This is easily addressed: Our results are completely consistent with a positive

income balance, as income yields using the revised and original series are similar in magnitude.

In both, a large income differential on direct investment offsets negative payments on bonds and

equities.

        The second stylized fact that reinforces the perception of a large U.S. returns differential

is shown in Figure 3: The cumulative current account deficit (CCA) is much more negative than

the net IIP, which suggests high capital gains on claims relative to liabilities. This is at odds with

the evidence in Section 3 that the capital gains differential is on average zero. Lane and Milesi-

Ferretti (2007) provide one analysis of the wedge between the CCA and the net IIP. In particular,

they depict the implications of different assumptions about “other” changes, an innocuous

sounding but vital component of the IIP presentation that is described in some detail below, on

reconciling the wedge. In the rest of this section we first show that some wedge is consistent with

a zero average capital gains differential, but that most of wedge owes to “other” changes brought

about by mismeasured flows.

5.1 Relationship Between the Net Foreign Position and the Current Account

        We can write the net IIP at time t as the initial position plus the cumulative current

account and cumulative net capital gains on cross-border positions:


                                                    ∑ (A                                            )
                                    t                t
            NIIP t R = NIIP 0R +   ∑
                                   s =1
                                          CA tR +
                                                    s =1
                                                              R
                                                              s −1   kg sR , A − L Rs−1 kg sR , L       (5)



                                                         23
where CA is the current account, A are gross claims, L are gross liabilities, kgA and kgL are capital

gain rates on claims and liabilities.22 Superscript R indicates that all series—including the capital

gains rates kgA and kgL—are revised. 23 Multiplying the revised capital gains rates by revised

positions produces $2.2 trillion of cumulative net capital gains from 1990 to 2005—exactly the

amount needed to close the wedge between the cumulated current accounts and the revised net

position in Figure 3.

         Some of this wedge can be explained by applying capital gains calculated using original

rather than revised series. Multiplying our original series capital gains rates by revised positions

produces cumulative net capital gains of $0.7 trillion. These cumulative net capital gains are not

zero—even though the average capital gain rate differential is zero—because there were positive

differentials when gross positions were large and negative differentials when gross positions were

small. Applying negative differentials to small gross positions and positive differentials to larger

gross positions can yield positive cumulative net capital gains even if the average capital gains

differential is zero. That said, we are still left with a puzzle. Capital gains rates calculated using

original series suggest that the wedge between the net IIP and cumulated current accounts should

be $0.7 trillion, but Figure 3 shows that the gap is far wider at $2.2 trillion.

5.2 Role of “Other” Changes

         “Other” changes sound innocuous enough. BEA defines these “other” changes as (i)

changes in coverage, (ii) capital gains and losses of direct investment affiliates, and (iii) other

adjustments to the value of assets and liabilities. In fact, as also noted by Lane and Milesi-Ferretti

(2007) and Kitchen (2007), “other” changes play an important role in the divergence of the net

IIP and cumulated current accounts. This is apparent in Figure 3, where a dashed line shows that

without “other” changes the net position would be much lower and very close to the CCA plus

22
   We omit the cumulative net capital account and statistical discrepancy from the right hand side as it is
negligible. We also exclude financial derivatives, which BEA started reporting as of end of 2005.
23
   The capital gains rates in equation (5) are exactly what we calculated in Section 3 using the revised
series. Note that the revised series capital gains match the pattern of revised net positions and revised
current accounts by construction.


                                                     24
our original series capital gains. While there are some “other” changes in the original series, they

are small and produce cumulative capital gains of only $0.2 trillion. In contrast, in the revised

series “other” changes produce $1.4 trillion of cumulative (implied) capital gains. Therefore, if

we exclude “other” changes from both revised and original series, net cumulative capital gains

are fairly similar ($0.8 trillion for revised series and $0.5 for the original series). Excluding

“other” changes, the original capital gains series match the net IIP fairly well.

         In our opinion, the cumulative capital gains implied by “other” changes are not capital

gains but most likely represent mismeasured flows. As pointed out by Lane and Milesi-Ferretti

(2007), the “other” changes could in principle represent three things: mismeasured flows,

mismeasured initial positions, or mismeasured capital gains. Their analysis suggests that more

than three quarters of the “other” changes represent mismeasured flows.24 This is consistent with

our evidence presented in Section 3 that U.S. purchases of foreign securities and foreign sales

(redemptions) of U.S. securities have been systematically underestimated. In fact, the $1.4 trillion

of “other” consists of two parts. The first part is $1.0 trillion of positive “other” changes made to

claims—suggesting that U.S. purchases were initially underestimated. The second part is $0.4

trillion of negative “other” changes made to liabilities—suggesting that foreign sales of U.S.

securities were initially underestimated. Furthermore, our calculations in Section 2 using monthly

portfolios and market returns suggest that for portfolio investment a substantial portion of these

“other” changes should not be attributed to capital gains.25


24
   The Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2007) analysis of BEA documents describing various revisions concludes
that the allocation of “other” changes depends on the asset category. They argue that for portfolio claims
and liabilities “other” changes represent mismeasured flows, for FDI they represent mismeasured capital
gains, and for bank and non-bank lending they represent mismeasured initial positions. However, according
to their calculations in Tables 3 through 6 (last row and last two columns), more than three quarters of
“other” changes can be attributed to portfolio claims and liabilities.
25
   One might think that one component of “other” changes—capital gains and losses of direct investment
affiliates—should indeed be counted as capital gains. We agree. But on net that component contributes very
little to cumulative capital gains. The cumulative value of the original “other” changes due to direct
investment is $0.1 trillion. The capital gains on direct investment using the revised and original series are
nearly identical (about $0.4 trillion). This means that revised “other” changes due to direct investment
contribute at most $0.1 trillion to cumulative capital gains. Even that amount is unlikely due to capital gains
but rather to reclassification of portfolio investment as direct investment.


                                                     25
        The overestimation of net financial inflows, a point also made earlier by Warnock and

Cleaver (2003), has the additional implication that some other part of the balance of payments is

mismeasured. For example, it could be that the current account deficit has also been

overestimated; Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2007) note that results such as ours suggest that the

current account deficit has been overestimated by as much as 0.6 percent per year. Such

mismeasurement in the current account might seem unsettling to those who believe that the trade

data are the most accurate part of the balance of payments.

        Does the fact that our results suggest that the current account deficit might be overstated,

which some would find incredulous, invalidate our results? Not at all, in part because it is entirely

plausible that the current account deficit has been overstated. For example, the collector of U.S.

merchandise trade data carefully shows in U.S. Census Bureau (1998) that in the past U.S.

exports were systematically underestimated by as much as 10 percent, or 0.8 percent of GDP.

Moreover, there are strong parallels between mismeasurements in financial flows and

merchandise trade. Data on merchandise imports are rather accurate, in large part because these

goods must, for taxation purposes, go through customs. In contrast, for most countries U.S.

tracking of exports relies not on customs data but rather on less accurate survey data. For

financial flows, countries tend to care more about what foreigners own of their securities rather

than what their residents own abroad. Accordingly, detailed surveys of U.S. liability positions—

which help identify problems in flows data—have been conducted regularly since 1974, while the

first post-war survey of claims positions was not undertaken until 1994. And just as financial

flows data are not revised substantially because of an inability to recollect source data, historical

revisions to goods trade tend to be for short periods; even when holes in the reporting system are

found, it is impossible to go back in time and recollect the data.

        In summary, in this section we note that it is true that U.S. net position did not decline by

as much as implied by current account deficits. However, in our opinion this apparent stability of

the revised net IIP relative to cumulative current accounts is not because the U.S. experienced a


                                                 26
high return on its claims relative to liabilities, but rather is primarily caused by the systematic

patterns to revisions in positions without corresponding revisions to flows that we highlighted in

Section 3. The independent analysis of Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2007) supports this opinion.

Moreover, while a likely counterpart to our results is the potential overstatement of the current

account deficit, a more complete assessment of this issue is beyond the scope of this paper.



6. Conclusion

        We argue that existing papers overstate the size of the returns differential between U.S.

cross-border claims and liabilities. We show that the bias in existing estimates, which is

particularly pronounced for portfolio investment, owes to the practice of calculating implied

returns using fully revised positions data and partially revised flows data. Returns calculated

using original data releases do not suffer from this bias, and using these returns we find a

significantly lower aggregate differential that is almost entirely driven by direct investment. To be

clear, we do not claim that BEA revision policies are flawed—the U.S. capital flows data are in

some sense not revisable—but rather that the practice of using a combination of fully and

partially revised data produces estimates of implied capital gains that are biased in explainable

ways.

        Our results have important implications along many dimensions. For example, there are

implications for global imbalances. In theoretical models (e.g., Cavallo and Tille 2006), a positive

returns differential would decrease the likelihood of a disorderly adjustment in the U.S. current

account and the dollar. Our finding of a relatively small returns differential between U.S. claims

and liabilities means that one stabilizing aspect of the current international economic system is

weaker than previously believed. Moreover, a differential that is due to a high yield on U.S. direct

investment abroad—which, according to Gros (2006) and Bosworth et al. (2007) is due to tax

shifting—has different implications than a differential that is due to liquidity discount on U.S.




                                                 27
portfolio investment. That U.S. issuers of portfolio securities enjoy a significant discount is

simply not apparent in the data.

        Our results have implications for theoretical work, which has recently been influenced by

the presumption of a sizeable and persistent returns differential. For example, the returns

differential figures prominently in the models of Mendoza, Quadrini and Rios-Rull (2006),

Ghironi, Lee, and Rebucci (2006), Devereux and Saito (2006), and Obstfeld and Rogoff (2005).

In the model of Tille and van Wincoop (2007), a persistent returns differential is shown not to

have an important role and the authors sound almost apologetic in noting that their “model can

therefore not account for empirical findings by Gourinchas and Rey (2007b) that net external debt

is to some extent financed by differences in expected returns” (Tille and van Wincoop 2007, page

31). Our findings suggest that while it might be desirable for theoretical models to allow for

returns differentials, the assumption of persistent and sizeable differentials in asset classes other

than direct investment is on shaky footing.

        We caution the reader on two points about returns differentials. First, our work does not

infer that returns differentials are always small. Over shorter time periods, returns differentials

can be substantial, owing mostly (but not entirely) to short- to medium-run exchange rate

movements; see, for example, Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2005b) and Forbes (2007). Second, over

longer time periods, even if returns within portfolio asset classes are roughly equal, the venture

capitalist nature of the U.S. external position highlighted by GR means that as long as bonds

return less than equities there can be a long-lasting (albeit somewhat small) positive differential

on portfolio securities.

        Finally, our results raise the point that various theories concerning the sustainability of

large U.S. current account deficits hinge on different views of the relative reliability of the many

components of the international accounts. For example, we showed that implicit in the view that

sizeable returns differentials exist and can keep the current situation from unwinding in a malign

manner is the belief that the IIP and the financial account are accurately measured and form a


                                                 28
consistent dataset. Similarly, the “dark matter” view of Hausmann and Sturzennegger (2007) also

hinges on a view of the relative reliability of components of the international accounts, in

particular that income streams in the BOP presentation are more accurate than measures of

service exports. While the validity of this assumption is not entirely clear, if it is true then it

follows that service exports are underestimated and U.S. current account deficits are

overestimated. Further study on the relative reliability of various components of the international

accounts is necessary to shed light on these and other theories of current account sustainability.

 Returns and Returns Differentials Using BEA’s Revised and Original Series, 1990 – 2005
Total return is the sum of yield and capital gains. Yield is investment income divided by previous year-end
position. Capital gains is the difference between current year-end position, corresponding flows and
previous year-end position, all divided by previous year-end position. The revised series use positions as
reported in the July 2007 release of U.S. international positions (BEA Table 2); flows from the July 2007
release of balance of payments (BEA Tables 1, 7a and 7b); and income from the 2007 issue of IMF’s
Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook. Original series use positions and flows from the original BEA
releases of international positions published in each year’s June or July issue of the Survey of Current
Business (Table 1) and income from each year’s issue of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Statistics
Yearbook. All returns are expressed in percent per year.

               Pattern of Revisions in BEA’s International Investment Positions
Revisions to end-of-year positions is the difference between the revised position as reported by BEA as of
July 2007 and the end-of-year position as reported in the right-most column of Table 1 of each original
release of international investment position. Revisions to beginning-of-year positions are defined
analogously. Revisions to flows is the difference between flows reported in the July 2007 vintage of the
balance of payments and the original flows reported in Column (a) of Table 1 in each original release of
international investment position. Revisions to implied capital gains is the difference between capital gains
implied by the revised data (change in position minus corresponding flows) and the capital gains plus other
changes (Columns b, c and d of Table 1) as reported in each original release of international investment
position. All differences are expressed as percent of the original beginning-of-year position. Averages from
1990 through 2005 are reported.

                       Net International Investment Position Estimates
“IIP” is the revised net investment position published by BEA as of July 2007. By construction, the series
equals the revised net position in 1989 plus revised cumulative current account balance plus cumulative
revised capital gains. “IIP less ‘other’” is the revised net position excluding revised “other” changes as
published in BEA’s International Investment Position Table 3. “CCA plus original capital gains” is the
revised net position in 1989 plus revised cumulative current account balance plus cumulative original
capital gains. The original capital gains are calculated by applying original capital gains rates from Section
3 to revised gross positions. “CCA” is the revised net position in 1989 plus the revised cumulative current
account balance.

  Table A.I: Country Composition of U.S. Portfolio of Foreign Equity and Foreign Bonds
Country’s weight in U.S. equity (bond) portfolio is the U.S. equity (bond) position in the country divided
by the total U.S. equity (bond) position in all 38 countries included in the sample. Country’s equity return is
the annualized average of simple monthly returns on MSCI gross U.S. dollar total return index expressed in
percent. Developed countries’ bond returns are the annualized weighted averages of simple monthly U.S.
dollar returns on the country’s MSCI bond index and the MSCI Eurodollar Credit index, where for each
country the weight on the Eurodollar index is the share of dollar-denominated bonds in U.S. holdings of its
bonds. Emerging markets’ bond returns are simple monthly returns on the EMBI+ U.S. dollar index. The
time period begins in January 1994, unless otherwise noted in the last column, and ends in December 2005.
