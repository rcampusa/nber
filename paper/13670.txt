                                              ABSTRACT

This paper uses multiple data sources and a unified methodology to estimate the trends and levels
of the U.S. high school graduation rate. Correcting for important biases that plague previous calculations,
we establish that (a) the true high school graduation rate is substantially lower than the official rate
issued by the National Center for Educational Statistics; (b) it has been declining over the past 40 years;
(c) majority/minority graduation rate differentials are substantial and have not converged over the
past 35 years; (d) the decline in high school graduation rates occurs among native populations and
is not solely a consequence of increasing proportions of immigrants and minorities in American society;
(e) the decline in high school graduation explains part of the recent slowdown in college attendance;
and (f) the pattern of the decline of high school graduation rates by gender helps to explain the recent
increase in male-female college attendance gaps.

                                          I.    Introduction

        The high school graduation rate is a barometer of the health of American society and the

skill level of its future workforce. Throughout the first half of the 20th century, each new cohort of

Americans was more likely to graduate high school than the preceding one. This upward trend in

secondary education increased worker productivity and fueled American economic growth (See

Goldin and Katz [2003]). In the past 25 years, rising wage differentials between high school

graduates and dropouts increased the economic incentives to graduate high school.1 The real wages

of high school dropouts have declined since the early 1970s while those of more skilled workers

have risen sharply (See Autor, Katz, and Kearney [2005]).

        According to one measure issued by the National Center for Educational Statistics (NCES),

U.S. students responded to these higher incentives by completing high school at increasingly greater

rates. Figure I plots the high school status completion rate overall and by race for each year since

1968 from the NCES. It is the percentage of 18- to 24-year-olds possessing a high school credential.

By this measure—widely regarded as the official rate—U.S. schools now graduate nearly 88 percent

of students and black graduation rates have converged to those of non-Hispanic whites over the

past four decades.

        The NCES also publishes a second measure of the high school graduation rate called the 17-

year-old graduation ratio (Figure I). This is the number of public and private high school diplomas

issued by secondary schools each year divided by the size of the 17-year-old population in that year.

This measure suggests a very different assessment of the U.S. secondary schooling system.2 Both

the graduation ratio and status completion rate start at nearly the same level in 1968. However,

contrary to the status completion rate, the graduation ratio estimates peak at 77 percent in 1969 and

then slowly declined until suddenly reversing the long-time trend starting in 2002.3

                                                   2
        A number of recent studies question the validity of the status completion rate and attempt to

develop more accurate estimators of high school graduation rates (See Greene [2001], Swanson

[2004], Swanson and Chaplin [2003], Miao and Haney [2004] and Warren [2005]). Heated debates

about the levels and trends in the true high school graduation rate have appeared in the popular

press.4 Depending on the data sources, definitions, and methods used, the U.S. graduation rate is

estimated to be anywhere from 66 to 88 percent in recent years—an astonishingly wide range for

such a basic statistic. The range of estimated minority rates is even greater—from 50 to 85 percent.

        This article demonstrates why such different conclusions are reached in previous studies. It

uses cleaner data and better methods to estimate U.S. graduation rates. Our study is unique in its

use of a wide variety of data sources and its demonstration that when comparable measures are used

on comparable samples, a consensus can be reached among all data sources. After adjusting for

multiple sources of bias and differences in sample construction, we establish that (1) the U.S. high

school graduation rate peaked at around 80 percent in the late 1960s and then declined by 4-5

percentage points; (2) the actual high school graduation rate is substantially lower than the 88

percent estimate of the status completion rate issued by the NCES; (3) about 65 percent of blacks

and Hispanics leave school with a high school diploma and minority graduation rates are still

substantially below the rates for non-Hispanic whites. In fact, we find no evidence of convergence

in minority-majority graduation rates over the past 35 years.

        The decline in high school graduation is of interest in its own right as a measure of the

performance of American schools. It has important implications for interpreting a wide variety of

educational statistics. For example, part of the slowdown in male college attendance rates

documented by Card and Lemieux (2001) is due to declining rates of high school graduation among

males. In addition, half of the growing gap in female versus male college enrollments documented

by Goldin, Katz and Kuziemko (2006) can be attributed to higher levels of high school graduation


                                                   3
among females and larger declines in male graduation rates. Our findings also have implications for

the study of the effects of educational policy changes on secondary attainment rates. Many estimates

of the effects of policies on high school graduation reported in the literature are based on poorly

constructed graduation estimators that produce inflated levels and inaccurate time-trends.

        The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section II reviews the recent debate about high

school graduation rates and various estimators. Section III shows how various adjustments affect

the estimates. Section IV synthesizes the discussion and presents estimates of historic graduation

rates by race and sex. In it, we also estimate the contribution of the decline in high school graduation

rates to the recent slowdown in college attendance growth rates. Section V concludes.


                               II.    The Graduation Rate Debate

        For years, the NCES has published the two apparently contradictory assessments of the

health of the U.S. secondary education system plotted in Figure I. Only a few scholars remarked on

the discrepancy (See Finn [1987]; Cameron and Heckman [1993] and Heckman and Rubinstein

[2001]). The passage of the “No Child Left Behind” Act (NCLB) in 2001 (see U.S. Congress [2001])

renewed interest among researchers in estimating high school graduation rates. NCLB made

increased high school graduation a primary objective and required states and schools to monitor

them as measures of adequate yearly progress (AYP). School districts and states that did not meet

AYP requirements were sanctioned, primarily in the form of reduced federal funding. NCLB also

revised the definition of who counts as a high school graduate. Only those students who receive a

secondary credential that is fully aligned with each state’s academic standards are to be counted as

high school graduates. For the first time, alternative credentials, such as General Educational

Development (GED) certificates and certificates of attendance, were to be explicitly excluded from

state and local graduation calculations (United States Congress [2001]).5


                                                   4
        Using the new definition of who is a high school graduate, many scholars claim that the

United States has a dropout crisis (See Greene [2001], Swanson [2004], Swanson and Chaplin [2003],

Miao and Haney [2004] and Warren [2005]). The new school of thought is that the true graduation

rate is substantially lower than the rate that had been reported for years by the NCES and other

governmental agencies. Contrary to the official statistics of 85-90 percent, researchers now report

overall graduation rates closer to 70 percent. African-American and Hispanic rates are often

calculated to be as low as 50 percent nationally (See Greene [2001] and Swanson [2004]).

        Historic trends in high school graduation have also come under closer scrutiny. In

agreement with the earlier findings of Cameron and Heckman (1993), some scholars find that high

school graduation rates peaked in the late 1960s and have since stagnated or fallen (See Chaplin

[2002] and Miao and Haney [2004]).

        In response to these studies, Mishel and Roy (2006) argue that graduation rates are not

nearly as low as those reported in most studies in the recent literature. They argue that overall

graduation rates are 83 percent and that minority graduation rates are 75 percent, rather than the 50

percent claimed by other researchers. This paper examines these competing claims.


                  III.    Estimating the U.S. High School Graduation Rate

        Before turning to the data, it is important to clarify the distinction between a “completer” and

a “graduate”. Following the NCES convention, we use the term “high school completer” to indicate a

person who either graduated high school or obtained a GED certificate. GED recipients are

dropouts who are exam certified as high school equivalents through the GED testing program. High

school graduates are those who receive a traditional high school diploma from an accredited high

school program.




                                                    5
        In this section, we use household surveys, school administrative data and longitudinal

surveys to recalculate national high school graduation rates by race and gender. We discuss the

problems and limitations of each data source in detail and show that, after adjusting for a variety of

sources of bias, all of these data sources give a consistent picture of U.S. graduation rates.



A. Census and CPS-Based Estimates

The Current Population Survey (CPS) is a monthly survey of approximately 50,000 U.S. households

administered by the Bureau of Labor Statistics. It is primarily designed to track employment and

earnings trends in the civilian non-institutional population. 6 However, along with economic

variables, the CPS also collects the educational status of each household member.

        Every October, the CPS administers an educational supplement that asks more detailed

questions concerning the educational history and attainment level of each household member. The

NCES uses this data to calculate the 18- to 24-year-old status completion rate depicted in Figure I.

Many recent papers have discussed the problems that arise from using the status completion rate as

a measure of the national graduation rate (See, e.g., Chaplin [2002], Greene [2001], Swanson and

Chaplin [2003] and Sum et al. [2003]). These studies claim that the status completion rate is a biased

estimator of the graduation rate because: (1) GED recipients are counted as high school graduates;

(2) the institutional and military populations are excluded from the CPS; (3) one household member

responds for the entire household roster (i.e. proxy response bias); (4) the CPS is not able to locate

all persons eligible for the survey (i.e. low sample coverage); and (5) recent immigrants, who were

never enrolled in U.S. secondary schools, are included in the estimates. The final point is irrelevant

for measuring the stock of labor by skill category available to the U.S. economy. It is highly relevant

for assessing the performance of American schools—the focus of this paper.




                                                    6
        Using decennial Census data, we assess the importance of each of these potential biases. A

sub-sample of the Census, the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS), contains more

detailed education and demographic information than the CPS for both a 1 percent and 5 percent

representative sample of the entire U.S. resident population. It is a useful tool for examining

potential sources of bias in CPS-based estimates because it does not suffer from many of the

disadvantages of the CPS. First, the universe is more inclusive than the CPS because it samples both

the institutional and military populations. Second, coverage rates are significantly higher in the

Census than in the CPS. Finally, the Census began asking immigration questions long before the

CPS did so. Immigrants who did not attend U.S. schools can be identified and excluded from the

calculation beginning with the 1970 IPUMS data.

        The IPUMS data have two important drawbacks. In contrast to the CPS supplements that

are available on an annual basis, IPUMS data are only available every ten years. In addition, the

IPUMS questionnaire does not distinguish between GED recipients and regular high school

graduates. However, using data from the GED testing service, we are able to estimate the total

number of GED recipients in each Census for a given age range and deduct them from the total

number of people reporting high school completion in the Census data. The estimate of GED

recipients using this method is in very close agreement with independent estimates obtained from

various data sources.7

        Calculating national graduation rates by race and sex using the 5 percent IPUMS for the year

2000, we find that the status completion rate measure from the CPS suffers from significant bias.8

The two largest sources of bias are GED certification and response bias to the CPS education

question. Low sample coverage is empirically unimportant. Bias from the CPS exclusion of military

personnel is negligible. The exclusion of prisoners plays only a small role overall, but is important




                                                   7
when computing race and gender differentials in graduation. We now discuss each of these points in

detail and compute their effect on graduation rate estimates.9



The GED

The GED began as a small-scale program designed to certify veterans who interrupted their high

school training to serve in the armed forces during World War II. Quinn (2008) documents how the

GED changed its original mission of certifying veterans to become a substitute for high school

graduation among school-age youth. In 2001, more than 1 million high school dropouts attempted

to certify as “high school equivalents.” Of these, 65 percent were under the age of twenty-four.10 In

1960, only 2 percent of all new high school credentials were awarded through equivalency exams in

the United States. By 2001, nearly 20 percent of all new high school credentials were achieved

through GED certification.11

        The GED is generally accepted as the equivalent of a high school diploma for college

admissions and for determining eligibility for job training and financial aid programs. Historically,

GED recipients have also been counted as high school graduates in many official federal, state, and

local education statistics.

        Cameron and Heckman (1993) and Heckman and LaFontaine (2006, 2008) show that a

GED is not equivalent to a high school diploma. Although GED recipients have the same measured

academic ability as high school graduates who do not attend college, they have the economic and

social outcomes of otherwise similar dropouts without certification. Despite measures of cognitive

ability similar to high school graduates, GED recipients perform significantly worse in all

dimensions when compared to them (Heckman and Rubinstein [2001]). GED recipients lack non-

cognitive skills such as perseverance and motivation that are essential to success in school and in life.

The GED opens education and training opportunities but GED recipients do not reap the potential


                                                   8
benefits because they are unable to finish these activities. GED recipients attrite from the military at

the same rate as other dropouts and they exit post-secondary schooling with nearly the same degree

attainment rates as other dropouts who start with no credential (See Laurence [2008] and Heckman

and LaFontaine [2008]).

        Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary, the GED is often still equated with a high

school diploma and the line between the two credentials is being increasingly blurred. Many states

use the GED program to issue state-accredited high school diplomas on the basis of GED test

scores. In New Jersey, for example, an individual need only mail in GED test scores that meet the

state’s GED score requirement and qualify for a state-endorsed high school diploma. Candidates do

not even need to reside in the state in order to qualify.12 These credentials are then included in

official state diploma counts issued by NCES and in calculations of state graduation rates.13 In fact,

in many years, diplomas issued are greater than the number enrolled in 12th grade. Unsurprisingly,

New Jersey is estimated to have one of the highest graduation rates in the country (See Greene

[2001] and Swanson [2004]).14

        Another troubling aspect of the GED program is its disproportionate use by minorities.

The GED program conceals serious problems in minority education.15 Historic trends in

conventional status completion rates suggest that minorities are closing the secondary schooling gap

with the majority (Figure I). However, minority male high school completers are almost twice as

likely as white males to possess a GED certificate (Cameron and Heckman [1993]). A substantial

proportion of the black-white difference in GED attainment rates is due to the large number of

minority GED credentials being produced by the prison system (See Gensowski [2008]). Prison

GED recipients now account for over 10% of all GED certificates issued in the U.S. each year.16 If

those who have served in prison are removed from the calculation, the GED attainment rates for

minority and majority group males are similar. Not only is most of the convergence in male minority


                                                    9
high school completion rates to those of whites due to higher GED certification rates among

minorities, but a substantial portion of these credentials is produced in the prison system.

        The 2000 IPUMS data can be used to calculate the graduation rate for 20-24 year olds both

including and excluding GED recipients. Counting GED recipients as dropouts has a substantial

impact on overall graduation rates (Figure II).17 The estimated graduation rate is biased upward by

7.7 percentage points when GED recipients are counted as high school graduates. The bias is larger

for males than females due to high rate of GED certification in prisons among males (Figures III

and IV). Excluding GED recipients lowers minority graduation rates more than majority rates. The

overall black rate falls by nearly 2 percentage points more than the overall white rate after excluding

GED recipients (Figure II).18 Largely due to the disproportionate number of black males obtaining

GED credentials in prison, the most significant bias occurs in the black male estimates—nearly 11

points (Figure III).



Incarceration

        There has been an explosion in the growth of the incarcerated population since the early

1980s.19 In 2002, the total incarcerated population exceeded 2 million people for the first time.20

Minority males, especially young black males, have been disproportionately affected by tougher anti-

crime measures. Nearly one out of every ten black males age 18-24 is now incarcerated and it is

estimated that more than one-third of all black male high school dropouts age 20-35 were in prison

on an average day in the late 1990s – a higher proportion than found in paid employment (Western

and Pettit [2000]).

        There is a strong negative causal relationship between education and crime (Lochner and

Moretti [2004]). Thus, the educational attainment levels of prisoners are low.21 Among the prison




                                                   10
population, 78 percent are uncertified high school dropouts or GED recipients. Furthermore, 56%

of the incarcerated high school completion category comes via GED certification.

        Excluding the prison population has only a small effect on the overall graduation rate,

increasing it by slightly more than 1 percent (Figure II), but has more significant impacts on race and

gender comparisons.22 Overall male rates are biased upward by 2.1 points when excluding prisoners

while overall female rates are nearly unchanged (Compare Figures III and IV). Excluding the prison

population decreases the estimated black-white gap in high school graduation rates by 2.6 percentage

points. This change is even greater when the sample is limited to males. The black-white male gap is

biased downward by nearly 5 points when the prison population is excluded, as it is in computing

status completion rates based on CPS data.



Armed Forces

In 2000, 91 percent of military recruits across all services were high school graduates; 7.4 percent

were GED recipients, and only 1.5 percent uncertified dropouts.23 Most military personnel are high

school graduates and excluding them could potentially bias the estimated high school graduation rate

downward.24 However, because the military is a relatively small segment of the population, the

exclusion of the military population from the CPS has insignificant effects on the overall graduation

rate. The net effect of excluding the armed forces is one-tenth of a percentage point overall (Figure

II). The estimates by race are also largely unchanged due to similar high school attainment rates

among enlisted whites and minorities.



Immigration

Many CPS-sampled 18-to-24-year-olds are recent immigrants who never attended high school in the

United States. Hispanics account for most of this group. The Census data show that almost half of


                                                   11
Hispanics in this age group immigrated within the last ten years. These recent Hispanic immigrants

are primarily low-skilled Mexican workers who have significantly lower high school attainment rates

than U.S.-educated Hispanics. The large influx of immigrants into the United States in the past two

decades imparts a serious bias to the estimates—both in levels and in trends.25 A meaningful

evaluation of the performance of the U.S. educational system should not include people who never

attended U.S. schools or those who did so only briefly.

        To examine the effect of immigration on the estimates, we exclude immigrants who entered

the U.S. within the past 10 years in our 20-24 year old sample. Including immigrants biases the

overall high school graduation rate downward by 2.6 points (Figure II). The largest bias is observed

for Hispanic attainment rates—nearly 11 percentage points overall. Hispanic male rates are more

strongly affected than female rates by the inclusion of immigrants (Figures III and IV). We show in

the next section that the trends in Hispanic graduation rates are also strongly affected by this bias

since the migration of workers with low levels of education has increased substantially over the past

40 years.



Low Coverage and Response Bias

Low coverage rates are a potential source of bias in CPS data. This source of bias is distinct from the

CPS exclusion of the non-civilian and institutional populations. Coverage is usually discussed in

terms of the coverage ratio, defined as the estimated population for a given group divided by the

known target population size for that group based on an independent data source (e.g. Census). The

coverage ratio of the CPS survey instrument is .92 overall, indicating that the CPS population

estimate for the civilian non-institutional is 92% that of the Census estimate. However, coverage

rates vary substantially by age and race. 26 Young minority males are the least likely to be sampled.

For example, the coverage ratio for black males ages 20-29 is only .66 in the CPS. In contrast, the


                                                   12
coverage ratio for non-black males in this age group is .85. The final CPS sample weights are

adjusted by race and sex to account for this known undercoverage in an attempt to eliminate

potential bias.27 However, Sum et al. (2003) argue that low coverage leads to an upward bias in

graduation rates, because those who are missed by the survey likely have lower educational

attainments than the sampled population and only adjusting the weights will not fully correct for

this.

        The Census data allow us to partially assess the role of incomplete coverage in estimating

graduation rates since Census coverage is much higher than CPS coverage. A concerted effort is

made by the Census Bureau to obtain accurate counts of the entire resident population every ten

years including the military and institutional populations. As a result, the overall Census coverage

ratio is .98 (See Web Appendix Figure S.7).28 Minority coverage also far exceeds that of CPS data.

The coverage ratio for black males and females age 20-29 in the Census is .91 and .96, respectively.

In addition, the inclusion of the incarcerated and military personnel in the Census data further

mitigates the potential bias of CPS-based estimates.

        To assess the role of undercoverage in biasing CPS estimates, we compare the educational

attainment distributions in the CPS March 2000 demographic supplement for the civilian non-

institutional population with those found in the 2000 IPUMS data.29 The CPS March and IPUMS

educational attainment question are essentially the same. Due to the similarity in sample design and

timeframe, the estimated population counts by educational category should be closely aligned.30

        The overall population totals for 20-24 year olds in the civilian non-institutional population

are nearly identical in the two data sources, but the educational attainment distributions differ

considerably (Figure V). The CPS overestimates the fraction of high school completers (both GEDs

and high school graduates) in the 20- to 24-year-old population relative to the IPUMS and

undercounts uncertified dropouts. As a result, the overall graduation rate based on the CPS data is


                                                   13
nearly 2 percentage points higher than a Census-based estimate for this age group. The bias is even

greater for minority groups. The difference in the percentage of the Hispanic population that report

being a dropout is nearly 3% points lower in the CPS March sample relative to Census (Figure V).

        From this evidence it would appear that the low sample coverage in the CPS survey is a

plausible explanation for the discrepancy in the dropout estimates. As predicted, the CPS

underestimates those with low educational attainments and more so for minority groups.

        A closer examination of the distributions of educational responses in the two data sources

reveals that this explanation is unlikely. The CPS and Census closely align across all educational

categories with the exception of two.31 The CPS undercounts dropouts who completed 12th grade,

but received no diploma and overestimates the percentage of high school graduates who did not

attend college relative to the Census (Figure V). The difference between the two data sources in the

number of dropouts reporting all other grade levels (completing 11th grade or less) is negligible. In

fact, if we equate the percentage of the population in the CPS “12th grade, no diploma”, category to

that found in the Census, the estimated total number of high school completers and dropouts are

nearly equal for all race and sex groups in the two datasets (See the high school counterfactual in

Figure V).32 The discrepancy in the 12th grade, no diploma category accounts for nearly all the

difference in the estimated graduation rate in the two data sources.

        Given that the CPS survey underestimates the number of dropouts in only one category, it is

unlikely that low sample coverage is the source of the discrepancy. If undercoverage is the source of

bias, then we would expect a more uniform pattern of undercounting across all of the lower

education categories.

        Scanniello (2007) reports a similar discrepancy when comparing educational responses in the

CPS March against the American Community Survey (ACS). The ACS is a new Census bureau

survey similar in sample design, mode of administration, and coverage to the IPUMS data.


                                                  14
Scanniello suggests that the discrepancy in the 12th grade, no diploma category likely results from

differences in survey administration. The ACS and Census surveys are primarily administered

through a mail questionnaire while the CPS is primarily conducted through telephone interviews. It

appears that respondents are able to more accurately distinguish between the two categories in the

IPUMS and ACS data for two reasons. First, respondents see the available choices when responding

to the paper-based ACS and IPUMS survey whereas the choices are read to them over the phone in

the CPS. This may be particularly important for getting respondents to distinguish between

completing 12th grade with no degree and finishing with a diploma. Second, the ACS and Census

instrument allows each member of the household to fill out questions that pertain to them rather

than have one person respond for the entire household as is the case in the CPS. CPS proxy

respondents are unlikely to be able to distinguish between someone who completed 12th grade with

or without a diploma.33

        The final two columns of Figure V show the total bias in the CPS survey design and the total

bias in the CPS status completion rate by race. The undercounting of dropouts and the exclusion of

the prison and military samples in the CPS results in a net bias of 3 points overall and over 5 points

for blacks. The total bias in the 2000 status completion rate computed using CPS data is 8% overall

and over 15 points for blacks. The bias in the status completion rate as an estimate of the Hispanic

high school graduation rate in 2000 is very small due to the large number of recent immigrants that

tend to offset the other sources of bias.34



B. Common Core of Data Based Estimates

        The Common Core of Data (CCD) is collected from state departments of education and

contains the number of students enrolled in each grade level in a given year, as well as the number of

high school diplomas issued in that year. From these annual counts, an approximate cohort high


                                                  15
school graduation rate can be calculated by dividing the number of diplomas issued in a given year

by the number of entering ninth-grade grade students four years earlier. Some measures adjust for

migration between states in the enrollment and diploma counts while others average one or more

years of enrollment data to form a smoothed estimate of the entering freshman class. Recent

graduation rate estimates based on these estimators are between 68-70 percent – significantly lower

than those calculated using household survey data (See Greene [2001] and Swanson and Chaplin

[2003]).

           As noted by Mishel and Roy (2006), the primary reason that most of the proposed

administrative-data-based graduation estimators produce lower estimates than those from other data

sources is because they condition on 9th grade enrollments.35 The data do not give the number of

entering ninth graders, but instead provide the total ninth-grade enrollment in each year. The 9th

grade is the most common grade for upper level students to be held back. This causes CCD

estimators that use 9th grade enrollments to be biased downwards because they double count

retained students in the denominator.

           To gauge the magnitude of this bias, we estimate grade retention by calculating the

percentage change in 8th grade public school enrollment counts in a given year to the next year’s 9th

grade enrollment counts (Figure VI). In the mid-1950s, fall ninth-grade enrollment counts were

nearly identical to the previous year’s fall eighth-grade class size. By 2000, they were over 13 percent

larger. Ninth-grade retention bias is even greater for minorities than for whites. Minority 9th grade

enrollments are often 20-26 percent greater than the previous year’s 8th enrollment count, as

opposed to only 6-10 percent for whites. This severely biases estimated minority graduation rates

downward relative to those of whites if conditioning on 9th grade enrollment counts. The claim that

only 50 percent of minorities graduate high school is due to high rates of 9th grade retention and

estimators that do not correct for this source of bias.36


                                                    16
        To avoid this problem, we use the previous year’s eighth-grade enrollments to proxy for the

entering ninth-grade class. This estimator—also used by Miao and Haney (2004)—avoids the

problem of ninth-grade retentions and produces estimates that are consistent with Census and all

other data sources. Figure VII plots the estimated trends in public school graduation from the 8th

grade estimator for the graduating classes of 1960-2005. We also indicate the sampling period of the

major longitudinal data sources that we use as well as the occurrence of two major educational

policy changes for reference. Overall, the U.S. graduation rate steadily increased throughout the early

1960s and peaked in the early 70s. It then steadily declined from this point until the publication of A

Nation at Risk (See U.S. National Commission on Excellence in Education [1983]). A decline again

followed until 2002, when NCLB graduation rate monitoring was implemented. Even with this

recent surge, the U.S. graduation rate has never fully recovered to its early levels.

        NCLB gives schools strong incentives to raise graduation rates by any means possible. When

monitoring was implemented in 2002, minority retention dropped sharply and graduation rates

turned upward, especially for minority groups (Figure VI and VII).37 A similar pattern is observed

following the publication of A Nation at Risk. Whether these represent real gains or are an indication

of schools cheating the system in the face of political pressure remains an open question for future

research, although the timing suggests strategic behavior.

        Comparisons between the CCD and Census-based estimates are in close agreement.

Assuming that students graduate at age 18, comparing the CCD estimates for the graduating classes

of 1994-1998 to the 2000 Census estimates for those ages 20- to 24, we find that the two data

sources agree. The overall Census estimate for these graduating cohorts is 77.1 percent while the

CCD estimate is 76.6 percent. The predicted rates for whites, blacks and Hispanics in the Census are

81 percent, 66 percent, and 63 percent, respectively. Using CCD data, we estimate rates of 80.5

percent, 62 percent, and 65 percent, respectively.38


                                                    17
        Widely-used estimators that condition on 9th enrollment greatly underestimate graduation

rates, especially for minorities (Figure VIII). In 1960, the bias associated with conditioning on 9th

grade enrollment size rather than 8th grade enrollment was nearly zero. In recent years, the difference

between the two estimators is as large as 9 points overall and 14 points for minorities. For the same

2000 Census cohort previously discussed, the 9th grade estimator predicts an overall graduation rate

of only 68 percent. This is very different from the Census estimate of 77 percent. Furthermore,

estimated minority graduation rates miss the mark completely. The estimated Hispanic rate is only

52 percent, while the black rate is an even lower 50 percent. Both estimates differ substantially from

those obtained from both the Census and the 8th grade estimator.

        While the Census and 8th grade estimator generally agree in levels and exhibit the same

overall trends in graduation over time, we will show that the 8th grade CCD estimator consistently

produces slightly lower overall estimates (~ 1%) than the Census and longitudinal data sources over

time. For minorities, the disparity between the two sources is greater, generally 3 to 5 points. The

discrepancy results primarily from a difference in what is being estimated. Many post-high school

training and education programs such as Job Corps, Adult Basic Education and Adult Secondary

Education also issue state-endorsed regular high school diplomas that are not counted in the CCD-

school-based data. The number of diplomas issued by these programs is relatively small overall since

GED certification is the primary focus.39 However, these post-schooling diplomas have a greater

impact on estimated minority rates since enrollment in these programs draws heavily from minority

populations. CCD-based measures provide the best indicator of the performance of American

public schools while the Census and other survey data are more indicative of final attainment.

               IV.     Historic Trends and Comparisons across Data Sources

This section presents estimates of high school graduation rates for all race and sex groups over time

using a wide range of data sources. The major conclusion we reach from this analysis is that

graduation rates fell by 4-5 percentage points over most of the past 40 years. The decline was

concentrated among males, and racial gaps have largely remained unchanged.



A. Census

Combining Census data with a number of different independent data sources, it is possible to

construct accurate high school attainment measures by race and sex in each available Census sample.

We use these outside data sources to estimate the race and gender distributions of all GED

recipients ages 20-24 and 25-29 in each Census from 1970 through 2000.40 This allows us to

compute graduation rate estimates by race and sex for two cohorts that, together, span the entire 10

years between each of the available decennial Census samples.

        Figure IX plots the estimated Census graduation rates by cohort and race. These rates

exclude recent immigrants and do not count GED recipients as high school graduates. The highest

estimated graduation rates are for the first two cohorts, at nearly 81%. For later cohorts, the

graduation rate declines to 77% in the most recent Census. The Census estimates are in near perfect

agreement both in levels and trends with those estimated from CCD data using the 8th grade

estimator shown in Figure VII.

        Gaps by race have also remained nearly unchanged for cohorts born after 1951-1955 (i.e.

unchanged for cohorts of 25-29 year olds in the 1980 and later Censuses). The estimated gap

between blacks and whites is 15% for this cohort and nearly identical for 20-24 year olds in the 2000

Census. The corresponding gaps between whites and Hispanics (excluding immigrants) are 20% and

19% for these two cohorts, respectively. We also estimate the bias due to including recent

                                                  19
immigrants in the Hispanic calculations by computing Census rates that include these individuals.

The bias that results from including recent immigrants has grown from 2 percentage points in the

first cohort to nearly 9 points for the latest cohort.

        Calculations by gender reveal that the decline in high school graduation is almost exclusively

concentrated among young males (Figures X and XI). The overall male graduation rate fell 7

percentage points from the first to the last cohort, while the female rate fell by only 1 point. The

forces affecting the increasing high school dropout rate operate more strongly on men than on

women.



B. Longitudinal Data

This section uses a variety of longitudinal surveys that confirm the conclusions from the estimates

based on CPS and Census data. An advantage of the longitudinal data in sources we use is that

educational attainment questions are asked and verified each year. In addition, in many longitudinal

surveys that we examine the educational responses of the individual were verified through official

high school transcripts. Thus, a more detailed and accurate educational history for each individual

can be formed. One major disadvantage of longitudinal data sources is potential bias due to sample

attrition. As members of the sample leave the survey for various reasons (e.g. death, survey refusal,

survey design), the remaining sample may no longer be representative of the underlying population.

        a. NLS Estimates

        The National Longitudinal Surveys (NLS) have collected detailed schooling, employment,

labor market and social measures on multiple cohorts of young adults over the past 40 years. This

section uses the NLS66 Young Men and NLS68 Young Women cohorts (born 1946-1950), two

cohorts of NLSY79 data (born 1957-1960 and 1961-1964), and the most recent NLSY97 cohorts

(born 1980-1984), to examine graduation time-trends in longitudinal data.41 For the two NLSY79


                                                    20
cohorts and the one from NLSY97, high school transcripts were collected for a large number of the

sample members. This allows us to verify educational responses against official school records. In

the small number of cases where there was a discrepancy between reported education and the

official school transcript, the transcript report was used. See the Web Appendix

(http://jenni.uchicago.edu/estimating_hsgraduation) for further details regarding NLS sample

construction.

       Examining graduation rate estimates across four of the National Longitudinal Surveys (NLS)

confirms the overall conclusions of the Census analysis. The highest estimates are for the NLS

young men and women who were born between 1946 and 1950 (Table I). The graduation rate then

declines slightly in the first NLSY79 cohort (those born 1957-1960) until falling off for those born

after 1960. This is very similar to the observed Census patterns shown in Figure IX. By the last NLS

cohort, the NLSY97 sample (those born 1980-1984), the overall graduation rate has fallen nearly 4

points relative to the early NLS cohort. An additional longitudinal dataset, the National

Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) survey, confirms the lower estimates found

in the NLSY97 sample. Add Health respondents were born during the same period as the NLSY97

sample and the estimated graduation rate is nearly identical for all race and sex groups in the two

surveys.

       Estimates by race and sex are also in agreement with Census estimates and confirm the low

graduation rates for minority students found in Census and CCD data. The NLS male graduation

rate declines sharply while the female rate remains relatively stagnant. As is observed in Census data,

the black rate rises from the earliest NLS68 cohorts and then remains stagnant for both NLSY79

cohorts through the NLSY97 cohorts. The NLSY79 estimates a high school graduation rate for

blacks born from 1957-1960 of 69.7%. The estimate for blacks born 25 years later is even slightly




                                                  21
lower at 69.1%. The levels in black graduation rates by cohort are also entirely consistent with those

found in Census data.

        b. HSB and NELS Estimates

The two exceptions to the overall trends across the longitudinal data sources are the two NCES

surveys; the High School and Beyond Sophomore Cohort (HSB) and the National Educational

Longitudinal Survey (NELS).42 The overall estimates from these data sources are significantly higher

than those found in NLS and Census data and also exhibit anomalous patterns by race and sex. For

instance, the black male graduation rate estimates in NELS are above those of black females. This is

not observed in any other data source.

        Mishel and Roy (2006) claim that these data are the best available for calculating graduation

rates since the educational attainments of sample members are verified using school transcript

records. However, they do not account for a number of problems with the data that tend to impart

an upward bias to the estimates. After correcting for these biases, we find that both NELS and HSB

data are consistent with the overall estimates in other data sources for the given cohorts.

        The HSB base year survey was administered to sophomores enrolled in the spring of 1980

while the NELS base year sample is composed of 8th graders in the spring of 1988. Both the HSB

and NELS surveys were designed to be nationally representative of U.S. students enrolled in public

and private schools in the respective grades. However, both surveys excluded students from the

initial samples who were identified by school administrators as having either limited English

proficiency or learning/physical disabilities. The excluded students are called base-year-ineligibles

and compose approximately 5% of the NELS base year 8th grade sample. These base-year-ineligible

students were primarily minority males and were excluded because it was thought that the NELS

testing battery and questionnaire would be too stressful for them.43 It is unknown exactly how many




                                                   22
10th graders were excluded from the HSB sample but we estimate based on enrollment counts that it

is close to 4% of the sample and similar in race and gender composition to the NELS ineligibles.

          The NCES sub-sampled and resurveyed the original NELS cohort in 1990, 1992, 1994, and

2000. These survey years correspond to sophomore year, senior year, two years after expected

graduation and eight years after expected graduation, respectively. The sample was also “freshened”

in 1990 and 1992 to ensure a representative sample of both 10th and 12th graders. The freshened

sample is composed of students who were not enrolled in 8th grade in the spring of 1988 but who

were enrolled in an eligible school in either 10th or 12th grade in 1990 and 1992. These students are a

heterogeneous group that includes those who skip or repeat a grade and recent immigrants among

others.

          The original HSB sophomore cohort of 1980 was also sub-sampled and resurveyed in 1982,

1984, 1986 and 1992. These survey years correspond to senior year, two years after expected

graduation, four years after expected graduation and ten years after expected graduation. The HSB

sample was not freshened.

          The NELS and HSB sample designs are complex and results derived from them are strongly

affected by the choice of weights due to a series of non-random sampling procedures employed by

NCES in both surveys. The results reported by Mishel and Roy (2006) for the NELS use weights

that exclude the base-year-ineligible sample.44 This results in an upward bias in the estimated NELS

graduation rate. A further problem is that they estimate the graduation rate using the fourth follow-

up. In the fourth follow up, the target population changed from the previous samples. For the first

time, those who were incarcerated or institutionalized at the time of survey were excluded (See

Curtin, et al. [2002]). As previously demonstrated for the CPS and Census estimates, such exclusions

impart an upward bias to estimated graduation rates, especially for black males. The base year 10th




                                                  23
grade sampling frame of the HSB survey adds a further complication to estimating national high

school graduation rates because those who drop out prior to 10th grade are never sampled.

        We account for these multiple sources of bias in the following manner. First, we use the

NELS third follow-up administered in 1994. By this year, respondents were around age 20 and

nearly the entire sample had completed secondary schooling. Only .35% of the sample is still

enrolled in high school at the survey date, and only 117 total cases out of over 12,000 report having

attained a high school diploma after the third follow up. Second, we use NLSY79 and Census data

to estimate the number of students by race and sex who dropped out prior to 10th grade in the HSB

sample. These dropouts are then included in the final graduation rate estimates. Finally, we estimate

the high school graduation rate for the base year ineligible samples in HSB and NELS and include

them in the final estimates.45

        Table II shows the close agreement across all the data sources we have examined to both

each other and the HSB survey. The 10th grade enrollment estimates in CPS October, Census, CCD

and NLSY79 are nearly identical. The HSB survey undercounts 10th grade enrollments, primarily in

public schools, due to the exclusion of the base year ineligible sample. We estimate the base year

ineligibles as the difference in the total HSB and Census enrollment counts as 3.45% of the original

10th grade cohort. The base year exclusion rate for blacks is over 10%. The high school diplomas

issued in 1982 totals are also nearly identical in NLS, CCD and HSB data. While the CPS October

survey correctly estimates enrollment counts, it consistently underestimates diploma counts at older

ages. These patterns hold across all race groups.

        At the bottom of Table II, we compute three high school graduation rate estimates in the

HSB data. The cohort rate is the percentage of the base year eligible HSB cohort and pre-10th grade

dropouts that attain a high school diploma by the final survey round in 1992. The on-time cohort

rate is the percentage of the base year eligible cohort that graduates by 1982 (the expected year of


                                                    24
graduation for this cohort). The final cohort rate adjusts the initial cohort rate for the base year

ineligible sample. Excluding base year ineligibles raises the graduation rate by about one percentage

point overall but raises that black rate by over 4 points. The final estimated graduation rates across

all data sources are similar for all groups and are within survey sampling error of each other.

        Using the third follow up to estimate NELS graduation rates, and including the ineligibles,

again yields very similar estimates to graduation rates based on other data sources (See Table III).

The estimated numbers of diplomas issued in 1992 as well as 8th grade enrollment counts are nearly

identical in the CCD and NELS after adding back the ineligible sample to NELS. The one exception

is for black enrollment counts where NELS consistently underestimates totals relative to Census and

CPS data. The CPS again estimates fewer diplomas issued than the other data sources.

        From the NELS sample, we can construct both a final longitudinal cohort rate and an 8th

grade estimator comparable to that employed in the CCD. The NELS and CCD 8th grade estimator,

diplomas issued in 1992 divided by 8th grade enrollments in 1988, yield nearly identical graduation

rates for this cohort while the overall final cohort rate estimate is only 0.2 percentage points higher.

The CCD estimator by race consistently produces lower estimates than either Census or NELS data

but the CCD estimates only capture degree completion through schools and not those obtained in

post-schooling educational programs. The CCD data actually estimate a greater number of high

school diplomas issued to blacks in 1992 than do the NELS data, but the NELS cohort graduation

rate is higher due to the low 8th grade enrollment estimates for blacks.

        NCLB requires that states estimate on-time graduation rates like the ones we calculate here

in the NELS and HSB data. Some claim incorrectly that the CCD provides a measure of on-time

completion. The CCD 8th (or 9th) grade estimator is a smoothed measure of high school graduation

across multiple cohorts since retained students will be included in subsequent high school diploma

totals. The difference in the 8th grade estimator and the estimated cohort rate is a function of cohort


                                                   25
sizes, retention rates, change in graduation rates between cohorts and early graduation, among other

factors. The similarity in the 8th grade estimator and NELS cohort rate show that these factors play

only a small role overall but may be more important in explaining discrepancies in minority estimates

for whom grade retention is high. If the CCD and Census based measures were on-time rates, they

would be significantly lower, as is confirmed in the NELS and HSB data. The on-time-graduation

rates are about 4% lower overall, and the difference is even greater among minorities.

        One final point is that the NELS sampled a peak cohort for U.S. graduation. Both the CCD

and Census estimates confirm that the graduating class of 1992 (those born around 1974) attained

unusually high levels of U.S. graduation for recent years. They are not representative of the decline

that followed (See Figure VII).

        Our analysis of the longitudinal data confirms two important facts about high school

attainment rates. First, the overall graduation rate has fallen in the past 35 years. Children born in

the late 1940s graduated at a higher overall rate than do today’s children. The overall rate in the NLS

young men and women cohorts was nearly 82 percent, whereas the overall rate in NLSY97 was 77.5

percent. This is again consistent with Census data in both trends and levels. Second, minority

graduation rates have shown little improvement on the rates attained by the early 1950s birth

cohorts. In addition, this section shows that all of the major longitudinal data sources are entirely

consistent with estimates obtained from both Census survey data and CCD school administrative

data.



C. Comparisons Across Data Sources

Recent graduation rate analyses report widely different and often contradictory estimates. However,

when similar methods are used on the same populations, estimated graduation rates largely agree in

both trends and levels for all race and sex groups. We summarize our discussion by comparing the


                                                   26
estimates obtained from the Census household data (correcting for GED recipients and recent

immigration) with those obtained from longitudinal data sources such as the NLSY surveys, as well

as the estimates obtained from NCES and CCD data. In addition to the data sources discussed so

far, we add the National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH).46 Figure XII makes the

comparison across birth year cohorts and data sources. Comparisons of the same cohorts, using the

same definition of high school graduation, lead to agreement in the estimates across all data sources

in both overall levels and trends.



D. Decomposition of Historic Trends

        When accurately measured, the U.S. high school graduation rate has declined at a time when

the returns to completing high school have greatly increased. The slowdown in the high school

graduation rate accounts for a substantial portion of the recent slowdown in the growth of college

educated workers in the U.S. workforce. This slowdown is not due to a decline in rates of college

attendance among those who graduate high school (Table IV and Figures XIII-XV).47 Table IV,

panel A presents the change in the probability of high school graduation, overall and by gender, over

the past century. It shows that the growth in college attendance and graduation for cohorts born

before 1950 was fueled by growth in high school graduation. This contribution diminishes and

turns negative in more recent cohorts.

        The bottom two panels of Table IV perform standard growth accounting, decomposing the

change in attendance (and graduation) into the change due to high school graduation and the change

in college attendance given high school graduation. In them, we also examine college graduation

given college attendance. The decline in high school graduation is greater for males than it is for

females, accounting in part for the differential growth in college attendance for women that is

discussed in Goldin, Katz and Kuziemko (2006). As a result of this decline, men now graduate from


                                                  27
high school at significantly lower levels than women (Compare Figures XIV and XV). For recent

birth cohorts, the gap in college attendance between males and females is roughly 10%. However,

the gap in college attendance given high school is only 5%. Approximately half of the growing

gender gap in college going and a large part of the sluggishness in the growth of college educated

labor during a time of rising economic returns to skilled labor can be explained by declining rates of

high school graduation.




                                           V.     Conclusion

        This paper extensively documents that the U.S. high school graduation rate is neither as low

as some alarmists claim, nor as high as many believe. Calculating the national high school graduation

rate might appear to be a straightforward task but in reality, it is not so easy because of the

measurement issues discussed in this paper. When the same definition of what it means to be a

“high school graduate” is applied to comparable populations, we show that all major data sources

produce the same levels and trends in graduation over the past 40 years.

        Biases in both data and methodology that we document in this article are the cause of the

large discrepancies in estimates that appear in the recent literature. As others have shown, and we

confirm, recent estimates based on CCD data are often biased significantly downward by growth in

ninth-grade retentions. This problem can be avoided by using eighth-grade enrollment as the base

and we show that this estimator aligns with estimates from other data sources.

        The most significant source of bias comes from including GED recipients as high school

graduates. In recent years, their inclusion has biased graduation rates upwards of 7-8 percentage

points. The exclusion of the military population from CPS data used to estimate the status




                                                   28
completion rate has little impact on the estimates. Exclusion of incarcerated populations greatly

affects the black male rate.

        Especially striking are the comparisons in graduation rates between minorities and whites.

While our estimated black graduation rate is 15 percentage points higher than the 50% rate reported

in many recent studies, it is also 15 points lower than the NCES status completion rate. About 65%

of blacks and Hispanics leave secondary schooling with a diploma. An additional 5% eventually

receive a regular diploma through a variety of job training and adult education programs. Officially,

white and minority high school completion rates have converged since the early 1970s. However,

the official estimates are based on the civilian non-institutional population using CPS data and do

not count those who are in prison. We show that when we count GED recipients as dropouts

(incarcerated or not), there is little convergence in high school graduation rates between whites and

minorities over the past 35 years. A significant portion of the convergence reported in the official

statistics is due to black males obtaining GED credentials in prison.

        The decline in high school graduation is important for understanding the recent slowdown

in the growth of college attendance and completion and the growing gender difference in college

attainment. In the first half of the 20th century, growth in high school graduation was the driving

force behind increased college enrollments. The decline in high school graduation since 1970 has

flattened college attendance and completion rates as well as the skill attainment of the U.S.

workforce. To increase the skill levels of the future workforce, America needs to confront a large

and growing dropout problem.

        These numbers are not available by race.

   3    This reversal coincides temporally with the implementation of federally mandated graduation

rate monitoring under the No Child Left Behind Act (NCLB). We discuss this point and the

evidence that schools may be “gaming” the system in more detail later in the text.

   4    For a sample, see the heated debate in the popular press in May 2006

www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/22/AR2006052201187.html;

www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/22/AR2006052201197.html; and

www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/22/AR2006052201189.html.

   5
        In practice, there is some flexibility built into No Child Left Behind for states to define their

own graduation standards. The law further states that "Another definition, developed by the State

and approved by the Secretary in the State plan" (Title I Final Regulations, Sec. 200.19 (a)(1)(i)(B))

could also be employed. See Swanson (2003) for a detailed discussion of the implementation of

NCLB graduation measures in each state.




                                                               35
   6
        See our Web Appendix Part A for a more detailed description of CPS and Census data.

   7    See Table S.1 in the Web Appendix. at http://jenni.uchicago.edu/estimating_hsgraduation/ for

a more detailed description of this calculation. Laird, et al. (2007) use a similar method as we employ

here.

   8
        Mishel and Roy (2006) perform a similar calculation and conclude that the CPS is not

substantially biased by these factors. However, they do not simultaneously correct for all of the

biases we discuss to show the total effect of the biases. If they had done so, they would have reached

a conclusion similar to ours.

   9
        The population totals used to compute our Census graduation rates are listed in Web Appendix

Tables A.1 through A.7.

   10   Appendix Figure S.2 shows that the average age of GED recipients at the time they pass the

GED test adjusted for the age composition of the population has declined sharply since the

beginning of the program. While the changing demographic structure connected with the Baby

Boom and the Baby Bust accounts for a small part of the time series of the age pattern of GED test

takers, most of the decline in the average age is due to other factors.

   11   See Web Appendix Figure S.3

   12   See http://www.state.nj.us/education/students/ged/ged11.htm for more details about the

New Jersey GED program.

           13   It is not possible to fully account for the alternative completers who are issued state

diplomas with the available data. The graduation rates we report in this paper are close to upper

bounds since we lack information to fully account for these completers. This is true of both the




                                                         36
administrative and survey data estimates. NCLB likely exacerbates this potential source of bias since

it increases the incentives for states to raise reported graduation rates by any means possible. For

instance, when New Jersey increased the difficulty of the state exit exam, the numbers enrolled in

Special Review Assessment (SRA) diploma program increased dramatically.

   14   New Jersey, as well as most other states with high stakes exit exams, offers an alternative

program for those who fail the High School Proficiency Assessment (HSPA). The SRA program

administers diplomas based on a series of untimed locally administered tests similar in content to the

GED and distinct from the HSPA. In 2006, 12% of all graduates and over 1/3 in urban areas came

through the SRA program (See State of New Jersey Department of Education [2006], 2005-06

School Report Card).

   15
        This has important implications for a large body of economic research devoted to differences

in earnings between minorities and whites. Substantial gaps remain in the market wages of minorities

compared to those for whites. Part of this gap is a result of minorities obtaining less valuable GED

credentials rather than high school diplomas. See Heckman and LaFontaine (2008) for this

evidence.

   16   See Web Appendix Table S.2.

   17   The estimated graduation rates for each race and gender group of this cohort are shown in

Table A.1 in the Web Appendix.

   18   The percent distribution of non-institutional, non-military GED recipients by race and sex is

calculated from CPS October data. See the Web Appendix for further details.




                                                     37
   19
        See Web Appendix Figure S.4. This increase is not the result of an increase in violent crimes,

but instead is due to mandatory and longer prison sentencing for non-violent drug offenders and

repeat offenders. See Blumstein and Beck (2000) and Mauer (1999) for a discussion of this point.

   20
        The total incarcerated population is even greater than the number reported here as the figure

excludes those who are serving short-term sentences or awaiting trial in local jails. The breakdown

of the incarcerated population by type of institution and education for recent years is documented in

Web Appendix Tables A.10-A.17.

   21
        See Web Appendix Tables A.13-A.16.

   22   Mishel and Roy (2006) claim that including the incarcerated population only has a minimal

impact on the estimated black-white gap in high school graduation. However, they do not account

for the fact that over 50 percent of the overall high school completion category in the incarcerated

sample in the Census is composed of GED recipients, and the rate is even higher among young

black males.

   23
        See Web Appendix Table A.18.

   24   Web Appendix Figure S.5 shows this was not always the case.

   25   See Web Appendix Figure S.6 for trends on immigration.

   26   See Web Appendix Figure S.7.

   27   For instance, suppose the CPS survey estimates 250,000 black males ages 20-24 in the civilian

non-institutional while Census bureau estimates show there should be 500,000 in this category. The

CPS weights for this category are doubled to account for the underestimate.




                                                    38
   28   Census coverage is benchmarked against estimated population totals from administrative birth,

death and immigration records.

   29   See the Web Appendix A for a detailed discussion of the CPS March supplement.

   30   The most relevant comparison is between the CPS March and IPUMS surveys since they are

closest in timeframe. The IPUMS point of reference is April 1st while the CPS questionnaire is

administered in the third week of March. In addition, the weights for the CPS March survey are

based on the 2000 Census population estimates while those for the October survey are based on the

1990 Census estimates. Calculations using CPS October data yield similar conclusions to those

found using the March data.

   31   See Web Appendix Table A.20 in the Web Appendix for the complete disaggregated estimates

of the educational distributions across the two data sources.

   32   See Web Appendix Table A.20 for the tests of equality by race and sex.

   33   There is no way to analyze the role of survey administration with the existing data. CATI and

CAPI interviews are performed in the ACS data but only for the select sample of people who do not

respond to the mail questionnaire.

   34   It should be noted that these result are computed in the year 2000 and will not hold for the

entire status completion rate time series since GED test taking, incarceration, immigration and other

factors have changed considerably over the past 40 years.

   35   These administrative data-based-graduation estimators include the Swanson Cumulative

Promotion Index (CPI) and the Greene Method. See Web Appendix A for details on the

construction of these various estimators.




                                                    39
   36   For some sources that make this claim see Swanson and Chaplin (2003); Greene (2001); Losen,

et al. (2004) and Bridgeland, DiIulio and Morison (2006).

   37   NCLB provides a strong incentive for schools to end high school grade retention because

under NCLB schools are supposed to report on-time graduation rates. This is defined as “The

percentage of students, measured from the beginning of high school, who graduate from high

school with a regular diploma...in the standard number of years”. Students who are held back and

later graduate do not count under this definition.

   38
        Census data include public and private schools while the CCD data are only for public schools.

The data necessary to align the two sources more closely are not available.

   39   An evaluation of Job Corps by Schochet, Burghardt and Glazerman (2001) finds that 5.3% of

Job Corps participants achieve high school diplomas within 48 months, while 41.6% GED certify.

This focus on GED certification helps explain the estimated negative returns to Job Corps. The

program has since shifted toward awarding more regular high school diplomas.

   40   For the details of these calculations see the Web Appendix A.

NELS sample.

   44   This is the base year to fourth follow-up panel weight (F4BYPNWT).

   45   For the base year ineligibles that were eligible for the third follow-up, we are able to compute

the high school graduation rate directly. Those who are still not eligible by the third follow-up are

assumed to graduate at the same rate as base year ineligibles that were out of sequence in the second

follow-up. HSB base year ineligibles are assumed to graduate at the same rates by race and sex as

NELS ineligibles.

   46   See the Web appendix for a description of this data source.

   47   There was a decline in college attendance for male high school graduates following the Vietnam

War, during which college attendance provided a deferment from the draft during most of the war.

 Note: Authors' calculations based on HSB80, NLSY79, Census 1990 and NCES CCD data. The CCD graduation estimates are based on the 8th grade estimator. The NLSY79 data is restricted to those
born from 1962-1964. NLSY79 pre-10th grade dropouts are based on the single 1963 year of birth cohort and are those who are not enrolled in school and who never attended 10th grade. Census and CPS
pre-10th grade dropouts are based on 16 year olds who never attended 10th grade. The NLSY79 public/private school variable is from the 1979 survey. HSB diploma calculations are based on the variables
HSGRDATE and HSDIPGED in the fourth follow-up and are weighted using PANEL5WT. HS graduates are those who receive a regular high school diploma and do not include alternative credentials
such as the GED. The "other race" category is not shown and therefore totals by race do not sum to overall totals. CPS diplomas are total credentials issued to 16-24 year olds in
1982 less those who received a credential but were not enrolled in school the previous year (assumed to be GED recipients). CPS 10th grade enrollments are based on 14-17 year olds in the fall of 1979.
Census graduation estimates are those for the HSB cohort shown in the previous section. CCD graduates include all regular diplomas issued to public and private school graduates in 1982. Base year
ineligible graduation rates by race estimated from NELS data.

Note: Authors' calculations based on NELS88, Census 1990, 2000 and NCES CCD data. The final 8th Grade enrollment estimate for the CCD data includes the 8th grade private
enrollment estimate from the CPS October data. NELS 10th grade enrollment counts include those who were enrolled in the spring and fall who dropped out before the spring survey
round in order to be comparable to fall enrollment counts in other data. NELS base year estimates are based on the base year race variable and base year weight. NELS third follow-up
calculations are based on the variables F3RACE, F3DIPLOM, F3HSCPDT and weighted using F3QWT. Base year ineligibles who were still ineligible by the third follow-up are assumed to
have the graduation rates of sampled base year ineligibles who were out of modal grade sequence in the second follow-up. CPS graduates are those ages 16-24 who received a regular HS
diploma in 1992. CPS 8th grade enrollment counts are for 12-15 year olds in the fall of 1987. CPS 10th grade enrollment counts are for 14-17 year olds in the fall of 1989. Missing CCD data
by race are imputed for all states to obtain final diploma counts. CCD diplomas inlcude all regular diplomas issued to public and private school graduates in 1992.
Private school diplomas by race are distributed according to 10th grade enrollment counts by race. The "other race" category is not shown and therefore totals by race do not sum to overall
totals. The CCD graduation estimates by race are base on the same sample as those shown in Figure VIII to limit the effects of imputation on the estimates. Census graduation estimates are
those for the NELS cohort shown in the previous section.

NOTES: Authors' calculations based on CPS October, CPS March, Census and NCES data. The decomposition is given by: ∆P(Degree) = [∆P(HS)*P(College | HS)*P(Degree | College)] + [P(HS)*∆P(College | HS)*P(Degree | College)] + [P(HS)*P(College
| HS)*∆P(Degree | College)] + [P(HS)*∆P(College | HS)*∆P(Degree | College) + P(College | HS)*∆P(HS)*∆P(Degree | College) + P(Degree | College)*∆P(HS)*∆P(College | HS) + ∆P(HS)*∆P(College | HS)*∆P(Degree | College)]. All college attendance
and HS graduation probabilities are fixed at the previous cohort levels. "∆Levels due to ∆HS" is the first term of the decomposition, "∆Levels due to ∆(Coll | HS) is the 2nd, "∆Levels due to ∆(Deg | Coll)" is the 3rd term and "∆Levels due to Interaction" is the
4th. All calculations based on decompositions shown in figures XIII-XV.

Source: Reproduced from NCES publication "Dropout Rates in the United States: 2005" (Laird et al, June 2007). Rates prior to 1972 are based on authors' calculations using CPS data.
The status completion rate is the percentage of 18- through 24-year-olds not enrolled in secondary school who have a high school credential. High school credentials include regular
diplomas and alternative credentials such as GED certificates. Hispanic ethnicity is not available before 1972. The 17-year old graduation ratio is from the Digest of Education Statistics.
HS graduates for the graduation ratio include both public and private school diplomas and exclude GED recipients and other certificates. October 17-year-old population estimates are
obtained from Census Bureau P-20 reports.

Notes: Authors' calculations based on Census 2000 data. All estimates are weighted and race categories are mutually exclusive. Calculations are for the 20-24 year old population. Total GED recipients are estimated
from GED testing service data. The recent immigrant category contains only those who are in the civilian non-institutional population and who emigrated to the U.S. after 1990. Those still enrolled in high school are
excluded from calculations. The percentage of GEDs who are recent immigrants is estimated from CPS October data. Estimates of GEDs who are incarcerated or in the military are obtained from BJS and DOD data,
respectively. The bias calculations are computed sequentially so that those belonging to multiple groups are only counted once. Immigrants are excluded first, followed by GEDs, prisoners and then the military
sample. See the Web Appendix for further details of these calculations.

 from GED testing service data. The recent immigrant category contains only those who are in the civilian non-institutional population and who emigrated to the U.S. after 1990. Those still enrolled in high school are
 excluded from calculations. The percentage of GEDs who are recent immigrants is estimated from CPS October data. Estimates of GEDs who are incarcerated or in the military are obtained from BJS and DOD
 data, respectively. The bias calculations are computed sequentially so that those belonging to multiple groups are only counted once. Immigrants are excluded first, followed by GEDs, prisoners and then the military
 sample. See the Web Appendix for further details of these calculations.

    Notes: Authors' calculations based on 2000 CPS March and IPUMS data. All calculations are weighted. High school completers include those who earned a GED. Estimated population
    totals are 17,974,212 in the Census and 17,982,365 in the CPS March. (*) The HS counterfactual is the difference between the two surveys in the percentage of the population reporting a
    high school credential if the % in the CPS March 12th grade, no diploma, category is set equal to the Census estimate. These additional March dropouts are subtracted from the HS no
    college category. (**) Computed as the bias from the undercount of dropouts and the exclusion of the institutionalized and military populations in the CPS survey. (***) Total bias from the
    undercount of dropouts, the exclusion of the institutionalized and military populations, the inclusion of immigrants and counting GEDs as HS graduates in the status completion rate
    category and are deducted from this category.

Notes: Authors' calculations based on CCD data obtained from the Digest of Education Statistics (various years). Data by race are only available beginning in 1992. For calculations by
race, the following states are dropped in all years due to too many missing values: ID, KY, ND, UT. Enrollment counts by race for some states with missing values were imputed using a
linear estimate based on previous and future enrollment counts by race in that state. See data appendix for further details.

Notes: Authors' calculations based on CCD data obtained from the Digest of Education Statistics (various years). Data by race are only available beginning in 1992. For estimates by race, the following states were
excluded in all years due to missing enrollment or diploma counts: ID, KY, ND, NH, SC, UT, VT, WA. Enrollment and diploma counts by race for some states with missing values were imputed using a linear
estimate based on previous and future enrollment counts by race in that state. The race distribution of 8th grade enrollments from 1987-1991 are estimated using CPS October data to extend the graduation rates by
race to as early as 1992 (the first year diplomas issued by race are available). Ungraded students were distributed across all enrollment totals prior to 1965. These students are estimated from the 1965 values and
subtracted from the totals. See data appendix for further details.

 Notes: Authors' calculations based on CCD data obtained from the Digest of Education Statistics (various years). Data by race are only available beginning in 1992. The following states
 are dropped in all years due to too many missing values: ID, KY, ND, UT. For estimates by race, the following states were excluded in all years: ID, KY, ND, NH, SC, UT, VT, WA due
 to too many missing values. Enrollment counts by race for some states with missing values were imputed using a linear estimate based on previous and future enrollment counts by race
 in that state. See data appendix for further details.

     Notes: Authors' calculations from various data sources. Census graduation rates are ages 20-24 or 25-29 depending on cohort and do not include recent immigrants. The 8th grade estimator is calculated using CCD
     data. It is assumed that people graduate at age 18. For example, the graduation rate in the year 1968 is for those born in 1950. GED recipients are not counted as high school graduates in all calculations. The NLS
     data sources are the Young Men and Young women (born 1946-1951), two cohorts of NLSY79 data (those born 1957-1960 and 1961-1964) and the NLSY97 (born 1980-1984). For all survey data, 99% confidence
     intervals are shown. CCD data do not allow for standard error calculations. The 1981-1985 "Census" estimates are calculated in the 2004 ACS survey.

Notes: 3-year moving averages based on CPS October, Census, CPS March and NCES data. HS graduates are those who obtained a regular public or private HS diploma (excluding GEDs)
from the NCES. "Graduate HS" is the fraction of 8th grade enrollments for a given cohort who report a regular HS diploma. "Attend Given HS" is the fraction of recent HS graduates who
report being enrolled the fall of the year following graduation. "Attend College" is college enrollments of recent HS graduates as a fraction of 18 year old cohort size. College graduates are
those who report a BA or higher by age 25. "Graduate Given Attend" is those who obtained a four year degree as a fraction of the college enrollment total for that cohort. Two-year degrees
are not included. "Graduate College" is the number of college graduates as a fraction of the 18 year old cohort size. Population estimates are from the Census P-20 reports. HS diplomas
issued by sex are estimated from CPS October data after 1982.
