                                          ABSTRACT

We test the hypothesis that greater stock price informativeness (SPI) leads to higher firm-level
productivity (TFP). Management, directly or indirectly, learns more from more informative stock
prices, so that more informative stock prices should make firms more productive. We find a
positive relation between SPI and TFP. The relation is stronger for smaller, younger, riskier, less
capital-intensive, and financially-constrained firms. Product market competition and better
governance amplify the relation, while diversification weakens it. We address endogeneity
concerns with fixed effects, instrumental variables, and the use of brokerage house research
department closures and S&P 500 additions as plausibly exogenous events.

1. Introduction

    One important role of the stock market is to provide price discovery (e.g., Bond, Edmans, and

Goldstein, 2012, Fama and Miller, 1972, Subrahmanyam and Titman, 1999, Dow and Gorton, 1997,

and Dow and Rahi, 2003). Investors and managers learn from stock prices. It is well-established that

the quality of price discovery varies across stocks and stock markets (see, for instance, Morck, Yeung,

and Yu, 2013). In this paper, we use differences in the quality of price discovery across U.S. firms to

investigate whether better price discovery makes firms more productive. We find that it does. In other

words, firms are more productive when the market for their stock leads to better price discovery.

    Consider two firms. One firm’s stock moves exactly with the market, so no firm-specific

information is incorporated in the price. The other firm’s stock price incorporates a large amount of

firm-specific information. With the first stock, management learns nothing from price moves that it

would not learn by looking at a market index. In the other case, the stock price has information about

the firm that is separate from information about the market. Some of that information results from

trading by investors (e.g., Grossman and Stiglitz, 1980, Glosten and Milgrom, 1985, and Kyle, 1985).

The contention and evidence in the literature is that this information is valuable to management in

guiding its actions. In the case of the first firm, a drop in the stock price is not informative about firm-

specific developments; in the case of the second firm, it is.

    Once private information is in the stock price, it informs the actions of managers and investors. For

example, corporate managers can learn from the information in stock prices for M&A decisions: if a

firm’s stock price drops after an M&A announcement, the manager may cancel the M&A plan (Luo,

2005), the acquirer may itself be taken over (Mitchell and Lehn, 1990), or the CEO may lose her job

(Lehn and Zhao, 2006). In addition to management, directors and activists can take actions to force

changes in how firms are managed and investors in general can take market-based corrective actions

(Bond, Goldstein, and Prescott, 2010). Bond, Goldstein, and Edmans (2012) review the theoretical and

empirical literature on the real effects of price discovery.

    The extent to which trading incorporates private information in stock prices is measured in the

literature by a stock’s price informativeness (SPI). Throughout the paper, we highlight results using the




                                                     1
two measures of SPI that are most widely used in the literature, the probability of informed trading

(PIN) and stock price nonsynchronicity (PSI), but we also establish that our results hold for other

measures. PIN measures the probability of informed trading in a stock (Easley, Hvidkjaer, and O’Hara,

2002). This measure has a micro-foundation as it is based on a structural market microstructure model.

PSI measures firm-specific return variation. Initiated by Roll (1988), the logic of this measure is to filter

out the market and industry related components from stock returns. As a firm’s idiosyncratic variation

increases, the stock price reflects more private information (e.g., Morck, Yeung, and Yu, 2000, and

Durnev, Morck, and Yeung, 2004).

    We use as our main measure of productivity Total Factor Productivity or TFP. TFP measures the

overall effectiveness and efficiency with which capital and labor are used in the production process. To

measure TFP, we have to estimate a production function with data available from Compustat. To do so,

we follow Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) and Ackerberg, Caves, and Frazer (2015). We also use other

measures of firm efficiency that are used in the corporate finance literature. We show that these

measures are also positively related to SPI, so that our conclusions do not depend on the use of TFP.

    We find that the evidence supports our hypothesis that firms with better price discovery in the stock

market are more productive. Such a result could be explained by factors that influence both price

discovery and firm productivity. To make a causal interpretation of our results plausible, we address

potential endogeneity concerns in multiple ways. First, we use instrumental variables for SPI. Second,

we provide difference in differences estimations using exogenous shocks to SPI. Third, we use quasi-

natural experiments of changes in price informativeness of stocks. The first experiment involves

closures of analyst research departments and the second experiment uses additions to the S&P500 index.

Fourth, we control for firm fixed effects to minimize the possibility that a firm-invariant omitted

variable is affecting our results. Fifth, we use a moving average of SPI over the previous three years,

which helps alleviate simultaneity and reverse causality concerns. Our results are robust to these

approaches to address endogeneity concerns and hence provide strong support for the existence of a

causal effect of SPI on TFP.

    One of our approaches to deal with endogeneity has important implications on its own. For a firm,

being added to the S&P 500 is viewed as an exogenous event as firms cannot directly get themselves


                                                     2
included and S&P makes it clear that inclusion has no information about a firm’s future performance.

We examine the impact on firm productivity of being added to the S&P 500. Being added to the index

decreases SPI as it is known that being added to the index increases the correlation of a stock with the

index. Hence, we would expect that being added to the index decreases a firm’s productivity. Our

evidence is strongly supportive of this prediction.

    To understand how SPI affects TFP, we first examine the channels through which SPI affects TFP.

We find that firms with more informative stock prices have higher revenues, lower operating costs

(SG&A), and lower labor expenses. The higher revenues and lower costs help improve productivity.

    We expect the strength of the relation between SPI and TFP to vary depending on firm

characteristics. First, we would expect the relation to be weaker for larger firms. Holmstrom (1989)

argues that larger firms are more bureaucratic, which increases adjustment costs for these firms. We

find that the relation between SPI and TFP is weaker, but still holds, for larger firms. Second, we expect

older firms to adjust more slowly as well as they have developed more formal processes to manage their

operations and are more hierarchical (Loderer, Stulz, and Walchli, 2016). We find that this is indeed

the case. The literature cited earlier implies that firms learn about acquisitions through their stock price.

Hence, we would expect acquisitive firms to benefit more from a more informative stock price. Again,

we find support for this hypothesis.

    With more complex firms, investors and managers are expected to find it more difficult to extract

information from the stock price. Using firm-level diversification as an index of complexity, we find

that the impact of SPI on TFP is weaker for diversified firms. Firms with riskier businesses are less

certain about their internal information and, therefore, their decisions should rely relatively more on the

information in their stock price. Our results pertaining to business risk support this prediction. Within

a firm, labor is generally more easily reallocated among different projects than capital. For example,

capital (e.g. machines and other equipment) generally has a specific function (in a specific business

line) that is difficult to change. But employees (labor) can often perform similar tasks across different

projects and can be retained. If firms can adjust labor inputs more easily than capital inputs, we would

expect that a higher capital-labor ratio weakens the effect of SPI on TFP. Our empirical findings support

this prediction.


                                                      3
    Economic theory suggests that the incentives of firms to use stock price information differ across

firms depending on their financial situation and on the environment they are in. Financially constrained

firms have strong incentives to allocate resources efficiently to relax their financial constraints, but they

may find it difficult to use stock price information that requires funding. We find that the impact of SPI

on TFP is stronger for financially constrained firms. Firms that operate in a more competitive

environment have stronger incentives to make the best use of their resources as they operate with little

slack (e.g., Hart, 1983). We find that the impact of SPI on TFP is stronger for such firms. Lastly, better

corporate governance should provide stronger incentives for management to allocate resources

efficiently, so that the impact of SPI on TFP should be stronger for firms that have better governance.

Our evidence is supportive of that prediction.

    Our contributions are as follows. First, the paper adds to the literature on corporate productivity.

We provide evidence that informative stock prices have a positive effect on firms’ TFP. It is consistent

with the findings in the literature that SPI improves corporate decisions such as investment and M&A.

Second, we conduct comprehensive investigations on characteristics which amplify or minimize the

effect SPI has on TFP. Relevant firm characteristics, financial frictions, product market competition,

and governance all play important roles. Third, our paper adds to the discussion on the effect of financial

markets on the real economy. There is a large literature on whether the stock market is a sideshow.

Recently, David, Hopenhayn, and Venkateswaran (2016) find that learning from financial markets

contributes little to firms’ resource allocation. Fourth, our paper contributes to the literature that assesses

the benefits and costs of exchange listings for corporations. Our findings are consistent with a role of

the stock market in providing information to investors and managers that helps make firms more

efficient.

    Section 2 introduces the measures of stock price informativeness. Section 3 describes the data

sources and the sample. Section 4 provides our evidence on the impact of SPI on TFP. Section 5 shows

the channels through which SPI impacts productivity. Section 6 investigates the cross-sectional

variation in the impact of SPI on TFP. Section 7 provides evidence that SPI affects other measures of

firm efficiency. Section 8 concludes.

2. Measures of stock price informativeness

      We mainly use two measures of stock price informativeness, which are annual measures based on

high frequency tick size trading, or stock daily trading activities. The first measure is the probability of

information-based trading (PIN), which follows from a market microstructure model (Easley,

Hvidkjaer, and O’Hara, 2002). The logic is that, when there is more informed trading in a stock, new

information is more likely to be incorporated into that stock’s price, which improves the stock’s price

informativeness. High PIN means high stock price informativeness. The second measure is the stock’s

price nonsynchronicity (PSI), which captures the firm-specific stock return variation (Durnev, Morck,

and Yeung, 2004). The logic is that when there is more firm-specific information in the stock price, the

stock return is less correlated with market and industry returns. High PSI means high stock price

informativeness. Both measures are widely used as stock price informativeness measures in the

literature.2



2.1. Probability of information-based trading (PIN)

      PIN measures the probability of information-based trading. Suppose that on a day new information

appears with probability 𝛼, with probability 𝛿 the news is bad, and with probability 1 − 𝛿 the news is

good. The probability of no news on a day is 1 − 𝛼. The trading orders follow Poisson distributions.

Uninformed traders trade irrespective of whether new information arrives or not. The arrival rate of

uninformed buy (sell) orders is 𝜀𝑏 (𝜀𝑠 ). The traders with private information only trade when there is

new information and the arrival rate is 𝜇. The informed trader will only buy if the news is good and

only sell if the news is bad. Given these parameters (𝛼, 𝛿, 𝜇, 𝜀𝑏 , 𝜀𝑠 ), the probability of information-based

trading is

                                                       α⋅μ
                                        PIN =                      ,                                      (1)
                                                α ⋅ μ + (εb + εs )

where the denominator is the arrival rate for all orders and the numerator is the arrival rate of informed

orders.




2
    For example, see Chen, Goldstein and Jiang (2007) and Ferreira, Ferreira and Raposo (2011).


                                                         5
    The parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood. On day i, we observe the number of buy

orders 𝐵𝑖 and the number of sell orders S𝑖 . Denote the Poisson distribution function as 𝑃(𝑘; 𝜆) =

    𝜆𝑘
𝑒 −𝜆 𝑘! , where 𝑘 is the number of arrivals and 𝜆 is the arrival rate. Then the likelihood function for a

trading day is:

         L(α, δ, μ, εb , εs |B𝑖 , S𝑖 ) = (1 − α) ⋅ P(B𝑖 ; εb ) ⋅ P(S𝑖 ; εs ) + α ⋅ δ ⋅ P(B𝑖 ; εb ) ⋅ P(S𝑖 ; μ + εs )

                                      +α ⋅ (1 − δ) ⋅ P(B𝑖 ; μ + εb ) ⋅ P(S𝑖 ; εs )                                     (2)

    Assuming that trading activity across days is independently distributed, the likelihood function

within a year is:
                                                     𝐼

                                             V = ∏ L(α, δ, μ, εb , εs |B𝑖 , S𝑖 ) ,                                     (3)
                                                    𝑖=1

where 𝐼 is the number of trading days in a year.

    Based on TAQ data and the Lee and Ready (1991) algorithm, we calculate the number of daily buy

and sell orders for a stock. We then use maximum likelihood to calculate the parameters (𝛼, 𝛿, 𝜇, 𝜀𝑏 , 𝜀𝑠 )

based on the data in a year. In turn, PIN is calculated for a stock in a given year.



2.2. Stock price nonsynchronicity (𝑃𝑆𝐼)

    The stock price nonsynchronicity, PSI, is a measure of stock price informativeness based on the R2

from asset pricing regressions, following Roll (1988) and Morck, Yeung, and Yu (2000). We

decompose the stock return into the systematic part explained by the market return and industry return,

and a firm-specific residual variation. When there is relatively more firm-specific variation, the return

co-moves less with the market return and the industry return, so that R2 is smaller. To perform our

decomposition, we use the following linear regression:

                                        r𝑗,𝑖,𝑡 = β𝑗,0 + β𝑗,𝑚 r𝑚,𝑡 + β𝑗,𝑖 r𝑖,𝑡 + ε𝑖,𝑗,𝑡 ,                               (4)

where j is for firm j, i is for industry i, and t is for day t, r𝑗,𝑖,𝑡 is the stock return of firm j in industry i

(three-digit SIC) on day t, r𝑚,𝑡 is the value weighted market return on day t, and r𝑖,𝑡 is the value

weighted industry return on day t. The weights are based on market capitalization. When calculating




                                                             6
the market and industry value weighted returns for firm j, the return of firm j is excluded to prevent

spurious correlations between firm and industry returns in industries that contain few firms.

    The regression is estimated for each firm j within a year, and the R2 of the regression is used to

construct PSI𝑗 for stock j in a given year as follows:

                                                       1 − R𝑗2
                                         PSI𝑗 = ln (             )                                   (5)
                                                         R𝑗2

    In the above equation, PSI𝑗 is transformed to address the skewness and boundedness of 1 − R𝑗2

(Morck, Yeung and Yu, 2000). The stock price is more informative when a stock becomes less

correlated with the market and industry returns, i.e., when R𝑗2 falls and hence PSI𝑗 increases.



2.3. Additional measures of stock price informativeness

    Besides PIN and PSI, we also investigate the relation between SPI and TFP using two additional

SPI measures: Gamma and Adjusted PIN. Gamma measures the amount of trading-based information

in stock prices. It is originally constructed by Llorente, Michaely, and Wang (2002), and used by Fresard

(2012) and Foucault and Fresard (2014). We apply two alternative versions of Gamma. The first version

follows Llorente, Michaely, and Wang (2002) and Fresard (2012), where both the firm stock return and

the market return are controlled for in the calculation of Gamma. We denote this version as

Gamma(Market). The second version follows an original design by Llorente, Michaely, and Wang

(2002), where only the firm stock return is controlled for in the calculation of Gamma. We denote this

version as Gamma(No Market). Duarte and Young (2009) develop Adjusted PIN, which we denote by

APIN. APIN refines PIN by removing the liquidity component of PIN so that only the portion related

to asymmetric information remains.



3. Data and sample

    Our firm-level accounting data are from Compustat. We use TAQ data to calculate PIN and daily

stock file of CRSP to calculate PSI and the standard deviation of stock returns. Institutional ownership

and blockholder data are from Thomson Reuters 13F. Our governance measure, the E-index, is from




                                                    7
RiskMetrics. The competition variables we use are from the Hoberg-Phillips data library. 3 CEO

characteristics are from Execucomp and BoardEx.

    Our sample only includes firms with non-missing accounting data and non-missing stock price

informativeness (we require at least one of PIN or PSI for a firm-year to be included in our sample).

PIN is first available in 1993 as that is the first year TAQ data is available. In our analysis, we use the

average PIN and PSI over the previous three years (we require at least one non-missing value in the

previous three years). We use a backward looking approach to help alleviate reverse causality concerns.

Our sample is from 1994 to 2015 and includes 66,341 firm-year observations.

    Our main dependent variable is total factor productivity (TFP). TFP measures the overall

effectiveness and efficiency with which capital and labor are used in the production process. We

estimate the production function following Ackerberg, Caves, and Frazer (2015). Compared with the

previous methods (Olley and Pakes, 1996, and Levinsohn and Petrin, 2003), Ackerberg, Caves, and

Frazer (2015) address the functional dependence problem and estimate all input coefficients in the

second stage of the estimation. The detailed description of our method to estimate TFP can be found in

Appendix B.

    The control variables used in our main tests are the natural logarithm of total assets, Tobin’s Q,

cash scaled by assets, debt scaled by assets, and R&D scaled by assets. The definitions for all variables

can be found in the appendix. The summary statistics of our main variables are reported in Table 1. The

mean values of our SPI variables, PIN and PSI, are 0.22 and 2.22 respectively, which are in line with

previous studies.4



4. Empirical evidence
    In this section, we first present our baseline OLS regressions. We then turn to various approaches

to account for endogeneity.

4.1 Baseline regressions

       The informational role of stock prices helps firms allocate their resources more efficiently. This

implies that SPI has a positive effect on TFP. Our baseline regression specification regresses TFP on

lagged average SPI and controls for firm characteristics, year fixed effects, and firm fixed effects:

                            𝑇𝐹𝑃𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 ⋅ 𝑆𝑃𝐼𝑖,𝑡−3,𝑡−1 + 𝑋𝑖𝑡 ⋅ Γ + 𝜇𝑖 + 𝜗𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡 ,                        (6)

where i is the firm index, t is the year index, 𝑆𝑃𝐼𝑖,𝑡−3,𝑡−1 stands for the measure of stock price

informativeness, which is the average of the previous 3 years,5 X is the vector of control variables, Γ is

the coefficient vector for the control variables, 𝜇𝑖 is the firm fixed effect, 𝜗𝑡 is the year fixed effect, and

𝜀𝑖𝑡 is the error term. The results are reported in Table 2.

       Panel A of Table 2 shows the results for our main SPI measures, PIN and PSI. Models 1 and 3 use

PIN as the SPI measure. Model 1 controls for firm size and Tobin’s Q. Model 3 also includes cash

holdings, leverage, and R&D as control variables. We use the full list of control variables in Model 3

in the remainder of the paper. We include firm fixed effects to minimize potential issues related to firm-

invariant omitted variables. Estimated coefficients on PIN are positive and highly significant in both

models (t-statistics above 10). Models 2 and 4 use PSI as the SPI measure. The results are consistent

with those using PIN. The economic effects are also significant. One standard deviation increase in PIN

(PSI) leads to a 5.6% (5.9%) TFP increase in standard deviation units, based on the results in Models 3

(4).

       When we use PSI as the measure of SPI, we can actually have a longer sample period, because its

calculation relies on the CRSP daily stock files. Model 5 estimates Model 4 from 1975 to 2015. The

coefficient of PSI is significantly positive, but its economic magnitude is lower.

       Panel B of Table 2 shows the results for our additional SPI measures. Models 1, 2, 4, and 5 show

that the coefficients of Gamma (both versions) are significantly positive. In Models 3 and 6, the

estimated coefficients on the adjusted PIN (APIN) are significantly positive as well.




5
 In the unreported tests, we also use the average SPI of the previous 2 or 4 years. Our results remain strong and
are not sensitive to the time window for the average.


                                                        9
4.2 Endogeneity tests

    In Section 4.1, we reported the results from OLS regressions using different measures of SPI,

different sample periods, and different control variables. All the estimates of the coefficients on the

measures of SPI are significantly positive. In all the regressions, we use lagged values of the right-hand

side variables to mitigate reverse causation concerns, and use firm fixed effects to account for time-

invariant unobserved firm-specific variables. In this section, we further address endogeneity concerns

through the use of an instrumental variable (IV) for SPI, and through the use of difference-in-differences

analyses using brokerage house research department closing and S&P 500 Index additions as plausibly

exogenous events.



4.2.1   Instrumental variable approach

    The IV approach is one of the standard methods to address endogeneity concerns. A valid

instrumental variable (IV) of SPI needs to satisfy the following two conditions: i) the IV should be

correlated with SPI; ii) the IV should affect TFP only through SPI. An industry-level average SPI seems

to be an appropriate candidate because, within the industry, firms’ SPI may have a common component.

However, it is possible that a firm learns from the stock price of its close peers and hence is affected by

their SPI, which would violate the exclusion restriction. To avoid this issue, we construct an IV as

follows. We call the average SPI of firms in a 3-digit industry the industry-level SPI. Our IV is obtained

by taking the average of the industry-level SPIs within the two-digit industry of a firm, excluding the

industry-level SPI of the industry of the firm. Excluding the industry of the firm in constructing the IV

alleviates the concern that the exclusion restriction might be violated. It is unlikely that a firm’s TFP is

affected by the SPI of an average firm in another 3-digit SIC industry code except through the

correlation of that SPI with the firm’s SPI. We estimate two-stage least squares (2SLS) regressions with

firm and year fixed effects using that IV. The results are reported in Table 3.

    Models 1 and 2 are for PIN as the measure of SPI using the previously described industry SPI as

instrument. The first stage regression, where PIN is the dependent variable, is in Model 1. The

coefficient of the 2-digit SIC industry average SPI is positive and statistically significant at the 1%

level. The F-statistic in the first stage is 247.14, which provides strong support for the relevance


                                                    10
condition. Model 2 reports the second-stage regression where TFP is the dependent variable. The

coefficient on the instrumented PIN is positive and statistically significant at the 1% level. This result

indicates that the effect of PIN on TFP remains strong. Models 3 and 4 provide estimates using PSI.

They are consistent with those of Models 1 and 2. In the two-stage least squares test, PSI also has a

significantly positive effect on TFP. The results of the IV method support the causal effect of SPI on

TFP.

    A concern with our instrumental approach is that our TFP measure could have some industry

component which could drive the results of our IV tests. To address this possibility, we regress our TFP

measure on industry and year indicator variables. We then use this filtered TFP measure in our IV tests.

Our results (not reported) are similar.



4.2.2   DiD analysis

    In this section, we carry out difference-in-differences analyses based on plausibly exogenous shocks

to firms’ SPI. Specifically, we first use brokerage house closures as exogenous shocks to the information

production of the covered stocks (Kelly and Ljungqvist, 2012). Such events involve the closure of

brokerage house research departments as well. These research departments provide information

production to their clients, including both institutional and retail clients. Their research affects the

generation of both private and public information on the firms they cover. Second, we consider the

impact of additions to the S&P 500 Index on firm productivity through their impact on SPI.



4.2.2.a Research department closures

    When research departments are closed, less information on the firms they cover is available to

institutional and retail investors. We therefore expect the SPI for the stocks of these firms to fall. The

closure of a brokerage house research department has little or nothing to do with the fundamentals of

the covered firms. So, these shocks to the firms’ stocks are largely exogenous.

    To identify closures of brokerage houses, we start from the closures listed in Kelly and Ljungqvist

(2012). We match the closure dates with the “delisting” (last) date of brokerage houses and the number

of firms they cover in IBES. Of the 22 closures listed, we are able to match 7 using the last date a


                                                   11
brokerage appears in IBES and the number of firms it covers. The first closure event is in 2000 and the

last is in 2007. We define the yearly event window for each closure as [-3, +3] years. It leads to a test

sample from 1997 to 2010.

    We define a dummy variable, 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡_𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 , which equals one if a firm experienced a

brokerage closure over the last one, two, or three years, and zero otherwise. The DiD specification is as

follows:

                     𝑇𝐹𝑃𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 ⋅ 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡_𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑡 + 𝑋𝑖𝑡 ⋅ Γ + 𝜇𝑖 + 𝜗𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡 ,                        (7)

where i is the firm index, t is the year index, X is the vector of control variables, Γ is the coefficient

vector of the controls, 𝜇𝑖 is the firm fixed effect, 𝜗𝑡 is the year fixed effect, and 𝜀𝑖𝑡 is the error term. We

drop the year of the closure in the regression analysis. The estimates are reported in Table 4.

    Model 1 shows that the coefficient of 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡_𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 is negative and statistically significant at

the 5% level. It indicates that negative shocks to SPI have a negative impact on the treated firms’

productivity. Specifically, compared to the control firms, the treated firms experience a 6.4% TFP

decrease in standard deviation units. This result supports the causal interpretation of the estimates of

the coefficients of SPI in regressions of TFP on SPI.

    To check if the treated group and the control group have similar TFPs before the shocks, we define

an indicator variable, 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡_𝑃𝑟𝑒, which equals one if the firm experienced a brokerage closure

in the following one, two or three years and zero otherwise. We estimate the following regression:

    𝑇𝐹𝑃𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 ⋅ 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡_𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽2 ⋅ 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡_𝑃𝑟𝑒𝑖𝑡 + 𝑋𝑖𝑡 ⋅ Γ + 𝜇𝑖 + 𝜗𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡 ,                  (8)

where i is the firm index, t is the year index, X is the vector of control variables, Γ is the coefficient

vector of the controls, 𝜇𝑖 is the firm fixed effect, 𝜗𝑡 is the year fixed effect, and 𝜀𝑖𝑡 is the error term.

The result is reported in Model 2 of Table 4.

    Model 2 shows that the coefficient of 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡_𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 is still significantly negative, consistent

with the result of Model 1. However, the coefficient of 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡_𝑃𝑟𝑒 is not statistically significant.

This indicates that in the years before the shock, years [-3, -1], the treated firms’ TFP is not statistically

different from that of the control firms. This result supports the interpretation that the post-event




                                                      12
decrease in TFP of treated firms is caused by the brokerage house closures which served as negative

exogenous shocks to SPI.

    We also construct a propensity score matched (PSM) sample, and carry out the DiD analysis on this

PSM sample. In the PSM sample, the treated firms are those which experience brokerage closures and

control firms are those that do not. We first restrict the potential control firms to those i) which have at

least one analyst covering the firms, ii) are not covered by any of the seven brokerage houses that

ultimately close, and iii) have Compustat data available during the sample period. We then match treated

firms to control firms using the Mahalanobis distance. We only consider matches in the same two-digit

SIC code and then find the closest firm in terms of the total assets and Tobin’s Q. For the matched

sample, we estimate the same regressions as those in Models 1 and 2 of Table 4. The results are reported

in Models 3 and 4 of Table 4.

    Model 3 shows that the coefficient of 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡_𝑃𝑜𝑠𝑡 is negative and statistically significant at

the 1% level. This result is consistent with the result in Model 1 using the full sample. Compared to

Model 1, the treatment effect more than doubles. The result in Model 4 is also consistent with that in

Model 3: the treatment effect remains negative and highly significant. The treatment effect almost

doubles compared to Model 2 for the full sample. The coefficient of 𝑇𝑟𝑒𝑎𝑡𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡_𝑃𝑟𝑒 is not statistically

significant.



4.2.2.b S&P 500 Index additions

    The firms in the S&P 500 Index are selected by a committee based on eight primary criteria.6 The

selected firms have little control on the selection process, so that much research that examines the

impact of additions to the S&P 500 Index treats the event as exogenous (see, for instance, Harris and

Gurel, 1986, and Shleifer, 1986).7 Existing research shows that prices of S&P 500 stocks are more likely

to comove with the index (Vijh, 1994; Barberis, Shleifer, and Wurgler, 2005). Greater comovement



6
  The primary criteria include specific requirements on the following eight dimensions: market capitalization,
liquidity, domicile, public float, sector classification, financial viability, length of time publicly traded and stock
exchange. More details can be found at http://us.spindices.com/documents/methodologies/methodology-sp-us-
indices.pdf

  An exception is Denis, McConnell, Ovtchinnikov, and Yu (2003).


                                                          13
implies that less firm-specific information is incorporated in the stock prices of firms in the index. As a

result, if a firm is added to the index, its stock price informativeness falls. Accordingly, we expect that

being added to the index reduces a firm’s productivity.

    To carry out the DiD analysis based on S&P 500 Index additions, we define a treatment dummy,

𝑆𝑃500_𝐴𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝑡 + 1, 𝑡 + 3), which equals one if a firm was added to the S&P 500 Index over the

last one, two, or three years and zero otherwise. The DiD specification is as follows:

         𝑇𝐹𝑃𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 ⋅ 𝑆𝑃500_𝐴𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝑡 + 1, 𝑡 + 3)𝑖𝑡 + 𝑋𝑖𝑡 ⋅ Γ + 𝜇𝑖 + 𝜗𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡 ,                    (9)

where i is the firm index, t is the year index, X is the vector of control variables, Γ is the coefficient

vector of the controls, 𝜇𝑖 is the firm fixed effect, 𝜗𝑡 is the year fixed effect, and 𝜀𝑖𝑡 is the error term.

The estimates are reported in Table 5. Model 1 shows that a firm’s TFP is significantly reduced after it

is added into the S&P 500 Index.

    To check if the treated group and the control group have similar TFPs before the shock, we define

a pre-treatment dummy, 𝑆𝑃500_𝐴𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝑡 − 1), which equals one if the firm was added to the S&P

500 Index in the following year and zero otherwise. We estimate the following specification:

       𝑇𝐹𝑃𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 ⋅ 𝑆𝑃500_𝐴𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝑡 + 1, 𝑡 + 3)𝑖𝑡 + 𝛽2 ⋅ 𝑆𝑃500_𝐴𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛(𝑡 − 1)𝑖𝑡 + 𝑋𝑖𝑡 ⋅ Γ

                     + 𝜇𝑖 + 𝜗𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡 ,                                                                 (10)

where i is the firm index, t is the year index, X is the vector of control variables, Γ is the coefficient

vector of the controls, 𝜇𝑖 is the firm fixed effect, 𝜗𝑡 is the year fixed effect, and 𝜀𝑖𝑡 is the error term.

The result is reported in Model 2 of Table 5. The result shows that there is no significant TFP difference

between treated and control groups before the index addition, which supports the parallel trend

condition of our DiD analysis. The coefficient of the treatment dummy remains significantly positive,

and is very similar to the coefficient in Model 1.

    We also construct a propensity score matched (PSM) sample, and carry out the DiD analysis on this

PSM sample. In the PSM sample, the treated firms are those which are added to the S&P 500 Index and

the control firms are those that are not. We restrict the potential control firms to firms i) which are never

added to the S&P 500 Index at any time during the sample period and ii) have Compustat data available

during the sample period. We then match treated firms to control firms using the Mahalanobis distance.




                                                     14
We only consider matches in the same two-digit SIC code and then find the closest firm in terms of

total assets and Tobin’s Q. For the matched sample, we estimate the same regressions as those in Models

1 and 2 of Table 5. The results are reported in Models 3 and 4 of Table 5. The DiD analysis based on

the matched sample delivers very similar results to those in the full sample tests. Firms added in the

S&P 500 Index experience a reduction in productivity, which supports our results that a decrease in SPI

leads to lower firm productivity.

    In this section, both the IV approach and the DiD analyses provide strong and consistent support

for the causal effect of SPI on TFP. These results are consistent with the view that financial markets

have real effects on the economy through their informational role.



5. Channels for TFP improvement

    SPI can affect TFP by increasing output for given inputs and by decreasing inputs for given output.

Consequently, to understand how SPI affects TFP, it is useful to assess separately how it affects inputs

and output. The inputs that we consider include firms’ general operating expenses (SG&A, scaled by

sales) and labor costs. We use revenue as the measure of output. We expect that SPI increases output

and decreases inputs, which in turn leads to a TFP improvement. Our specification is as follows.


                         𝐼𝑂𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 ⋅ 𝑆𝑃𝐼𝑖,𝑡−3,𝑡−1 + 𝑋𝑖𝑡 ⋅ Γ + 𝜇𝑖 + 𝜗𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡 ,                        (11)


where i is for firm i, t is for year t, IO stands for the measures of input and output, 𝑆𝑃𝐼𝑖,𝑡−3,𝑡−1 stands

for PIN or PSI averaged over the previous 3 years, X is the vector of control variables, Γ is the

coefficient vector of the controls, 𝜇𝑖 is the firm fixed effect, 𝜗𝑡 is the year fixed effect, and 𝜀𝑖𝑡 is for the

error term. The results are reported in Table 6.

    Models 1 and 2 show that SPI increases output as measured by the logarithm of revenues. The

coefficients of PIN and PSI are both positive and significant at the 1% level, which indicates that SPI

has a positive effect on firm output. Models 3 and 4 show that SPI decreases general operating costs

(SG&A, scaled by sales). The coefficients of PIN and PSI are both negative and statistically significant

at the 1% or the 5% level. These estimates are consistent with the idea that informative stock prices

facilitate market monitoring and drive managers to minimize SG&A costs to improve efficiency.


                                                      15
Models 5 to 6 show that SPI decreases labor costs. The coefficients of both SPI measures are all

significantly negative and indicate that firms with more informative stock prices spend less on wages.

Specifically, a one standard deviation increase of PIN (PSI) decreases wage payments by 3% (3%).

These real effects on the revenues, the SG&A and labor costs identify some concrete channels through

which SPI affects TFP.



6. Cross-sectional heterogeneity

    We expect the ability and incentives of firms to take advantage of stock price informativeness to

exhibit cross-sectional variation. In this section, we first look at firm characteristics that affect a firm’s

ability to extract information from its stock price. We then consider firms that are financially

constrained. Finally, we consider how the relation between SPI and TFP is affected by governance.



6.1 Firm characteristics

    The effect of SPI on TFP should depend on firm characteristics. We consider five firm

characteristics: firm size, firm age, acquisition activity, complexity, and capital intensity. For each

characteristic, we develop predictions on how it affects the relation between SPI and TFP. Empirically,

we test our hypotheses using the following specification:

   𝑇𝐹𝑃𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝜷𝟏 ⋅ 𝐹𝑖𝑡 × 𝑆𝑃𝐼𝑖,𝑡−3,𝑡−1 + 𝛽2 ⋅ 𝑆𝑃𝐼𝑖,𝑡−3,𝑡−1 + 𝛽3 ⋅ 𝐹𝑖𝑡 + 𝑋𝑖𝑡 ⋅ Γ + 𝜇𝑖 + 𝜗𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡 , (12)

where i is the firm index, t is the year index, 𝑆𝑃𝐼𝑖,𝑡−3,𝑡−1 is the average of the previous 3 years of the

measure of informativeness, F stands for the firm characteristic we are investigating. Γ is the coefficient

vector of the controls, 𝜇𝑖 is the firm fixed effect, 𝜗𝑡 is the year fixed effect, and 𝜀𝑖𝑡 is the error term.

The results are reported in Table 7.

    It is more difficult for larger firms to benefit from private information in stock prices. They are less

able to adjust their organizational structure or production procedures. For example, a larger bureaucracy

makes innovation more time consuming which in turn reduces the speed of productivity improvements

(Holmstrom 1989). We expect the TFP of large firms to be less sensitive to SPI, which corresponds to

a negative 𝛽1 in equation (12). The high asset dummy equals one if a firm’s total assets exceed the yearly




                                                     16
median and zero otherwise. Models 1 and 2 of Table 7 show the estimates. Both 𝛽1 ’s are negative and

statistically significant at the 1% level. The results support our hypothesis that larger firms are less

flexible and thus less able to take advantage of the information in their stock prices. However, it is

important to note that the result that TFP increases with SPI holds for large firms, so that it is not a

result driven by small firms. Specifically, if we exclude the bottom third of firms by asset size, we still

find a relation between TFP and SPI (not tabulated).

    Older firms are also at a disadvantage when it comes to utilizing the private information in their

stock prices. When firms become older, they are less able to adjust and take advantage of new growth

opportunities (Loderer, Stulz, and Waelchli 2016). This lower flexibility makes it more difficult for

older firms to benefit from the private information in their stock prices. We expect the TFP of older

firms to be less sensitive to SPI, so that β1 should be negative. We measure a firm’s age by the number

of years after its first appearance on CRSP (e.g., Fama and French, 2001, Pastor and Veronesi, 2003,

and Loderer, Stulz, and Waelchli, 2016). The results are reported in Table 6. Models 3 and 4 of Table

6 show that the coefficients β1 for the interaction terms (both PIN and PSI) are negative and statistically

significant at the 1% level. They confirm that older firms benefit less from the private information in

their stock prices.

    Acquisitions are typically the largest discrete investment firms make. Any acquisition could

potentially have a large impact on a firm’s productivity. As discussed earlier, firms seem to gather much

information from the market with respect to acquisitions. Therefore, we expect the productivity of firms

with acquisitions to be more sensitive to SPI. We measure the acquisition activity by an acquisition

indicator variable, which equals one if a firm carries out an acquisition in a given year and zero

otherwise. The results are shown in Models 5 and 6. The coefficient of the interaction term, 𝛽1 , is

positive and statistically significant at the 1% level in both models. Firms acquiring new assets utilize

the information in their stock price to achieve a more efficient asset allocation and benefit more in terms

of productivity as a result.

    We expect the stock price to be less useful for more complex firms. We use firm-level

diversification as an index of complexity. In stock markets, new information is incorporated into stock

prices at the firm level, not at the business segment level. When a firm has more business segments, the


                                                    17
information in its stock price is more difficult to interpret. When unique information on different

business segments is aggregated, the information may not always be consistent or easy to interpret.

Consequently, it is more challenging for managers to utilize the information in the firm’s stock price to

improve the performance of different segments. We expect the TFP of more diversified firms to be less

sensitive to SPI. We measure diversification by the diversification dummy, which equals one if a firm

has more than one business segment and zero otherwise.8 The results are reported in Table 7.

    In Models 7 and 8, the coefficient of the diversification dummy, β1 , is negative and statistically

significant at the 1% level. This indicates that diversified firms’ productivity is less affected by their

SPI, so that diversification weakens the effect of SPI on TFP. The stock prices of more diversified firms

have less of a potential to guide the firms towards optimal resource allocation. This may be one reason

why diversification hurts productivity.

    Adjustment costs tend to be lower with labor than capital. For example, capital (e.g., machines and

other equipment) generally has a specific function (in a specific business line) that is difficult to change.

But the employees (labor) are more easily reallocated to other projects. As a result, a firm that has a

higher capital-labor ratio may find it more difficult to adjust to new information obtained from the stock

price. Therefore, we expect a high capital-labor ratio to weaken the effect of SPI on TFP.

    The high capital-labor ratio dummy equals one if a firm’s capital-labor ratio is in the top yearly

tercile and zero otherwise. Models 9 and 10 in Table 7 show the estimates for that variable. The

coefficient (𝛽1 ) of the interaction between High capital-labor ratio and the informativeness measure is

significantly negative for both measures. In summary, the productivity of firms with a higher capital-

labor ratio is less sensitive to the stock price informativeness.

    Firms with risky businesses tend to rely less on the internal information and more on an outside

signal. We measure business risk by the standard deviation of daily stock return during the previous

year. As such, we expect the TFP of a riskier firm to be more sensitive to its SPI. Models 11 and 12

confirm the amplification effect of business risk. Both 𝛽1 ’s are positive and statistically significant at

the 1% level. Riskier firms rely more on their SPI.


8
 In unreported tests, we also use the number of segments as the measure for diversification, and the results are
consistent.


                                                      18
6.2 Financial constraints

    Financially constrained firms have strong incentives to take steps to relax their constraints.

Improving their resource allocation helps them in relaxing their constraints as it improves their

performance. At the same time, however, these firms are likely to be constrained in implementing

changes that require funding.9 Consequently, whether the productivity of financially constrained firms

is more or less affected by SPI depends on whether making use of the information in the stock price

requires the use of additional funds. As long as the information in the stock price can be used without

additional funds, we expect the productivity of financially constrained firms to be more affected by SPI.

    We use five different financial constraint measures that are widely used in the literature. They are

a dividend dummy (which equals one if the firm pays a dividend and zero otherwise), the Whited and

Wu index (Whited and Wu, 2006), the Size and Age index from Hadlock and Pierce (2010), a dummy

for S&P bond rating, and a dummy for S&P commercial paper rating (Denis and Sibikov, 2010). Our

specification is as follows.

         𝑇𝐹𝑃𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 ⋅ 𝐹𝐶𝑖𝑡 × 𝑆𝑃𝐼𝑖,𝑡−3,𝑡−1 + 𝛽2 ⋅ 𝑆𝑃𝐼𝑖,𝑡−3,𝑡−1 + 𝛽3 ⋅ 𝐹𝐶𝑖𝑡 + 𝑋𝑖𝑡 ⋅ Γ + 𝜇𝑖 + 𝜗𝑡

                     + 𝜀𝑖𝑡 ,                                                                            (13)

where i is the firm index, t is the year index, 𝑆𝑃𝐼𝑖,𝑡−3,𝑡−1 stands for PIN or PSI, which is the average of

the previous 3 years accordingly, FC stands for the measure of financial constraints, X is the vector of

control variables, Γ is the coefficient vector of the controls, 𝜇𝑖 is the firm fixed effect, 𝜗𝑡 is the year

fixed effect, and 𝜀𝑖𝑡 is the error term. We expect the coefficient of the interaction terms to be positive,

which indicates an amplification effect of financial constraints. The results are reported in Table 8.

    Table 8 estimates 10 models for 5 measures of financial constraints. For each measure, we show

results for PIN and PSI. The relevant interaction term, 𝛽1 , has a significant positive coefficient in each

model. In eight of the ten models, the coefficient is statistically significant at the 1% level, and in the

remaining two models, the coefficient is significant at the 5% level. These results provide strong and




9
 Note that a higher SPI makes a firm more transparent to outside capital providers. Hence, a higher SPI could
also relax financial constraints by making outsiders more willing to provide funds as they understand the firm
better.


                                                     19
consistent evidence that financially constrained firms benefit more from the informativeness of their

stock price.



6.3 Product market competition

    More competition in the product market gives firms a stronger motive to improve productivity, so

that they can survive or gain larger market share. We therefore expect firms in more competitive markets

to have greater incentives to make use of the information in their stock price. We should find that

product market competition amplifies the effect of SPI on productivity.

    We use three text-based network industry classification (TNIC) competition measures: product

market fluidity (Hoberg, Phillips and Prabhala, 2014), product similarity, and TNIC HHI concentration

(Hoberg and Phillips, 2016). These measures are from the Hoberg and Phillip data library. In our

analysis, we define three dummy variables for high competition based on these three measures: High

Similarity, High Fluidity, and Low HHI. High Similarity (Fluidity) equals one if the product similarity

(fluidity) is above the yearly median and zero otherwise. Low HHI equals one if the TNIC HHI is below

the yearly median and zero otherwise. Our specification is as follows:

        𝑇𝐹𝑃𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 ⋅ 𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑡 × 𝑆𝑃𝐼𝑖,𝑡−3,𝑡−1 + 𝛽2 ⋅ 𝑆𝑃𝐼𝑖,𝑡−3,𝑡−1 + 𝛽3 ⋅ 𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑒𝑡𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑡

                    +𝑋𝑖𝑡 ⋅ Γ + 𝜇𝑖 + 𝜗𝑡 + 𝜀𝑖𝑡 ,                                                          (14)

where i is the firm index, t is the year index, 𝑆𝑃𝐼𝑖,𝑡−3,𝑡−1 is three-year average of the informativeness

measure, Competition stands for the product market competition measure, X is the vector of control

variables, Γ is the coefficient vector of the controls, 𝜇𝑖 is the firm fixed effect, 𝜗𝑡 is the year fixed effect,

and 𝜀𝑖𝑡 is the error term. We expect the coefficient of the interaction term (𝛽1 ) to be positive, which

indicates that firms in more competitive product markets are more likely to utilize their informative

stock prices to improve productivity. The results are reported in Table 9.

    Models 1 and 2 use the High Similarity variable. The product market is more competitive if the

products of the firms in the industry are close substitutes. High Similarity is a dummy for high

competition. The coefficients 𝛽1 in the first two models are positive and statistically significant at the

1% level. Model 1 (2) shows that for high competition firms, the effect of PIN (PSI) is amplified by




                                                       20
59% (64%) compared to the effect for low competition firms. Models 3 and 4 show estimates for High

Fluidity. Fluidity measures the extent to which rivals present competitive threats to the firm. Lastly,

Models 5 and 6 provide estimates for the coefficients of Low HHI. These results are consistent with the

results for the High Similarity variable. The estimates of 𝛽1 in these models are significantly positive.

All results in Table 9 are consistent with firms in more competitive product markets reacting to the

information in their stock price more strongly, and accordingly the SPI effect on TFP is amplified by

product market competition.



6.4 Corporate governance

    Firms learn from the information in their stock price, and use the information to optimize resource

allocation to increase productivity. When utilizing SPI to increase TFP, the amount of the information

in the stock price is only part of the story as managerial action is required to take advantage of that

information. If a firm has weak governance, the managers may shirk and ignore new information in the

stock price. Therefore, we expect SPI to have more of an impact on TFP in firms with better governance.

    Our corporate governance measures include the E-index (Bebchuk, Cohen, and Ferrell 2009), the

G-index (Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick 2003), a high institutional ownership dummy (based on median

in a year), and the number of blockholders (logarithm). Our regression model is as follows:

    𝑇𝐹𝑃𝑖𝑡 = 𝛽0 + 𝛽1 ⋅ 𝐺𝑜𝑣𝑖𝑡 × 𝑆𝑃𝐼𝑖,𝑡−3,𝑡−1 + 𝛽2 ⋅ 𝑆𝑃𝐼𝑖,𝑡−3,𝑡−1 + 𝛽3 ⋅ 𝐺𝑜𝑣𝑖𝑡 + 𝑋𝑖𝑡 ⋅ Γ + 𝜇𝑖 + 𝜗𝑡

                     + 𝜀𝑖𝑡 ,                                                                        (15)

where i is the firm index, t is the year index, 𝑆𝑃𝐼𝑖,𝑡−3,𝑡−1 stands for the three-year average of the

informativeness measure, Gov stands for the corporate governance measure, X is the vector of control

variables, Γ is the coefficient vector for the controls, 𝜇𝑖 is the firm fixed effect, 𝜗𝑡 is the year fixed

effect, and 𝜀𝑖𝑡 is the error term. We expect the coefficient of the interaction terms (𝛽1 ) to be negative

for the SPI interaction with the E-index or G-index (weak governance), and positive for the SPI

interaction with the remaining two measures. The results are reported in Table 10.

    Models 1 and 2 show estimates for the E-index. A high value of the E-index indicates more

entrenchment of managers and weaker governance. Model 1 (2) shows that the coefficient of the




                                                   21
interaction between the E-index and PIN (PSI), 𝛽1 , is negative and statistically significant at the 1%

level. Models 3 and 4 provide estimates for the interaction of informativeness with the G-index. The

estimates are similar to those of the first two Models, which confirms that the SPI effect on TFP is

stronger for firms with better governance.

    Models 5 and 6 show estimates for institutional ownership. It is common in the literature to view

higher institutional ownership as indicating more monitoring from institutional investors and better

external governance. We measure the strength of this governance by a High institutional ownership

dummy, which equals one if the institutional ownership is above the median in a year, and zero

otherwise. The coefficients of the interaction term in Models 5 and 6 are both positive and statistically

significant. They indicate that the TFP of firms with better governance is more sensitive to SPI.

    Our last governance measure is the number of blockholders (logarithm). A blockholder is a

shareholder holding at least 5% of firm’s shares outstanding. Blockholders have strong incentives to

monitor firms because they are less likely to be free riders as some shareholders with smaller holdings.

More blockholders suggests stronger governance. Models 7 and 8 show the relevant results. The

positive interaction between the number of blockholders and the infomativeness measure is positive in

both models, which confirms that firms with stronger governance have a stronger TFP-SPI sensitivity.

The evidence from all four measures of corporate governance consistently shows that TFP for firms

with better governance is more sensitive to SPI.



7   Alternative efficiency measures

    Informative stock prices assist firms in allocating resources more efficiently. Besides TFP, we also

test other efficiency measures. Following Loderer, Stulz, and Waelchli (2016), we use the following

five efficiency measures: sales/book-value-of-assets ratio, sales/value-of-assets-in-place (VAIP) ratio,

cost of goods sold (COGS) per employee, ROA, and the Negative net income (NI) dummy. The results

are shown in Table 11.

    Models 1 and 2 provide estimates using the sales/book-value-of-assets ratio as dependent variable.

The results show that PIN (PSI) has a positive coefficient, which is statistically significant at the 5%

(1%) level. Models 3 and 4 show results with sales/value-of-assets-in-place ratio as the dependent


                                                   22
variable. The results are consistent with those of Models 1 and 2. The results for the ratio of cost of

goods sold (COGS) per employee are shown in Models 5 and 6. The coefficient of PSI is negative and

statistically significant at the 1% level. The coefficient of PIN is not significant at the conventional

level. This is the only insignificant coefficient out of the ten in this table. Models 7 and 8 show results

for ROA. Both PIN and PSI have positive coefficients which are significant at the 1% level. Models 9

and 10 report results for the Negative NI dummy. Both PIN and PSI have negative coefficients that are

significant at the 1% level. The evidence for these alternative efficiency measures corroborates our

earlier findings that SPI improves firms’ efficiency.



8   Conclusions

    Financial markets have a real effect on the economy. Informative stock prices help firms allocate

resources more efficiently. Our paper provides evidence that the amount of information in stock prices

has a positive effect on firm-level productivity. We investigate how this effect varies along different

firm characteristics. We find that firm size, firm age, acquisition, complexity, and capital intensity all

matter to the effect of SPI on TFP. We also find that financial constraints, product market competition,

and better governance amplify the sensitivity of TFP to stock price informativeness.

    We address potential endogeneity concerns using multiple methods. Our baseline specification

includes firm fixed effect to get rid of any firm-invariant omitted variables and uses lagged measures

of informativeness. More importantly, we also explore an IV approach and difference-in-differences

analyses based on exogenous shocks to stock price informativeness. These efforts provide strong

evidence in support of the causal effect of stock price informativeness on TFP.

Appendix B: TFP Estimation
    Our main measure of productivity is the total factor productivity (TFP), which is the portion of

output not explained by the amount of inputs used in production. TFP increases as a firm uses its inputs

more efficiently. Consider a linear production function with capital and labor is:

                                         yi,t = β0 + βk k it + βl lit + ϵit                              (A1)

where yi,t is the log of the value added of the firm, k it is the log value of capital, lit is the log value of

labor, and ϵit is the error term, which relates to the productivity. A naïve estimation of TFP would be

the residuals in Equation A1. However, when making the decision on inputs, firms (managers) can have

some information on their productivity that econometricians do not know, which would make the input

variables and the error term correlated. To address this endogeneity concern, the production function in

Equation A1 is rewritten as follows.

                                         yi,t = β0 + βk k it + βl lit + ωit + εit                        (A2)

where yi,t is the log of the value added of the firm, k it is the log value of capital, lit is the log value of

labor, ωit is the part of the productivity known by the firm but not by the econometrician, and 𝜀𝑖𝑡 is the

part of the productivity unknown to both the firm and the econometrician.

    To calculate TFP, we first need to estimate the production function, i.e. the coefficients in Equation

A2. Then the TFP is just the residual. Due to the endogeneity issue mentioned above, the OLS estimator

is biased. In the literature, the effort to fix the endogeneity issue focuses on expressing ωit as a function

of some variables known by the econometrician. Specifically, first assume some corporate decision

variable (observable) is determined by ωit and the capital stock. Then express ωit as a function of the

corporate decision variable and the capital stock. For example, the decision variable in Olley and Pakes

(1996) is investment, and the decision variable in Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) is materials. Then

substitute the expression for ωit in Equation 2, and estimate the coefficients in a two-step procedure.

    Olley and Pakes (1996) and Levinsohn and Petrin (2003) both assume the decision variable is not

affected by labor, which is the key to estimate the coefficient of labor in the first step of the two-step

procedure. However, Ackerberg, Caves, and Frazer (2015) point out that such an assumption may not

fit well with the data. If the data is inconsistent this assumption, the coefficient on labor would be




                                                      30
estimated incorrectly because the true expression of ωit would include labor. Ackerberg, Caves, and

Frazer (2015) call this issue the functional dependence problem and propose a new method to estimate

the production function.

    In our paper, we use the methodology by Ackerberg, Caves, and Frazer (2015) to estimate the firm-

level production function. This means our calculation does not suffer from the functional dependence

problem. After estimating the production function, our firm-level TFP is calculated as the residual of

the production function. This is the main TFP measure in our empirical analysis. In our robustness tests,

we try an alternative firm-level TFP measure, which is calculated by Imrohoroglu and Tuzel (2014) and

based on the methodology in Olley and Pakes (1996). Our results are robust to the alternative TFP

measure.

    To calculate the firm-level TFP, we use firm data from Compustat. The construction of the variables

for the estimation follows İmrohoroğlu and Tüzel (2014). Besides the data from Compustat, we use the

following additional data for the production function estimation: i) the price index for Gross Domestic

Product (GDP) as a deflator for the value added, ii) the price index for private fixed investment as a

deflator for investment and capital (both from the Bureau of Economic Analysis), and iii) the national

average wage index from the Social Security Administration.

    Value added is Sales minus Material, deflated by GDP deflator. Sales are Revenue (revt) from

Compustat. Material is Total expenses minus Labor expenses. Total expenses is Revenue less Operating

income before depreciation and amortization (oibdp). Labor expenses is obtained by multiplying the

number of employees (emp) by average wages from the Social Security Administration. Capital is

measured as Gross plant, property, and equipment (ppegt) deflated by the price deflator for investment

and then adjusted to take into account the average age of the capital stock (Hall, 1990, Brynjolfsson and

Hitt, 2003).

    Denote the estimates of (β0 , βk , βl ) as (β̂0 , β̂k , β̂l ). Our TFP measure is calculated as the residual of

the regression as

                                           yi,t − β̂0 − β̂k k it − β̂l lit .

Table 2: Price informativeness and productivity
This table presents panel regressions of total factor productivity (TFP) on stock price informativeness and other
firm-level controls. In Panel A, stock price informativeness is measured by the probability of informed trading
(PIN) and stock price nonsynchronicity (PSI). In Panel B, we test additional SPI measures. The first measure is
Gamma, a trading-based informativeness measure calculated in Equation (12) in Llorente, Michaely, Saar and
Wang, (2002). We calculate this measure two ways. The first method (Columns 1 and 3) is as in Equation (3) in
Fresard (2012) and controls for both firm and market returns, while the second method (Columns 2 and 4) only
controls for firm returns as in the original Llorente, Michaely, Saar and Wang, (2002). The last additional stock
price informativeness measure, Adjusted-PIN (APIN), is calculated using Equation (7) in Duarte and Young
(2009). In our regressions, we use the average SPI over the previous three years. All specifications include firm
and year fixed effects. All columns are from 1994-2015 except for Column 5 in Panel A which is from 1975-
2015. Robust standard errors are clustered at the firm level. Variable definitions are in Appendix A. ***, **, *
denote significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

Table 3: Instrumental variable (IV) method and 2SLS
This table presents 2SLS regressions using the IV method. The IV is constructed as follows. We first calculate
the average SPI within each industry (3-digit SIC). We then take the average of the 3-digit SIC industry-level SPIs
within the corresponding 2-digit SIC industry. When taking the average, we exclude the 3-digit SIC industry-level
SPI for a firm, if the firm is in this 3-digit SIC industry. Then we use the average of this 2-digit SIC industry-level
SPI over the previous three years (t-3 to t-1) as our IV. Columns 1 and 3 show the results of the first stage
regression. Columns 2 and 4 show the results of the second stage regression. All specifications include firm and
year fixed effects. Robust standard errors are clustered at the firm level. Variable definitions are in Appendix A.
***, **, * denote significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

Table 4: DiD analysis: brokerage house closures and productivity
This table shows DiD tests based on the closures of brokerage house research departments. The sample is from
1997 to 2010. A firm is defined as a treated firm if its stock is covered by a closed research department. For each
closure event, we define the event window as [-3, +3]. The dummy Treatment_Post (Treatment_Pre) equals 1 if
a stock is covered by a closed research department and the year is between one and three years after (before) the
closure year and 0 otherwise. Closure years are dropped in the regressions. Columns 1 and 2 use the full sample.
Columns 3 and 4 use a matched sample. In the matched sample, for each treated firm, we match a control firm in
the same industry (2-digit SIC) by total assets and Tobin’s Q using Mahalanobis distance. All specifications
include firm and year fixed effects. Robust standard errors are clustered at the firm level. Variable definitions are
in Appendix A. ***, **, * denote significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

This table shows DiD tests based on S&P 500 Index additions. The treatment dummy, SP500_Addition (t+1, t+3),
equals 1 if a firm is added to the S&P 500 Index over the previous one, two, or three years, and 0 otherwise. The
pre-treatment dummy, SP500_Addition (t-1), equals 1 if the firm is added to the S&P 500 Index in the following
one year and 0 otherwise. Columns 1 and 2 use the full sample. Columns 3 and 4 use a matched sample. In the
matched sample, for each treated firm, we match a control firm in the same industry (2-digit SIC) by total assets

Table 6: Channels for TFP improvement
This table presents panel regressions of revenue, operating and labor expenses on stock price informativeness and other firm-level controls. The operating cost is
measured by SG&A (scaled by sales), and the labor cost is measures by the labor expenses (xlr in Compustat). Stock Price Informativeness is measured by the
probability of information-based trading (PIN) and stock price nonsynchronicity (PSI). In our regressions, we use the average PIN or PSI over the previous three
years. All specifications include firm and year fixed effects. Robust standard errors are clustered at the firm level. Variable definitions are in Appendix A. ***, **,
* denote significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

Table 7: Firm characteristics, price informativeness, and productivity
This table presents estimates of panel regressions of TFP on the interactions of firm characteristics and stock price informativeness and other firm level control variables. The
dependent variable in all specifications is TFP. Stock price informativeness is measured by the probability of information-based trading (PIN) and stock price nonsynchronicity
(PSI). In our regressions, we use the average PIN or PSI over the previous three years. All controls used in Columns 3 and 4 of Table 3 are included, but for brevity their
coefficients are not displayed. All specifications include firm and year fixed effects. Robust standard errors are clustered at the firm level. Variable definitions are in Appendix
A. ***, **, * denote significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

Table 8: Financial constraints, price informativeness, and productivity
This table presents estimates of panel regressions of TFP on the interactions of financial constraint measures and stock price informativeness and other firm level control variables.
We use five financial constraint measures: dividend dummy, Whited-Wu index, Hadlock and Pierce (2010) size and age index, bond rating dummy and commercial paper rating
dummy. The dependent variable in all specifications is TFP. Stock price informativeness is measured by the probability of information-based trading (PIN) and stock price
nonsynchronicity (PSI). In our regressions, we use the average PIN or PSI over the previous three years. All controls used in Columns 3 and 4 of Table 2 (Panel A) are included,
but for brevity their coefficients are not displayed. All specifications include firm and year fixed effects. Robust standard errors are clustered at the firm level. Variable definitions
are in Appendix A. ***, **, * denote significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

Table 9: Product market competition, stock price informativeness, and productivity
This table presents estimates of panel regressions of TFP on the interactions of product market competition measures
and stock price informativeness and other firm level control variables. Product market competition is measured by
product similarity, product market fluidity, TNIC HHI. The text-based network industry classification is used to
construct these measures, which are available at the Hoberg-Phillips Data Library. In the tests, dummy variables for
high competition are defined based on these competition measures: High Similarity, High Fluidity, and Low HHI,
which are based on the median of the relevant measures in a year. The dependent variable in all specifications is TFP.
Stock price informativeness is measured by the probability of information-based trading (PIN) and stock price
nonsynchronicity (PSI). In our regressions, we use the average PIN or PSI over the previous three years. All controls
used in Columns 3 and 4 of Table 2 (Panel A) are included, but for brevity their coefficients are not displayed. All
specifications include firm and year fixed effects. Robust standard errors are clustered at the firm level. Variable
definitions are in Appendix A. ***, **, * denote significance at the 1%, 5%, and 10% levels, respectively.

Table 10: Corporate governance and the complementary effect
This table presents estimates of panel regressions of TFP on the interactions of corporate governance measures and stock price informativeness and other firm level
control variables. The strength of corporate governance is measured by the E-index (Bebchuk, Cohen, and Ferrell, 2009), the G-index (Gompers, Ishii, and Metrick,
2003), a high institutional ownership dummy (based on median in a year), and the number of blockholders (logarithm). The dependent variable in all specifications
is TFP. Stock price informativeness is measured by the probability of information-based trading (PIN) and stock price nonsynchronicity (PSI). In our regressions,
we use the average PIN or PSI over the previous three years. All controls used in Columns 3 and 4 of Table 2 (Panel A) are included, but for brevity their coefficients
are not displayed. All specifications include firm and year fixed effects. Robust standard errors are clustered at the firm level. Variable definitions are in Appendix

Table 11: Alternative efficiency measures
This table presents panel regressions of different measures of productivity/efficiency on stock price informativeness and other firm-level controls. The measures
of productivity/efficiency are from Loderer, Stulz and Waechli (2016). Stock price informativeness is measured by the probability of information-based trading
(PIN) and stock price nonsynchronicity (PSI). In our regressions, we use the average PIN or PSI across the previous three years. All specifications include firm
and year fixed effects. Robust standard errors are clustered at the firm level. Variable definitions are in Appendix A. ***, **, * denote significance at the 1%, 5%,
and 10% levels, respectively.
