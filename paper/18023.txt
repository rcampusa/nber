The Impact of Patient Cost-Sharing on the Poor: Evidence from Massachusetts
Amitabh Chandra, Jonathan Gruber, and Robin McKnight
NBER Working Paper No. 18023
April 2012
JEL No. I13

                                               ABSTRACT

Greater patient cost-sharing could help reduce the fiscal pressures associated with insurance expansion
by reducing the scope for moral hazard. But it is possible that low-income recipients are unable to
cut back on utilization wisely and that, as a result, higher cost-sharing will lead to worse health and
higher downstream costs through hospitalizations. We use exogenous variation in the copayments
faced by low-income enrollees in the Massachusetts’ Commonwealth Care program to study these
effects. We estimate separate price elasticities of demand by type of service (hospital care, drugs, outpatient
care). Overall, we find price elasticities of about -0.15 for this low-income population — fairly similar
to elasticities calculated for higher-income populations in other settings. These elasticities are somewhat
larger for the chronically sick and older enrollees. A substantial portion of the decline in utilization
comes from some patients cutting back on use completely, but we find no (detectable) evidence of
offsetting increases in hospitalizations or emergency department visits in response to the higher copayments,
either overall or for the chronically ill in particular.

       The recently enacted Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA) includes the
largest expansion of health insurance coverage to low-income populations in our nation’s
history. The Federal government will spend almost $1 trillion over the next decade to subsidize
insurance for those below 400% of the Federal Poverty Line (FPL). Roughly, half that total will
be through expansions of the Medicaid program, which will provide publicly financed health
care for those below 133% of the poverty line at essentially zero patient cost. The other half will
be in the form of subsidies to private insurance for those between 133 and 400 percent of the
poverty line. These subsidies are of two types: the first type is premium subsidies, which offset
the premium cost of insurance by limiting the percentage of income that low-income individuals
must pay. The second type is cost-sharing subsidies, which offset to some extent the copayments,
coinsurance and deductibles that these low-income populations face.
       The motivation for the subsidies is twofold: to make the transfers in PPACA more
progressive, and to protect low-income populations from sacrificing necessary medical care
because of cost. The optimal level of such subsidies, therefore, depends critically on the way in
which the medical care utilization of low-income groups responds to cost sharing, and how any
change in utilization impacts their health. On one hand, greater patient cost-sharing could help
reduce the fiscal pressures associated with insurance expansion by reducing the scope for moral
hazard. But on the other, it is possible that low-income recipients are unable to cut back on
utilization wisely and, consequently, there remains a concern among many that higher cost-
sharing on primary care will lead to less effective use of primary care, worse health, and higher
downstream costs at hospitals (called “offset effects”). Commentators such as Evans et al. (1993)
have argued that user fees are a “policy zombie,” while Donaldson (2008) argued that it is
“wrong, unfair, and ineffective to try to limit consumer and patient access through user fees, and
also to dress up this process as actually enhancing access.”
       Most analyses of this issue still rely on the evidence from the RAND Health Insurance
Experiment (HIE) of the mid-1970s (Newhouse 1993). This seminal study found that, for the
population as a whole, there was a significant but modest response of medical care utilization to
the point-of-service cost of medical care. The reductions in care appeared to come across the
board, both in categories of “effective” and “ineffective” medical care. There were, however, no
“offset” effects in terms of reduced primary care leading to a demand for more hospital care;
indeed, reduced primary care appeared to lower spending on hospital care. Furthermore, most



                                                                                                    1
importantly, there was no evidence of a detrimental effect on the typical person in terms of
worsened health. That is, for the average person in the HIE, there did not appear to be productive
returns to marginal health care utilization in terms of improving health status.
       Although the sample size was more limited, the HIE did separately examine subgroups
by income and health. For the subset of low-income population, the findings paralleled those for
the larger population: a modest impact on health care spending, with no offset effects and no
impact on health status. However, there was an important potential exception to this finding: for
the chronically ill low-income population, there was a suggestion of a sizeable rise in blood
pressure for those in the higher cost-sharing insurance plan (although the overall health results
for this population were mixed, and the blood pressure result itself was not significant). In the
years since the HIE, there has been relatively little research on the impacts of cost-sharing on
low-income populations. But the HIE evidence is now over thirty years old, and changes in the
practice of medicine—including greater reliance on managed care contracts, increased use of
prescription drugs, the growth of imaging and diagnostic technology, and the development of
minimally invasive surgery—may imply a structural change in the elasticity of medical demand
and the health impacts of any utilization reductions.
       The possibility of offset effects is real: in our earlier work (Chandra, Gruber and
McKnight 2010a), we examined this question in a contemporary setting, and found evidence of
hospitalization offsets in elderly who had been diagnosed with chronic diseases such as diabetes,
hypertension, and hyperlipidemia. Tamblyn et al (2001) examined the effect of cost-sharing on
prescription drugs in the poor and found a 13 percent increase in the probability of
hospitalization, nursing home admission, or mortality. Similarly, Hsu et. al (2006) found that a
cap on drug benefits was associated with lower drug consumption and poorer adherence poorer
control of blood pressure, lipid levels, and glucose levels. The key role of cost-sharing in the
PPACA suggests the importance of revisiting this topic in a low-income population.
       In this paper, we use exogenous variation in the copayments faced by low-income
enrollees in the Massachusetts’ Commonwealth Care program. This state program was the model
for PPACA, providing highly subsidized insurance for families below 300% of the poverty line.
Importantly, there was a substantial increase in the copayments paid by enrollees in this program
at open enrollment in July 2008 that we exploit for identification. Using unique claims data on
the Commonwealth Care population provided to us by the state, we are able to estimate separate



                                                                                                    2
price elasticities of demand by type of service (hospital care, drugs, outpatient care, etc.), and
examine the effect of greater cost-sharing on utilization and hospitalization offsets.
       In previous work (Chandra, Gruber and McKnight, 2010b), we had provided preliminary
evidence on the elasticity of demand in this population, using only the first six months of post-
policy change data. This paper extends that analysis by incorporating additional post-policy
change data, by using a superior estimation framework, and most importantly by considering a
variety of questions not addressed in that earlier paper, such as the issue of population
heterogeneity in demand elasticities and in offset effects. We are also able to perform a number
of specification checks that provide assurance that our results aren't be driven by stockpiling
(where patients avail of medical care immediately before the policy change and do not use care
in the immediate months after), or the other confounders that may be timed with the policy
change. As a result of a variety of improvements to our data and estimation, our current estimate
for the overall price elasticity of demand in this population is on the low end of the range of
elasticities that we reported in our earlier work. Overall, we find price elasticities of about -0.15
for this low-income population, which is similar to, but somewhat lower than, elasticities
calculated for higher-income populations in other settings. In addition, we find no evidence of
offsetting increases in hospitalizations or emergency department visits in response to the higher
copayments, even among the chronically ill population.
       Our paper proceeds as follows. Section 1 provides background on the institutional setting
and data. Section II presents our estimation strategy. Section III shows our results, while
Section IV presents a set of robustness checks of those findings. Section V concludes with a
discussion of the implications of our findings.


I. Institutional Setting and Data
       Our analysis focuses on the implications of greater patient cost-sharing that was imposed
on low-income adults (aged 19 to 64) in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. Most of these
persons were beneficiaries of Massachusetts’ insurance expansion, which was signed into law on
April 12, 2006. Its goal was to achieve near-universal coverage of the Massachusetts population
by providing legal residents earning up to 150% of the FPL completely subsidized coverage and




                                                                                                     3
large premium subsidies to those earning over 150% of the FPL and below 300% of the FPL.1
These programs are offered by a subsidized program known as Commonwealth Care
(henceforth, CommCare) to persons who are not offered employer-provided health insurance, to
those who cannot be dependents on another person's family plan, and to those who do not qualify
for other public health insurance programs such as Medicaid. Currently, the monthly enrollee
premium for CommCare is $0 if the member's income is below 150% of the FPL, $39 for
income between 150 and 200 percent of the FPL, $77 for those between 200 and 250 percent of
the FPL, and $116 for those between 250 and 300 percent of the FPL.
          Members are eligible for different plan types based on where their income is relative to
the FPL, and each plan type offers a different level of patient cost-sharing. From October 2006 to
June 2008, there were four different plans— each with the same benefits but with different levels
of patient cost-sharing. The cost-sharing provisions generate discontinuities in cost-sharing at
100 and 200 percent of the FPL. For members whose incomes were between 200 and 300
percent of the FPL, there were two plan types: Plan 3 features higher cost-sharing, but lower
monthly premiums, while Plan 4 features lower cost-sharing, but higher monthly premiums.
Plan 4 was discontinued in July 2008 and its members were placed into Plan 3. Consequently,
this group incurred a substantial increase in patient cost-sharing as a result of the elimination of
Plan 4.


Data
          For the purposes of this analysis, Massachusetts' Commonwealth Health Insurance
Connector Authority provided us with the universe of (de-identified) enrollment and claims data
from July 2007 through June 2009. This sample period covers a full year before and a full year
after the copayment change that we are studying. From the enrollment file, we can observe the
CommCare plan in which each individual was enrolled in each month of the sample period. We
also observe very basic demographic information, such as age and gender. For most individuals,
we observe household income as a share of the FPL, although this information is missing for
some individuals. As a result of this missing information, we must exclude 25% of member-


1
 In 2009, 150% of the FPL is $16,620 for an individual; $33,084 for a family of four. 300% of
FPL is $32,508 for an individual; $66,168 for a family of four. These are national cutoffs (Kaiser
Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured, 2009).


                                                                                                       4
months from the full sample. Because income information is disproportionately missing for
individuals who were enrolled for shorter periods of time, this restriction affected only 16% of
the member-months in the continuously enrolled subsample that is the focus of our analysis. We
also exclude 10,073 member-months that report income levels above 300% of FPL and 19,290
member-months that report ages below 19 or above 65, since these individuals should not be
eligible for CommCare. After making these adjustments, our full sample includes 2,842,492
member-month observations and our continuously enrolled subsample includes 1,866,212
member-month observations.
        Our claims data include the universe of medical claims for CommCare enrollees during
our sample period. For each member in each month of our data, we use the claims data to
calculate the sum of all spending for each type of medical care, including zeroes for members
who have no claims in a particular month. 2 For our regression analysis, we then collapse these
member-month observations to averages for each percent of income as a share of the FPL in each
of the 24 months of data. We allow two observations per month for income cells between 200
and 300 percent of FPL: one for individuals who were ever enrolled in Plan 4 and one for
individuals who were never enrolled in Plan 4. As a result, the sample size for our main
regressions is 9,644.


Descriptive Statistics
        In Table 1, we describe the characteristics of our study population and, in Table 2, we
provide details of the copayment change. As Table 1 illustrates, the sample is poor; on average,
members were at 95% of the FPL. They are also quite sick, with over 30% of the sample having
some form of chronic disease (as measured by a diagnosis of diabetes, hypertension,
hyperlipidemia, asthma, arthritis, affective orders, or gastritis— conditions that are derived from
Goldman et al. (2007) and also used in Chandra, Gruber and McKnight (2010a)). Annual
spending is approximately $4,600, much of which comes from hospitalizations and outpatient
care.

2
 In our earlier work, we computed average monthly utilization for each individual over the months
during which they were enrolled and then computed an average across all individual-years. In this
version, we simply compute the average of monthly utilization across all member-month observations. In
effect, we previously placed disproportionate weight on individuals who were enrolled for shorter periods
of time; now the weight that we place on individuals is proportional to the amount of time that they are
enrolled.


                                                                                                        5
       In our data, we identify outpatient care as care that indicates “outpatient hospital” as the
place of service on the claim; it includes both facility and professional claims for the outpatient
hospital visit. Such care accounts for about 20% of total costs. Labs include any claims that
indicate “Independent Laboratory” as the place of service, or that indicate that the service
provided was “Laboratory” or “Radiology.” Labs account for approximately 15% of total costs.
Office visits include professional claims that do not indicate that the place of service is outpatient
hospital, independent laboratory, or emergency room; that do not occur on the same day as any
inpatient hospital claims; and that do not have a service code of “Laboratory” or “Radiology.”
They are, therefore, largely ambulatory visits for checkups and consultations and they account
for roughly 15% of total costs.
       In Table 1, we report means for two samples: the full sample with 247,565 members and
a sample of 122,528 members who stayed continuously enrolled at the time of the copayment
increase. Individuals in this second “continuously enrolled” sample were not necessarily enrolled
for the full 24-month sample period, but did not change their enrollment status at the time of the
copayment increase. Individuals who initially enrolled in Plan 4 but switched to Plan 3 in July
2008 are not excluded from the “continuously enrolled” sample, since it was not possible for
them to remain in Plan 4 at that time.
       We created this “continuously enrolled” sample because examining utilization changes in
the full-sample is subject to considerable bias if member income or enrollment is a function of
health status. This is a real concern in the full sample: in our work on the individual mandate in
Massachusetts (Chandra, Gruber, McKnight, 2011), we demonstrated that the insurance market
for Commonwealth Care was laced with adverse selection prior to the individual mandate
binding on January 1, 2008. Consistent with adverse selection, we found that those who enrolled
first in CommCare were sicker, with relatively healthy individuals joining the plan closer to the
date of the mandate. This time-varying change in the composition of enrollees will affect full-
sample estimates of the price elasticity of demand because utilization and health-status are
correlated in a time varying manner. Moreover, there was a change in the premiums charged
enrollees in Commonwealth Care at the same time that copayments changed, which could impact
the composition of enrollees. To mitigate these concerns, we examine the continuously enrolled
sample, who were continuosuly enrolled just before and after the policy change, to ensure that
our findings are not the result of differential entry and exit rates for different types of individuals



                                                                                                      6
around the time of the copayment change. Comparing the means in Table 1 reassures us—the
two samples are similar in age, gender, and income; furthermore, utilization levels are similar as
are enrollments across the four plans that we study.3
       In Table 2 we summarize the variation that we use to understand the effect of patient
cost-sharing on patient demand: we exploit a series of changes in the discontinuities in the cost-
sharing provisions of CommCare that occurred in July 2008. These changes, which varied by
type of plan, are reported in Table 2. Of these changes, the most salient are the increases in
copayments for prescription drugs and office visits for members whose incomes exceeded 100%
of the FPL. Copayments for ER visits increased only for those with incomes over 200% of FPL.
Copayments for hospital admissions were unchanged, except for the Plan 4 members who had to
switch to Plan 3. Note that there were no copayment changes for members whose income was
between 0 and 100 percent of the FPL.
       In order to estimate the price elasticity of demand, we devise a simple measure of the
overall change in copayments. Specifically, we calculate the weighted average of the copayments
for generic drugs, formulary drugs, non-formulary drugs, office visits, ER visits, and
hospitalizations. The weights are average monthly utilization of each type of care during the pre-
period (July 2007 to June 2008) for the entire sample. At the bottom of Table 2, we summarize
the (unadjusted) change in copayments that we will exploit: that is, there is no change for Plan 1,
a 51% increase for Plan 2, a 23% increase for Plan 3, and a 97% increase for Plan 4.
       In Figure 1, we plot the average copayment for one category of utilization—
generic drugs—by income category and by period (‘pre’ denotes the period before July 2008 and
‘post’ denotes the period after July 2008). This figure graphically illustrates the basis for our
formal regression analysis below.
       Because a number of cost-sharing increases occurred at the same time, it is important not
to attribute changes in a specific category of spending, such as the utilization of prescription
drugs, solely to changes in the copayments for these drugs. Declines in the use of prescription


3
 We investigated the possibility that a disproportionate number of people switched plans
because of the copayment increase. The percent of members who were new members of a plan in
May, June, July and August of 2008 was 5.2, 5.2, 4.7 and 4.4 percent respectively (the policy
change occurred in July 2008). Similarly, the percent of members who left the plan in May, June,
July and August of 2008 was 5.2, 4.8, 4.7 and 5.7 percent respectively. In other words, we do not
see excess churning at the time that the policy change occurred.


                                                                                                     7
drugs may, for example, partially reflect a reduction in the use of office visits. For this reason,
we are most interested in the reduction in total expenses across all categories of care.


II. Estimation
       Because the policy variation occurs at the level of plans, and plans are defined according
to the percent of FPL of the member’s income, we estimate our regression models at the level of
FPL x month, and cluster our standard errors at the level of FPL. The simplest framework to
think about estimating the price elasticity of demand is with the equation below:

(1)    ln Spendingjt = 0 + 1 ln Copaymentjt + FPLj+ Timet + jt

Here, Spendingjt is the average spending for income cell j in time t, and Copaymentjt is the
average copayment for this cell at a point in time. Income is defined as percent of the FPL so all
our specifications can (and do) include fixed effects for each percent of FPL. Note that plan fixed
effects are perfectly correlated with the percent of FPL fixed effects, and are therefore not
included. We also include year x month fixed effects to remove any effects of time trends or
seasonality.
       Equation (1) identifies the price (copayment) elasticity of healthcare as 1. In equation (1)
variation in copayments is coming only from within-plan increases. Our approach is identical to
identifying the effect of copayment changes using a regression-discontinuity design, where we
identify off changes in copayments at 100 and 200 percent of the poverty line (see Figure 1);
later in this paper (Table 7), we restrict the analysis to utilization in the period immediately
around the policy change and demonstrate that the results are unchanged.
       We could estimate equation (1) with OLS, but this would make sense only in a world
where all cells had non-zero spending. It is tempting to add a small amount of (arbitrary)
spending, such as $1, to overcome the problem that ln(0) is not defined; indeed, this is the
approach that we took in Chandra, Gruber, McKnight (2010b). But this can be a problematic
strategy, because ln(Spending) is quite sensitive to spending at the bottom of the spending
distribution; converting ln($1) to ln($2) has the same effect as converting ln($1000) to ln($2000).
To circumvent this problem, we follow the literature and estimate a general linear model with a
log-link function (Buntin and Zaslavsky, 2004). In GLM models with a log link-function, the
conditional mean is modeled as:


                                                                                                      8
(2)     Ln E(Spending|X) = 0 + 1 ln Copaymentjt + FPLj+ Timet

This setup models both the mean and variance on the original scale of the dependent variable
(here, dollars). We allow for a natural form of heteroscedascitiy, were var(Spending|X) is
allowed to depend on the mean level of conditional spending, E(Spending|X), which is a function
of the covariates. The use of the GLM model avoids the problem with two-part models (which
introduce selection on the dependent variable) and yields estimates that are easily interpretable as
elasticities.4 In principal, equation (2) could also be estimated at the level of individuals and we
could include individual fixed-effects. Because the policy change occurs at the plan level, and
individuals are assigned to plans based on their income, there is no additional benefit from this
approach.




III. Results
        Table 3 reports our key results. In column 1, we report the overall elasticity, which is
-0.15; a 10 percent increase in prices faced by patients would reduce utilization by 1 to 2 percent.
This is comparable to the much older estimates of RAND HIE, albeit somewhat lower
        With our data, we are able to estimate separate effects by type of service: hospital
spending, ER spending, outpatient spending, office visit spending, prescription drug spending,
and spending on laboratory services. We are also able to examine whether there were ‘offset’
effects; that is, did inpatient hospital and emergency department visits increase, potentially
because of excessive reductions in primary care utilization? The results in Table 3 demonstrate
that spending on hospital care, and ER are price inelastic at conventional spending levels.
Relatively more discretionary services exhibit larger elasticies: elasticities for laboratory services
and outpatient care are almost twice as large, but still small.
        Perhaps most interestingly, we find no evidence of offset effects. Hospital and ER
utilization fall, not rise, as copayments are increased (but these effects are statistically

4
 In contrast to this model, in OLS one is assuming that E(ln Spending|X) = 0 + 1 ln
Copaymentjt + FPLj+ Timet , which is difficult to translate into easily interpretable statements
about E(Spending). The solution is to use a 'smearing' estimator, where exponentiated
predictions are multiplied by a smearing factor to calculate expected
values on the raw (unlogged) scale (Manning et.al, 1987).


                                                                                                       9
insignificant). For Plans I, II and III, hospital copayments did not increase, so that any impact on
hospital utilization represents a pure offset effect. But for patients in Plan IV, this could reflect
the demand side impact of copayments rising from $50 to $250 for hospital care. Our results are
similar, however, if we exclude Plan IV (which is unsurprising since Plan IV is 1 percent of the
total sample), clarifying that we are estimating the offset effect only.
       In Table 4, we examine whether the overall elasticity varies by type of patient. We first
examine whether price sensitivity varies with health status, as measured by the Charlson
Comorbidity Index. The Charlson Index is a weighted sum of indicators for certain health
conditions, where the weights indicate the relative increase in one-year mortality risk associated
with the condition, as described in Charlson et al. (1987). We report separate price elasticities
for individuals with a Charlson index value of 0 (i.e., those who have none of the conditions) and
for those with Charlson index values of 1 or greater (this is the sickest 18 percent of our
population). We also consider variation in price elasticities by gender and age group.
       The results in Table 4 indicate very comparable elasticities across health (Charlson index)
groups and across genders. There is a somewhat higher elasticity for the chronically ill. We also
find larger price elasticities for older enrollees. The results therefore suggest that those facing
the highest expenditure risk appear to be the most price sensitive with respect to copayments.
       We are particularly interested in considering the presence of offset effects amongst those
who are chronically sick: this is the group for whom we found hospitalization offsets in the
elderly (Chandra, Gruber, McKnight, 2010a). In Table 5, we restrict the analysis to members
with a Charlson score of 1 or more (which is the sickest 18 percent of the population). Even in
this sample, we do not see evidence of hospital or ER spending increasing as a result of
copayments increasing, although our category-specific estimates are fairly imprecise.
       There are two mechanisms behind the reduced utilization. Some members cut back on the
service completely (extensive margin), while others reduce their utilization while continuing to
use some care (intensive margin). These two effects are combined in the tables that we have
reported so far. In Table 6, we report the importance of the extensive margin for all patients.
Here, the dependent variable is the fraction of members who had any utilization of care, by type
of care; this can modeled by OLS. We see statistically insignificant, negative effects on the
extensive margin of hospital care, emergency room care, and outpatient care. But a 10% increase
in copayments results in a 2.7 percentage point decline in the probability of making any



                                                                                                      10
physician office visits, a 6.7 percentage point decline in the use of any prescription drugs, and a
3.2 percentage point decline in the use of any laboratory services. These results are very
consistent across samples.
        We can ask how much of the overall decline in utilization is plausibly the consequence of
patients reducing utilization at the extensive margin. To perform this calculation, we multiply the
change in the margin of participation at the extensive margin with the spending among those
who adjusted on the extensive margin, and then divide by the total spending. We proxy
utilization for those who adjusted on the extensive margin by using the average utilization of
patients who had positive utilization .5 For example, for total spending, we calculate the implied
elasticity from behavior at the extensive margin as -0.050 x $788 / $358.8 = -0.12 (here, $788 is
the average spending of enrollees with non zero spending, and $358.8 is average spending from
Table 1). This is two-thirds the total elasticity estimated in the first panel, and suggests that about
70 percent of the decline in spending might be attributed to members dropping to zero
utilization; the rest of the decline is a consequence of members using fewer services after
copayments’ increase than before. Table 6 performs the same calculation for different categories
of care (we ignore categories where behavior at the extensive margin was not statistically
different than zero): in general, behavior at the extensive margin explains a very significant
portion of the overall price elasticity. This is a significant finding for it suggests that rather than
all patients cutting back on some care, some patients cut back completely: the cost savings of
greater cost-sharing are the consequence of this behavior.


IV. Robustness Checks
        In Table 7 we examine the robustness of our results to three alternative specifications. In
the first specification, we ignore information from the window just before and just after the
policy change (that is, we exclude June and July, 2008). We did this to examine the concern that
patients may be stockpiling drugs, or seeking care, in anticipation of the policy change. Such
behavior will cause us to overstate the price elasticity of demand for it accentuates the reduction

5
  Note that if all members had positive spending pre-reform, and if (pre-reform) spending for the
average member were the same as spending for a person who dropped to zero utilization, then
this exercise would generate the same elasticity as what we have estimated above. Of course, we
have no way of validating this assumption, so this calculation is purely illustrative of the
potential importance of these extensive responses.


                                                                                                      11
in utilization after the copayment increase (the increase in pre-policy use is accompanied by a
reduction in post-policy use). The first panel of Table 7 shows that this fear is unfounded: the
elasticities reported here are almost identical to those reported in Table 3, where we use all the
data available to us. The use of prescription drugs is particularly susceptible to the concern about
stockpiling, but we do not find any support for this actually happening.
       Next, we restrict the analysis to the period just before and just after the policy change
(that is, we keep data from April through September of 2008). The motivation for this
specification is that the US financial markets collapsed in early October of 2008 and there was a
rapid rise in recession-induced unemployment in late 2008 and 2009. We wanted to be sure that
the price elasticity of demand that we are estimating was not partially confounded by these
trends in the business cycle. While it is true that we have included income fixed-effects and very
flexible year x month controls, there may still be income-specific trends in the data. To allay this
concern we constructed Panel B of Table 7. The results are very similar to those in Table 3, so
we are reassured that the business-cycle is not an alternative explanation for our results. One
downside of this specification is that the loss of data also meant that we were unable to estimate
a separate price elasticity of demand for hospital care (there was not enough variation in 6
months of the data to jointly identify all the fixed-effects that we have included and the effect of
the copayment change, when it comes to a relatively rare event like hospital care).
        Finally, in Panel C of Table 7, we coded the policy change as having occurred on
January 1, 2008 (6 months before it actually happened) to verify that we obtained null effects
from this placebo regression. Note that the estimated coefficients are never significant and much
smaller in magnitude, thereby reassuring us that we have really picked up the effect of the policy
change and not of a pre-existing differential trend.




V. Discussion and Implications
       In the past, public insurance for our lowest income citizens has featured little patient
copayment. This may reflect concerns both about affordability, and the ability of the poor to
effectively manage their care in the face of marginal costs; in particular, the notion that the poor,
facing unaffordable copayments, may cut back on necessary as well as unnecessary care. As
public insurance subsidies have expanded to citizens above the poverty line, however, fiscal



                                                                                                     12
expediency suggests the use of some patient copayments. Yet concerns remain that copayments
in this population may do more harm than good.
       We have investigated this issue in the Commonwealth Care program in Massachusetts,
the nation’s largest expansion of publicly subsidized private insurance coverage and the model
for the national Affordable Care Act. During our sample period there was a sizeable (in
percentage terms) copayment change facing individuals with incomes between one and three
times the poverty line. Using a unique set of claims data provided by the state we are able to
study the impacts of this copayment change on overall utilization and on utilization of specific
medical services.
       Our results largely confirm the conclusions of the RAND Health Insurance Experiment.
We find that health care demand is somewhat sensitive to copayments, but that the elasticity is
small (-0.15 on average). We find that those who are chronically ill, and especially older
individuals, have a higher elasticity of demand. But we also find no evidence for “offset
effects” indicating that the reduced use of outpatient services has led to increased demand for
hospital services. This is true even for the sickest patients in our sample, in contrast to our
earlier study of elderly retired public sector workers in California. Our results suggest that
concerns about ‘offset effects’ in poorer populations, while still possible, require substantially
more evidence.
       These results are subject to a number of caveats. In particular, these copayment changes
are large in percentage terms but small in absolute dollar terms. It is possible that responses
could differ for larger copayment changes or changes in coinsurance rates, which would induce
larger patient cost-sharing than the copayment changes examined here. Moreover, we have not
estimated pure own-price effects here. The decline in prescription drug use, for example, could
come from the increase in prescription drug copayments or from the increase in office
copayments, which could cause physicians to prescribe fewer drugs. Our aggregate elasticity is
really the key measure for an overall rise in copayments, but it does not necessarily speak to the
particulars of charging individually for these services. Future work could usefully address these
limitations.

Note: Each number in the table is the percentage point change in the probability of having any medical spending. Each estimate comes from a separate
OLS regression that is estimated at the percent of FPL x month level. Dependent variable is the fraction of the cell that had any utilization. Standard
errors are clustered on member, and explanatory variables include percent of FPL fixed-effects, and year*month indicators. The implied elasticity from
the extensive margin is the price elasticity of demand that would arise from behavior at the extensive margin. Empty cells are those where the effect at the
extensive margin is not statistically different than zero.
