                                           ABSTRACT

Two recent papers have made compelling cases that mismeasurement of prices of high tech
products cannot explain the slow pace of labor productivity growth that has prevailed since the
mid-2000s. Does that result indicate that mismeasurement of high-tech products has limited
implications for patterns of economic growth? The answer in this paper is ‚Äúno.‚Äù We demonstrate
that the understatement of price declines for high-tech products in official measures has a
dramatic effect on the pattern of MFP growth across sectors. In particular, we show that
correcting this mismeasurement implies faster MFP growth in high-tech sectors and slower MFP
advance outside the high-tech sector. If MFP growth is taken as a rough proxy for the pace of
innovation, our results suggest that innovation in the tech sector has been more rapid than the rate
that would be inferred from official statistics (and less rapid outside high-tech). These results
deepen the productivity puzzle. If the pace of innovation in high-tech sectors has been more
rapid than indicated by official statistics, then it is perhaps even more puzzling that overall labor
productivity growth has been so sluggish in recent years.

1. Introduction

        Economists and others have offered many explanations for the slowdown in U.S.

productivity growth that began in the mid-2000s, with labor productivity in the business

sector rising just over ¬Ω percent at an annual rate from 2010 to 2015, well below the pace

over the boom years of 1995-2004 and even below the already reduced rate that prevailed

over 2004-2010. Focusing on the supply side of the economy, Gordon (2016) argues that

the IT revolution is just not as big a deal as the second industrial revolution and that the

boost to productivity growth rates from IT largely is behind us.1 Focusing on the demand

side, Summers (2014) has resurrected the Depression-era term ‚Äúsecular stagnation,‚Äù

arguing that the economy is generating insufficient demand. Others have argued that the

tools of economic measurement have not kept up with the digital revolution and that

economic growth has been stronger than reflected in official statistics. One strand of this

argument focuses on items within the current scope of GDP, positing mismeasurement of

key GDP components. (See Goldman Sachs (2015 and 2016), for example.) Another

strand looks beyond the current scope of GDP, making the case that economic welfare

has improved much more rapidly than have measures of productivity.2

        This paper contributes to the ‚Äúwithin GDP‚Äù debate, focusing on the

mismeasurement of prices of high-tech products. As noted, Goldman Sachs and others

have made the case that the productivity slowdown can be explained, at least in part, by

mismeasurement of the digital economy. Since that argument emerged, two papers have

countered that claim. Byrne, Fernald, and Reinsdorf (2016) carefully examined the

  Fernald (2014) and Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel (2013) provide growth-accounting evidence documenting
the dropback in the contribution from the use and production of high-tech products to labor and multifactor
productivity (MFP) growth. Fernald, Hall, Stock, and Watson (2017) highlight the important role of slower
MFP growth and a decline in labor force participation in the slowdown in labor productivity growth.
2
  For example, see Brynjolfsson and Oh (2013).


                                                                                                         3
evidence and concluded that mismeasurement does not provide an explanation of the

slowdown. Syverson (2016), using a completely different methodology, also made a

compelling case that mismeasurement cannot explain the productivity slowdown.

       But, is this the end of the story? Should we conclude that mismeasurement of

high-tech prices and the digital economy have no important consequences for patterns of

economic growth? This paper argues that mismeasurement does matter. In particular,

mismeasurement matters for the allocation and pattern of multifactor productivity (MFP)

growth across sectors. To demonstrate this, we take estimates of the amount of

mismeasurement of prices of high-tech products from the literature and feed these

through a standard growth accounting framework to examine the implications of this

mismeasurement for sectoral MFP growth.

       Our results show that the mismeasurement of high-tech prices has a dramatic

effect on the pattern of MFP growth across sectors. Specifically, the faster decline of

prices of high-tech products implies a faster pace of MFP growth in high-tech sectors and

a slower rate of MFP advance outside the high-tech sector. If we take MFP growth as a

rough proxy for the pace of innovation, our results suggest that innovation in the tech

sector has been more rapid than the rate that would be inferred from official statistics

(and even slower outside high-tech). At the same time, our results confirm that this

mismeasurement does not explain the labor productivity slowdown and has a relatively

modest effect on aggregate MFP growth.

       We believe these results are important for three reasons. First, they deepen the

productivity puzzle. If the pace of innovation in the high-tech sectors has been more

rapid than indicated by official statistics, then it is perhaps even more puzzling that




                                                                                           4
overall labor productivity growth has been so sluggish in recent years. Second, we

believe narratives about the prospects for growth have been improperly darkened by the

view that innovation, even in the tech sector, has been weak. According to official

statistics, prices of tech products have barely been falling in recent years. And, that slow

rate of price decline in the tech sector has implied, via the dual approach to productivity

measurement, a slow rate of MFP growth. This has led, in turn, to inferences that the

pace of innovation in the tech sector has faltered.3 Finally, a faster rate of innovation in

the tech sector implies, via a multi-sector growth model, a faster steady-state rate of

growth in labor productivity even with the slower rate of MFP growth outside the tech

sector. Accordingly, we argue that the pattern of MFP growth across industries may

presage a second wave of productivity advance supported by the digital economy.4



2. A Standard Framework for Growth Accounting

        We use a standard framework for growth accounting, as described in Fernald

(2014) and Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel (2013). That framework has two basic elements: 1)

a decomposition of labor productivity growth into contributions from capital deepening,

labor quality, and MFP; and 2) a decomposition of MFP growth into contributions from

different sectors. For the decomposition of labor productivity, the key equation is:

                     !    !
        ùë¶‚àí‚Ñé =        !!! ùõº! (ùëò!   ‚àí ‚Ñé) + ùõº! ùëû + ùëöùëìùëù                                              (1)

where ùë¶ is the growth rate of output, ‚Ñé is the growth rate of total hours, ùëò! is the growth

rate of capital services for capital of type i, ùõº!! is the income share for capital of type i,



3
  For example, see figure 13-1 in Gordon (2016) and the surrounding discussion.
4
  In a similar vein, van Ark (2016) argues that the digital economy is still in the ‚Äúinstallation‚Äù phase and
that growth may pick up when the ‚Äúdeployment‚Äù phase is reached.


                                                                                                               5
ùõº! ùëû is the contribution of changes in labor quality to labor productivity growth and ùëöùëìùëù

is the growth rate of MFP. Although time subscripts have been suppressed for

expositional clarity, all of the variables and parameters in equation 1 (including the

income shares) are time varying.

       We modify Fernald‚Äôs framework by disaggregating capital into five broad types:

computer hardware, communications equipment, software, other intellectual property

(research and development and artistic originals), and all other capital. We assume

constant returns to scale so the labor income share (ùõº! ) and the capital income shares

sum to one. Finally, although not shown in equation 1, we include an adjustment for the

utilization of capital.

       We also extend Fernald‚Äôs framework by including a more detailed decomposition

of MFP growth. This decomposition is described in Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel (2013),

and can be expressed as:

                  !
       ùëöùëìùëù =      !!! ùúá! ùëöùëìùëù!   + ùúá! ùëöùëìùëù!                                           (2)

where ùëöùëìùëù! is MFP growth in sector i (including computer hardware, communications

equipment, software, other intellectual property, and all other final demand output),

ùëöùëìùëù! is MFP growth in the semiconductor sector, and the ¬µ‚Äôs are Domar weights for

aggregating MFP growth rates. We separate the contribution for semiconductors in

equation 2 because, except for net exports, they are intermediate inputs and are handled

differently in the growth accounting equations than are other products that are

components of final demand.

       To empirically implement the decomposition of labor productivity in equation 1,

we use Fernald‚Äôs data for the business sector. Note that Fernald measures output as an



                                                                                           6
average of gross domestic product and gross domestic income, so the productivity figures

will not match those published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics (which rely solely on

gross domestic product).

       To empirically implement the MFP decomposition in equation 2, we measure the

sectoral MFP growth rates using the dual approach described in Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel

(2013). In the dual approach, the rate of price change for output of a sector (say,

semiconductors) is decomposed as a weighted average of the growth rates of labor costs

and the cost of capital less the growth rate of MFP. The logic is that faster MFP growth

would, all else equal, hold down rates of price change for a sector‚Äôs output. Thus, MFP

growth rates can be inferred from relative price changes. We use standard data from the

Bureau of Economic Analysis, the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and data on the tech sector

from some other sources. All of our data sources are described in the data appendix to

Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel (2013).

       With equations 1 and 2, we have the tools needed to assess the impact of

mismeasurement on labor productivity growth, total MFP growth, and MFP growth in

individual sectors. In particular, we can compare estimates for those measures based on

official measures of high-tech prices and on alternative measures of tech prices that

adjust for likely biases in the official data.




                                                                                           7
3. Mismeasurement of Prices of High-Tech Products

        While official measures of prices point to very slow rates of decline in recent

years, a growing literature indicates that these measures understate the rate of price

decline.5

        For example, Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel (forthcoming) developed a new index for

microprocessors (MPUs) used in desktop personal computers. Their preferred index fell

at an average rate of 42 percent a year over 2009-2013, while the most comparable

official price measure‚Äîthe Producer Price Index (PPI) for microprocessors‚Äîreports an

average decline of only 6 percent a year.

        This measurement gap for MPUs arose in the mid-2000s because of a major

change in the lifecycle pattern of Intel‚Äôs posted prices for MPUs.6 Prior to that time,

posted prices of MPUs tended to fall over their lifecycle, and a matched-model index

such as the PPI would rely on those declines to capture quality change. Since the mid-

2000s, posted prices of Intel MPUs have tended to be flat. Using these relatively flat

price profiles, a matched-model index will indicate little change in quality-adjusted prices

even if quality is improving. Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel (forthcoming) developed a

hedonic index that could capture ongoing quality change and generated the more rapid

price declines reported above.

        We believe measurement problems also are present for other types of high-tech

products, although the sources of problems differ across products. For computer

hardware, communications equipment, and software, we rely on alternative research

5
  See Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel (2016 and forthcoming), Byrne and Corrado (2016), Byrne (2015a and
  2015b), and Byrne, Fernald, and Reinsdorf (2016).
6
  Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel (forthcoming) use posted prices for Intel MPUs because transaction prices are
  unavailable. Although BLS does not indicate which prices are included in the PPI for MPUs, we are able
  to replicate the trend in the PPI with a matched-model index that uses only Intel‚Äôs posted prices.


                                                                                                            8
indexes developed by Byrne and Corrado (2016), which are the series used by Byrne,

Fernald, and Reinsdorf (2016) in their analysis demonstrating that mismeasurement of

high-tech prices does not explain the mid-2000s slowdown in labor productivity growth.

Byrne and Corrado did extensive work to develop these indexes, and, while additional

research will surely improve on their indexes, their work provides the best available

measures of the amount of bias in official price indexes for high-tech products. Table 1

reports rates of change in official price indexes and the alternative research price indexes

for computers, communications equipment, software, and semiconductors.7 (Note that

the semiconductor index shown in the table is for all semiconductors rather than MPUs,

and it incorporates the MPU estimates described above.)

           As shown in the last column of the table, measurement gaps‚Äîwhich equal the

difference between the percent changes of the official price index and the alternative

research index‚Äîare sizable for all of the high-tech products shown. Over the period

2004-2015, these gaps range from 5.4 percentage points for communications equipment

to 13.6 percentage points for semiconductors.



4. How Much Does Mismeasurement of Tech Prices Affect Labor Productivity?

           To answer this question, we implement the standard growth accounting

framework described above using official price indexes and the alternative research

indexes. For the implementation relying on the alternative price indexes, we make two

types of adjustments. First, we adjust real GDP to account for the more rapid declines in


7
    The alternative research prices shown in table 1 are price indexes for output. We use these output price
    indexes in all of our calculations with alternative research prices with one exception. The exception is for
    estimates of capital deepening in the decomposition of labor productivity. For those calculations we use
    Byrne and Corrado‚Äôs investment price series as the alternative research index.


                                                                                                               9
deflators for final demand of high-tech products. Second, we adjust capital services to

reflect the different trends in real investment in high-tech products arising from the

alternative research price measures.

           Results for labor productivity are summarized in tables 2A-2C and figure 1.

Table 2A shows the standard decomposition of growth in labor productivity using official

prices. The figures show the well-known pattern of a pickup in labor productivity growth

in the period from 1995 to 2004, a slowdown after 2004, and then another slowdown

after 2010. The pickup after 1995 reflects a jump in contributions from capital deepening

and MFP growth. The slowdown in 2004 mostly reflects a slowdown in MFP growth.

As Fernald (2014) and others have highlighted, this stepdown occurred prior to the

financial crisis so it is difficult to find its source in the financial crisis and Great

Recession. However, the dropback in labor productivity growth after 2010 was

concentrated in capital deepening. This retrenchment might well reflect effects of the

Great Recession as expectations of weak future demand and heightened uncertainty

restrained business investment.8

           Table 2B reports results using the alternative research price measures. The broad

patterns are the same as in the decomposition relying on official price measures. And, as

shown in table 2C, the differences are fairly small between the decompositions using

official and alternative research prices. Although labor productivity growth is somewhat

higher using the alternative research indexes, the contribution of capital deepening also is

8
    The figures discussed here follow current U.S. national income accounting conventions, which include
    only some types of intangible investment‚Äîspecifically, software, research and development, and artistic
    originals. Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel (2009) argued for the inclusion of a wider set of intangibles as
    business investment, including organizational capital, training, product development and design, and
    brand equity. Corrado, Haskel, Jona-Lasino, and Iommi (2016) note that business investment including
    the full set of intangibles has held up better than has business investment as reported in the U.S. National
    Accounts. Accordingly, capital deepening and labor productivity could be stronger than shown in the
    official data.


                                                                                                              10
higher. Consequently, switching to the alternative research indexes has a relatively

modest effect on aggregate MFP growth. These patterns also are evident in figure 1,

which shows stacked bar charts for the labor productivity decomposition with both

official prices and the alternative research prices.9

           These comparisons confirm the conclusion reached by Byrne, Fernald, and

Reinsdorf (2016) and Syverson (2016) that mismeasurement of tech prices does not

explain the productivity slowdown around 2004. Correcting the likely biases in tech

prices does boost labor productivity by about a quarter percentage point over 2004-2015,

but that correction also boosts growth by similar amounts prior to 2004.



5. How Much Does Mismeasurement of High-Tech Prices Affect MFP Growth?

           As noted, correcting the mismeasurement of tech prices has a relatively modest

effect on total MFP growth because the increment to labor productivity growth is not

much bigger than that to the contribution of capital deepening. However, correcting the

mismeasurement of tech prices has a much more dramatic effect on the allocation of MFP

growth across sectors.

           For the sectoral decomposition of MFP growth, we use the dual approach to

estimate MFP for each sector, relying on changes in the relative price of output in each

sector to estimate MFP growth.10 This link between price trends in each sector and MFP

growth means that correcting the mismeasurement of tech prices can affect MFP growth

rates. Of course, given the earlier results that switching from official measures of tech

prices to the alternative price indexes had only a small effect on total MFP growth, the

9
    Figure 1 reports contributions for aggregate MFP growth without the utilization adjustment.
10
     Details of the dual approach are described in Oliner and Sichel (2002) and Byrne, Oliner, and Sichel
    (2013).


                                                                                                            11
changes in MFP growth rates that we identify largely are to the allocation of MFP growth

across sectors. Our results are shown in tables 3A-3C and in figures 2 through 7.

       Table 3A reports our MFP decomposition using official measures of tech prices.

The estimates show the pickup in MFP growth rates across sectors after 1995 and the

widespread slowdown after 2004. After 2010, growth rates stepped down in the high-

tech sector (with a large dropback in semiconductors), and were little changed outside the

tech sector.

       Table 3B shows MFP growth rates based on the alternative research measures of

tech prices, while table 3C shows the difference between growth rates using official

prices and the alternative research prices. As these panels indicate, MFP growth rates for

the tech sectors are noticeably more rapid using the alternative research measures for tech

prices. At the same time, MFP growth rates are slower in the ‚ÄúAll other‚Äù sector when

using the alternative research prices. Put another way, using the alternative research

series causes a reallocation of MFP growth across sectors, with more rapid growth in tech

and less rapid growth outside the tech sector.

       Turning to the details, MFP growth rates in the high-tech sector are higher over

every period when the alternative research prices are used as can be seen in figures 2

through 7. The same story is evident by comparing tables 3A and 3B. And, as shown in

table 3C, the gap between MFP growth rates in the high-tech sector with official and

alternative research prices steps up noticeably after 1995 and increases further after 2010.

Over the period from 2010 to 2015, the amount of mismeasurement for semiconductors

increases dramatically, while the amount of mismeasurement for the other categories of

tech products decreases. This dropback in the amount of mismeasurement for computing




                                                                                          12
and communications equipment partly reflects the jump in mismeasurement in the

semiconductor sector because our model estimates MFP growth in the computer and

communications equipment sectors net of the contribution from semiconductors.

        As noted, the use of the alternative research prices reduces the growth rate of

MFP in the rest of the economy (the ‚ÄúAll other‚Äù sector), with MFP estimated to be little

changed since 2004. This result is, perhaps, puzzling. Is it credible that MFP growth in a

large swath of the economy was essentially flat on average for a decade?11 We believe

several factors may account for this weak performance.

        First, it is possible that mismeasurement also is present in final demand prices for

products in the ‚ÄúAll other‚Äù sector. If inflation is overstated in this sector, then correcting

this mismeasurement would boost real output growth and MFP growth. One area of

possible mismeasurement is related to so-called ‚Äúfactoryless‚Äù manufacturing, where a

company‚Äôs U.S. establishment provides product designs and maintains control of the

production process by approving inputs and outputs, but outsources the actual fabrication

to a contract manufacturer abroad.12 A key measurement question is, what price deflator

to use for the design, development, and management value added that occurs within the

United States? Currently, that value added is not uniformly included in the

manufacturing sector, and it is not deflated with prices of the products produced by the

company. Thus, for high-tech companies in this situation, much of their U.S. value

added is not deflated with high-tech prices deflators even though the company is

producing high-tech products. Using high-tech deflators for this design and development

work would boost the growth of measured real output, labor productivity, and MFP.

11
   Corrado and Slifman (1999) raised a similar question about labor productivity growth in the
  noncorporate business sector and in services.

           Another possibility is that the very weak pattern of MFP in the ‚ÄúAll other‚Äù sector

is correctly capturing economic developments. As highlighted by van Ark (2016), the

U.S. economy could be characterized as in a transition period, in which a host of

technologies are being developed and installed but are not yet generating significant

productivity gains. Put another way, firms may be paying adjustment costs as they begin

to utilize new technologies, as discussed in Basu, Fernald, and Shapiro (2001). More

generally, the historical record suggests that new technologies boost productivity with a

significant lag.13

            It also is possible that weak MFP growth across parts of the U.S. economy

reflects a decline in business dynamism. According to an important strand of recent

research, just such a decline has occurred in recent decades.14 And, as noted by Decker,

Haltiwanger, Jarmin, and Miranda (2015), since 2000 this decline in dynamism ‚Äúhas

been accompanied by a decline in high-growth young firms.‚Äù Perhaps these forces are

restraining MFP growth.

           Providing an explanation of the weak performance of MFP growth in the ‚ÄúAll

other‚Äù sector is beyond the scope of this paper. That being said, we can easily imagine

that its roots lie in some combination of the explanations given above.



6. Implications of Faster MFP Growth Rates in the Tech Sector

           MFP growth rates often are used by macroeconomists as rough proxies for rates

of innovation. Thus, the reallocation of MFP growth rates across sectors suggests that the

                                                                                           14
pace of innovation in tech sectors has been more rapid than would be inferred from

figures based on official measures of high-tech prices.

         We believe that these faster implied rates of innovation in the tech sector are

important for three reasons. First, these results deepen the productivity paradox. If the

pace of innovation in the tech sector has been more rapid than implied by official data,

then it is perhaps even more of a puzzle that productivity growth has remained so weak.

         Second, as a rhetorical point, we believe that the sluggish rates of high-tech MFP

growth implied by official price measures have improperly supported darker narratives

about future prospects for productivity growth. The apparent weak pace of innovation in

the tech sector provides fuel for the story that little scope remains for the tech sector to

boost aggregate labor productivity growth.

         Third, we believe that these faster rates of growth in high-tech could presage a

second wave of higher productivity growth spurred by the digital revolution.15 To make

this argument, we rely on steady-state values from the multi-sector growth model used

above.

         Table 4A shows the actual growth in labor productivity and steady-state estimates

of labor productivity growth over the full period from 1974 to 2015. The steady-state

estimates shown‚Äîwhich are derived using the methodology described in Byrne, Oliner,

and Sichel (2013)‚Äîconfirm that the model fits long trends in the data reasonably well.

As can be seen on the first line of the table, using official prices for tech products, the

model implies steady-state growth in labor productivity of 2.0 percent a year, just about

15
  If views were to pivot toward greater optimism, such a shift could, according to Blanchard, Lorenzoni,
 and L‚ÄôHullier (2017), spur faster growth. Their work provides evidence that the economy‚Äôs weak
 performance may, in part, reflect a self-fulfilling prophecy in which expectations of sluggish growth in
 potential output feed back to weaken actual economic growth.



                                                                                                        15
the same as the actual average growth rate over that period. Repeating these calculations

using the alternative research price series, the actual growth rate of labor productivity is

2.1 percent (accounting for the faster price declines of tech products in final demand),

while the steady-state estimate is slightly higher at 2.4 percent.

        The question we ask is, how far below its steady-state pace is the recent rate of

increase in labor productivity? To answer this question, we compare the growth rate of

actual labor productivity during 2010 to 2015 to our estimate of its current steady-state

growth rate. To obtain the current steady state, we update the estimates in Byrne, Oliner,

and Sichel (2013) using our best estimate of the current underlying trend in MFP growth

in the ‚ÄúAll other‚Äù sector and the model parameters that determine MFP growth in the

high-tech sectors.16 In our model, just as in a one-sector Solow growth model, the

steady-state value of labor productivity growth is the sum of steady-state MFP growth,

the amount of capital deepening induced by the steady-state MFP growth, and growth in

labor quality.

        Table 4B provides the numbers. Using official prices for high-tech products,

actual labor productivity growth over 2010-2015 averaged just 0.8 percent. This figure is

about ¬æ percentage point below our estimate of the steady-state value of 1.5 percent

based on current underlying trends and the official measures of high-tech prices.

        The gap between recent actual growth rates of labor productivity and the steady

state based on current underlying trends becomes larger if we use the alternative research

prices. As shown in the lower panel of table 4B, labor productivity growth averaged 1.0


16
  Our procedure is to set a lower bound and upper bound for ‚ÄúAll other‚Äù MFP growth and the many other
 parameters of the model. These bounds are set based on the historical and recent performance of each
 series. Our estimate of the current steady state is based on each parameter‚Äôs midpoint value (between the
 lower and upper bounds).


                                                                                                        16
percent over 2010-2015 with these alternative prices. The steady-state value using these

prices stepped up to 2.2 percent, boosted by the greater capital deepening induced by the

faster rates of innovation in the tech sector. Thus, using the alternative price series, the

average growth rate of labor productivity over 2010-2015 is about 1¬º percentage points

below its steady-state value. This gap primarily reflects a shortfall in capital deepening

relative to what would occur in steady state.17

         We recognize that steady-state values are relatively weak attractors, that

convergence could take a long time, and that some recent work has expressed skepticism

about a revival of investment.18 Nonetheless, we believe that this evidence raises the

possibility that the faster rates of innovation implied by the alternative research price

measures could spur faster labor productivity in the future.19



7. Conclusion

         In the recent debate about the labor productivity slowdown in the U.S., Byrne,

Fernald, and Reinsdorf (2016) and Syverson (2016) showed that mismeasurement of

high-tech prices cannot explain the slowdown. Nevertheless, available evidence points to

considerable mismeasurement of high-tech prices, and this mismeasurement does have

important implications. In particular, the evidence that prices of high-tech products are

falling more rapidly than is reflected in official statistics implies a reallocation of MFP




17
   Alexander and Eberly (2016) and Gutierrez and Phillipon (2016) document that the weakness in
  investment began in the early 2000s, and both papers explore possible explanations.
18
   Fernald, Hall, Stock, and Watson (2017) argue that the actual value of the capital-output ratio currently is
  close to its cyclically-adjusted or trend level. However, they also note that the capital-output ratio is less
  than the steady-state value implied by standard growth theory, raising the possibility that the ratio has
  been pushed down by factors that may recede in the future.

growth across sectors, with faster growth rates of MFP in high-tech sectors and slower

growth rates elsewhere in the economy.

       Macroeconomists often use growth rates of MFP as proxies for the pace of

innovation so the faster rates of MFP growth in the high-tech sector indicate that rates of

innovation in the digital economy have been more rapid than implied by official price

measures. We believe this finding is important for three reasons. First, it deepens the

productivity paradox; that is, the recent sluggish rates of productivity growth become

even more puzzling given faster rates of innovation in the tech sector. Second, it raises

questions about the darkened narratives about future prospects for productivity growth

that have been based on the official price measures. Finally, the research price indexes

that better capture the faster rates of innovation in the tech sector provide a reason to be

more optimistic about future prospects for labor productivity growth.
