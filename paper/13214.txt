                                              ABSTRACT

Bilateral, product-level data exhibit a number of strong patterns that can be used to evaluate international
trade theories, notably the spatial incidence of “export zeros” (correlated with distance and importer
size), and of export unit values (positively related to distance). We show that leading theoretical trade
models fail to explain at least some of these facts, and propose a variant of the Melitz model that can
account for all the facts. In our model, high quality firms are the most competitive, with heterogeneous
quality increasing with firms’ heterogeneous cost.

                                                      Abstract

        Bilateral, product-level data exhibit a number of strong patterns that can be used to
        evaluate international trade theories, notably the spatial incidence of “export zeros”
        (correlated with distance and importer size), and of export unit values (positively
        related to distance). We show that leading theoretical trade models fail to explain at
        least some of these facts, and propose a variant of the Melitz model that can account
        for all the facts. In our model, high quality firms are the most competitive, with
        heterogeneous quality increasing with firms’ heterogeneous cost.



          The gravity equation relates bilateral trade volumes to distance and country size.

Countless gravity equations have been estimated, usually with “good” results, and trade theorists

have proposed various theoretical explanations for gravity’s success. However, the many

potential explanations for the success of the gravity equation make it a problematic tool for

discriminating among trade models.1

          As a matter of arithmetic, the value of trade depends on the number of goods traded, the

amount of each good that is shipped, and the prices they are sold for. Most studies of trade




1
 An important exception to this principle is Robert Feenstra, James Markusen, and Andrew Rose (2001), who show
and test how different trade models imply different variations on the gravity model. Our paper is similar in
approach, though different in focus.

volumes have not distinguished among these three factors. In this paper we show that focusing

on how the number of traded goods and their prices differ as a function of trade costs and market

size turns out to be very informative about the ability of trade theory to match trade data.

        We establish some new facts about United States trade using the most disaggregated data

publicly available. First, most potential export flows are not present, and the incidence of these

“export zeros” is strongly correlated with distance and importing country size. Second, export

unit values are positively related to distance and negatively related to market size. We show that

every well-known multi-good general equilibrium trade model is inconsistent with at least some

of these facts.

        We conclude the paper with a variant of the heterogeneous-firms trade model pioneered

by Marc Melitz (2003). Our model maintains the core structure of Melitz, namely heterogeneity

in firms’ productivity with fixed market entry costs, but introduces a taste for quality so that the

lowest priced goods are not necessarily the most competitive. In our model, firms’

competitiveness depends upon their quality-adjusted price and, in equilibrium, higher quality

goods are more costly, more profitable and better able to penetrate distant markets. Our model’s

predictions are borne out by the facts established in our data analysis.

        In Section 2 we generate testable predictions concerning the spatial pattern of trade flows

and prices. The predictions come from three multi-good general equilibrium models that are

representative of a wide swath of mainstream trade theory – one based purely on comparative

advantage (Jonathan Eaton and Samuel Kortum (2002)), one based purely on monopolistic

competition (a multi-country Elhanan Helpman and Paul Krugman (1985) model with trade

costs), and one based on monopolistic competition with heterogeneous firms and fixed market-

entry costs (a multi-country version of the Melitz (2003) model). These models predict very

                                                      2
different spatial patterns of zeros, i.e. the impact of country size and bilateral distance on the

likelihood of two nations trading a particular product. They also generate divergent predictions

on how observed trade prices should vary with bilateral distance and country size.

        Section 3 confronts these theoretical predictions with product level U.S. data on bilateral

trade flows and unit values. On the quantity side, we focus on the pattern of zeros in product-

level, bilateral trade data since this data contains information that is both rich and relatively

unexploited.2 Another advantage of focusing on zeros (the extensive margin) rather than volumes

of positive flows (the intensive margin), is that it allows us to avoid issues such as the

indeterminacy of trade flows at the product level in comparative advantage theory and the lack of

data on firms’ cost functions. On the price side, we focus on bilateral, product-specific “free on

board” (f.o.b.) unit values.

        All three mainstream models fail to explain the broad outlines of the data along at least

one dimension. The best performance is turned in by the heterogeneous-firms trade (HFT) model

based on Melitz (2003). However, this model fails to account for the spatial pattern of trade

prices, in particular the fact that average unit values clearly increase with distance while the HFT

model predicts that they should decrease with distance. Section III presents the modified Melitz

model. As explained, a nation’s high-quality/high-price goods are the most competitive, so they

more easily overcome distance-related trade costs and this accounts for why observed prices in

distant markets tends to be higher.

 We are not the first to exploit zeros. Jon Haveman and David Hummels (2004) is similar in sprit to our paper,
although they focus on import zeros. Feenstra and Rose (2000) and Tibor Besedeš and Thomas J. Prusa (2006a,
2006b) have looked at time-series variation in product level zeros to test trade models.

I.     ZEROS AND PRICES IN THEORY

       This section derives testable hypotheses concerning the spatial pattern of zeros and trade

prices in models that represent a broad swath of trade theory. In the three models selected, trade

is driven by: 1) comparative advantage, 2) monopolistic competition, and 3) monopolistic

competition with heterogeneous firms.

       The models we study share some assumptions and notation. There are C countries and a

continuum of goods. Preferences are given by the indirect CES utility function

where E is expenditure, pi is the price of variety i, and  is a set of available varieties. Transport

costs are assumed to be of the iceberg form, with od  1 representing the amount of a good

which must be shipped from “origin” nation-o for one unit to arrive in “destination” nation-d. All

the models assume just one factor of production, labor, which is in fixed supply and paid a wage

w.

       In the theory we discuss, the definition of a product is perfectly clear. An issue of

interpretation, however, arises when confronting model predictions with data. In our recap of

each model’s predictions for zeros and prices across space, we specifically address the mapping

of the theory predictions to the data. As a background for these mappings, we briefly consider

the essential features of the data. In Sections 3 and 4, we work with annual data on the least

aggregated trade data that is publicly available, the U.S. ten-digit level of the Harmonized

System (HS 10). We refer to the HS10 categories as “codes” and recognize that the HS10 codes

do not generally correspond to a single product variety. Some examples of HS10 codes exported


                                                       4
by the United States in 2005 include: women's or girls' wool sweaters (HS6110110020), new

motor vehicle engine between 1500 - 3000cc, more than 6 cylinders (HS 8703230075), bicycles

with wheels greater than 63.25 cm diameter (HS 8712002600), undercarriages & parts for use in

civil aircraft (HS 8803200010), and lasers, other than laser diodes (HS 9013200000). Plainly,

there is ample scope for distinct products being sold in these and most other HS10 codes.

Andrew Bernard, Bradford Jensen, and Peter Schott (2009) report that more than a quarter

million different firms exported from the U.S. in 2000 in just over 8,500 HS10 codes, or more

than 30 firms per code on average.3 As a consequence, we are careful in translating firm- and/or

variety-level predictions into predictions for HS10 codes.

         A.       Comparative advantage: Eaton-Kortum

         Economists have been thinking about the effects of trade costs on trade in homogeneous

goods since Ricardo, but we had to wait for Eaton and Kortum (2002) to get a clear, rigorous,

and flexible account of how distance affects bilateral trade in a competitive general equilibrium

trade model. Appendix 1 presents and solves a slightly simplified Eaton-Kortum model (EK for

short) explicitly. Here we provide intuition for the EK model’s predictions on the spatial pattern

of zeros and prices.

         Countries in the EK model compete head-to-head in every market on the basis of “cost,

insurance and freight” (c.i.f.) prices, with the low-price supplier capturing the whole market.4

This “winner takes all” form of competition means that the importing country buys each good

from only one source. As usual in Ricardian models, the competitiveness of a country’s goods in

a particular market depends upon the exporting country’s technology, wage and bilateral trade

costs – all relative to those of its competitors. A key novelty of the EK model is the way it

describes each nation’s technology. The EK model does not explicitly specify each nation’s

vector of unit-labor input coefficients (the a’s in Ricardian notation). Rather it views the national

vectors of a’s as the result of a stochastic technology-generation process – much like the one

used later by Melitz (2003). Denoting the producing nation as nation-o (‘o’ for origin), and the

unit labor coefficient for a typical good-j as ao(j), each ao(j) is an independent draw from the

cumulative distribution function (cdf)5

where To > 0 is the nation-specific parameter that reflects the nation’s absolute advantage, and C

is the number of nations.

           Equation (2) permits calculation of the probability that a particular nation has a

comparative advantage in a particular market in a typical good. Since the ao(j)’s for all nations

are random variables, determining comparative advantage becomes a problem in applied

statistics. Perfect competition implies that nation-o will offer good-j in destination nation-d at a

price of p od ( j )   od wo ao ( j ) where wo is the nation-o wage. As the appendix shows, this implies

that the distribution of prices in market-d in equilibrium is

destination nation-d for any product is  od  Tod /  d .6 This probability of observing positive

trade between nations o and d in a given good is the key to characterizing the spatial pattern of

zeros. It reflects the relative competitiveness of nation-o’s goods in market-d. Namely, Tod is

inversely related to o’s average unit-labor cost for goods delivered to market-d, so od is

something like the ratio of o’s average unit-labor cost to that of all its competitors in market-d.7

           The EK model does not yield closed-form solutions for equilibrium wages, so a closed

form solution for od is unavailable. We can, however, link the Tod’s to observable variables by

employing the market clearing conditions for all nations (see appendix for details). In particular,

wages must adjust to the point where every nation can sell all its output and this implies

where the Y’s are nations’ total output (GDP) and the P’s are nations’ price indices from (1) for

the continuum of goods   0,1 . While this is not a closed form solution, the export probability

is expressed in terms of endogenous variables for which we have data or proxies.

           Equation (4) gives the sensible prediction that the probability of o successfully competing

in market-d is decreasing in bilateral transport costs. The incidence of export zeros (that is,

products exported to at least one but not all potential markets) should be increasing in distance if

distance is correlated with trade costs, and import zeros (products imported from at least one

potential source but not all) should predominate since each importer buys each good from just

one supplier. Finally, Equation (4) also shows that all of the trade costs facing nation-d affect

country o’s competitiveness in d, through the effect of bilateral trade costs on d’s price level Pd.

The expression shows the probability of trade is higher when the destination market d has a high

price level, and d’s price level depends on all of its bilateral trade costs through the term d in

equation (3). The intuition is that if d faces high average trade costs, it will have high local prices

and thus be relatively easy to penetrate for any given bilateral trade cost. In what follows, we

will refer to this relative location effect as a country’s remoteness.

       The role of market size in determining the probability of exporting can also be studied

with (4). The bigger is market-d, as measured by its GDP Yd, the smaller is the probability that o

successfully sells in d. There are two elements explaining this counter-intuitive result. Large

countries must sell a lot so they need, on average, low unit-labor-costs (as measured by wo/To).

This means that large nations are often their own low-cost supplier. The second is that there are

no fixed market-entry costs, so an exporter will supply every markets where it has the lowest

c.i.f. price – regardless of how tiny the market. Expression (4) also predicts that nation-d imports

more goods from larger exporters, with size measured by Yo.

       The EK model makes simple predictions for the spatial distribution of import prices. The

distribution of prices inside nation-d is given by (3) and each exporting nation has a constant

probability of being the supplier of any given good. Consequently, the c.i.f. price of nation-o’s

exports to nation-d is just a random sample from (3), which means (3) also describes the

distribution of import prices for every exporting nation. The average c.i.f. price of goods

imported from every partner should be identical and related to nation-d price index by (see

appendix for details)

where [.] is the Gamma function. Since trade costs are fully passed on under perfect

competition, the average bilateral export f.o.b. price, p od /  od , should be increasing in the

destination nation’s price index (remoteness) and declining in bilateral distance.

        The EK model is a multi-country Ricardian model with trade costs. In all Ricardian

models, the locus of competition is destination nations; exporters must meet the competitive

demands in each nation if they are to export successfully. Given this basic structure, the

prediction of equal average import prices from all source nations is quite robust. Putting it

differently, highly competitive nations export a wider range of goods than less competitive

nations but the average import price of their goods does not vary with exporter’s

competitiveness, size or distance from the importing market. Staying in the Ricardian-Walrasian

framework limits the range of modifications and extensions, so most extensions and

modifications of the EK model lead to quite similar spatial predictions for zeros and prices.

        One important extension of EK is Bernard, Eaton, Jensen and Kortum (2003). This model

introduces imperfect competition into the EK framework with the low-cost firm in each market

engaging in limit pricing. Limit pricing ties the market price to the marginal cost of the second-

best firm, rather than the first-best as in EK. However with randomly generated technology, the

outcome for the spatial pattern of zeros and prices is qualitatively unaltered.

        Eaton, Kortum and Francis Kramarz (2008) modify the EK framework model further,

introducing monopolistic competition and beachhead costs (i.e. fixed market-entry costs). With

these two additions, Eaton, Kortum and Kramarz (2008) is best thought of as part of the HFT

family of trade models we consider below.

       To recap the EK model’s predictions on the spatial pattern of zeros and prices:

       Export zeros The probability that exporter-o sends a good to destination-d is decreasing

                       in the distance between o and d, decreasing in the size of d, and increasing

                       in d’s remoteness. A fall in trade costs reduces the incidence of zeros.

       Export prices Considering products sold by o in multiple destinations d, the average

                       f.o.b. price is decreasing in the distance between o and d, increasing in the

                       remoteness of d, and unrelated to the size,

       In terms of HS10 codes, the export-zero prediction is that the probability that no firm

exports in a given code from o to d is increasing in the distance between o and d and in the size

of d. The export price prediction is that, within a given code, higher-cost products are less likely

to be shipped longer distances and to less remote markets. As a consequence of this composition

effect, the average export price within a code will be decreasing in distance, increasing in

remoteness, and unrelated to size.

       B.      Monopolistic competition

       Monopolistic competition (MC) models constitute another major strand in trade theory.

The particular MC model that we focus on has C countries, iceberg trade costs, and a single

factor of production L. Goods are produced under conditions of increasing returns and Dixit-

Stiglitz monopolistic competition. Firms are homogenous in that they all face the same unit-labor

requirement, a. As the model is very standard, we move quickly (see Appendix for details).

       Dixit-Stiglitz competition implies that ‘mill pricing’ is optimal, so firms charge the same

f.o.b. export price regardless of destination (iceberg trade cost are fully passed on to consumers).

                                                     10
Using this and the demand function implied by (1), the value of bilateral exports for each good is

                                             1

where vod[a] is the value of bilateral exports for a nation-o firm with marginal cost a, od reflects

the ‘freeness’ of bilateral trade ( ranges from zero when  is prohibitive to unity under costless

trade, i.e.  = 1), Bd is the per-firm demand-shifter in market-d, and Pd is as in (1), with  being

the set of goods sold in d.

       Spatial patterns are exceedingly simple in the MC model. Consumers buy some of every

good with a finite price, so there should be no zeros in the trade matrix – if a good is exported to

one country it is exported to all. Neither the size of the destination market nor the distance

between the origin and destination markets has any bearing on the probability of observing a

zero. This outcome is, of course, due to the model’s dramatic simplifications meant to explain

pervasive intra-industry trade (the widespread existence of zeros was not known when the model

was developed in the 1980s).

       The predictions for the spatial pattern of trade prices are equally sharp. As mill-pricing is

optimal, trade costs are passed fully on to consumers, and all products are sold in all markets the

f.o.b. export prices to all destinations should be identical (and thus unrelated to distance, market

size, or remoteness).

       These stark predictions depend upon standard simplifying assumptions. Some of these

have been relaxed in the theory literature, so we consider the predictions that are robust across

well-known variants of the MC model.

       The core elements of the MC model are imperfect competition, increasing returns and

                                                              11
homogenous firms. Since imperfect competition can take many forms, many variants of the

standard MC model are possible. The general formula for optimal pricing under monopolistic

competition sets consumer price to a od /(1   d1 ) , where d is the perceived elasticity of demand

in market-d. Different frameworks link d to different parameters. Under Dixit-Stiglitz

monopolistic competition, d always equals  – a constancy that is the heart of the simple spatial

pattern of zeros and prices in the standard MC model.

       Under the Gianmarco Ottaviano, Takatoshi Tabuchi and Jacques Thisse (2002)

monopolistic competition framework, firms face linear demand so d rises as firms move up the

demand curve. This creates a link between bilateral pricing and distance via bilateral markups. In

other words, producers absorb some of the trade costs, so the f.o.b. export prices should be lower

for more distant markets. Linear demand also features a choke-price for consumption and this

opens the door to zeros in the spatial trade pattern, even without beachhead costs (fixed market-

entry costs). The predicted pattern of zeros with homogeneous firms is very stark. Nation-o’s

export matrix has either no zero with respect to nation-d, or all zeros, with the likelihood of

observing such zeros rising with the distance to the destination market. Moreover, as the

equilibrium number of varieties consumed is higher in bigger markets, and a rise in this number

makes the market more competitive (i.e. it lowers the demand curve intercept), it should be more

likely to observe zeros for larger destination-markets. Likewise, as remoteness makes a

destination market less competitive, ceteris paribus, there should be a negative conditional

correlation between zeros and remoteness.

       Finally, if demand curves are sufficiently convex, higher bilateral trade costs raise the

markup and this implies that f.o.b. prices can rise with distance. Because this degree of convexity

implies a counterfactual more-than-full pass-through of cost shocks (e.g., more than 100 percent
                                                      12
exchange rate pass-through) such demand structures are not typically viewed as part of the

standard MC model.

       To recap, considering the MC model under both Dixit-Stiglitz monopolistic competition

and Ottaviano, Tabuchi and Thisse (2002) monopolistic competition:

       Export zeros: The baseline model predicts zero zeros; if an exporter-o sends a good to

                      any destination-d, it will send the good to all destinations. With linear

                      demand, the probability of a zero is increasing in the distance between o

                      and d, and increasing in the size of d. A fall in trade costs will reduce the

                      probability of zeros with linear demand. Controlling for other factors,

                      remoteness should be negatively correlated with zeros.

       Export prices: Considering a single product sold by o in multiple destinations, the

                      baseline model predicts no variation in f.o.b. export prices. With linear

                      demand, the f.o.b. price is decreasing in the distance between o and d,

                      decreasing with the size of d, and increasing with d’s remoteness.

       In terms of HS10 codes, the export zero prediction with linear demand is that the

probability that no firm exports in code i from o to d is decreasing in the distance between o and

d. Unlike in the EK model, the export price prediction with linear demand has nothing to do with

a composition effect. Rather, the prediction is driven by the reduction in markups with distance.

       C.      The heterogeneous-firms trade model

       One of the beauties of the Melitz (2003) heterogeneous-firms trade (HFT) model is that it

provides a clean and convincing story about why some products are not exported at all. But since

Melitz (2003) works with symmetric countries, it cannot address the spatial pattern of export

                                                    13
zeros or export prices. To generate testable hypotheses concerning zeros and prices, Melitz

(2003) must be modified to allow asymmetric countries and arbitrary bilateral trade costs. Such

modifications, however, pose difficult general equilibrium problems linked to the simultaneous

determination of wages, export thresholds and the mass of firms in each nation. The standard

modification that allows country asymmetries – introduced by Helpman, Melitz, and Steven

Yeaple (2004) – gets around the general equilibrium problems by including a costlessly-traded,

constant-returns numeraire sector that pins down wage rates globally. This theoretically

convenient artifice, however, implies that the per-firm demand levels – the Bd – are independent

of market size (see appendix). This in turn leads to the unintuitive prediction that, controlling for

distance, a given export firm sells the same to every market regardless of market size.8 To avoid

these pitfalls, we take an approach that is closer to the original Melitz (2003) set up.

        The Melitz model embraces all of the features of the baseline monopolistic competition

model and adds in two new elements – beachhead costs denoted as F, and heterogeneous, firm-

level, marginal costs. This firm-level marginal-cost heterogeneity is introduced – as in the EK

model – via a stochastic technology-generation process. When a firm pays its set-up cost it

simultaneously draws a unit labor coefficient from the Pareto distribution9

                                                   

                                              a0 

where  is the shape parameter and a0 is the maximum a; as a regularity condition,  >  - 1.

After seeing its a, the firm decides how many markets to enter.


8
  The economic logic rests on entry. The B’s in larger markets have higher numerators (higher wL), but they also
have more firms in equilibrium so the denominator is also higher. Indeed, free entry exactly offsets country-size
differences, equalizing the equilibrium B’s across all nations.
9
  The HFT model is easily solved with an exponential cdf as in the EK model, but the Pareto is more traditional and
can be justified by reference to data on the U.S. firm size distribution (Robert L. Axtell (2001)).
                                                             14
        The assumed Dixit-Stiglitz competition means that: (i) a firm’s optimal price is

proportional to its marginal cost, (ii) its operating profit is proportional to its revenue, and (iii) its

revenue is inversely proportional to its relative price. Thus a firm that draws a relatively high

marginal cost earns little if it produces. If this amount is insufficient to cover the beachhead cost

F in any market, the firm never produces. Firms that draw lower marginal costs may find it

profitable to enter some markets (especially their local market where the absence of trade costs

provides them with a relative cost advantage). More generally, for each export market there is a

threshold marginal cost for every origin nation; firms with marginal cost draws above the

threshold do not sell their production in the market concerned as doing so would yield operating

profit insufficient to cover the beachhead cost. Using (6), which shows the revenue a nation-o

firm would earn if it sold in market-d, and the constant operating-profit share (i.e. 1/), we can

find the cut-off conditions for each trade pair. Defining the bilateral threshold for firms based in

nation-o and selling in nation-d as aod, defined by v od [a od ] /   F , where vod is as in (6).10

Rearranging, the pairwise cutoff is

                                                                      1

where f is the collection of parameters, F(1-1/)1-. The HFT model also involves a free entry

condition (see appendix), but this does not come into play in characterizing the spatial pattern of

zeros and prices.

        As we show in the appendix, it is not possible to solve this model analytically, but




10
  Here we have chosen units (without loss of generality) such that a0=1. We also assume the beachhead costs are the
same in all markets (no difference between home and foreign markets) for notational simplicity.
                                                            15
numerical simulation is straightforward. We show that larger countries have larger per-firm

demands, and as a result any given firm sells more to larger countries than to smaller ones

(controlling for trade costs). The mechanism is that larger countries have endogenously higher

wages, which leads to less entry than there would be if wages were equalized. A way to see the

contrast between the two solutions is to note that incipient entry raises the demand for labor in

the larger country, but that this has different effects depending on the behavior of wages. When

wages are fixed by the numeraire sector, all the adjustment takes place through entry. Without

the numeraire sector, part of the adjustment comes through higher wages in the larger country

which in turn dampens entry, leaving per-firm demand higher in larger countries (see appendix

for details).

        The spatial pattern of zeros comes from the cut-off conditions. The probability that a firm

producing variety-j with marginal costs woao(j) will export to nation-d is the probability that its

marginal cost is less than the threshold defined in (8), namely

where  equals /(-1) and we use (7) to evaluate the likelihood.

        In our empirics, we only have data on products that are actually exported to at least one

market so it is useful to derive the expression for the conditional probability, i.e. the probability

that a firm exports to market d given that it exports to at least one market. This conditional

probability of exports from o to d by a typical firm is

Since we work with data for a single exporting nation, the denominator here will be a constant

for all products. Plainly, the probability of a positive trade flow decreases with  (proxied by

bilateral distance in our empirics), and increases in the firm-specific demand shifter, B. As B is

increasing in a destination market’s size and price index P, it is more likely to observe positive

flows with destination markets that are large and remote, when other factors are controlled for.11

           The spatial pattern of prices is also simple to derive. We consider both the export (f.o.b.)

price for a particular good exported to several markets, and the average export (f.o.b.) price for

all varieties exported by a particular nation. Because mill pricing is optimal for every firm, a

given firm’s f.o.b. export price is predicted to be identical for all destinations. In particular, the

export price for any given good should be unrelated to bilateral distance and unrelated to the size

or remoteness of the origin and destination nations. However, the range of goods exported does

depend on bilateral distance, size, and remoteness, so the average bilateral f.o.b. export price will

also depend on these. The cut-off conditions (8) imply

                                                                      1

        The logic of (13) is that since the cut-off marginal cost, aod, falls with bilateral distance,

and increases with market size and remoteness, the average export price of nation-o varieties to

nation-d should be decreasing in distance, and increasing in the size and remoteness of the export

market. The intuition is that the cheapest goods are the most competitive in the Melitz model, so

they travel the furthest.

        The HFT model, like the monopolistic competition model, has imperfect competition and

increasing returns as core elements. As noted above, there are many different forms of imperfect

competition and scale economies. The other core elements of the HFT model are beachhead

costs or choke-prices (these explain why not all varieties are sold in all markets) and

heterogeneous marginal costs (these explain why some nation-o firms can sell in a market but

others cannot). This suggests three dimensions along which HFT models can vary: market

structure, source of scale economies, and source of heterogeneity.

        For example, Eaton, Kortum, and Kramarz (2008) present a model that incorporates

beachhead and iceberg costs in a setting that nests the Ricardian framework of Eaton-Kortum

(2002) and Bernard et al (2003) with the monopolistic competition approach of Melitz (2003).

The model, however, does not assume set-up costs and does not deal with entry since firms are

assumed to be endowed with a technology draw. Another difference is that they work with a

technology-generating function from the exponential family. Svetlana Demidova (2008), and

Rod Falvey, David Greenaway and Zhihong Yu (2006) allow for technological asymmetry


                                                      18
among nations but embrace Dixit-Stiglitz competition with iceberg, beachhead and set-up costs.

Yeaple (2005) assumes the source of the heterogeneous marginal costs stems from workers who

are endowed with heterogeneous productivity and works with Dixit-Stiglitz monopolistic

competition with iceberg and beachhead costs. As these models all involve Dixit-Stiglitz

monopolistic competition, iceberg and beachhead costs, their spatial predictions for zeros and

price are qualitatively in line with the model laid out above.

       Melitz and Ottaviano (2008) work with the Ottaviano, Tabuchi, and Thisse (2002)

monopolistic competition framework with linear demands. The implied choke-price substitutes

for beachhead costs in shutting off the trade of high-cost varieties. The Melitz-Ottaviano

prediction for the spatial pattern of zeros matches that of the asymmetric HFT model with

respect to bilateral distance, but not with respect to market size. As our appendix illustrates, the

cut-off marginal cost in Melitz-Ottaviano is tied to the y-axis intercept of the linear residual

demand curve facing a typical firm. More intense competition lowers this intercept (this is how

pure profits are eliminated in the model) and thus the cut-off, aod, falls with the degree of

competition. Since large nations and nations that are not very remote have more intense

competition from local and imported varieties, Melitz-Ottaviano predicts that large countries

should have lower cut-offs, controlling for the nation’s remoteness. In other words, Melitz-

Ottaviano predicts a positive relationship between the size of the partner nation and the number

of zeros in an exporter’s matrix of bilateral, product-level exports.

       Predictions for the spatial pattern of prices are also decided by the intercept, which is

itself affected by the local price index, Pd. Thus, Melitz-Ottaviano predicts that export prices

should decline with the market’s distance and with market size. As remoteness dampens

competition in nation-d, the export price from nation-o should rise with d’s remoteness. To

recap, considering both the baseline HFT model with CES and linear demands:

       Export zeros The probability of an export zero is increasing in bilateral distance. The

                       effect of market size on the probability of an export zero is negative in the

                       baseline model, and positive in the Melitz-Ottaviano variant.

       Export prices The average f.o.b. price is decreasing in the distance between o and d

                       since only the cheapest (i.e. most competitive) varieties are sold in distant

                       markets. The effect of market size on the average f.o.b. price is positive in

                       the baseline model, and negative in the Melitz-Ottaviano variant. More

                       remote markets have higher prices under both Dixit-Stiglitz and Melitz-

                       Ottaviano competition.

       In terms of HS10 codes, the export-zero prediction refers to the probability that no

variety is exported in a particular code from o to d. The export-price prediction is driven by a

composition effect within HS10 codes, as was the export-price prediction in the EK model.


II.    ZEROS AND PRICES IN TRADE DATA

       The models described in the previous section all make predictions about detailed trade

data in a many country world. These predictions are collected for easy reference in the first five

rows of Table 1.

       TABLE 1 NEAR HERE

       To evaluate these predictions, we use detailed data on imports and exports, specifically

the trade data collected by the U.S. Customs Service and made available on CD-ROM. For both

U.S. imports and U.S. exports, the Census reports data for all trading partners classified by the

10-digit Harmonized System (HS). For each country-HS10 record, Census reports value,
                                                    20
quantity, and shipping mode. In addition, the import data include shipping costs and tariff

charges. Our data analysis also includes information on distance and various macro variables,

which come from the Penn-World Tables.

       The Census data are censored from below, which means that very small trade flows are

not reported. For imports, the cut-off is $250, so the smallest value of trade reported is $251. For

exports, the cut-off is 10 times higher, at $2,500. This relatively high censoring level for exports

is a potential problem, since there might be many economically meaningful export relationships

which are inappropriately coded as nonexistent. One hint that this problem is not too prevalent

comes from the import data, where only 0.8 percent of the non-zero trade flows are between

$250 and $2,500.

       A.      How many zeros?

       We define a zero as a trade flow which could have occurred but did not. For exports, a

zero occurs when the U.S. exports an HS10 code to at least one country but not all. The

interpretation of an export zero is simple, since they are defined only for goods actually

produced. For imports, a zero is an HS10 code which is imported from at least one country but

not all. The interpretation of an import zero is not as simple; they may be defined in cases when

the country in question does not even produce the good (e.g. the U.S. imports no bananas from

Canada).

       The incidence of zeros in U.S. trade in 2005 is reported in Table 2. The US imports

nearly 17,000 different HS10 categories from 228 countries, for a total of over 3.8 million

potential trade flows. Over 90 percent of these potential trade flows are zeros. The median

number of supplier countries was 12, with a quarter of goods being supplied by at least 23

countries. Only 5 percent of codes have a unique supplier. In principle this pattern of imports is
                                                   21
consistent with a homogeneous goods model, since if we define a good narrowly enough it will

have just one supplier. However, the large number of suppliers for the majority of narrowly

defined codes seems instead to be suggestive of product differentiation.12 This well-known

phenomenon is part of what motivated the development of monopolistic competition trade

models.

        TABLE 2 NEAR HERE

        Zeros are almost as common in the export data as in the import data. Table 2 shows that

in 2005 the U.S. exported 8,880 HS10 codes to 230 different destinations, for a total of more

than 2 million potential trade flows. Of these, 82 percent are zeros. Unlike the import zeros these

have an unambiguous interpretation, since a zero is defined only if a good is exported to at least

one country, which necessarily means the good is produced in the U.S. The median number of

export markets is 35, with a quarter of codes exported to at least 59 markets. Only 1 percent of

codes are sent to a unique partner.

        Many of the 230 places that the U.S. trades with are tiny to the point of insignificance

(Andorra, Falkland Islands, Nauru, Pitcairn, Vatican City, and the like). Restricting attention to

the 100 large countries for which we have at least some macroeconomic data reduces the

incidence of zeros somewhat (86 percent for imports, 70 percent for exports), but does not

fundamentally change the message that zeros predominate.

        From the standpoint of theory, the predominance of HS10 code zeros almost certainly

understates the number of zeros at the level of firms and/or products. This is because, as noted

above, each HS10 code contains products from an average of 31 different firms, and each firm-


12
  The largest number of trading partners for any product is 125, for product 6204.52.2020, “Women’s trousers and
breeches, of cotton, not knitted or crocheted”. This is not a homogeneous goods category.
                                                           22
product in a given code might be exported to a proper subset of the countries with positive

purchases in that code.

       The predominance of export zeros suggests that the baseline monopolistic competition

model with CES preferences discussed in Section 2 misses important aspects of the world trade

pattern (the model was not designed with zeros in mind as these facts were unknown when it was

developed). This suggests that including either beachhead costs or choke-off prices is essential to

mapping even the first order features of real world trade patterns.

       B.      Export zeros across space

       The gravity equation offers a flexible and ubiquitous statistical explanation for the

aggregate volume of trade between countries. The basic logic of the gravity equation is

simplicity itself: bilateral trade volumes depend positively on country size and negatively on

distance. As emphasized by James Anderson and Eric van Wincoop (2003), countries’ relative

distance from their trading partners also affects bilateral trade volumes, an effect visible in the

theory models discussed in the previous section and that we are calling “remoteness”. Here we

adopt the gravity approach to explain not the volume of trade but rather its incidence. This

descriptive statistical exercise is intended to help us understand the pattern of export zeros

summarized in Table 2.

       We emphasize that the purpose of our statistical exercises in this and the following

section is to document robust reduced form relationships in the data. Any structural model of

trade should be consistent with these correlations. We contrast our approach with the well-known

recent paper by Helpman, Melitz, and Yona Rubinstein (2008); that paper structurally estimates

the distance elasticity of trade in the context of a particular theoretical model. They also focus

only on country-level zeros, that is, pairs of countries that have no trade in any product. As Table
                                                      23
2 and Figure 1 illustrate, product level zeros are a first-order feature of the data for U.S. trade,

while the U.S. has positive trade in some products with virtually every country in the world.

       We focus on U.S. export zeros because of their unambiguous interpretation as products

which the U.S. produces and ships to at least one, but not all, countries. Extending the gravity

logic suggests that exports should be more likely the larger the production of the good, the larger

and more remote the export market, and the shorter the distance the good would have to travel.

We have no information on production volumes by good, so we focus on within-product

variation across export partners. As indicated in Table 2, the dimensions of the data in 2005 are

8,880 HS10 codes and 100 countries.

       Figure 1 offers a first look at the data. The vertical axis shows market size (measured as

log real GDP of the importing country) and the horizontal axis shows distance from the United

States (measured as log kilometers between Chicago and the capital city of the importer). Each

point is represented by a circle, where the size of the circle is proportional to the number of

HS10 codes exported from the U.S. to the importer. Canada and Mexico are identified, with

other country names left out in the interest of legibility.

       A number of patterns are visible in Figure 1. First, controlling for distance, size is

associated with more codes being exported (to see this, pick a point on the log distance axis such

as 8 or 9 and observe that the circles generally get bigger from bottom to top). Second, the small,

distant exporters clustered in the lower right hand corner of the plot have very small circles,

meaning that few codes are exported to these markets. Overall, Figure 1 suggests a gravity

relationship: the number of codes exported increases with market size and decreases with

distance.

       We next turn to statistical analysis of the probability that a code is exported from the
                                                      24
United States to a particular market. Our statistical model is motivated by the theory summarized

in Table 1. All of the models suggest that both export prices and the probability of trade depend

on trade costs between the U.S. and the importer, importer market size, and importer remoteness.

Here is how we measure these theoretical concepts:

           Trade costs: The most obvious proxy for trade costs is distance, which we measure as

kilometers from Chicago to the capital city of the importer.

           While trade costs are likely to be weakly monotonic in distance, there is no reason to

expect them to have any particular functional form, so we specify the distance proxy in two

ways. The first is simply log distance. The second breaks distance down into bins, derived from

looking for natural breaks in distance among U.S. trading partners. These bins are described in

Table 3. We also include several country-specific indicators of trade costs that have been often

used in the gravity literature: dummies equal to one if the importer is landlocked, an island,

shares a border with the U.S., and if the primary language is English.13

           Market size: Our measure of market size is real GDP, from the Penn World Tables. We

also include real GDP per capita as a demand-related control.

           Remoteness: The proper specification of remoteness is model-specific, which creates a

potentially important measurement issue for our purposes since we are interested in comparing

the performance of various models in explaining a common set of facts. However, most

theoretically consistent measures of remoteness have a common structure as they all work via the

average price of goods sold in a destination market. This average price in turn depends upon the

number of varieties produced locally in the destination market, and the number of imported

                                                                25
varieties and the bilateral trade costs they face. As the number of varieties coming from each

exporting nation is – roughly speaking – related to the origin-nation’s size, a reasonable proxy

for remoteness involves market-size weighted sums of an inverse power function of trade costs.

Following this logic, we adopt the following measure of remoteness in our empirical work,

                C
         Rd   Yo d oc
               o 1



James Harrigan (2003) shows that this remoteness index is an approximation to the model-

specific measures of Anderson and van Wincoop (2003) and Eaton and Kortum (2002).

Empirical implementation of Rd involves some potentially important choices about how to

measure within-country distance ddd and what value to use for the exponent .14 Fortunately, our

empirical results are entirely insensitive to any reasonable choice of how to construct Rd, and in

what follows we include within country distance as reported in the CEPII data (cf. footnote 13),

and set  equal to 1. The reason for this robustness is simply that the cross section variation in Rd

is overwhelmingly dominated by differences in the GDP-weighted raw distances (consider New

Zealand versus Belgium), so that different choices about including own distance and what value

to choose for  lead to very highly correlated measures.

        Our statistical approach models the incidence of positive U.S. exports as a function of a

where yic = 1 if positive exports of HS10 code i from the U.S. to country c, xc = is a vector of

country c characteristics, F is a probability distribution function,  is a vector of parameters to be

estimated, and  ic is an error term.


         There are three sets of econometric issues involved in estimating (14): the functional

form of F , the specification of the index function xc, and computation of the covariance matrix

of β̂ (the estimate of ).


         Functional Form: The key specification issue is how to control for HS10-specific effects.

This is quite important a priori, since different HS10 codes are likely to have systematically

different probabilities of being exported. The probit and linear probability models have different

advantages and disadvantages, so we use both. The advantage of the probit is that it produces

fitted probabilities that are between zero and one, but the disadvantage is that we cannot include

HS10 fixed effects.15 With the linear probability model we can estimate HS10 fixed effects, but

the assumption that the error term has unlimited range is incorrect. We also estimate a random

effects probit model, which treats HS10 effects as random and orthogonal to the country-level

regressors. Finally, to allow for different parameter values for different subsamples, we estimate

the model on two samples: all HS codes, and only codes that map to SITC 6 (manufactured

goods), 7 (machinery and transport equipment), and 8 (miscellaneous manufactures).

         Index function: We specify three variants of the index function. The first simply enters

distance, real GDP, real GDP per capita, and remoteness log-linearly. The second adds an

  This is not a computational issue but a statistical one: the probit estimator with fixed effects is not a consistent
estimator of  (see, for example, Wooldridge (2002), pp. 483-484).
                                                                27
interaction between log distance and log real GDP. The third replaces the log linear measure of

distance with the distance bins discussed above (the excluded distance category includes Mexico

and Canada, so we cannot estimate a separate border effect in this specification).


       Covariance matrix of β̂ : Our data has a balanced panel structure, with each HS10 code i

potentially exported to each importer c. There is sure to be population correlation in the errors

 ic both across i for a given c, and across c for a given i. Recent econometric theory results due

to A. Colin Cameron, Jonah B. Gelbach, and Douglas L. Miller (forthcoming) show how to

handle such a situation using multi-way clustering of the errors by HS code i and importer c, and

we implement this procedure for the probit and linear probability specifications. Put simply, the

Cameron et al procedure allows us to assume arbitrary and non-constant correlation within both

c and i clusters, and we assume independence only across clusters, as is standard. Robust

covariance matrix estimation is not applicable with the random effects probit estimator (see

Jeffrey M. Wooldridge (2002), pg. 485-486), so we report standard errors conditional on the

(untenable) assumption that the errors are independent within, as well as across, i and c.

       To summarize, we estimate 18 different versions of (14), namely three specifications 

three estimators  two samples. The results are reported in Table 4. The first column of Table 4

reports our baseline results. The coefficients are the marginal effects on the probability of a code

being exported to a particular country, conditional on being exported to at least one country,

evaluated at the sample mean. The continuous variables are scaled to have sample standard

deviation one, so the coefficients answer the question: how much does the probability of

exporting increase with a one standard deviation increase in the explanatory variable? Distance

has a powerful negative effect on the probability of exporting, with a one standard deviation

increase in distance reducing the probability by about 0.11. Market size as measured by real
                                                     28
GDP has a similarly powerful positive effect, with a one standard deviation increase in market

size raising the probability of exporting by about 0.18, with the effect of real GDP per capita a

bit smaller at 0.11. Remoteness also has a large positive effect, with a one standard deviation

increase raising the export probability by 0.067. English-language importers have a 0.08 percent

greater probability of importing a particular product. The other indicators (common border,

landlocked, and island) do not have statistically significant effects on export probability. These

inferences are very similar across the linear and random effects probit specifications, although as

noted above the very small standard errors in the latter specification should be discounted. The

effects are also quite similar, though a bit larger, when the sample is restricted to manufacturing

codes only (see second panel of the Table).

        The second three columns of Table 4 include an interaction between log distance and log

GDP per capita. In the linear probability model all three parameter estimates are statistically

insignificant, and in the probit specification the coefficient on real GDP is significant and

negative at just the 10 percent level. Our interpretation of these imprecise results is that the data

cannot reliably estimate an interaction effect.

        The final three columns of Table 4 measure distance using a step function rather than as

log kilometers.16 In the probit specification, distance less than 4000 kilometers (which includes

the Caribbean basin) has no effect on export probability, an effect which becomes -0.16 to -0.21

once distance is greater than 4000 kilometers with no statistically significant differences in the

effects of the three distance categories above 4000 kilometers. The estimated effects are similar

in the linear probability and random effects probit specifications, and when the sample is



16
  The excluded distance category is zero kilometers (Canada and Mexico), which is why we cannot separately
estimate a border effect in this specification.
                                                          29
restricted to manufacturing goods. These results suggest a simple interpretation: when goods

must cross an ocean the probability of exporting falls by about 0.2, but other variation in distance

is of secondary importance. In fact, a simple specification where distance is replaced by a single

indicator for crossing an ocean, which is equivalent to restricting the coefficients on the three

indicators for distance greater than 4000 kilometers to be the same, fits quite well (we don’t

report these results to save space). The estimated effects of the other explanatory variables are

quite similar to their estimates from the linear distance specifications.

       TABLE 4 NEAR HERE

       In summary, the 18 different estimated versions of (14) tell a clear and consistent story:

distance has a big negative effect on the probability that a good is exported, while larger, richer,

and more remote markets are much more likely to import. While in many respects not surprising,

it is worth noting that the results of Table 4 are not consistent with most of the models

summarized in Table 1. Only the HFT model with CES preferences is consistent with the

positive market size and remoteness effects and negative distance effects identified so strongly in

the data.

       In a recent paper, Roc Armenter and Miklos Koren (2008) show that correlations of zeros

with distance and importer size such as those documented in Table 4 can be generated by a

purely random assignment of trade shipments to product categories, conditional on aggregate

bilateral trade volumes. Armenter and Koren argue that their results make it difficult to use

empirical results about zeros to discriminate between trade models. As shown in Section I above

and summarized in Table 1, the different models we study do not all predict that HS10-level

zeros are correlated with distance and importer size, so the Armenter-Koren results are not

relevant to how we interpret the empirical results of Table 4.

                                                     30
       C.      Export unit values across space

       We now turn to a descriptive analysis of export unit values. The statistical model is very

similar to the previous section, with within-HS10 code variation in unit values regressed on

characteristics of the importing country including distance, market size, and remoteness:

                                             pic   i  βxc   ic                                (15)

where pic is the log of the f.o.b. average unit value of code i shipped to country c and the vector

xc is the same as in the previous section. The code fixed effect  i controls both for the average

unit value of products (industrial diamonds vs. peanuts) and differences in units (kilos vs.

bushels) across codes. Because this analysis uses only non-zero export observations, the sample

size is much smaller than in the previous section, and the panel is highly unbalanced because the

incidence of zeros varies widely across products. Estimation is by OLS with HS10 fixed effects,

and standard errors are clustered by HS10 code and importing country. As in the previous

section, we consider three different specifications estimated on different sub-samples.

       The residual in (15) can be given several interpretations. Probably the most natural is

simple measurement error stemming from the fact that unit values are not the same as true prices.

A related interpretation is that the residual arises due to aggregation within a product-importer

category of many different goods that may be horizontally as well as vertically differentiated.

       The most common definition of units in the U.S. export data unit is a simple count, with

the second most common being weight in kilograms (some records report two unit definitions, in

which case the second unit is almost always kilos). Other units include bushels, barrels, square

meters, grams, and the like. While the code fixed effects sweep out differences in units across

products, there may still be a difficulty in comparing the effects of distance, market size, and

                                                      31
remoteness on unit values not in common units. To address this concern, we run the regression

above on the subset of data for which kilograms are the unit, so that unit value is simply the

value/weight ratio. We also report results where the sample is restricted to manufactured goods,

as in the previous section.

       Product level unit values are notoriously noisy indicators of prices, particularly for very

small trade flows. To make sure that our results are not overly influenced by noisy and

economically unimportant observations we trim the estimation sample by discarding all export

flows of less than $10,000, which eliminates the smallest 7 percent of observations.

       Table 5 reports the results of our export unit value regressions. A striking message is that

distance has a very large positive effect on unit values. Looking at the first column in the Table,

which is our baseline specification, the distance elasticity of unit values is over 0.2. This

elasticity is even larger for manufactured goods and a bit smaller for goods measured in kilos,

though the differences across samples are not statistically significant.

       The market size elasticity is small and negative at -0.04, an effect which disappears when

the sample is restricted to goods measured in kilos. Turning to the specification with a distance-

market size interaction, the implied distance elasticity in the full sample is smaller for richer

countries, but remains positive for 97 out of 100 of the countries in the sample. The implied

market size elasticity becomes more negative with distance, and is negative for 85 of the 100

countries in the sample (similar results apply to the manufacturing and kilos samples).

       When distance is measured using a step function rather than as log kilometers, the same

pattern that was observed in the zeros results reappears: for importers within 4000 kilometers of

Chicago, distance does not have a statistically significant effect (except when the sample is

restricted to goods measured in kilos). When reaching an export market requires crossing an
                                                     32
ocean, the effect of distance is very large and mildly increasing in distance, with an effect of

about 40 to 60 log points. These are extremely large effects, since a 50 log point effect

corresponds to distance raising export unit values by 65 percent.

       The effect of remoteness is large and consistently negative across specifications and

samples, with the range of elasticities between -1.5 and -2.7 (though it should be noted that the

sample standard deviation of log remoteness is only 0.05, so not much of the variation in the data

is explained by remoteness). The effect of aggregate productivity is fragile: there is a small

positive effect when the sample is restricted to products measured in kilos, and a small negative

effect for manufactured goods, with the effect for the sample as a whole being indistinguishable

from zero. Finally, the other indicator variables (border, landlocked, island, and English

language) have inconsistent and generally statistically insignificant effects.

       The Table 5 results are consistent with the findings of Hummels and Alexandre Skiba

(2004). In particular, equation (12) in Hummels and Skiba is quite similar to the specification

estimated in Table 5. The biggest difference is that we include market size and remoteness as

explanatory variables for log unit values while Hummels and Skiba do not. Hummels and Skiba

interpret the price-distance correlation as evidence of a composition effect in demand due to

lower proportionate transport costs on higher quality goods, an effect whose strength increases in

distance. The Hummels-Skiba explanation is based on their evidence that transport costs are per

unit rather than ad valorem, which is to say that the usual iceberg transport cost assumption,

which is embodied in all of the theory models that we consider, is wrong. In the following

section we retain the iceberg transport cost assumption for comparability with the literature and

to allow analytical solution of the general equilibrium model. The quality-sorting mechanism

that we propose to explain the price-distance relationship operates through a different mechanism

                                                     33
than the relative demand effect proposed by Hummels-Skiba, but the two explanations work in

the same direction and we regard them as complementary.

         Figure 2 illustrates the price-distance relationship that is described statistically in Table 5.

To construct this figure, we first subtracted HS10 means from all log export unit values.17 The

distribution of the de-meaned unit values is then plotted, with the histogram of unit values for

goods sent to Mexico and Canada rendered as green solid bars, and the corresponding histogram

for goods sent 4000-7800 kilometers rendered as red open bars.18 This distance category was

chosen for comparison with Canada/Mexico because it contains the largest value of trade of the

distance categories we examine, but figures for other distance categories are very similar, as

would be expected from the Table 5 results. Figure 2 shows a clear right shift in the distribution

for goods sent across an ocean: even without controlling for composition, market size, etc,

distance is systematically associated with higher export unit values.

         The strong positive relationship between export unit values and distance seen in Table 5

and Figure 2 is inconsistent with all of the models presented in Section 2. The baseline

monopolistic competition model predict a zero relationship, while the other models predict a

negative relationship between export unit values and distance, the exact opposite of what shows

up so strongly in the data. Only the Melitz-Ottaviano model is consistent with the negative

market size effect on prices.

         We emphasize that the effect of distance on unit values found here cannot be given a

clear structural interpretation. Most obviously, since we know from the results of Table 4 that




17
   That is, we regressed all log export unit values on a full set of HS10 fixed effects. The residuals from this
regression are plotted in Figure 2, by distance category.

                                                               34
distance has a strong influence on the probability of zeros, the effect estimated here conflates a

selection effect (which markets are exported to) and a treatment effect (conditional on positive

exports, what is the effect of distance on unit value).


III.   TRADE WITH HETEROGENEOUS QUALITY

       The empirical evidence presented above has a clear message: the Melitz model does a

good job of explaining export zeros, but cannot explain spatial variation in prices. In this section

we introduce a slight variant of the HFT model that can account for the spatial facts on prices.

The basic change is that firms will compete on the basis of quality as well as price, so we refer to

it as the quality heterogeneous-firms model, or QHFT for short.

       A.      Quality and trade: antecedents and recent work

       The idea that exporting firms compete on quality as well as price has a long history in

international trade economics. In examining the linkages between quality and national trade

patterns, we follow a number of important recent papers, including primarily empirical papers by

Schott (2004), Hummels and Peter Klenow (2005), and Juan Carlos Hallak (2006). Schott’s

(2004) importance lies in the finding of a strong positive relationship between exporter GDP per

capita and the average unit value of HS10 codes sold to the United States (in contrast, our results

reported in Table 5 look at the opposite flow and find no robust relationship between U.S. export

unit values and the GDP per capita of the importer). Hummels and Klenow (2005) sketch the

empirical implications of a number of homogenous-firms trade theories that take quality as

national attributes. As such, the Melitz-like selection effect of distance-related trade costs is not

in operation; bilateral export patterns are marked by an all-varieties-or-none pattern. A key

empirical finding of Hummels and Klenow (2005) is an empirical association between exporter


                                                      35
GDP per capita and export unit value. While Schott (2004) and Hummels and Klenow (2005)

find a relationship between exporter GDP per capita and quality, Hallak (2006) looks at the

demand side, and finds that the demand for quality is related to importer GDP per capita.

        In an important recent paper, Hallak and Schott (2008) take a more nuanced approach to

estimating exporter product quality, both across countries and over time, by developing a method

to disentangle price and quality variation in unit value data. Among their findings is a

confirmation that the level of quality is correlated with the level of development, but the

relationship is somewhat weaker in growth rates. Amit Khandelwal (2009) also separates price

and quality, and finds that this decomposition enables provocative insights into the nature of U.S.

manufacturer’s exposure to competition from imports. Khandelwal also confirms the association

between exporter level of development and export quality.

        There are a number of different approaches to modeling the demand for quality. The most

common is to model preferences for what might be called box-size-quality: the utility of

consuming two boxes of variety-j with quality 1 is identical to consuming one box of variety-j

with quality 2, just as if it were a bigger box of the same good.19 In the standard CES

monopolistic competition setting this means consumers make their decisions on quality-adjusted

price rather than the observed price (i.e. they care about the observed price adjusted for box-

size). An older theoretical literature, exemplified by Kevin Murphy and Andrei Shleifer (1997)

and Gene Grossman and Helpman (1991) worked with vertical quality models where several

firms compete on price and quality to win a single market. A separate approach is found in the

Industrial Organization “buy only one” models of quality demand used in the trade literature by



19
 Hummels and Klenow (2005), Hallak (2006), Hallak and Schott (2008) and Kugler and Verhoogen (2008), among
many others, use variations on this approach.

Eric Verhoogen (2008), Khandelwal (2009), and John Sutton (2007).

        Models of the supply of quality by firms differ in their details, but invariably deliver a

mapping between an exogenous parameter (Sutton (2008) calls it “capability”, Khandelwal

(2009) calls it “ability”, Verhoogen (2006) calls it “productivity”, etc) and the possibly

endogenous supply of quality, a characteristic valued by consumers.20 Market equilibrium in

these models is usually some variant of Nash equilibrium (including monopolistic competition).

        The value added of our QHFT model developed below lies in three main dimensions.

First, we work out a general equilibrium trade model with trade costs and many nations where

quality is a basis of comparative advantage and quality is linked in a very simple manner to

fundamentals in each nation. As part of this, we show that adding in quality as part of a firm’s

competitiveness is best thought of as a conceptual amendment to the standard HFT models rather

than a separate model. Second, the model allows for firm heterogeneity in productivity and

quality in line with empirical evidence. Third, we develop specific, testable hypotheses and,

referring back to Section 3 above, show that the QHFT model is more consistent with the data

than the models discussed in Section 2 above.

        Since the first draft of our paper was widely disseminated in March 2007, a number of

“quality heterogeneous-firms trade” models have been developed or are in development. Several

of these use the box-size-quality preferences over quality and monopolistic competition (Robert

Johnson 2008, Maurice Kugler and Verhoogen 2008), while others work in the buy-only-one-

unit preferences or the linear preferences taken from the tradition of partial equilibrium models

of Industrial Organization theory (Sutton 2007, Ralph Auer and Thomas Chaney 2007). The only



20
  An exception is Thomas Helble and Toshihiro Okubo (2006), whose model assumes that quality has no effect on
demand, but that high quality products face lower beachhead costs.

paper that works out the full general equilibrium with trade costs is Alexis Antoniades (2008, in

progress), who incorporates quality competition into the Melitz-Ottaviano model. Others assume

away trade costs, which are essential to our empirically testable predictions (Kugler and

Verhoogen 2008, Sutton 2007).

        B.      Quality, heterogeneous firms, and trade: the QHFT model

        Most of the assumptions and notation of our QHFT model are in keeping with the HFT

model introduced above. There are two main changes. On the demand side consumers now care

about quality, and on the supply side firms produce varieties of different quality. More precisely,

consumers regard some varieties as superior to others. This superiority could be regarded purely

as a matter of taste, but we will interpret superiority as a matter of “quality.” The utility function

is


                                U         i
                                                   (ci qi )11 /  di   
                                                                        1 /(11 /  )
                                                                                        ;    1            (16)


where c and q are the units consumed and quality of a typical variety and  is the set of

consumed varieties. The optimal expenditure on a typical variety is

                                        pj                                   E                   p

                                                                                  , P 1   ( i )1 di   (17)
                                        qj                                  P                i qi


where pj/qj has the interpretation of a quality-adjusted price of good-j, P is the CES index of

quality-adjusted prices, and  the set of consumed varieties. The standard CES preferences are a

special case of (16) with qj=1, for all j.

        As in the standard HFT model, manufacturing firms draw their a from a random

distribution after paying a fixed innovation cost of FI units of labor (see appendix for details). In


                                                                            38
the QHFT model, however, high costs are not all bad news, for higher quality is assumed to

come with higher marginal cost. In particular

                                                   1
                                         qj  aj         ,          1                          (18)


where 1 +  is the ‘quality elasticity’, namely the extent to which higher marginal costs are

related to higher quality (setting  = -1 reduces this to the standard HFT model). Observe that

although this link is assumed for simplicity’s sake, allowing firms to optimally choose quality

would not enrich the model. In any model where heterogeneity only stemmed from firms’

productivity, optimization would yield a link between a firm’s optimized q and its a that would

resemble (18). Indeed, a similar positive (and often log-linear) relationship between quality and

marginal cost is common to many of the papers discussed above, including Khandelwal (2009),

Verhoogen (2008), Johnson (2008), and Antoniades (2008). Some of these papers derive this

relationship as the solution of the firm’s optimal quality choice problem, but the reduced forms

plainly depend only upon a firm’s randomly assigned productivity. The point is that all firms

face identical parameters (factor costs, etc) except for their firm-specific productivity draw.

Obviously then the optimal, firm-specific quality choice will vary only with firm-specific

productivity.

       The important contribution of Kugler and Verhoogen (2008) provides direct empirical

support for the relationship between quality and cost. Using a remarkable dataset from Colombia

which records information on the cost of firms’ inputs, Kugler and Verhoogen (2008) show that

higher cost inputs are systematically associated with higher quality outputs, as we assume in

(18). Also see the plant-level evidence for this mechanism in Eileen Brooks (2006), and

Verhoogen (2008).


                                                             39
       At the time it chooses prices, the typical firm takes its quality and marginal cost as given,

so the standard Dixit-Stiglitz results apply. Mill-pricing is optimal for all firms in all markets,

and operating profit is a constant fraction, 1/ , of firm revenue. Using mill-pricing and (18) in

(17), the optimized operating profit for a typical nation-o firm selling in nation-d is

                                                                            1
                                           v od [a ]        a  wo            Bd
                                                         od          
                                                                                                (19)
                                                          1  1/              

       The only difference between this and the corresponding expression for profits without

quality differences is the  in the exponent on a. Plainly, the properties of this model crucially

depend on how elastic quality is with respect to marginal cost. For    1, 0  , quality increases

slowly with cost and the optimal quality-adjusted consumer price increases with a firm’s a. In

this case, a firm’s revenue and operating profit fall with its marginal cost. For   0 , by contrast,

quality increases quickly enough so that the quality-adjusted price falls as a rises. This means

that higher a’s are associated with higher operating profit. Henceforth we focus on the   0

case because, as the empirics above suggested, it is the case that is most consistent with the data.

       Given (19), v od [a od ] /   F defines the cut-off for nation-o sales to market-d; this can be

rewritten as

                                                                        1

                                                          B      1                          (20)
                                            wo a od      od d   
                                                           f       

       Assuming   0 , this tells us that only firms with sufficiently high-price/high-quality

goods find it worthwhile to sell to distant markets. This is the opposite of Melitz (2003) and all

other HFT models. In standard HFT models, competition depends only on price, so it is the

lowest priced goods that make it to the most distant markets. In the QHFT model, competition
                                                          40
depends on quality-adjusted prices and with  > 0, the most competitive varieties are high-

price/high-quality. This means that distance selects for high-priced varieties rather than low-

priced varieties as in the HFT model.

       Since the QHFT model can be reduced to the HFT model with quality adjusted prices, the

general equilibrium solution for the QHFT model is isomorphic to that of the HFT model (see

appendix for details). More elaborate and nuanced models of quality choice (e.g., Johnson (2008)

and Sutton (2007)) are well suited to addressing partial equilibrium industry-competition issues,

but they are not amenable to the general equilibrium analysis necessary to yield testable

predictions for the spatial pattern of zeros and prices. For this reason, we do not pursue such

extensions here.

       C.      Quality HFT’s spatial pattern of zeros and prices

       The spatial pattern of zeros in the QHFT model conforms to those of the HFT model, as a

comparison of the cut-off conditions of the two models, (8) and (20), reveals. The key, new

implication has to do with the relationship between prices and distance. Since a high observed

price indicates high competitiveness (i.e. a low quality-adjusted price), the marginal cost

thresholds are increasing in distance, rather than decreasing as in the HFT model. Given that mill

pricing is optimal, this means that the selection produces average c.i.f. and f.o.b. prices that are

increasing with bilateral distance. Of course, the logic of the model turns on the fact that the

average f.o.b. quality-adjusted prices are decreasing in distance, but since the data report only

average unit values this is not a testable implication.

       Like all of the other models reviewed in this paper, the QHFT model assumes ad valorem

trade costs. As discussed in the previous section, the partial equilibrium quality-sorting


                                                     41
explanation of the price-distance relationship proposed by Hummels and Skiba (2004) is

complementary to the general equilibrium quality-selection mechanism in the QHFT model.

Incorporating per-unit trade costs into our CES-based general equilibrium model of quality

competition would make an analytical solution impossible and would also break the close

connection to Melitz (2003), so we do not pursue this extension here.

       Equation (20) also implies that the relationship between average f.o.b. prices and market

size and remoteness is decreasing, the opposite of the relationship given by the baseline HFT

model. The reason for the different prediction is that as export market becomes more attractive –

either due to size or remoteness – selection leads to lower quality firms to enter; their entry

lowers the average f.o.b. price.

       We summarize the quality HFT model’s predictions as

       Export zeros: The probability of an export zero is increasing in bilateral distance, and

                       decreasing in market size and remoteness.

       Export prices: Considering a single product sold by o in multiple destinations, the f.o.b.

                       price is increasing in the distance between o and d. The effect of market

                       size and remoteness on average f.o.b. prices is negative in the baseline

                       model.

       These predictions are noted in the last line of Table 2. Once again, the QHFT model is

the only one that we considered which matches the findings of the data analysis in Section 3.


IV.    CONCLUDING REMARKS

       This paper has shown that existing models of bilateral trade all fail to explain key

features of the product-level data that we document using highly disaggregated U.S. trade data:
                                                     42
      Most products are exported to only a few destinations.

      The incidence of these “export zeros” is positively related to distance and negatively

       related to market size and remoteness.

      The average unit value of exports is positively related to distance.

       We finished the paper by proposing a slight modification of the Melitz model which fits

all of the facts just summarized. The modification assumes that consumers care about quality and

firms’ heterogeneity in productivity shows up in heterogeneous quality in a specific way. The

most competitive firms – i.e. those with the lowest quality-adjusted price – charge the highest

market prices. This accounts for the fact that the most expensive products seem to be sold to the

most distant markets.

       Notes to Table 1 The first five rows of the table summarize the theoretical comparative static

predictions discussed in Section 2, with the last row giving the predictions of the model that we

develop in Section 4. The six models under discussion are listed in the first column. Each entry reports

the effect of an increase in distance or importer size on the probability of an export zero or f.o.b. export

price. An export zero is defined to occur when a country exports a good to one country but not all.

       Notes to Figure 1: Each circle in the plot represents a U.S. export market, and the size of the

circle is proportional to the number of HS10 products exported by the U.S. to that destination in 2005.

Distance is measured as kilometers between Chicago and the capital city of each country.

Notes to Table 4: Dependent variable is indicator for positive exports in particular HS code to particular importing country. Reported
probit and random effects probit results are marginal effects, evaluated at sample mean for continuous variables. Continuous variables
are scaled to have mean zero and standard deviation one, so coefficient gives effect on probability of a one standard deviation increase
in the continuous RHS variable. For indicator variables, coefficient is change in probability from turning on indicator. Robust standard
errors in italics, asterisks denote statistical significance: *** p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. First panel includes 888,000 observations
(100 countries  8,800 HS10 codes), second panel includes 583,400 observations (100 countries  5,834 HS10 codes). Except for
random effects probit, standard errors are clustered on both country and HS10.

Notes to Table 5: Dependent variable is log unit value of exports by HS10 product and export destination, relative to HS10 code

mean (that is, HS10 code fixed effects are included in all regressions). Includes only trade flows over $10,000. Independent variables

are characteristics of export destinations. Estimator is OLS with HS10 product fixed effects, and errors are clustered by HS10 and

country. Robust standard errors clustered by HS10 code and importing country in italics, asterisks denote statistical significance: ***

p<0.01, ** p<0.05, * p<0.1. See text for discussion of different subsamples.

Notes to Figure 2: Data are log U.S. export unit values by HS10 and export destination,

relative to HS10 means. The green/solid histogram shows the distribution of log unit values to

Canada and Mexico, and the red/unfilled histogram shows the distribution to countries between

4000 and 7800 kilometers from the U.S.
