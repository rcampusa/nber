        This paper describes the efficient allocation of consumption and work
effort in an economy in which workers face idiosyncratic employment risk and
considerations of moral hazard prevent full insurance. We impose a lower
bound on the expected discounted utility that can be assigned to any agent from
any date onward, and show, with this feature added, that the efficient
unemployment insurance scheme induces an invariant cross sectional
distribution of individual entitlements to utility. The paper thus provides a
simple prototype model suited to the study of the normative question: what is
the tradeoff between equality and efficiency in resource allocation?

    Introduction:
    This paper describes the efficient allocation of consumption
and work effort in an economy in which workers face idiosyncratic
employment risk. Each period, each worker either finds or fails to
find a job opportunity. A worker who finds a job opportunity and
takes it produces output at the cost of some disutility of effort.
A worker who does not have a job opportunity does not work,
suffers no disutility of effort, and produces nothing. The presence
of a job opportunity is not observable by others, so a worker who
has ajob opportunity and chooses not to work is indistinguishable
from a worker who has no such opportunity. It is this element
of moral hazard that precludes the perfect pooling of job risk: in
providing insurance against this employment risk, the gains from
reducing consumption uncertainty need to be weighed against
the costs of reduced work incentives.
     In. our formulation of this problem we impose a lower bound
on the expected discounted utility that can be assigned to any
agent from any date onward. With this feature added, we show
under fairly general assumptions on preferences that the efficient
unemployment insurance scheme induces an invariant cross sec-
tional distribution of individual entitlements to utility: the econ-
omy as a whole has an efficient steady state distribution, within
which the fortunes of any individual family rise or fall depend-

                                 2
ing on its idiosyncratic luck. The paper thus provides a simple
prototype model suited to the study of the normative question:
what is the tradeoff between equality and efficiency in resource
allocation?

     The context we use for examining this issue is a simplified
version of the frameworks used by Albrecht and Axell (1984) and
Hansen and Imrohoroglu (1992) to study unemployment insur-
ance. Our model lacks several realistic features that are incorpo-
rated into these earlier studies. Our model, in contrast to Hansen
and Imrohoroglu's model, is not capable of matching data on
the typical length of employment and unemployment spells, and,
in contrast to Aibrecht and Axell's model, it is not well suited
for the study of the impact of unemployment insurance on the
McCall-like determination of a reservation wage. We focus in-
stead on a feature of the efficient allocation of consumption and
work effort that these earlier papers do not consider: the depen-
dence of the efficient allocation of current consumption and work
effort on a worker's employment history. This dependence was
first explored in Townsend (1980) and Radner (1981). Usami
(1983) is an early application of these ideas to the problem of
unemployment insurance.

    Our formulation of this economy's efficiency problem is taken
from Atkeson and Lucas (1992). We take as the state of the
                               3
system a utility distribution — a distribution of households by
the expected discounted utility each is to receive from the cur-
rent period on. We define an allocation, and then define, for
any given utility distribution, the cost of that distribution as the
smallest (over all allocations) net, constant inflow of resources
needed to attain the utilities in the given distribution. Since we
deal with a closed system, the set of utility distributions that
can be attained with zero cost are on the frontier of the utility
possibility set for this economy, and the allocations which attain
these distributions are efficient. Following our previous paper,
we show that the efficient allocation can be decentralized in a
fashion that connects this efficiency problem to the one-on-one
principal-agent problem studied by Green (1987) and many oth-
ers. In this one-on-one principal-agent problem, the state variable
is simply the discounted expected utility the agent is to receive
from the current period on, and the principal's objective is to
minimize the resource cost to himself of providing that utility,
where this cost is measured according to some set of intertempo-.
ral prices or interest rates. The solution to the original efficiency
problem is then found through a process of varying the interest
rates the representative principal. faces until, period by period,
the net resource use implied by the solution to the one-on-one
principal-agent problem is set equal to zero. A similar procedure

                                 4
is followed in Taub (1990).

    Thomas and Worrall (1990) and Atkeson and Lucas (1992)
show that, if agents can give up all claims to discounted expected
utility for the sake of current consumption, then the solution to
the one-on-one principal-agent problem implies that the limiting
distribution of agents' wealth and consumption is degenerate,
with a vanishing fraction of the population consuming all output
in the economy. In light of this result, the efficiency standard
used by Albrecht and Axell and Hansen and Irnrohoroglu of ex-
amining the costs of various unemployment insurance schemes at
the steady state distribution of consumption makes little sense in
a setting in which each worker's unemployment benefits can de-
pend on his individual history of employment and unemployment
and each worker can trade away in the limit all of his claims to
future consumption for the sake of current consumption. In this
paper, we address this problem by imposing a limit on the ex-
tent to which workers can trade future for current consumption.
In particular, we impose the constraint that there is a minimum
entitlement to discounted expected utility from the beginning of
each period on that each agent must receive. We interpret this
con•straint as a limit on the extent to which living members of
an infinitely lived household in our economy can sell the con-
sumption claims of their heirs. It is important to remember that

                                5
this constraint is an additional constraint imposed upon our ef-
ficiency problem and is not derived directly from any efficiency
consideration. We find that the solution to the one-on-one prin-
cipal agent problem with this additional constraint does imply a
non-degenerate steady state distribution of consumption.

     For any given interest rate for the principals, the resource
cost of the steady-state cross-sectional distribution of utility enti-
tlements implied by the solution to the one-on-one principal agent
problem is determined by the balancing of two forces, with the
relative strength of these forces being determined by the size of
the interest rate. When agents have relatively high entitlements,
so that the minimum entitlement constraint is not binding, then
the first order conditions of the one-on-one principal agent prob-
lem imply that the marginal cost to the principal of providing the
agent with his entitlement to discounted expected utility follows
a sub-martingale. For example, in the case that agents have
time additive preferences with momentary utility of the form
u(c) =   cV2,   this implies that agent's current consumption fol-
lows a random walk with downward drift. In general, with time
additive utility with concave momentary utility, agents' current
consumption follows a qualitatively similar process. The down-
ward drift in the process governing agents' current consumption
and entitlements is thus a force that pushes all agents in the long

                                  6
run down upon the minimum entitlement constraint, with the
push being greater the lower the interest rate.
     The second and balancing force is provided by the mini-
mum entitlement constraint itself. When interest rates are very
low, this minimum entitlement becomes an absorbing state of
the Markov process governing the evolution of individual agents'
entitlements, so that, in the limit, all agents end up stuck on this
constraint. But if the job opportunity is sufficiently productive,
a steady state with all agents at the minimum entitlement entails
an excess supply of goods. As the interest rate is increased, the
minimum entitlement ceases to be an absorbing state, as agents
who have this entitlement and report a job opportunity in essence
save some of their earnings and thus raise their entitlement from
next period on. In this case, the steady state distribution of en-
titlements has only some fraction of the population at the miii-
imum entitlement, with that fraction being determined by the
interest rate. With these results, we can then pose our original
efficiency problem as one of finding the interest rate for the prin-
cipal in a one-on-one principal agent problem such that the net
resource cost of the corresponding steady state distribution of
entitlements of utility is zero.
     The remainder of paper is organized as follows. In section 2,
we present the model, define our efficiency problem, and estab-

                                   7
lish the connection between our original efficiency problem and a
one-on-one principal agent problem. In sections 3 and 4, we char-
acterize the solution to that one-on-one principal agent problem.
In section 5, we analyze the Markov process of entitlements gen-
erated by the solution to the one-on-one principal agent problem
and demonstrate that the steady-state level of resource use is a
continuous, increasing function of the interest rate, thus estab-
lishing the existence of a market clearing interest rate. In section
6, we conclude.
     2. The Model:
    Time is denoted by t = 0, 1, 2            Each period, each agent
finds a job opportunity with probability ir and fails to find such
an opportunity with probability 1 — ir. An agent who finds a
job can work h E [0, 1] units of time. We assume that job op-
portimities are independently and identically distributed both
across agents and across time. Agents who consume resources c
and work h hours within the current period obtain flow utility
(1 — j3)(U(c)   —
                    hv), where U :       —÷   D    R and v > 0, the
disutility of work, is a fixed parameter. Let C(u), C: D —+
be the inverse of the flow utility function U(c). We assume that
C is continuously differentiable, strictly increasing, and strictly
convex, with inf€D C(u) = 0.
     At each date t 0 agents are distinguished by their names

                                     8
        D and their history of reported job opportunities z
(z0, z1, . . . , Zr). We assume z E {O, 1} for all t and we use z2 = 0
to indicate a report of no job opportunity and zj = 1 to indi-
cate a report of a job opportunity in the current period t. We
use w0 interchangeably to denote an agent's name and his ini-
tial entitlement to discounted expected utility. At each date t, a
hypothetical social planner assigns each agent of each type some
current level of consumption C(x) (some current flow utility from
consumption Xj) and assigns each agent who reports a job oppor-
tunity some hours of work h. An allocation in this environment
is thus a sequence of functions

                   0=

where Xt maps agents' initial entitlements wo and histories of
reports zt into levels of current utility in D, while h maps these
same variables into the interval [0, 1].
     Given an allocation o, an agent chooses a strategy for re-
porting job opportunities to maximize the discounted expected
utility he obtains under that allocation. This strategy is de-
noted by z = {z(Ot)}, where O = (°o,Oi,...,O), O E {0,1}
for all t 0, denotes the agent's true job experience. We use
et+l = {0, 1} x {0, 1} x ... x {0, 1} to denote the space of possible
job histories up through time t, i' to denote the distribution of
                                  9
O E et+1 generated by ir, z1(9t) to denote the choice of report at
time t as a function of history O, and zt(9t) to denote the history
of reports up through time t induced by a reporting strategy z
and history 9. We assume that an agent cannot report a job
opportunity if he does not have one. That is, we assume that for
all t, zj(0t)    =   0 if °1 = 0.

       An agent's initial discounted expected utility can be written
as a function of w0, o, and z as

                                    U(wo,c,z) =


  (1   —
           3)   31 f      {x1(wo,zt(Ot)) — zj(9t)hj(wo,zt(0t))v}dpt1.

Let z = {z(0t)}0,               4(91) = 0 for all t 0 and O e
                              where

e2-'-', denote the truthful reporting strategy. We use the notation

U1(wo, o, z, 9t_1) to denote the discounted expected utility from
date t on received under the allocation o by an agent who was
originally entitled to w0 E D, has reported employment history
t—1 E et up to date t, and who uses the truthful reporting

strategy f.
       We impose four conditions on allocations. The first requires
that o delivers wo to those entitled to wo:

                               wo = U(wo,c,z),                    (2.1)

                                        10
for all w0 E D. The second is incentive compatibility:

                        U(wo,o,z*) U(wo,az)                   (2.2)

for all w0 E D and all reporting strategies z. The third is a
lower bound on the discounted expected utility that an agent
can receive after any employment history:

                         Ut(wo,o,z',O')                       (2.3)

for all t   1, wo E D,    O'   E 9. The fourth is an upper bound
on the discounted expected utility that an agent can expect in
the tail of the allocation:

                 lim/3 sup Uj(wo,ti,z,O')=O
                 t—00
                                                              (2.4)

     An allocation o is said to attain a distribution of entitle-
ments 'b0 with transfers i- if (2.1)-(2.4) are satisfied and if the
allocation o never requires a net infusion of resources greater
than 'r:


     fDx8*+I
               {C[x(wo,Ot)1 — Oth(wo,Ot)y}ddbo         r      (2.5)

for all t > 0. An allocation is said to be efficient if it attains a
distribution      with transfers r and there is no other allocation
that attains o with transfers less than r.

                                  11
     Following Atkeson and Lucas (1992), prices can be used to
decentralize the overall problem of finding efficient allocations
into component planning problems. To define what we mean by
a "component planning problem", consider a planner responsi-
ble for allocating resources only to those who are initially en-
titled to expected utility w0. He assigns an allocation (spe-
cific to w0) o(w0) = {Xt(WQ, 9i), h2(wo, Ot)}, Xt :       —+ D,

     ei+l —+ [0, 1] in such a way as to minimize the value of the

total resources he allocates, with resources at each date valued
at prices determined by the sequence {qj}0, qt         (0, 1). The
objective for this planner is to choose a(w0) to minimize


           (1 — qo) f {C[xo(wo, 9)] — Oho(wo, O)y}da+         (2.6)


          —
              q)   fi   q3   {C[x(w0, Qt)] — 9h(wo, 9t)y}d,t1

where 0(wO) is chosen subject to the constraints (2.1)-(2.4). It is
as if consumers are grouped by their initial w0 values, with each
group represented by its own social planner, and then these plan-
ners trade certain claims to current and future resources among
themselves at prices given by {qj}0.
    The next result, essentially Theorem 1 of Atkeson and Lu-
cas (1992), provides one connection between these component

                                 12
planning problems (2.6) and the problem of finding efficient al-
locations.
Theorem 1. Suppose there exist an allocation a' = {x(w0, ot),
hj(wo, Ot)}r0, prices        {qj}, a distribution of entitlements ,
and transfers r such that

     (i) at prices {q2}), for all w0 E D, a'(wO) minimizes (2.6)
subject to (2.1)-(2.4);
     (ii) for all t, (2.5) holds with equality;

     (iii) (1 —   qo)   +         —
                                      qt) fl10q,   < +00.
Then the allocation a- attains l'o with transfers r and is efficient.
Proof: That a' attains o with transfers r is immediate. We
prove that a- is efficient by contradiction. Suppose that there
exists some other allocation & = {t(wO, Ut), t(WO, Ut)} that
attains with transfers ? <r. Thus, by (ii),


             f          {C[it(wo, Ot)1 — Oii(wo, Ut)y}djt'dbo



         <fDxe {C[xj(wo,Ut)] —
for all t, with the difference between these two quantities being
at least r — . Then,

             (1 — qo) f     {C[o(wo, 0)] — 0h(wo, O)y]}d+

                                       13
             — t) H q, f {C[(wo, Ot)J — Otiz(wo, Ot)y}d

           <(1 _qo)f{C[xo(woO)] —Oho(wo,O)y]}dp+

       —
           qt) fi   q8 f {C[x(w0, 9t)] — Oh(wo, Ot)y}dt' <+oo
where the last inequality follows from (iii). This contradicts the
hypothesis (i) that o(wo) minimizes (2.6) for each wo.
     Theorem 1 is an analogue to the first theorem of welfare
economics, with conditions (i)-(iii) defining the counterpart to a
competitive equilibrium. Condition (i) requires quantities to be
optimal (cost minimizing) for each w, given prices; condition (ii)
is market clearing; and condition (iii) is a boundedness condition
on prices.
    We do not have a general method for obtaining price se-
quences {qj}0 that will clear these markets among planners.
In the sections that follow, we develop a procedure for finding
a price q and a distribution of entitlements 'çbq that prevails in
a steady state. That is, we develop a procedure to find a con-
stant sequence of prices all equal to q, an allocation 0q, and a
distribution of entitlements q, such that these objects satisfy
the conditions of Theorem 1 with r = 0.



                                 14
        3. A Recursive Formulation of the Problem:
       In this section we define and study a Bellman equation that
characterizes solutions to the component planning problem (2.6)
when the price sequence {qj}0 is constant at fixed q E {,3, 1).
In section 4, we use this Bellman equation to characterize the
dynamics of consumption and employment under the cost mini-
mizing unemployment insurance scheme at constant price q. In
section 5, we use this characterization of consumption and em-
ployment dynamics to find a distribution of entitlements Jq that
prevails in the steady state at constant price q. This result gives
us, for each q E [8, 1), a constant price sequence {q }, an
allocation 0q, a distribution of entitlements bq, and a level of
transfers r(q) that satisfy the hypotheses of Theorem 1.
        The function T on D defined by setting q(wo) equal to the
imfimum of (2.6) over allocations that satisfy (2.1)-(2.4) when
prices are constant at q is clearly unbounded. In defining our
Bellman equation, our approach will be to set an upper bound
IIY   on entitlements and to consider cost functions on the bounded
set D =     [, J. We formulate and study the Bellman equation on
C(D), where C(D) is the space of bounded, continuous functions
on b, and obtain the corresponding optimal policy functions.
Then we will show that if the bound I1 is chosen large enough,
it will not be binding for any initial entitlements w0 E D,     so

                                  15
that our optimal policy functions are also cost minimizing for
the original, unbounded problem (2.6) for any such w0.
     The Bellman Equation is specified as follows. Define the
operator 7 on C(D) by:

 (1V)(w) = inf(1 — q)[irC(u(1)) + (1 — ir)C(u(O)) — irly]+        (3.1)

                     q[7rV(g(1)) + (1 — ir)V(g(O))]

where u : {O, 1} —÷ D, 1 E [0, 1], and g : {O, 1} —    I)   satisfy the
constraints:

               w = (1 — 13)[iru(1) + (1 — ir)u(0) — rlv}+

                        [irg(1) + (1 — ir)g(0)],                  (3.2)

     (1 —,8)[u(1) — lv] +/3g(1)     (1— )u(0) +Bg(0).             (3.3)

    The constraint (3.2) requires that an agent entitled to dis-
counted expected utility w from the current period on receives
that utility. it is analogous to (2.1). The constraint (3.3) is
a single-period version of the incentive compatibility constraint
(2.2). It requires that agents who plan to report their future
job opportunities truthfully also find it optimal to report their
current job opportunity truthfully.
    Lemma 3.1 The operator Tq has a unique fixed point V, in
C(D), and, for all V C(D), lim,c, TV = T'. The function
                                  16
V' is increasing and convex. For all w E D, the infimum on the
right hand side of (3.1) is attained.

     Proof: The proof is standard. Applying Tq involves mini-
mizing a continuous function over a compact set and Theorems
4.6, 4.7, and 4.8 of Stokey, Lucas, and Prescott (1989) apply. 1

     We obtain further facts about the value function V and
about the minimizing policies Uq, 1q 9q by studying the sequence
of functions {TC}O, where C is the inverse of the momentary
utility function U, and then applying the fact that this sequence
converges to Vq. To this end, we establish some facts about TqV
when V is any convex function in C(D).

    Lemma 3.2 For any convex V C(D), the minimum on
the right hand side of (3.1) can be attained at a point at which
the incentive constraint (3.3) holds with equality.

     Proof: Suppose (3.1) is minimized at a point (u, l,g) such
that (3.3) is slack. Then, since C is strictly convex, u(1) = u(O),
and thus, by (3.3), 9g(1) — (1 — j3)lv > 13g(O). Since V is convex,
with 1 fixed it is possible to choose a> 0 to raise (0) = g(0) + a
and lower (1) = g(1) — a until (3.3) binds without raising the
right hand side of (3.1). I

    In view of this lemma, the two constraints (3.2) and (3.3)

                                17

      Lemma 3.3: For any strictly increasing and strictly convex
V E C(D) and any w E L, the minimum on the right hand side of
(3.6) is attained by a unique 1(w), g(w, 0) (and hence u(w, 0)) and
these functions are continuous. Furthermore, TqV is continuous,
strictly increasing, and strictly convex.
      Proof: For each w E D,       the right hand side of (3.6) is
continuous in the arguments 1, g(O). The arguments 1 and g(0)
are restricted to lie in closed intervals. Since C is strictly convex
and V is convex, these choices are unique. By the Theorem of
the Maximum, TqV is continuous. That TqV is strictly increasing
and strictly convex follows from the assumed properties of V and
C'

          In the next two lemmas, we show that if   is large enough,
    the upper bound on entitlements does not bind the optimal policy
    functions 9q. To this end we analyze the sequence of functions
      q
                      E C(D) for all ii, defined by V°(w) = C(w) and

                                            19
V1(w) (TqVq')(w), n 0. On each iteration n, we denote
the optimal choice of 1, g by l,, 9,,.
     Lemma 3.4: Assume that q E [3,1). Define w0 to be the
solution to C'(w°) = y/v and assume w0 > . Then the optimal
policy functions fin satisfy:
     (i) g,,(w, 1) and g,,(w, 0) are non-decreasing functions with
g,,(w, 1) g,,(w, 0) for all w, and
     (ii) for all n, g,,(w, 0)   w when w V)0.
     Proof: Given that C and         V1"   are convex, (3.8) gives the
result (i). Result (ii) is proved by induction. Begin with the case
with n = 0 and          = C. Ifgo(w,1) =for w w0 then the


,
induction hypothesis is immediate. When w w0 and g0(w, 1)>
    then (3.8) holds with equality. Since q /3, substituting
from the right hand side of (3.8) into the left hand side of (3.7)
implies that 1(w) = 0 if go(w, 1) w0. Thus (3.8) implies that
.go(w, 1)   w for w w0. Since go(w, 1) go(w, 0) for all w, this
proves the induction hypothesis for n = 0.
     Now assume that result (ii) holds for n—i. Again, if it is the
case that g,,(w, 1) = w for w w0 then the induction hypothesis
is immediate. When w w0 and g,,(w, 1) > w, then (3.8) holds
with equality. From (3.9), we have that

                            V(g,,(w, 1))   =                   (3.10)

By the induction hypothesis, g_i(g(W, 1), 0) .gn(W,          1) when

when 9(W, 1) w0. Thus, by (3.7) and (3.8), l(w) = 0 when
g(w,1) >   w°.   Finally, by (3.8) and (3.11), g(w,1) w when
9n(W, 1) w°. Thus, the induction hypothesis is proved for n.
    We sum up the implications of these results for the Bellman
equation (3.1) in the following result.
    Lemma 3.5      Assume     that C'(w) <    y/v    and C'(i) >   y/v.

Then for q E [8,1), V, — the unique fixed point of 1 — is strictly
increasing, strictly convex, and continuously differentiable, with
a derivative given by (3.9). The policy functions ,o = (us, 1q gq)
are continuous and satisfy properties (i) and (ii) of Lemma 3.4.
    Proof: That V, is strictly increasing and strictly convex fol-
lows from Lemmas 3.1 and 3.3, as do the existence and continuity
of the policy functions.
    By Theorem 3.8 of Stokey, Lucas, and Prescott, the se-
quence {u, i, g} defined above in Lemma 3.4 converges uni-
formly to = (uq, 1q gq). Hence 9q satisfies properties (i) and
                                   21
 (ii) of Lemma 3.4. It also follows that the sequence of derivatives
 {dV'/dw} defined in (3.9) converges uniformly to the expression
given on the right hand side of (3.9) evaluated at 2q. Since {V'}
converges uniformly to V, the expression (3.9) is the derivative
of V,. It is evidently continuous.O

      We now relate the solution to the Bellman equation (3.1)
to the solution to the component planning problem (2.6). First
note that a policy function p = (u(w, O),l(w),g(w, 0)) can be
used to generate an allocation o in the following manner. Let
x0(w0, 0) = u(w0, 0) and ho(wo, 0) =         01(wo)   for all w0 E D,
o E {O,1}. Define wi(wo,0) = g(wo,0)             for all w0 E D, U E
{O, 1}. Iterating on this procedure to complete the definition, set
xj(wo, ot)   = U(Wt(U)O, Ut_i), o) h(w0, ot) =   Ol(w(wo, ot_1)), and
Wt+i(WO, Ut)   = g(wt(wo, Oi_i), ot) for all t 1, 1110   D, 9 e-'-1.
      Lemma 3.6 Assume that C'(Ei) > y/v. For any q [8,1),
let    be the policy function that minimizes (3.1) subject to the
constraints (3.2) and (3.3) and 0q be the allocation generated
by Pq Then, for any wo D, wo <I1J, oq(wo) minimizes (2.6)
subject to constraints (2.1)-(2.4).

    Proof: By Stokey, Lucas, and Prescott, Theorems 4.3, 4.4,
and 4.5, for all w0      Vq(wo) equals the infimum of (2.6),
with prices constant at q, over the set of allocations o(w0) which

                                   22
satisfy
                          U(wo,a,z,Ut') E                                  (3.12)

                           Ut(wo,o',z,Ot') =                               (3.13)

for all t 0, O               Moreover, the allocation cr(wo) uniquely
attains the minimum on the set satisfying (3.12)-(3.14).
      By Lemma 3.4, cq(wo) satisfies (2.4). By the argument of
Atkeson and Lucas (1992), Lemmas 3.1 and 3.2, the set of values
of (2.6) (at price sequence {qj}) that can be attained with
allocations satisfying (2.1)-(2.4) is the same as the set of values
of (2.6) than can be attained with allocations satisfying (3.13),
(3.14), and (2.4). Thus, 0q(wo) uniquely attains the minimum of
(2.6) subject to (2.1)-(2.4) and the additional constraint

                           U1(wo,o.,z*, Ut_l)       1J                     (3.15)

                                         23
for alit     0,
     Finally, Lemma 3.5 and the hypothesis C'(iii) > y/v imply
that the inequality (3.15) is never binding on aq(wo) for w0 <.
Since   the constraint set (2.1)-(2.4) is convex, this implies that
oq(wo) minimizes (2.6) among the set of allocations satisfying
(2. 1)-(2.4) .0
     4. Characterization of the Policy Functions
     In this section we characterize the policy functions gq(w, 0)
and lq(w) and then analyze the Markov process in entitlements

generated by these policy functions.
     The behavior of .gq(w, 9) and lq(w) as functions of w on the
interval [, oo) is drawn in Figure 1 and can be described as
follows. Provided that

                            C'(+v) <y/v,                        (4.1)

there is an interval [, w9 on which lq(w) = 1, an interval (w, w)
on which lq(w)       (0, 1), and an interval [w, oo) on which lq(w) =
0. The value Wq' is determined as the solution to the equation

                            —
                    C'( q       ,Bg   (w',q 1)
                                1—j3

where gq(wq1 , 1)   solves the equation
                                —
                                      )    ,

                         8(1— )V(9)=Y/v.                       (4.3)

                                          24
Condition (4.1) guarantees that w > j. The value            is deter-
mined as the solution to the equation


                      C'( -gq(w,1)) = y/v,                      (4.4)


where gq(w, 1) solves the equation (4.3) (and is thus equal to
gq(wq', 1)). For entitlements w w, the resource cost of com-
pensating an agent for the disutility of work is less than that
agent's product on the job. Thus, no agent with such high en-
titlements works and gq(w, 1) gq(w, 0) for all w w. For all
w E (wi', w), gq(w, 1) is constant at the value that solves equa-
tion (4.3) and lq(w) decreases in w from 1 to 0 SO as to preserve
the equality (3.4).
    Figure 1 is drawn so that the curve gq(w, 0) lies everywhere
below the 45 degree line, while gq(w, 1) lies above the 45 degree
line on the interval [w, w] and crosses that line in the interval
(w, w). The first of these features is necessary given the as-
sumptions we have already made; the second feature is not. The
next two lemmas describe the possibilities.

     Lemma 4.1: Assume q> i3. If gq(w, 1) and gq(w, 0) are the
policy functions that minimize (3.6), then
     (i) there exists some 5> 0 and Ic > 0 such that gq(w, 0) =
for all w E [, w + 5) and gq (w, 0) w —   Ic   for all w E (w +5, w};

                               25
    (ii)      1) > w if and only if

           C'(w + v)>              + v) + (1 — ir)C'(w)]     (4.5)


holds at w = w.
    Proof: To verify (i), use (3.8), (3.9) and the result that
gq(w, 1) gq(w, 0) for all w to conclude that if .gq(w, 0) > w then

      V'(w) =                 1)) + (1 — ir)V'(gq(w, 0))].   (4.6)
                [irV'(gq(w,
If g,(w,0) w for w > ,          then   (4.6) implies that V'(w)
V'(w). Since q> 9, this is a contradiction. Thus gq(w, 0) <W
for all w > w. To prove (i), observe that, by the continuity of
V'(.), there must exist some Ic> 0 such that

                      V'(w) V'(w — k)

for all w E [, w]. Using the same argument above, for all
w E [, w], (4.6) cannot hold with gq(w, 0) > unless gq(w, 0)
w—k. Thusgq(w,0)>impliesgq(w,O) w—kandgq(w,0)=
  for w E {, + Ic). Since 9q(w, 0) is continuous and non-
decreasing in w, gq(w, 0) = w over an interval and result (i) is
proved.
   To prove (ii), note that gq(i,O) = . Thus, (3.8) and (3.9)
imply that if 9q(, 1) = w as well, then (4.5) fails to hold at
                                 26
w = w. Thus, if (4.5) does hold at w = , then gq(, 1) >              W.

Conversely,     if (4.5) fails to hold at w =   j, then it cannot be the
case that (3.8) and (3.9) are satisfied with some gq(w, 1) > w.V.
     Lemma 4.1 does not cover the case q = /3. We treat this case
separately in the next result.
     Lemma 4.2: Assume q = /3. If gq(w, 1) and gq(w, 0) are the
policy functions that minimize (3.6), then
     (i) there exists k >      0   such that .qq(w, 1) w + k for all
wE   [w,wq'];

     (ii) gq(w, 1) = w for all w E [wq1, w]; and
     (iii) gq(W, 1) = gq(w, 0) = w for all w w.
     Proof: Equations (3.8) and (3.9) imply

          V'(w) irV'(gq(w, 1)) + (1 — ir) V'(gq(w, 0)).            (4.7)

For w E [,    w], lq(w) = 1, and thus (3.8) and the strict concav-
ity of C and V imply that gq(w, 1) is uniformly bounded above
gq(w, 0) on this interval. Thus, if gq(W, 1) = w for some w E
{w, w],
      then gq(w, 0) <w and by the strict convexity of T', (4.7)
implies the contradiction w) < V'(w). Since condition (4.5)
is automatically satisfied when q = /3, gq(w, 1) > . Thus, by
the continuity of gq(w, 1), gq(w, 1) > w for all w E [w, w]. Since
gq(w,1) is uniformly bounded above gq(w,0), for all wE

                                     27
(4.7) implies that gq(w, 1) is uniformly bounded above w on this
interval. Thus, (i) is proved.
    Result (iii) is proved by the observation that V(w) C(w)
with gq(w, 1) = .qq(w, 0) = w for all w     solves the Bellman
equation (3.6) when q = 3.

     Equations (3.7) and (3.8) imply that gq(w, 1) is constant for
all w E [w, w]. Thus (ii) is implied by (iii).g
     5. Analysis of the Entitlement Process
     The previous section completes the characterization of the
value and the policy functions which solve the Bellman equation
(3.1) for any ftxed q     [/3, 1).   We now turn to the study of the
Markov processes defined by the job finding probability ir and the
policy functions gq(w, 0). For any q E [SB, 1), the state space of the
entitlement process is [, oo). If q > /3, the results in section 3
imply that the ergodic sets of this process must be subsets of the
set [, w}. If q = /3, then there is at least one ergodic set in the
interval [, w], but it also the case that every point w w is
also an ergodic set. To take all of these possibilities into account,
we first study the processes generated by (ir, .gq(w, 0)) on the set
S=   [w, wJ   and then deal with the additional possibilities that
arise when q =

     Let A be any probability measure on the Borel sets S of S,

                                     28
and define the Markov operator Pq by


       (PA)(A) =f(gq(w,1)EA) d+(1_)f(.qq(w,O)EA)
for any A S.
     Lemma 5.1: Assume q E [8, 1). The process (ir, gq(w, 0))
has a unique invariant distribution ibq in (S, S), the unique fixed

?,bq in the total variation norm.
     Proof: The proof is divided into two cases: q E (p8, 1) and
q = /3. In both cases, the proof is an application of Theorem
11.12 of Stokey, Lucas, and Prescott (1989).
     Part 1: Assume q e (/3, 1). Let X,, be the probability mea-
sure that concentrates mass on the point w. We show that there
exist N 1 and 6> 0 such that (Pq'w)(w) for all w S.
By result (i) of Lemma 4.1, there exists k > 0 such that either
gq(w, 0) w — k or gq(w, 0) = w for all w E [w, w]. Choose
N large enough so that       Nk < j. Then the probability

of passing from the point w to the point w in N steps (that is
              is at least (1 _ir)N. Since gq(w, 0) is non-decreasing
in w, this transition to     is at least as probable from any other
point in S, so letting 6 =   (1

process under study satisfies the hypotheses of Theorem 11.12 in
Stokey, Lucas, and Prescott (1989) is complete.

                                      29
     Part 2: The proof in the case with q = fi is slightly different.
In this case, we show that there exist N 1 and > 0 such that
(pN)(w) for all w E S. By result (1) of Lemma 4.2, there
exists k> 0 such that g(w,1) w+Jc for all w E [,w']. By
result (ii), g(w, 1) =     for all w E [w, w]. Choose N large
enough so that w + (N — 1)k > w. Then the probability of
passing from the point to the point w in N steps (that is
P(\)(w)) is at least irN. Since 9q(W, 1) is non-decreasing in
w, this transition to     is at least as probable from any other
point in S, so letting E = irs, the proof that the Markov process
under study satisfies the hypotheses of Theorem 11.12 in Stokey,
Lucas, and Prescott (1989) is complete.
     In view of Lemma 5.1, the function

                        r(q) =
                                 f   Vq(w)th,bq


is well-defined for q E [8, 1). The function r has the interpret a-
tion as the constant, net inflow of resources required to attain the
entitlement distribution liq in the steady state. In the rest of this
section we provide conditions under which r(q) = 0 is satisfied
for a price q E [8, 1). We first examine the values of this function
at q = /3 and q near one. Then we establish the continuity of r
(Lemmas 5.2-5.4). Finally, we establish that r(q) is decreasing
in q (Lemmas 5.5 and 5.6).

                                 30
     In the case that q = /3, the point w is an absorbing state,
and, as shown in the proof of Lemma 5.1, part 2, the probability
of transiting from any other point in the state space to       in N
steps is strictly positive. Thus the unique invariant distribution
in this case is concentrated at the point w. At this point, no
one works, so the cost of attaining this distribution in the steady
state is r(,3) = C(w). This cost is clearly greater than zero.
     In the case that q> /3 and

           C(w + v)                + v) + (1 — ir)C'(w)]


for q close to one, then gq(, 1) = w, and w is an absorbing state.
As shown in the proof of Lemma 5.1, part 1, the probability of
transiting from any other point in the state space to in N steps
is strictly positive. Thus, the unique invariant distribution in this
case is concentrated at the point w. At this point, everyone who
has a job opportunity works l() =       1,   so the cost of attaining
this distribution in the steady state is

           limr(q) = irC( + v) + (1 — ir)C() — lry.
           q—1


i is too large relative to y and ir, then this cost is also positive
and there is no market clearing price q. We assume that this
quantity is negative.

     Lemma 5.2 Let q E [fi, 1) and {q}0, q E [8, 1) be a
sequence of prices converging to q. Then                   converges uni-
formly to V, on [, w].
    Proof: We show that              —

where the last inequality follows from the fact that Tqi is a con-
traction mapping with modulus q'. Thus, as n — 00,            7'V—V
converges to a quantity less than or equal to j—!?jIT(?sV —
Since   V=   7, the result that JTsV —                   —p 0    as q' —   q
follows from the observation that the operator Tq is continuous
in q by the Theorem of the Maximum.O
     Lemma 5.3 Let {(q,w)}0, qn E              [8,1),    wE               be
a sequence converging to the point (q, w). Then the sequence
{(gq,(wn, 1),gq,(wn,O))}o     converges to (gq(w,1),gq(w,0)).

     Proof: Since the policy functions gq(w, 0) are         continuous in

w, for all f > 0, there exists an N 1 such that .gq(wn, 0) —
gq(w, )I <f, 0 = 0, 1, for all n N. By Lemma 5.2 and Stokey,

      Lemma 5.4 r(q) is continuous on [3, 1).
      Proof: By Lemma 5.1 and Stokey, Lucas, and Prescott
(1989), Theorem 12.13, if {q}0 converges to q, then
convergesto weakly to 'çbq. By Lemma 5.2, {V} converges
uniformly to V, on [, w]. Thus the lemma is proved.g
      Lemma 5.5 II q'> q, then '               (where          here de-
notes first order stochastic dominance).
      Proof: We first use the first order conditions to show that
the optimal policies gq(w, 0) are decreasing in q. Then we use
this fact to prove the lemma.
    Let q' > q. For ii 1, let     =        and          be the
associated optimal policies. We first use an induction to show
that for all (w,0) and ii    1,

                  c'( —8g(w,0) +0l(w)v)                               (5.1)

                            /99q(W,0)
                   c#(W                 +Olq(W)V).
For n = 1, q'> q implies

                  q'(1—/3)dV>q(1—3)dV                                 (52)
                  ,3(1—q')dw           3(1—q)dw
                                  33
Hence (3.8) implies that g1(w, 0) gq(w, 0) for all w and (5.1) is
proved for U = 0 and n = 1. From (4.2) — (4.4) and the fact that
the functions g(w, 0) and gq(w, 0) are non-decreasing in w, the
points w and w decrease as q is increased, so that li(w) l(w)
for all w. If li(w) = lq(w) = 1 or l1(w) = lq(w) 0, then (3.8)
and (5.2) imply gj(w, 1) gq(w, 1) and (5.1). If l1(w) < l,(w) =
1,   then (5.1) follows directly from (3.7). If li(w), lq(w) E (0, 1),
then (3.7) implies that (5.1) holds as an equality. Finally, if
11(w) = 0 and lq(w) > 0, then (5.1) follows again from (3.7).
Hence, (5.1) holds for all w D when n = 1.
      Now assume (5.1) holds for ii = N. Then from (3.9) and the
induction hypothesis

                       (1_3)dV'(w)            —
                       (1—q')           dw

             —                                          — J3N(W,
                        1)

                              j3(1—q) dw
for all w D. Then, (3.8) implies that g1v÷i(w, 0) .gq(w, 0).
When 9 = 1, the reasoning used in the case n = 1 implies
1N+1(W) lq(V), gN+1(w, 1) gq(w, 1), and that (5.1) holds
                                   34
for n = N + 1. Thus, if q' >      q,   then gqi(w, 0) .qq(w, 0) for all
w E O and 0 = 0,1.
      Now let     = (Pbq) where bq is the invariant distribution
of entitlements corresponding to price q. From the result above,
   = (Pqi,bq) (Pqbq)      = J)q. Since Pqi is monotone and         q,
for n 1, A' )                   By Lemma 5.1, {} —               in the

      Lemma 5.6r(q) is decreasing in q.
      Proof: By definition,

                       r(q) =
                                f   V(w)dhq                        (5.3)


  f {(1 — q)[C(uq(w, 0)) — Olq(w)y] + qVq(gq(w,

Since 'l,bq is the invariant distribution,


                                       S.qqPq                      (5.4)


and

Thus,


      f V(w)di,bq =   f     {C(u(w, 0)) — Glq(w)y}d/1dbq.          (5.6)

                                    35
Now consider changing the price q to q' and calculating the inte-
gral f(TqsVq)(w)dq. Let uo, lo,go be the optimal controls asso-
ciated with the determination of Tq' V, so that

                          f(Tq'Vq)(w)dIJq =

Thus,

Since   lim,, IVq = Vqi we have proved that

By Lemma 5.5, ,bq first order stochastically dominates i'i when

    6. Conclusion:
    In this paper, we have presented a model of the long run
consequences of efficient unemployment insurance for the distri-
bution of welfare and consumption in a simple environment in
which workers face idiosyncratic, serially uncorrelated employ-
ment risk. Under the assumptions of the preceding sections, there
exists an invariant distribution of utility entitlements and an as-
sociated invariant distribution of consumption and employment.
The invariant distribution has a mass point at the lower bound
on utility entitlements ()   and also distributes probability over
higher entitlement levels. The existence of a mass point follows
from Thomas and Worrall's (1990) proof that entitlements to
utility must converge to their lower bound with probability one.
In our case, the lower bound on entitlements serves as a reflecting
barrier rather than an absorbing one as in Thomas and Worrall.
It is clear, then, that if the lower bound on entitlements were
removed, no steady state would exist.
    The dynamics of an individual's entitlement within the in-
variant distribution are described by the solution to a one-on-
one principal agent contracting problem between the individual
worker and an unemployment insurance intermediary. In that
contracting problem, the intermediary minimizes the resource
cost, evaluated at a ñxed intertemporal price given by q, of
                                38
providing incentive compatible unemployment insurance to the
worker. The first order conditions of that problem indicate that,
when the minimum utility constraint is not binding, the worker's
entitlements to discounted expected utility are set so that the
ratio of the expected marginal cost to the intermediary of the
worker's entitlement next period and the marginal cost to the
intermediary of the worker's entitlement in the current period
is set equal the intertemporal price set by q. When the min-
imum entitlement constraint is binding, this ratio of marginal
costs exceeds the intertemporal price given by q. These first or-
der conditions, and the dynamics of individual consumption im-
plied by these first order conditions, are qualitatively very similar
to those obtained from a model like Hansen and Imrohoroglu's
in which consumption smoothing is achieved through pure credit
markets with uncontingent borrowing and lending. In particular,
as in Hansen and Imrohoroglu, when the minimum entitlement
constraint is not binding, idiosyncratic movements in individual
consumption in response to realizations of employment risk are
highly persistent and in equilibrium follow a downward drift until
the minimum entitlement constraint binds. When the minimum
entitlement constraint is binding, then workers who fail to find a
job opportunity experience a transitory fall in consumption while
agents who find a job opportunity experience a persistent rise

                                 39
in their consumption. The quantitative differences between the
equilibrium in this model and that in Hansen and Imrohoroglu
would manifest themselves in the divergence between the lifetime
utility and discounted present value of consumption of agents who
are lucky in finding employment and agents who are unlucky.

    In this model we have assumed that workers experience seri-
ally uncorrelated employment risk. It is clear that if one were to
use this model to establish a benchmark against which to judge
the efficiency of existing unemployment insurance schemes, it
would be necessary to adapt the techniques used here to the
analysis of the efficient invariant distribution of a model like
Hansen and Imrohoroglu's in which this employment risk is se-
rially correlated so as to match the risk in the model to data
on the distribution of the length of employment and unemploy-
ment spells. We leave this to future work. At this point, we
conclude with remarks on two questions that we have left aside
in the body of the paper. The first of these questions concerns
the role of our assumption that agents in the model cannot enter
into contracts that would leave them at any point in time with
discounted expected utility in some states of nature below some
minimal entitlement to discounted expected utility. The second
question concerns the possibilities for decentralizing the efficient
allocation found in this model.

                                  40
     Regarding the role of the minimum entitlement constraint,
we motivate our assumption prohibiting agents from entering
agreements that require that they forgo all claims to future con-
sumption in certain states of nature with the idea that ancestors
in a dynasty have limited rights to sell the consumption of their
heirs. Phelan (1993) motivates the same assumption in a simi-
lar model with the idea that workers cannot legally commit to
remain in a contract that delivers them a discounted expected
utility below the level that they could obtain by entering a new
unemployment insurance contract with another insurance inter-
mediary. In either case, by introducing this form of contract
incompleteness into the model, we get the result that there is
a non-degenerate steady state distribution of entitlements. This
result introduces the following trade-off between equilibrium ef-
ficiency and equality into the model: stricter limits on agents'
rights to trade away claims to future consumption reduce steady
state inequality at the expense of limiting possibilities for insur-
ing idiosyncratic employment risk and thus reducing welfare ex-
ante. Relaxing these limits on contracting enhances efficiency at
the cost of widening the spread in the long run distribution of en-
titlements and consumption. This tension between equality and
efficiency arises in the model because onsiderations of efficiency
dictate that movements in individual consumption be persistent

                                41
in response to uninsured idiosyncratic shocks while equality re-
quires that the movement of individual consumption in response
to idiosyncratic shocks be bounded or show some mean reversion.
     Regarding the possibilities for decentralizing the efficient al-
location found here, the technique we use for finding the efficient
allocation itself suggests one decentralization in which financial
intermediaries compete in offering unemployment insurance con-
tracts to clients who are then bound to work and consume as in-
structed by the intermediary for the rest of time, subject to the
minimum entitlement constraint imposed on contracts. These
intermediaries can be thought of as trading resources with each
other through time at the price q in their competition to de-
velop the low-cost dynamic unemployment insurance contract.
One might think of the market as one in which workers join risk
pools to sign long term contracts with insurance companies who
then control the worker's consumption and work effort over time.
The difficulty with this market interpretation, as is well known,
is that, to implement the contract solved for here, the insurance
intermediary must have the ability to prevent the worker from
participating in any other asset market activity.
