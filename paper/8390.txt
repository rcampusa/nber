Introduction

        This research is based on a widely held belief that resource-abundant economies grow less
                                                   than other economies. As seen in

       Figure 1, this conviction is supported by a simple observation of the growth rate in these
countries. This effect was formally estimated in a recent paper by Sachs and Warner [8].

        Their results, shown in Table 11, indicate that there is a negative relationship between
resource abundance --measured as the share of primary exports to the gross national product
(GNP)-- and growth, which is measured as the growth rate for the gross domestic product (GDP)
per economically active population. An increase in a country's primary exports equivalent to 1% of
the GNP reduces its growth rate between 0.07% and 0.10%. In Table 2 we present some examples
of this finding, to illustrate the important impact these results have: Tunisia will grow 0.48% to
1.03% less than a country with similar income, investment rate, external sector rules and rule of
law, but which has no primary exports. This number can be as high as 3.8% to 5.4% for countries
like Zambia.

        However, there has been recent literature suggesting evidence to the contrary. For example,
Davis [3] finds that natural-resource abundant countries have higher social indicators than other
countries, controlling by income. In addition, these countries have higher growth rates for those
indicators.

        In this paper we further explore the ‚Äúresource curse‚Äù using alternative approaches. We show
that the results from Sachs and Warner are not robust for small changes in the econometric
procedure. Nevertheless, the effect continues to exist in the cross-sectional, therefore, in the last
section of the paper we concentrate on explaining why it remains.

        In particular, we argue that in the 70¬¥s commodity prices were high, which led developing
countries to use them as collateral for debt2. The 80‚Äôs saw an important fall of those prices, leaving
developing countries with an important amount of debt and a low flow of foreign resources to pay
them. Thus, in the sample, the cruse (low growth) looks close to a debt-overhang problem.

        The paper is organized as follows. In Section 1, we explain the problems associated we
growth regressions. Then in Section 2, we reestimate the findings of the literature, using alternative
approaches. Section 3 reviews different alternative explanations for the findings. Finally, Section 4
presents our conclusions.

  We are not saying that there was an explicit use of them as collateral, but most creditors gave loans under the
assumption that these countries will have funds to pay back based on their resource wealth.
1. The Problems of Estimating the ‚ÄúResource Curse‚Äù

         The empirical literature on growth starts from an estimation of the form:

                                      ln yi ,t ‚àí ln yi ,t ‚àíœÑ = Œ± ln yi ,t ‚àíœÑ + Œ≤X i ,t + Œ∑i + Œµ i ,t             Eq 1


where yi,t represents output for country i at period t, X represents a series of variables that explain
growth, Œ∑i is a country specific effect, and Œµi,t represents the error term.

         In Sachs and Warner [8], this estimation is done using the total GDP growth as an
independent variable for a cross-section of countries. These two issues --the use of total GDP and
the use of a cross-section data-- may have an impact on the coefficients estimated.

         On one hand, cross-section estimators rely on the assumption that individual effects are
uncorrelated with other right-hand-side variables3. If there are some unobservable characteristics
that are correlated with the right-hand-side variables, the coefficients would be biased. As
explained in Caselli et al. [2], this assumption can be violated within the dynamic framework of a
growth regression. With a panel this problem can be solved.

         On the other hand, total GDP includes the resource sector of the economy. This sector
affects total growth, especially when the share of primary exports is high. Therefore it is important
to know the behavior of the resource sector.

         Table 3 shows the change over time of the per-capita production of 7 commodities. We use
per-capita production because this is what the left-hand side of equation (1) tries to capture. The
table indicates that the production of natural resources per capita has generally fallen. Only one
commodity (gold) has a growth rate in production greater than the average growth rate for the total
GDP (1.1%) in our sample of countries.




3
  In a cross-section regression, there is only one t. Therefore, it is needed for Œ∑i to be uncorrelated with Xi. Then, the
total error term -Œæi =Œ∑i+Œµi- would be uncorrelated with Xi.

       The table also depicts another fact. We divide countries in two groups: the 5 or 6 countries
where the ratio of commodity production to GDP is the highest, and the rest of the world. It is clear
that, with the exception of lead and silver, the growth rate in production of the countries with the
highest dependency has been lower than the rest of the world. These results lead one to ask the
question whether previous estimations of the effect of natural resources are just estimations of the
fall in per capita production of the resource sector.


2. A Re-estimation

       For the reasons given in the previous section, in this section we reestimate Sachs and
Warner [8]. First, we will use panel estimation and then, we will use different measures of the non-
resource side of the economy.
       2.1.     A Panel Estimation

           In order to estimate a panel, we need to obtain a different data set than Sachs and Warner
[8].4,5 Table 4 compares the result from Sachs and Warner [8]6 with the result of doing the same
cross-section analysis using our data set. It is clear the results are statistically the same.

           We estimate a panel using alternative data sets, one with at least 2 time elements and the
other with 4 time elements. The results are shown in Table 5. The first set of regressions, from (1.1)
to (1.3), indicates that the effect is statistically significant in the cross-section of this sub-sample
but insignificant in a panel with fixed effects. The same is done in columns (2.1) to (2.3) using the
sample with 4 time elements. This allows for the presence of more observations to calculate the
fixed effect, but there are less countries with information available to do this regression. Again, the
effect is statistically significant in the cross-section ‚Äìthough only at the 2.5% level-- and then
insignificant in a panel with fixed effects.

    In Appendix A, we explain in detail some sample selection issues that drive this fact.

  The reader will note that we chose regression number (1.3) of Table 1. The reason is that the Rule of Law is a ‚Äúone-
time‚Äù variable and therefore will not be useful for panel estimation, and that the Change in Terms of Trade was not
significant in column (1.4).

          It is important to mention that the effects of the other variables do remain significant even
after the panel is done, with the expected signs and even with the expected relative size.7 The fact
that the impact of resource abundance disappears once fixed effects are introduced implies that this
variable is correlated with unobservable characteristics and therefore it disappears once fixed
effects are introduced.

          A natural concern is to ask whether we are just estimating the fixed effects of a country's
resource richness, a fact that is time invariant. In Figure 2, we show the shocks to the share
(measured through the standard deviation) compared to the share in 1970. We see that the biggest
shocks are not concentrated on the biggest producers. On the other hand, the cross-section measures
the ranking of the countries from low exporters to high exporters. In this sample it changes from
period to period.8

          Summarizing, in the panel we see that there are no effects from primary exports change
through time, which cast some doubts on the validity of the conclusions derived from the cross-
sectional regressions.


      2.2.     Growth in the Non-Resource Sector

In this subsection we deal with the other issue related to the estimation of the effect of resource
abundance, namely the inclusion of the resource sector on the total GDP. For that purpose, we will
use alternative measures for the non-resource side of the economy. In general, the effect still
remains present for the cross-section but disappears with the fixed effects.

          Throughout this section we will determine whether the effect found by Sachs and Warner
[8] on total GDP is still present in the sub-sample for which data is available for the non-resource
sector. Then, we estimate the effect on the non-resource measure of the economy. Finally, we
reestimate the effect on a panel. In this section we only present the results for the panels of 10-year


7
  For example the coefficient on the lagged GDP is expected to be greater the shorter the period of time where growth
is measured. For an explanation see Barro and Sala-i-Martin [1].

    See in Appendix B.
periods. The reason for this is that when a panel of 5-year periods is used the negative effect of
natural resources is lost even in the cross-sections.

           For the non-resource sector of the economy we construct a measure represented by the GDP
net of resource exports. Arguably, this tends to eliminate the resource sector in those countries
where the sector is large relative to the rest of the economy.9

           In Table 6, we show the cross-section results. It is clear that the effect measured by Sachs
and Warner is still present in this sub-sample. The coefficients in column (1) are actually not
significantly different from those in Table 4. Then we proceed to repeat the estimation with the
non-resource side of the economy. The results in column (2) seem to suggest that there is a negative
effect on growth in the non-resource side of the economy coming from resource abundance, similar
to the results presented in the previous subsection.

           In the previous estimations we construct the ‚Äúnon-resource GDP‚Äù with the nominal share of
primary exports to GNP. If relative prices change considerably, this can affect the estimation.
Ideally, this should be corrected by using the respective deflators. However, there are no deflators
just for primary exports. For that reason, we repeat the construction of this ‚Äúnon-resource GDP‚Äù
taking into account changes in relative prices using the deflator for total exports compared to the
GDP deflator. It can be expected that the deflator for total exports captures the change in prices for
primary exports in countries where primary products are the main export. For purposes of
abbreviation, we will call this variable the ‚Äúreal‚Äù non-resource growth.11

           The cross-section estimations are shown in Table 8. Column (1) shows that the effect is still
present in this sub-sample. Then, in column (2), we see that the negative effect persists on the

       The next step is to do the panel estimations. There are two different ways to do this
regression: one is to continue to use the nominal share of primary exports to GDP as an explanatory
variable, and the other is to use the real share. Both are used in Table 9. These alternative measures
have different interpretations: the former measures the ‚Äúwindfall‚Äù effect, while the latter measures
the presence and activity of a resource sector. In other words, a shock in the first one will measure a
price windfall, while a shock in the second one will measure the discovery of new reserves.

           As in the previous regressions, we start with the cross-sections to check whether the effect is
present in the sample or not. In order to compute the real shares, a base year has to be chosen. We
chose 1970; for that reason we only need to do one cross-section. In Table 9 we see that the effect
is present in the respective cross-sections --although weak12 However, it disappears in both panels.
Moreover, the result from column (3.2) suggests a positive sign.13

           As in subsection 2.1, there is the concern that once we control for changes in relative prices,
the only fixed effect is whether a country is resource rich or not, and that variable does not change
over time. For that reason, in Table 10 we show the shocks to the ‚Äúreal‚Äù primary exports. We see
that it is similar to Figure 2, in that the biggest shocks are not concentrated on the biggest
producers. On the other hand, there is also a shift in the ranking of the countries.14 This reflects the

       In this subsection we reestimate the resource curse, using different approaches to measure
the non-resource side of the economy. We have found that there is a negative effect present in the
cross-section but not in the panels. As in subsection 2.1, the fact that the effect of resource
abundance disappears once fixed effects are introduced implies that this variable is correlated with
unobservable characteristics and therefore it disappears once fixed effects are introduced.
       2.3.     Dividing Resources by Origin

           An important question to ask is whether the effect is the same for all kinds of primary
exports. Primary exports add agricultural, food, mineral and fuel exports together. Clearly, these are
very different products with different profitability, different behavior over time, etc. We divide
exports into account so in Table 10.

           In column (2) we divide primary exports between agricultural15 and non-agricultural
exports. In column (3) we divide the non-agricultural exports into minerals and fuels. The table
shows that once exports are divided into categories, they have different effects. This reinforces the
idea that using non-resources GDP is the right approach to see the effects of resource abundance.

3. New Dimensions of the ‚ÄúCurse‚Äù

The previous section makes clear that important econometric inconveniences are present in the
original formulation of the "curse". There are two striking facts that can be derived from the
previous exercises: First, in all specifications, when fixed effects are included, invariable the
natural resource curse disappears. Second, however, also in almost all specifications the curse
exists in the cross-sectional.

       In this section, we tackle this second fact: why we have the effect in the cross-section. An
explanation could be that most of the source of variation is found in the cross-sectional and not on
the time series variation. A second one, already mentioned above, the coefficient in the cross-
section may be reflecting the fact that there is a correlation between omitted variables and resource
abundance. In this section we will attempt to find those omitted variables.

        The first step is to see which are the countries driving the results. We are going to use the
specification in column (3) of Table 10 given that the result is clearly driven by non-agricultural
exports. For that reason, in Figure 4, we plot the residuals of doing that regression with all variables
but the non-agricultural exports against those non-agricultural exports. We see clearly two groups
of countries: one that almost draw a ‚Äúcone‚Äù on the upper left hand side and other on the lower right
hand side of the graph, that seems to be the group of countries driving the results.


First candidates.

In this sub-section, we show that the results are not driven by de degree of development, nor by the
quality of the institutions,

        A first intuitive explanation is to argue that the cross-section is estimating a difference
between developed economies and non-developed economies. In Table 12 we repeat the regression
done in column (3) of Table 10, and then divide the sample between OECD countries and non-
OECD countries. At the bottom of the table are some summary statistics for the share of primary
exports in each sub-sample.

           Non-OECD countries have a higher share of primary exports. On the other hand, this
variable does not seem to have an effect on growth in OECD countries. However, there is less
variance in the share of primary exports in OECD economies. Also we see that the variable is still
significant in non-OECD countries. Consequently, this variable is not just estimating a difference
between OECD and non-OECD economies.

           An alternative is to check for variables that measure the institutional setting of a country.
We are going to focus on the variable that tries to measure the quality of bureaucracy.16                        17
                                                                                                                      This
variable is measured between 0 and 6. A high value means low bureaucracy quality. Since it is

     See Appendix F for a complete description of this variable.
17
   In Appendix D we repeat the regressions from this section with alternative institutional variables. These variables are
intended to describe corruption, rule of law, risk of expropriation and risk of government repudiation. There is a
problem with these variables however: The methodology to construct them is the same for all. For that reason we do
not introduce all of them in the same regression.
These other variables usually have the expected sign but their significance level is lower.
usually measured at a point in time, this variable can be used in panels only before the introduction
of fixed effects.

          In Table 13, we present the results from the cross-section and a panel before the fixed
effects. We also included in the table a variable that measures ethno-linguistic fractionalization.
This comes from La Porta et al. [5].18 The idea is to introduce a variable that represents an
‚Äúexogenous‚Äù institutional setting, since it is argue that rents coming from the resource sector might
have an impact on the institutional setting.

         In the table, we see that the effect of the primary exports disappears once institutional
variables are introduced in the panel, while it remains significant in the cross-section. The
difference between those regressions is that in the panel we allow for the fluctuations of the
primary exports over time, while in the cross-section primary exports are only going to divide the
sample into resource-rich and resource-poor countries. Therefore, the cross-section indicates that
there exists a difference between countries driven by their resource abundance.


Credit Contraints and Debt Overhang

The previous exercises indicate that neither the classification of countries into developed and
developing countries, nor the introduction of institutions change the basic result that the negative
effect is present on the cross-section. In this sub-section, we present evidence that the results on the
"curse" are mainly due to credit constraint considerations.

       Giving a further look to Figure 4 indicates that the countries that are driving the result has
gone either trough an International Monetary Fund and/or a World Bank Program (including Debt
Relieves). This is confirmed by Figure 5.

                                  Figure 5: Debt Growth and Resource Abundance




       The previous regressions were done using the period 1970-1990. As seen in Figure 6, during
the 70¬¥s, commodity prices were high and might have induced resource abundant countries to use
them as collateral. Then, the 80‚Äôs saw a fall in commodity prices leading to a debt crisis, which
most of these countries faced.

       Figure 6 shows the evolution of commodity prices of Coal, Copper, Iron and Oil. The prices
are the nominal prices, where (for comparison reasons) they have been normalized to be equal to
100 in 1970. As can be seen, during the mid-70's the increases in commodity prices were quite
dramatic. However, all experienced drops as large as 30 percent during the 80's.

       In Table 14, we present the change in the prices every five years. Note between 1970-1975
coal, natural gas, and iron experienced price increases that doubled their prices. Moreover, in 1975-
1980 oil and natural gas experienced their own ‚Äúboom‚Äù. Coal is perhaps the most stable price in
this sample, but still its priced increase by 60 percent in the last five years of the decade of the 70's.

       During the first 5 years of the 80's, coal, natural gas, iron and oil experienced an important
slowdown in their price increases to finish the decade with falls. Copper is the only exception who
suffered the fall in prices at the beginning and then a recovery.

            If investment and debt decisions in the late 70's were based on the recent estimated price
increases, then it should become clear that during the first slow down in the early 80's the countries
had problems rolling over their debts. This motivates the regressions found in Table 15.

            In the table, we divide the sample in two periods: 1970-1980 and 1980-1990. From the
table, it is clear that the share of non-agricultural exports at the beginning of the period did not have
an effect on growth from 1970 to 1980. Nevertheless, they have a negative from 1980 to 1990.
However, in column (3) we changed it to the share of non-agricultural exports in 1970. We see that
the coefficient is higher19 and the significance of the regression is higher.

            We go a step further and construct a variable called credit constraint, which is the
Debt/GNP ratio in 1981 for less developed countries (LDC‚Äôs) and zero (0) for developed countries.
We then repeat the regression done in column (3) including this variable. The result shows that
non-agricultural exports no longer have a negative effect and rather this credit constraint ratio have
a negative effect on growth. This implies that the resource abundance variable was picking the fact
that these countries were highly indebted at the beginning of the decade20.

4. Conclusions

         This paper considers several reasons behind the perceived poor performance of resource-
intensive economies. It reestimates the effect of natural resource abundance on growth using panel
data and improved measures of the non-resource side of the economy. We found that the effect is
always present in the cross-section data and not in the panel data. We argue that the empirical
finding in the cross sectional is due to omitted variable biases.

         We thoroughly examine the possible candidates to explain the cross sectional results. We
found that degree of development and the quality of institutions were important determinants of the
growth, however, they were not the cause of the "curse"
       On the other hand, we show that it is due to the fact that these countries decided to take
advantage of high commodity prices on the 70‚Äôs to use them as implicit collateral and found
themselves on a debt overhang when commodity prices fell in the 80‚Äôs.

       Therefore, rather than a problem associated with the presence of natural resources, these
result seems to point out to credit market imperfections as reason for bad performance. If we think
of the commodity production of a country as part of their collateral, an increase in prices relaxes the
degree of credit constraint allowing those governments to increase their foreign debts. During the
slow down in prices and the subsequent fall, the countries were unable to continue to borrow and
had to repay part of their debts. In the end, devaluations and other contractionary measures had to
be taken to balance the current accounts, with their usual toll on growth.

       Our reading of the evidence is that the curse of natural resources is not due to the particular
aspect of excessively depending on natural resources what slows down the growth rates. It is the
interaction between credit markets and a collateralizable good that is experiencing a bubble, what
causes the problems in the end. In this respect, a boom-bust cycle in a commodity price is no
different from a bubble in stock markets, as was the case of Japan, or a bubble in real estate prices,
as was in New England and Thailand.

       Our interpretation is that the curse of natural resources, in this data, is another example of
the curse on asset prices bubbles. Future research should continue to explore the interaction of
credit market imperfections and the determinants of the growth. Finally, extending the present
analysis beyond the early 90's might help to unveil the relative importance of debt overhang issues
from other curses.


Appendix

A.     Sample Selection

In their paper, Sachs and Warner change the base year for which the share of primary exports is
computed for 16 countries. The reasons behind those changes range from including more countries
in the sample, to including primary exports missing in National Accounts, to excluding ‚Äúrefinery
countries‚Äù (countries that export fuels because they import fuels to refine). As we argue in section
2, the problem that arises from those changes is that, the correct regression would be a panel.
Therefore, we will always need ‚Äúbeginning of period measures‚Äù of the share of primary exports.

In Table 16 we show the steps we take to solve this problem.

First, in column (1.1) we have the results reported by Sachs and Warner. Then, column (2.1) uses
my entire sample, but the share of primary exports, which is taken directly from Sachs and Warner
[8]. As can be seen the coefficients are not significantly different from (1.1). The same regression is
then repeated in column (2.2), but only for those countries for which we would be able to compute
the share of primary exports. Again, the coefficients are not significantly different to those in (1.1).
The next step is to do the same regression but now using my computed share of primary exports.
We see that the coefficient in the share of primary exports changes substantially. This may be due
to the presence of those countries for which Sachs and Warner changed the share of primary
exports. Therefore, in columns (3.1) and (3.2) we repeated regressions (2.2) and (2.3), respectively,
without the countries that Sachs and Warner modified. It is clear that the coefficients in (2.1) and
(3.2) are not significantly different nor are they significantly different from the original Sachs and
Warner results in (1.1). For that reason we are going to use this group of countries.
B.     Change in Primary Exports

       Figures I and II compare the share of primary exports and ‚Äúreal‚Äù primary exports to GNP in
1970 and 1980. They illustrate that there are important changes in the shares. They also illustrate,
that those changes are not only among the biggest primary exporters.

C.    Alternative measure of Non-Resource GDP.

       The World Bank provides data on some sectors of countries' economies, in particular
manufacturing and services. In this subsection we estimate the effect of resource exports on the
combined GDP --as a proxy for the non-resource sector.

       In Table 17, we present the results from a cross-section of countries. From the result for the
total GDP, we see that the result from Sachs and Warner is present in this regression. In the
sectorial data, we find that we still get a negative effect from primary exports.21 This seems to
suggest that there is the predicted negative effect.

         In Table 18, we proceed to reestimate the effect with a panel. It indicates that once a panel
with fixed effects is done, the negative effect of primary exports is lost. Consequently, it seems that
there is no evidence of a negative effect from resource abundance in the growth of non-resource
sectors.




21
   This result is also found by Sachs and Warner [8] in their paper. See Table VIII, column (8.2). However, in Manzano
[6], the sectors are divided looking for evidence of ‚ÄúDutch Diesease‚Äù and it is found that the negative effect is found on
the service sector and not in the manufacturing sector, contrary to what it is expected from the ‚ÄúDutch Disease‚Äù
literature.

D.         Alternative Institutional Variables

           In Table 19, we repeat the estimation done in the cross-sections of Table 13, with other
institutional variables. These variables represent a corruption index, a rule of law index, an index
that tries to capture the risk of government repudiation, and another the tries to capture the
expropriation risk.22 It is clear that these variables are not statistically significant, while the non-
agricultural resource abundance variable continues to be significant in the regression.

E.        Robustness Check.

           In this appendix we test together our reading of the resource ‚Äúcurse‚Äù and alternative
explanations to it. In Table 20, we present the result of repeating the regressions found on Table 15,
but adding institutional performance. The degree of financial development should be correlated
with rule of law and the quality of the bureaucracy. In this regression, we test for the robustness in
our results regarding the credit constraint results.

           As can be seen, the resource curse survives the inclusion of bureaucracy. The same
conclusion as before is found: The effect of primary exports disappears when credit constraint
variables are included in the regression.

           A second robustness check is to find how sensitive the results are to other variables that
explain growth. In particular, resource abundance could be negatively correlated with many
different variables that are used to explain growth23. In table 21, we test for one of them, Education.
Which, indeed, it is negatively correlated with resource abundance. As seen in the Table the results
from Table 15 do not change with the introduction of it.

         In Table 22 we test for another variable used to explain growth, financial development,
measured as M2 to GDP Ratio. It is also negatively correlated with resource abundance. As seen in
the Table financial development is indeed significant, and has a positive effect on growth.
However, the results from Table 15 still do not change with the introduction of it. This exercise can
be repeated with several other variables standard in growth regressions and the results hold.

F.      Description of the Data

(i) Total Gross Domestic Product: Growth rates and logarithms of past values are per
     economically active population. It is calculated using the gross domestic product per capita
     constructed by the methodology developed in Summers and Heston [11] and updated in
     Summers and Heston [12]. This number is divided by the share of the economically active
     population in the total population given in World Bank [13].

(ii) Primary Exports/GNP, Agricultural Exports/GNP and Non-agricultural Exports/GNP:
     Calculated by using the primary exports and GNP figures given in World Bank [13].
(iii) Years Open: Percentage of years open in the period of reference. The number of years open is
     based on the criteria used in Sachs and Warner [6] to determine whether a country is open or
     not in a certain year.

(iv) Investment/GDP: Calculated using the values provided by Summers and Heston [12].

(v) Manufacturing and Services GDP: calculated using the figures of GDP described in (i) and the
     shares of the sectors given in World Bank [13].

(vi) Non-Resource Sector: Calculated using the data described on (i) and (ii).

(vii) ‚ÄúReal‚Äù Non-Resource Sector and ‚ÄúReal‚Äù Primary Exports Share: calculated using the data
     described in (i) and (ii) and the ratio of the deflators for merchandise exports and GDP given in
     World Bank [13].

(viii)   Bureaucracy: Calculated using the Index of Bureaucracy Quality from Keefer, Philip and
     Stephen Knac (1995), ``Institutions and Economic Policy: Cross-Country Tests Using
     Alternative Institutional Measures'', Economics and Politics, VII, 207-227 (cited by Sachs and
     Warner [9]). The variable in this paper is equal to 6 (maximum possible value) minus the
     actual value of the index. A lower value means a higher quality of bureaucracy.

(ix) Fractionalization: Ethno-linguistic fractionalization. Taken from La Porta et al. [5].

(x) Credit Rationing: Total External Debt divided by the GNP for the countries which this ratio is
     available in World Bank [13]. These countries are all less developed countries. For OECD‚Äôs
     countries this variable was set to zero (0).

(xi) Secondary Enrollment: Percentage of the age group attending secondary school. Taken from
     World Bank [13].
