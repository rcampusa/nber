                                              ABSTRACT

This paper presents numerical simulation results that suggest that China can both reduce its trade imbalance
and receive welfare benefits by switching the value added tax (VAT) regime from the current destination
principle to an origin principle. With the tax on exports exceeding that no longer collected on imports,
revenues rise and exports fall. VAT regime switching is thus a possibility for China to receive a double
benefit, rebalancing trade with a welfare gain. This has implications for present G20 discussions on
finding ways to adjust global trade imbalances. Under a destination principle, imports are taxed but
input taxes are rebated on exports (as currently). Under an origin basis imports are not taxed, but no
export rebates are given. Previous VAT literature stresses the neutrality of tax basis switches, which
simply reflect moving between consumption and production taxes, but neutrality only holds when
trade is balanced. In the unbalanced trade case for countries with a trade surplus, such as China, an
origin basis offers a lower tax rate on an equal yield basis and reduced exports. We use a two country
endogenous trade imbalance general equilibrium global trade model with endogenous factor supply,
a fixed exchange rate and a non-accommodative monetary policy structure which supports the Chinese
trade imbalance. We calibrate model parameters to 2008 data and simulate counterfactual equilibria
for VAT tax basis switches in which the trade imbalance changes. Our results suggest that given China’s
trade surplus VAT regime switching to an origin can decrease China’s trade surplus by over 50%,
and additionally increase Chinese and world welfare. The rest of the world’s production and welfare
improves simultaneously.

                                         Results



    Abstract: This paper presents numerical simulation results that suggest that China can

both reduce its trade imbalance and receive welfare benefits by switching the value added

tax (VAT) regime from the current destination principle to an origin principle. With the tax

on exports exceeding that no longer collected on imports, revenues rise and exports fall.

VAT regime switching is thus a possibility for China to receive a double benefit, rebalancing

trade with a welfare gain. This has implications for present G20 discussions on finding ways

to adjust global trade imbalances. Under a destination principle, imports are taxed but

input taxes are rebated on exports (as currently). Under an origin basis imports are not

taxed, but no export rebates are given. Previous VAT literature stresses the neutrality of

tax basis switches, which simply reflect moving between consumption and production taxes,

but neutrality only holds when trade is balanced. In the unbalanced trade case for countries

with a trade surplus, such as China, an origin basis offers a lower tax rate on an equal yield

basis and reduced exports. We use a two country endogenous trade imbalance general

equilibrium global trade model with endogenous factor supply, a fixed exchange rate and a

non-accommodative monetary policy structure which supports the Chinese trade imbalance.

We calibrate model parameters to 2008 data and simulate counterfactual equilibria for VAT

tax basis switches in which the trade imbalance changes. Our results suggest that given

China’s trade surplus VAT regime switching to an origin can decrease China’s trade surplus

by over 50%, and additionally increase Chinese and world welfare. The rest of the world’s

production and welfare improves simultaneously.

1. Introduction

    The Chinese trade imbalance has been extensively discussed globally in

recent years, and has been a major topic of discussion at G20 summits under the

heading of rebalancing as agreed by the G20 in Pittsburgh in September 2009 in

their Framework for Strong Sustainable and Balanced Growth (FSSBG).

Despite this, concrete proposals for policy changes to address rebalancing are

few. Here we report numerical simulation results which suggest that if China

were to switch its value added tax (VAT) regime from the current destination

basis (DB) to an origin basis (OB), the effect would be both reduce to

significantly reduce China’s trade imbalance by over 50% and also increase

China’s and world welfare. Other instruments than simply exchange rate

realignments can thus contribute to rebalancing.

    This effect occurs because of China’s unbalanced trade and reflects the

feature that under a destination basis, imports are taxed while input taxes are

rebated (as currently), while under an origin basis, imports enter tax free but

exports receive no tax rebate. Existing public finance literature stresses the

neutrality for movements between these two bases, but for this to occur trade

must be balanced. In the presence of a significant Chinese trade surplus, an

equal yield origin basis tax lowers the tax rate, generates efficiency gains, and

can also reduce the surplus.

    The analytical novelty in the paper is to work with a multi good trade

model with an endogenous rather than an exogenous trade imbalance, as such

                                        2
models are little used in the literature. Our 3 commodity 2 country 2 factor

numerical general equilibrium trade model for China with an endogenous trade

imbalance reflects China’s basket fixed exchange rate regime and non

accommodative monetary policy. We present a monetized extension to a

conventional trade model which builds on Whalley and Wang (2010) and in

which the reminbi is inconvertible while at the fixed exchange rate (given

monetary policy) the central bank accumulates reserves. We calibrate the model

to 2008 data before performing basis switching counterfactual analyses. Data

from the Chinese State Administration of Taxation show the VAT to be the

largest revenue source for the national government in China, accounting for

nearly 47% of Chinese total tax revenue in 2008 (CSY, 2009). Because of the size

of the Chinese trade surplus, if the Chinese VAT regime were changed from a

destination basis to an origin basis, the price of Chinese produced goods abroad

would increase and that of foreign produced goods in China would decrease, and

the trade surplus will fall. Under an equal yield tax change a consumer surplus

gain would accompany the change due to a lower tax rate.

    Earlier literature discussion of VAT basis switches emphasizes that a switch

from a destination based commodity tax to an origin based production tax has

no real effects under conditions of trade balance and price flexibility (Whalley,

1979; Grossman, 1980; Berglas, 1981; Lockwood et al, 1994); but is not neutral

if a trade imbalance exists (Lockwood et al, 1994; Genser, 1998). The VAT is

usually thought of as a consumption tax, based on the added value at each stage


                                        3
of a products manufacturing or distribution. Credits apply to taxes paid by

purchasers, and so it is ultimately passed on to the consumer who is ineligible for

tax credits.

    Other related literature argues for the superiority of origin based taxes and

these arguments are also relevant to the Chinese case. Berglas (1981), for

instance, compares three different taxation bases, destination, origin and

restricted origin. His results suggest that the origin basis is the superior one. He

argues that the origin basis is as efficient as the other two; but the origin basis

has lower administrative costs and it can be applied in different countries at a

different rate which provides freedom for countries within the union wanting to

pursue independent fiscal policies requiring a different fraction of the GDP as

tax revenue. Georgakopoulos and Hitiris (1992) argue that in a second-best

world, the restricted origin basis can be superior to the destination basis and

differs from the analysis in Dosser (1967), Shibata (1967) and Shoup (1969),

Lockwood et al (1995). The origin basis can also eliminate problems associated

with the potential for cross-border shopping. Lastly, Keen and Lahiri (1998)

compare destination and origin bases under conditions of imperfect competition,

and find that in this case the origin basis gives exchange efficiency relative to the

destination basis.

    Our numerical simulation results suggest that it could be advantageous for

China to switch the VAT from a destination to an origin basis. China can not

only reduce its trade surplus, but also either collect more tax revenue or on an


                                          4
equal yield basis lower tax rates and improve welfare. The general equilibrium

model we use employs a structure with a labor-leisure choice to provide

endogeneity of factor supply, a fixed exchange rate and an endogenously

determined trade surplus.

    The paper is organized as follows. Part 2 briefly discusses the Chinese VAT

and discusses the potential impacts of basis switches for rebalancing. Part 3

presents the model and outlines its calibration. Part 4 presents simulation and

sensitivity analysis results. The last part presents conclusions.

2. The Chinese VAT Regime, Rebalancing, and Destination and

Origin Bases

    China is unique in having two separate components of their VAT; one

applying to domestic transactions (or domestic VAT) and one applying to

international trade transactions (import VAT and export refunds). VAT,

introduced in 1994, is one of the most Chinese important taxes in revenue terms.

VAT revenues increased very quickly after its 1994 introduction, and VAT has

been the largest tax revenue source in China in recent years. According to data

from the State Administration of Taxation, Chinese domestic VAT revenues

increased from 233.86 billion RMB in 1994 to 1799.69 billion RMB in 2008,

increasing on average by 47.83% annually. Import VAT revenues increased from

32.28 billion RMB in 1994 to 739.11 billion RMB in 2008, an on average increase

of 156.4% (Figure 1). In 2008, Chinese domestic VAT and import VAT shares of

total tax revenue were respectively 33.19% and 13.63%. These two parts of the

VAT thus provide nearly 47% of national government revenues (Figure 2).

                        Data Source: Statistics of State Administration of Taxation



    China’s VAT is administered by the State Administration of Taxation (the

import VAT is collected by customs on its behalf), and the revenues are shared

between the central government (75%) and local governments (25%). According

to the Provisional Regulation of P.R.C on VAT, value-added tax, as in other

countries, is to be paid by enterprises or individuals who sell merchandise,

provide processing, repair, or assembling services, or import goods into the

People's Republic of China. It is based on the added value derived from

production, selling of merchandise, and providing industrial repairing or

assembling service. For different taxable goods and services, different tax rates

(including zero rates) apply, as listed in Table 1. VAT is the major source of

revenue for all government levels in China, and particularly the central

government.

    China’s VAT began on an experimented basis in the 1980s in selected

provinces, when China began to implement VAT on 24 specified taxable items.

In 1994, with the goal of building up the socialist market economy and following


                                                  7
guidelines of “unification of taxation management, equity of tax burden,

simplification of tax system, personalization of revenue distribution relations

and guarantee of the financial revenue”, the taxation system was changed. A

State Council decree enacting a broader VAT on “The Provisional Regulation of

the People’s Republic of China on Value Added Tax” then went into effect on

January 1, 1994.

     In 2004, China made further changes to the VAT in Heilongjiang, Jilin and

Liaoning with the aim of revitalizing the industrial base of Northeastern China.

A scheme of “increment deduction”, which shifts the previous production VAT

regime to a consumer VAT system allowing enterprises to deduct the full amount

of the input tax, was introduced for eight industries: equipment manufacturing,

petrochemical, metallurgy, automobile, shipbuilding, new-and high-tech

industries, and agricultural products processing. It was then extended to 26

industrial cities in the Central Chinese provinces in 2007 in Henan, Hunan,


                                                           8
Hubei, Shanxi, Anhui and Jiangxi. In the second half of 2008, five areas of

eastern Inner Mongolia and the earthquake devastated region of Wenchuan in

Sichuan Province were added.

        China implemented further VAT changes nationwide in 2009, as a national

move from a production-based VAT to one which is consumption-based. With

the exception of a few specific industries, all industries in China are now able to

offset the full amount of input VAT paid on newly purchased machinery and

equipment against VAT collected when they sell their products.

        China’s VAT is effectively operated on a destination basis, so China

imposes not only tariffs but also import-related VAT on goods imported as part

of general trade1. An import-related consumption tax is also levied on certain

goods. For exports, China applies a zero VAT rate with the exception of certain

restricted or prohibited goods and technologies. Effectively, there is no VAT on

exports, and VAT already paid is refunded as an export tax rebate.

        The Chinese government began to implement export tax rebates in April

1985, and a “full refund” principle was established in 1988. After tax reform in

1994, the new VAT was introduced and export goods were to receive a full

export rebate reflecting the tax paid on inputs. To implement the initial export

tax rebates, the central government earmarked a certain amount of its budget

for the purpose, but the obligation turned out to be too large to fulfill.

Consequently, in 1995 and 1996 the government twice reduced the export tax

system, disconnected from the domestic VAT, which uses separate export rebate

rates which change often (and by product) according to the economic situation.

3. Model and Calibration

    To analyze the potential impacts of VAT basis switches in China in the

presence of China’s trade surplus, we use a standard 3 good 2 country 2 factor

general equilibrium model, with the added feature that the trade imbalance is

endogenously determined and supported by a fixed exchange rate and

non-accommodative monetary policy. We use data for 2008 to calibrate model

parameters and conduct counterfactual policy analysis. The 3×2×2 static

structure incorporates a labor-leisure choice to yield endogeneity of factor

supplies, as well as a fixed exchange rate, non-accommodative monetary policy,

and a endogenously determined trade surplus. We use the model to simulate

possible impacts of Chinese VAT regime changes from a destination basis to an

origin basis in both equal yield format with endogenous tax rates for the new

regime, and in fixed tax rate format.

    3.1 Model

    The model has two countries, three goods and two factors of production.

The two countries are China and the ROW (rest of the world). The two input

factors are labor and capital which are immobile across countries, but mobile

across sectors. Because VAT rates in China for agriculture goods (13%),

manufacture goods (17%) and services (3%) differ, we include three kinds of

products in the model, agriculture, manufacturing and services. In reality China

employs a credit invoice VAT for manufactures and a noncredit turnover tax for

services. Since we do not explicitly model intermediate production, the separate

                                        11
VAT form used for services does not enter our analysis.

    On the production side, we assume CES functions for each product in each

country:

where Qij is the output of the ith industry in country j, Lij and Kij are the labor

and σij is the elasticity of factor substitution.

where PKj and PLj are the prices of capital and labor in country j.

    On the consumption side, we assume nested CES utility functions with a

labor-leisure choice in each country. These nested functions, with three levels,

are set out in Figure 3. The first level captures the consumption leisure choice,

the second the domestic imported good choice, and the third the more detailed

product choice. We use the Armington assumption under which domestic goods

and imported goods are heterogenous to accommodate cross hauling in trade

data, and to remove specialization problems with the model.

where Dij and Mij are consumption of domestic and imported goods of country i,

L j and K j are endowments of labor and capital, and Leiij is leisure consumption

    To accommodate a trade surplus or deficit as an endogenous variable in this

structure, we use a monetized extension of this structure incorporating a fixed

exchange rate and non-accommodative monetary policy, similar to that in

Whalley and Wang (2010). In this formulation prices are denominated in

domestic currency with an exchange rate e between the two domestic moneys.

Cross country arbitrage between the country specific prices with no taxes in

trade yields:

     pij  epii                  i,j=1,2; i  j                                         (9)

    If we only consider the transactions demand for money in each country and

for simplicity assume unitary velocity and also assume exporters are paid in

their own country currency, the money demand in country j is:

                                                                                          j
    Where pij is the consumer price of product i in country j, and M                           is

country jth’s money supply. In traditional models, money is neutral in the sense

that once domestic money supplies are specified, an equilibrium exchange rate is

determined independent of the real side, and a fixed exchange rate regime and

trade surplus does not occur. And if the exchange rate e is fixed at e , then the
                                                    i    j
relative domestic money stocks M / M                         need to accommodate to e so as to

support it as an equilibrium exchange rate.

    In the structure we use the monetary regime is non-accommodative to the

fixed exchange rate; and in this case the trade surplus will be endogenously

                                                        14
determined. If we denote country 1 as China, country 1 has a trade surplus S1

and country 2 has a trade deficit D2,

    S 1   pi1 X i1  pi1M i1
                                                                          (11)

                  i                    i


    Country 1’s trade surplus will equal country 2’s trade deficit in equilibrium,

and country money demands are:

    M   pi1Qi1
          1


                                                                          (12)
                  i

    M   pi2Qi2  S 1
          2

                      i


    Into this structure we can then introduce VAT. We use t to denote the VAT

rate and assume that the ROW does not have a VAT. In this world, a

destination basis VAT will imply that:

     
     pi1  e(1  t ) pi2                   imports taxed
     
     pi2  pi1 / e                         exports not taxed              (13)
     
     p  (1  t ) pi1
      1
      i                                    domestic goods taxed

    If the VAT regime is on an origin basis, international arbitrage yields:

     
     pi1  epi2                            imports not taxed
     
     pi2  (1  t ) pi1 / e                exports not taxed               (14)
     
     pi1  (1  t ) pi1                    domestic goods taxed

    Using the above trade model with a fixed exchange rate, and

non-accommodative monetary policy with an endogenously determined trade

surplus, we can then simulate the trade and welfare effects of Chinese VAT

regime switching both on the trade imbalance and on welfare. For the VAT rate


                                                       15
under the origin basis, we use revenue equivalent switching such that total

revenue is kept equal under the two VAT regimes. In this case, the VAT rate is

endogenously determined as we switch bases.

    3.2 Data and Calibration

    We use 2008 as our base year and build a benchmark general equilibrium

data set for use in calibration and simulation (see Shoven and Whalley (1992)).

There are two countries China and ROW, three sectors agriculture, manufacture

and service, and two factors capital and labor in our model. We take the ROW

to be a multiple of US data as elsewhere in literature (4.216 times in Dong and

Whalley, 2009).

    The data we use in model calibration as the base case equilibrium are listed

in Table 3. All Chinese data except trade data are from the National Bureau of

Statistics (NBS) and Chinese Statistic Yearbook. Chinese trade data are from

the WTO statistics database. US data except capital are from Bureau of

Economic Analysis database, and US capital data are from US census bureau

“2010 Capital Spending Report”. The foreign exchange rate we use is the

average exchange rate for the RMB to US dollar in 2008. Chinese work hours are

calculated according to the labor law that each employees work 8 hours per day,

and every year has 104 weekend holidays and 11 festival holidays so that each

has 250 (=365-104-11) work days. Each Chinese labor is assumed to work 250

multiply 8 equals 2000 hours each year. Annual working hours of per worker for

ROW, are taken as the same as average work hour of the world, that is 1764


                                      16
hours according to OECD report (OECD, 2008). From this working hour data

we calculate base case leisure consumption.

      The production and utility functions in our model are all of the CES type,

and the elasticity specification used in them can affect model results. There are

no available estimates of elasticities for China either on the demand or

production side (Dong and Whalley, 2009). Many of the estimates of domestic

and import good substitution elasticity are around 2 (Betina, 2003), so we set all

of these elasticities in our model to 2 (the same as Whalley and Wang (2010)).

We change these elasticities later in sensitivity analysis to check their influence

on simulation results.

4. Simulation Results

    We report model results for a series of model experiments in which the

Chinese VAT is switched from a destination to an origin basis. All of the results

are reported as per percentage changes compared to the base case equilibrium

with a VAT destination basis; that is the origin principle model equilibrium

minus the destination principle model equilibrium. We then divide by

destination principle values to give percentage changes. We are interested in

trade imbalance effects, trade effects, tax revenue effects, production effects and

welfare effects, but also report Hicksian equivalent variations (EV) for the

changes. Additionally, we report sensitivity analyses for elasticity parameters on

simulation results.

    4.1 Simulation Results

    When the Chinese VAT regime is switched from a destination principle to

an origin basis, Chinese export prices, which now include the tax increase, and

import prices decrease. Chinese imports increase and exports (plus the trade

surplus) decrease. Additionally, this change increases Chinese VAT revenues.

    We use two different methods to calculate the VAT rates and VAT revenues

from regime switching. The first is the traditional equal yield tax reform as in

the literature (Shoven and Whalley, 1977; Feldstein, 1974; Pereira, 1995;

Hamilton, 1999), which keeps tax revenues constant and has tax rates

endogenously determined. The second keeps tax rates constant and has tax

revenues endogenously determined. We analyze these two cases separately.

                                        19
    4.1.1 Equal Yield Tax Basis Switching

    Since we have three different products in our model, their VAT rates are

different. Table 5 reports results for trade, production and welfare for equal yield

VAT regime switching. In the equal yield tax analyses reported here, we assume

these three rates change by the same proportion in a basis switch so as to

preserve tax revenues.

    These results suggest that the trade surplus in China could decrease by

59.84% of its former size under VAT regime switching. This could be a major

contribution to global rebalancing, and would be accompanied by a welfare gain

for both China and the rest of the world. Under the basis switch Chinese exports

of agriculture, manufactures and service separately decrease by 9.99%, 4.89%

and 0.26%, and imports of these three kinds of products separately increase by

11.44%, 6.08% and 0.12%. Agricultural output changes the most, then

manufactures and lastly services. Because manufacturing account for most of the


                                           20
Chinese trade surplus, its changes determines most of the trade imbalance

changes. Although exports and imports do not change a lot, their different

signed effects decrease the trade surplus substantially. In our two country model,

Chinese imports equal ROW’s exports and Chinese exports equal ROW’s

imports. These import and export changes are the same as in Table 5, and the

Chinese trade surplus equals ROW’s trade deficit.

    Total production in China decreases by 1.73% which reflects decreased

exports and increased imports. The production change is less in percentage

terms than in trade which means that Chinese domestic demand increases after

VAT regime switching. Production of ROW increases by 0.45% reflecting the

Chinese trade imbalance adjustment.

    The Hicksian equivalent variation gain for China for the change is 0.26% of

GDP and for the ROW 0.69%. This suggests VAT regime switching can improve

both countries’ welfare. Chinese domestic products have prices lowered and

improved consumer welfare follows, and the ROW’s production increases and

improves its welfare.

    In order to keep total VAT revenues unchanged, Chinese VAT rates

decrease because of the trade surplus status. These simulation results indicate

that the VAT rate can be reduced by 23.99%, and VAT rates for agriculture,

manufacture and service are 9.88%, 12.92% and 2.28% respectively.

    4.1.2 Equal Tax Rate Basis Switching

    Table 6 also reports equal tax rate basis switching simulation results in


                                        21
which tax rates remain unchanged but tax revenues rise. Total Chinese imports

increase by 6.77% and agriculture, manufacture and service imports separately

increase by 11.63%, 7.02% and 0.13%. Total exports decrease by 4.63% and

agriculture, manufacture and service products by 10.38%, 5.17% and 0.27%.

These changes jointly decrease the trade imbalance by 64.11%, a little more than

in the equal yield case. Trade effects are more severe than equal yield tax

switching.

    On the production side, China’s output decreases 1.87% in total.

Production of agriculture and manufacture separately decrease by 1.72% and

9.61% and services increase by 7.49%. Production of the ROW increases by

0.53% and its agriculture and manufacture output increases by 1.34% and 2.16%,

while services decrease by 0.15%. In welfare terms, China and the ROW both

benefit from the switching; China’s EV is 0.23% of GDP and the ROW 0.74%.

China’s total VAT revenue increases if we use equal tax rate switching. These

results show that total revenues increase by 7.42%; in detail, agriculture

decreases by 38.79%, and manufacture and service separately increase by 26.11%

and 6.08%.

    In general, equal tax rate VAT regime switching decreases China’s exports

a little more and also increases imports by more, and the two effects jointly

decrease the trade surplus more. Although China experiences a negative

production effect, its welfare and tax revenue increase.

    4.2 Sensitivity Analysis

    In our model, the elasticity parameter values we use reflect available

literature. But changing these parameters value can change results, and so we

provide sensitivity analyze for different elasticity parameters. We change

elasticity parameters to different values and compare results of VAT basis

switching on trade, production, VAT revenues and welfare. In order to simplify

our sensitivity analyze, we assume all of the elasticity parameters are equal and

do not change each elasticity value one by one. We choose elasticity values equal

to 0.5, 0.8, 1.2, 1.6, 2.1 and 2.4. In our sensitivity analyze, we focus on the equal

tax yield case.

    Table 7 reports sensitivity analysis results for Chinese VAT basis switching.

In general, all of these elasticity variations do not change results that much. The

export impacts change from -4.29% to -4.89%, import impacts change from

6.21% to 6.92%, trade surplus impacts change from -59.63% to -66.51%, Chinese


                                         23
production impacts change from -1.39% to -1.83%, and EVs change from 0.20%

to 0.31%. All of these changes are within 30% of their central case values.

5. Conclusions and Policy Implications


    Trade rebalancing has become a major focus of discussion in the G20, and is

now taken as a task for the entire world after the 2008 financial crisis. Present

G20 summit discussions focus on members adjusting exchange rates. Here, we

argue that for China with a large trade surplus, VAT basis switching from a

destination to an origin basis may also be a significant accompanying measure

yielding reductions in China’s trade imbalance of over 50% and also welfare

gains both for China and the world.

    We use a two country, three sector and two factor global trade equilibrium

model with a fixed exchange rate and non-accommodative monetary policy in a

structure which accommodates an endogenous trade imbalance to simulate the

possible effects of Chinese VAT regime switching from a destination basis to an

origin basis. We use data for 2008 as our base year. Our results suggest that the

Chinese trade surplus and total production would both decrease under such a

change and there will be a positive welfare benefit for China. Production in

ROW will also increase.

    These results thus suggest that Chinese VAT regime switching can not only

reduce the Chinese trade imbalance, and also benefit both China and the ROW,

and that G20 discussion of rebalancing could usefully focus not only on exchange

rate reassignments, but also on other possible instruments. Using the origin

principle in the Chinese VAT may also have other advantages, including lower

administrative costs, and can alleviate the export rebate burden on the Chinese

government budget.
