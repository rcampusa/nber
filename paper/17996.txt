                                            ABSTRACT

From 1922 to 1929, the Sheppard-Towner Act provided matching grants to states to fund maternal
and infant care education initiatives. We examine the effects of this public health program on infant
mortality. States engaged in different types of activities, allowing us to examine whether different
interventions had differential effects on mortality. Interventions that provided one-on-one contact
and opportunities for follow-up care, such as home visits by public health nurses, reduced infant deaths
more than classes and conferences. Overall, we estimate that Sheppard-Towner activities can account
for 9 to 21 percent of the decline in infant mortality over the period.

Introduction

         Infant mortality in the United States declined significantly over the first
part of the twentieth century, as shown in Figure 1, which plots infant mortality
rates in the Birth Registration Area (BRA) from 1915 to 1940.1 Rising incomes,
improved nutrition and housing conditions, and public infrastructure
improvements such as water sanitation and sewer systems all contributed to the
decline in infant mortality rates, particularly in urban areas (see McKeown 1976;
Fogel 1994; Haines 2001; Cutler and Miller 2005; Ferrie and Troesken 2008). In
addition, government expenditures on public health and education increased
dramatically over this period. Miller (2008) finds that increases in state and local
public health and education expenditures caused by the enactment of women’s
suffrage decreased mortality from infectious diseases between 1900 and 1936.
Fox (2011) uses municipal data on public health expenditures over the period
1923-1932 and also concludes that public health spending lowered infant
mortality, although the effect is diminished by the inclusion of city-specific time
trends in his model.

         Most of the expansion in public health programs occurred at the state and
local levels. However, the federal government was also involved in public health
initiatives. The U.S. Children’s Bureau conducted studies of infant mortality in a
variety of areas in the U.S. and compared its findings to data on infant mortality
in other advanced economies. After declaring 1918 as the “Children’s Year,” the
Bureau sought to reduce infant and child mortality by distributing literature and
by providing education on health and hygiene at fairs. Efforts to implement a
broader and more permanent program aimed at providing prenatal and infant care
1
 Infant mortality trended strongly downward despite the fact that the BRA continued to expand
until 1932, and many of the states that entered later had higher mortality rates than earlier entrants.
In figure 1, we also plot infant mortality for only those states that were in the BRA as of 1915 to
show that the addition of later states does not obscure the strong downward trend.




                                                  2
education finally succeeded in 1921, when Congress passed the Promotion of the
Welfare and Hygiene of Maternity and Infancy Act, more commonly known as
the “Sheppard-Towner” Act.2

         Sheppard-Towner provided matching money to states to spend on public
health programs targeted at reducing infant and maternal mortality. Each
participating state received $5,000 outright and then received dollar-for-dollar
matching funds up to an explicit cap determined by its population. States used
funds from the program in a variety of ways. Some states used Sheppard-Towner
money to organize conferences where physicians and other health professionals
would examine children and pregnant women, or provide demonstrations on
maternal and infant care and hygiene. Many states provided classes for midwives
and classes for girls about infant care. Nearly all states sent “prenatal letters” to
pregnant women, while others paid public health nurses to visit new and
expectant mothers. Some also used the funds to build public health clinics.

         Despite its laudable goals, bitter political battles about the role of the
federal government in providing maternal and infant health education ensued and
the Sheppard-Towner Act was repealed in 1929.3 Even though the program was
short-lived, the Children’s Bureau heralded it as a success and concluded that “the
value of maternity and infancy work is reflected in the decrease in infant and
maternal death rates in 1928 as compared with those in 1921” (U.S. Children’s
Bureau 1931a: 6). This claim has been echoed by historians such as Molly Ladd-
Taylor, who writes, “A further indication of the program’s success was the
significant decrease in infant mortality during the Sheppard-Towner years”
(Ladd-Taylor 1994: 187). On the other hand, infant mortality was trending

  Prior to Sheppard-Towner, the federal government had also provided money to states to assist in
venereal disease control and prevention under the Chamberlain-Kahn Act of 1918.

strongly downward even before 1920. Opponents to Sheppard-Towner disputed
its effect and attributed the decline in infant mortality to its pre-existing trend. A
1932 editorial in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA)
highlights this view:
           During the seven and one-half years that the Sheppard-Towner Act
           was in effect, it cost the people about eleven million dollars in
           taxes. During that entire time it did not develop a single new idea
           in the field of maternal and infant hygiene. As shown by the
           official mortality statistics, it did not accelerate the rate of decline
           in either the maternal or the infant death rates, by even a fraction of
           a point per annum (JAMA 1932: 404).


           The goal of this paper is to disentangle the effect of Sheppard-Towner on
infant mortality from its pre-existing downward trend, thereby assessing the
contribution that public health educational programs made to the reduction of
infant mortality in the 1920s. This research agenda has significant modern policy
relevance. Educational programs, like those funded by the Sheppard-Towner
program, are still promoted today as ways to decrease infant mortality.4 Yet we
do not know if and how such activities contributed to the dramatic reduction in
infant mortality that occurred in the U.S. during the early twentieth century. The
literature on infant mortality in developing countries today provides mixed
findings on the effectiveness of public health expenditures. Several studies have
shown that public health expenditures have a minor or statistically insignificant
impact on infant and child mortality (Kim and Moody 1992; Mcguire et al., 1993;
Aiyer et al. 1995; Musgrove 1996; Filmer and Pritchett 1997; Filmer et al. 1998),
while others (Anand and Ravallion 1993; Hojman 1996; Gupta et al 2002;

    See for instance Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, 2009.

Anyanwu and Erhijakpor 2009) suggest that such expenditures cause substantial
decreases in infant deaths.
       Part of the difficulty in assessing the impact of public health expenditures
on infant mortality lies in the fact that changes in public health outlays may not
represent true spending increases. For example, under Sheppard-Towner, some
states that participated in the program did not actually increase net expenditures,
but rather shifted expenditures from existing public health programs in order to
qualify for the federal match. For example, in a letter dated December 8, 1921,
from W.S. Rankin, North Carolina’s State Health Officer to his counterpart in
Tennessee:

       I shall not find it difficult, I think, to secure the apportion
       for North Carolina for the reason that we are spending now
       practically as much as they have to apportion on infancy
       and maternity work. The situation, then with respect to this
       State will mean simply our adjusting our program to meet
       their approval and their matching their funds dollar for
       dollar for money now being expended on the same objects
       as provided in the Sheppard-Towner Act (Rankin, W.S. to
       Olin West; 8 December, 1921).

       While we do examine the impact of Sheppard-Towner grants and public
health expenditure measures on infant mortality, a key contribution of our work is
that we look beyond such measures to examine the impact of the specific
activities in which states engaged under Sheppard-Towner. These activities
involved very different levels of interaction with mothers and children and
therefore may have had differential impacts on infant mortality. Thus, we
separately analyze the effects of nurse visits, conferences, literature, public health
centers, and classes for midwives.




                                           5
       To account for the persistent differences in mortality environments across
states and the strong downward trend in infant mortality of the period, we include
state fixed effects and state specific time trends in all our models. We find that
state expenditures on child health programs, and health and sanitation more
generally, significantly reduced infant mortality. However, we also find that the
type of public health intervention mattered. More direct and personal
interventions such as nurse visits were most effective at reducing infant mortality,
while conferences and classes had little impact. Moreover, we find a differential
effect of Sheppard-Towner interventions on non-white and white infant mortality.
Specifically, building public health centers and funding nurse visits to mothers
generated much larger reductions in infant mortality for non-whites than for
whites. In addition, while prenatal letters reduced white infant mortality, they did
not reduce black infant mortality. We conclude that while much of the reduction
in infant mortality during the 1920s must be attributed to other factors, activities
funded by Sheppard-Towner could account for between 9 and 21 percent of the
decline.

Infant Mortality and the U.S. Children’s Bureau

       Created in 1912, the Children’s Bureau was charged with investigating
and reporting “upon all matters pertaining to the welfare of children and child life
among all classes of our people” (42 U.S.C. Ch. 6. April 9, 1912). In the 1910s,
the Children’s Bureau focused on studying causes of infant and maternal
mortality, and creating a birth registration area where all births would be
accurately and consistently reported. An examination of nearly 23,000 infants in
8 cities led the Children’s Bureau to conclude that the overall infant mortality rate
in the U.S. was 111.2 deaths per 1,000 live births, a rate higher than those of
many other industrialized countries. Moreover, many of these deaths were
believed to have been preventable. For example, the study revealed that the




                                          6
mortality rate for artificially fed infants in the nine months of life was 4.8 times
greater than for breastfed infants (Woodbury 1925: 91). Overall, about 29 percent
of the deaths were attributable to gastric and intestinal causes, many due to
improper feeding and hygiene (Woodbury 1925: 14).

       The Children's Bureau investigations also revealed that large numbers of
rural women had limited access to medical care during childbirth. In its study
area in rural Wisconsin, the Bureau found that half of confinements were attended
by midwives and 8 percent were attended by neighbors or relatives without any
training. Moreover, in a number of cases classified as attended by a physician,
the physician had arrived after the birth. In one case, a new mother had to wait
two hours for the doctor to arrive to cut the cord (Children's Bureau 1919a: 28-
30). In a homesteading county in Montana, the conditions were even worse:
more than half of the new mothers studied lived more than 20 miles from the
nearest physician (Children's Bureau 1919b: 27)

       As a result of these studies, the chief of the Children’s Bureau, Julia
Lathrop, proposed a plan for the “public protection of maternity and infancy” with
federal funds (Fifth Annual Report of the Chief, Children’s Bureau 1917: 49).
The plan called for greater instruction of mothers on the care of infants and
greater availability of physicians and hospital care. Instruction could be provided
through public health nurses, universities, and extension teaching (Fifth Annual
Report of the Chief, Children’s Bureau 1917: 47-48). Lathrop suggested that the
Smith-Lever Act of 1914 provided a precedent by which the federal government
could fund the program using matching grants to states (Fifth Annual Report of
the Chief, Children’s Bureau 1917: 49).

       In July 1918, Representative Jeannette Pickering Rankin (R-Montana)
sponsored a bill that contained the basics of Lathrop’s proposal. The bill




                                          7
proposed a yearly appropriation of $10,000 per state, with $1 million in additional
funds to be divided among states based on their share of the U.S. rural population,
and contingent on the state legislature approving matching funds. The purpose of
the bill was educational in nature; funds were to be used to encourage instruction
in hygiene and maternity, and not to provide medical care. Rankin’s bill failed to
gain traction. Despite the fact that no one appeared before the House Committee
on Labor to oppose the bill, it did not reach the floor of Congress (Lindenmeyer
1997: 79). During the next session, Representative Horace Mann Towner
(R-Iowa) and Senator Morris Sheppard (D-Texas) introduced proposals similar to
Rankin’s bill. The Senate passed the bill in December 1920, following three days
of debate that centered on questions of funding for the program, and whether it
should be administered by the Children’s Bureau or the medically-run Public
Health Service (PHS). In the House, hearings were held at the end of December,
but the bill failed to come to a vote before the end of the Congressional session.
Supporters of the bill were buoyed by President Harding’s endorsement in April
1921 and re-introduced the measures.

        While no group voiced opposition to the Rankin bill in 1918, new
resistance to the proposed Sheppard and Towner bills came from two primary
sources: the American Medical Association and the Woman Patriots
(Lindenmeyer 1997: 83). While the AMA was slow to organize against
compulsory health insurance in the late 1910s, the organization took a definitive
stance against such a program in 1920 (Burrow 1963: 150). The AMA strongly
opposed government control over medical service, and viewed the provision of
care for individuals as best achieved “…through voluntary self-taxation of voters
in a political unit to pay for the necessary local facilities for the prevention of




                                           8
disease and the promotion of health” (JAMA, February 5, 1921).5 Physicians
feared that government intervention would eventually lead to non-medical
provision of medical services.

         Anti-suffragists joined physicians in opposing the proposed Sheppard-
Towner legislation. The Woman Patriots, formerly known as the National
Association Opposed to Woman Suffrage, denounced the Act as a communist and
feminist plot. Samuel Winslow, an anti-suffragist and chair of the House
Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce refused to even hold hearings on
the bill for several months. Alice Robertson, an anti-suffragist and the only
woman in Congress, voted against the bill (Lemons 1990: 157).

         Despite the opposition, the bill easily passed in both the House, (279 to
39) and the Senate (63 to 7). Historians argue that Sheppard-Towner passed
because members of Congress feared the new, unknown voting power of women.
The effectiveness of the women’s lobby and the fear of the House and Senate was
noted by Senator Kenyon (R-Iowa), who stated, “If the members could have voted
on that measure secretly in their cloak rooms it would have been killed as
emphatically as it was finally passed in the open under the pressure of the Joint
Congressional Committee of Women” (Ladies Home Journal XXXIX (April
1922: 95)).6


5
  While the AMA as a whole was opposed, certain groups of physicians within the AMA
supported Sheppard-Towner. Pediatricians supported Sheppard-Towner; in fact, the American
Academy of Pediatrics was founded as an independent group in 1922 because pediatricians
disagreed with the AMA’s stance. Other medical groups also supported the bill’s passage,
including the Medical Women’s National Association (Lindenmeyer 1997: 87).
6
  The idea that Congress had at least some fear of the women’s vote is supported by Lott and
Kenny (1999) and Miller (2008). Lott and Kenny (1999) find that suffrage coincided with
immediate increases in state government expenditures for functions women generally supported,
such as education, sanitation and hospitals. Suffrage also generated more liberal voting patterns
among federal representatives. Miller (2008) similarly finds that suffrage laws generated large
increases in public health spending. Moehling and Thomasson (2012) also find that time since
suffrage had a large impact on the level of state participation in the Sheppard-Towner program.




                                                9
        The political debate at the national level did not end after Sheppard-
Towner’s enactment. Some states (MA, CT, and IL) never participated in the
program. The level of engagement among states that did participate varied
widely. When the program came up for renewal in 1926, it met with increased
opposition. Ultimately, a compromise was reached in which the program was
extended for an additional two years, but then automatically repealed in 1929.

        Under the auspices of Sheppard-Towner, states had the autonomy to
engage in a variety of different activities designed to reduce infant and maternal
mortality and improve the health of children and mothers. During the seven year
period in which the Act was in force, physicians conducted 144,777 conferences
where they examined children and pregnant women, and nurses and dentists held
nearly 40,000 more conferences where they provided general instruction on
maternal and child care. At these itinerant conferences, health professionals
provided instruction on infant and child care using lectures, motion pictures, and
exhibits. They also examined infants and preschoolers and referred those with
problems to physicians (Children’s Bureau 1925, 1926b, 1927).
        In addition, states and counties set up 2,978 permanent child and/or
prenatal health centers where mothers could bring children to be examined and
receive follow-up care.7 Public health nurses also visited over 3 million women
and their children in the last six years of the act. During these visits, field nurses
would advise women on child care and examine children. Nurses could provide
demonstrations in the household “… with the equipment the home affords,” and
make additional recommendations upon seeing the living conditions of the family
(Children’s Bureau 1926a: 7). The Children’s Bureau noted that the informal


7
  These permanent health centers were not necessarily newly constructed, stand-alone clinics.
They often were just regularly scheduled sessions where physicians and nurses would see patients
in a given location. For example, some states used rooms in municipal buildings or schools
(Children’s Bureau 1926b: 10).




                                               10
setting of the visits also may have enabled mothers to feel freer to ask questions,
and may have been particularly useful in isolated communities with a lack of
access to medical care and where it was difficult to arrange conferences
(Children’s Bureau 1926:7).
         Sheppard-Towner funds were also used to provide literature on prenatal
and child care to expectant women and mothers. The Children’s Bureau studies in
the 1910s had found that many mothers, especially those in rural areas, looked to
printed material for guidance on child care (Apple 2006:77-78). Over 22 million
pieces of literature (such as instructional pamphlets and prenatal letters) were
distributed nationwide when the Act was in force. Overall, in the last four years of
the Act alone, the Children’s Bureau estimated that more than 4 million infants
and children and about 700,000 pregnant women were reached by some form of
the public health work conducted under Sheppard-Towner (Children’s Bureau
1931).


Data and Methods
         The overall U.S. infant mortality rate in 1922 was 76.2 deaths per 1,000
live births. By the time Sheppard-Towner was repealed in 1929, the infant
mortality rate had fallen to 67.6 (Linder and Grove 1947: 574-75). How much, if
any, of this decline can be attributed to the activities that states engaged in under
the Sheppard-Towner program? Although Sheppard-Towner was passed in 1921,
it took many states a couple of years to gear up to accept federal grants and
establish programs. Not until its report on the Sheppard-Towner Act for the 1924
fiscal year was the Children's Bureau able to give a systematic accounting of the
activities of the states. The Children’s Bureau published these data in tabular
form and provided state-by-state reports on an annual basis starting in 1925 (U.S.
Children's Bureau 1925, 1926b, 1927, 1928, and 1931b). As a result, we use
state-level Vital Statistics data for the period 1924-1929 on the infant mortality




                                          11
rate (defined as the number of deaths of children under 1 year of age per 1,000
live births) to test whether a state’s participation in Sheppard-Towner had the life-
saving effects the Children’s Bureau claimed.8 Our basic model is:

(1)     IMRit = α + β*STit + δi + δt + δi*t + εit
where IMRit represents the infant mortality rate in state i in year t, STit represents
the measure of Sheppard-Towner activity for state i in year t, δi and δt are the state
and year fixed effects, and δi*t represents the state specific linear time-trend. This
model accounts for differences across states in both levels and trends in mortality
rates, and identifies the effects of Sheppard-Towner as deviations from those
trends. In the fully saturated specification, β is identified by the within-state
deviations from trend in Sheppard-Towner activities.
        One concern may be that the measure of Sheppard-Towner activity is
endogenous; a state’s decision to participate in Sheppard-Towner or to engage in
a particular activity may have been influenced by its infant mortality rate. In
other words, the error term for the model of a state’s participation in Sheppard-
Towner may be correlated with the error term in equation (1). It is important to
note, however, that this will only be a problem for the estimation of β in equation
(1) if the correlation is due to do something other than state and year fixed effects
and the state specific linear time-trend. To examine the effect of Sheppard-
Towner on infant mortality, we use several different measures of states’
participation in the program. The most direct measure would be to use a simple
binary measure equal to one if a state participated in the program. However, this
variable has little variation since only three states (CT, IL and MA) failed to
participate in the program, and it masks significant state-level variation in the
extent of participation (Moehling and Thomasson 2012). Thus, we instead look at


8
 We have also estimated the model over the period 1922-1929 and 1915-1929 (excluding the
years of the influenza pandemic) and get similar results.




                                             12
the grant amount accepted per capita. While this is better than the simple binary
measure in that it captures more of the variation both across states and over time,
it may mask the fact that some states simply shifted expenditures from existing
public health categories into Sheppard-Towner to qualify for the federal match.9

         As a result, we also estimate models in which we use data from the U.S.
Census Bureau's Financial Statistics of the States on outlays for the “conservation
of child life” and the broader category of “health and sanitation” as measures of
public health spending. Programs that would fall in the category of the
"conservation of child life" would include most of the Sheppard-Towner funded
activities, but would also include programs aimed at school-age children. The
“health and sanitation” category includes the full range of public health programs
and sanitation projects in which a state engaged.

         Key to our analysis, though, is the examination of how the different types
of activities in which states engaged under the Sheppard-Towner program
affected infant mortality. As noted above, states engaged in a wide range of
activities with Sheppard-Towner funds. States utilized Sheppard-Towner money
to build health clinics, conduct prenatal and child health conferences (where
physicians or nurses would examine children and provide information about
hygiene and nutrition), and to send public health nurses into homes to examine
children and educate mothers. In addition, states used Sheppard-Towner funds to
provide training for midwives and to disseminate free literature on prenatal and
infant care. These different types of activities involved very different types of


9
  The state of New Jersey was quite open about the fact that it used the federal grants to replace
state appropriations. For instance, in 1922, the New Jersey legislature appropriated almost
$100,000 less for the Department of Health than it had in 1921. This move was explained in the
Department's annual report in quite plain terms: the appropriations for the Bureau of Child
Hygiene and the Bureau of Venereal Disease Control were being reduced because both would be
receiving federal monies for their work (New Jersey Department of Health 1922, 19).




                                                13
interactions with mothers and their children, and we might expect that some
would have a greater impact than others on mortality rates.
         We estimate equation (1) for all infants, and also separately for whites and
non-whites. Vital Statistics data only provide infant mortality rates for states in
the BRA. At the start of our study period in 1924, 33 states were in the BRA; by
1929, that number had jumped to 46.10 In order to make the most of the available
data, we estimate equation (1) using the unbalanced panel of all states in the BRA
for at least one year of the study period.11
         The non-white infant mortality rate at the beginning of the period was
nearly twice that of white infants, as shown in Figure 2. Despite the fact that
more states with high non-white infant mortality rates were entering the BRA
during this period, the racial gap in infant mortality rates did not widen
appreciably. A priori, we do not know whether Sheppard-Towner spending
would affect blacks and whites differently. Sheppard-Towner initiatives were
targeted at smaller cities and rural areas. Some interventions, such as classes to
train midwives, may have benefited blacks more than whites, since the vast
majority of Southern blacks used midwives (Ladd-Taylor 1988: 263). On the
other hand, the structure of Sheppard-Towner may have limited the effectiveness
of the interventions for blacks. For example, while more strict regulation of
midwives and midwife classes may have improved the quality of some midwives,
the regulations may have served to drive many underground and out of business,

   To be included in the BRA, a state had to have a systematic procedure in place for recording all
births. When the BRA was established in 1915, it consisted of only 10 states. Following is a list
of the states that entered the BRA during the study period with their years of entry: West Virginia
(1925); Arizona (1926); Alabama, Arkansas, Louisiana, Missouri, Tennessee (1927); Colorado,
Georgia, Oklahoma (1928); Nevada, New Mexico (1929). South Carolina was part of the BRA in
1924, was dropped in 1925, and then readmitted in 1928. The two states not part of the BRA by
1929 were South Dakota and Texas (Linder and Grove 1947: 97).
11
   We have also estimated all models using the balanced panel consisting of states in the BRA for
all five years and the basic findings do not change. All estimated models presented in the paper
include the three states that did not participate in Sheppard-Towner: Connecticut, Illinois, and
Massachusetts. Excluding these states does not alter the basic findings.




                                                14
thus limiting the ability of blacks to find birth attendants (Ladd Taylor 1988: 269-
70).
         Of further concern is that the decentralization of Sheppard-Towner
administration may have reinforced the ability of racist public health workers to
discriminate against blacks at the local level. By helping whites and not blacks,
these practices may have increased the racial gap in infant mortality.12 Perhaps
surprisingly, though, state reports to the Children’s Bureau documented efforts to
target blacks as well as other minority groups rather than to exclude them. In
1924, for instance, Alabama paid for a black nurse to join the Tuskegee Movable
School. The nurse joined a carpenter, instructor and agriculturist who traveled
around the state teaching black rural families how to improve their homes and
their health (U.S. Children’s Bureau 1924: 21). In the same year, Florida reported
making more prenatal visits to black women (4,033) than to white women (2,406)
(ibid: 24).


Results
         Summary statistics are provided in Table 1. The mean of the white infant
mortality rate in the BRA over the period is about 70 deaths per 1,000 live births,
while the non-white infant mortality rate is 128. The means hide considerable
variation, so we report the minima and maxima of the variables as well. For
example, for those states that did spend money sending public health nurses into
homes, the mean value of nurse visits per 1,000 population is 12.60, with a
minimum of 0.02 and a maximum of 138. Table 1 shows that the largest impact
(in per capita terms) was for “prenatal letters” – literature that provided
information on prenatal and well-child care. We include information on the


12
  Later in the twentieth century, the widening of the racial gap in infant mortality can be attributed
to the fact that whites had better access to improved medical care than blacks (see Almond, Chay
and Greenstone 2007).

average Sheppard-Towner grant (per capita) accepted by states, as well as the
means of per capita state spending on “conservation of child life” and the broader
category of expenditures on health and sanitation, which would also capture state
spending on non-Sheppard-Towner health related items as well as sanitation
projects.
       Table 2 reports the results of the estimation of equation (1) for overall
infant mortality rates from 1924-1929. The first two columns present the
estimated coefficients and elasticities from regressions that include only one
public health measure; the third and fourth columns represent the results from a
single regression that includes all the activity measures and the two expenditure
measures as explanatory variables. The elasticities are calculated at the means of
the public health measures, conditioned on being positive values. All models
include state fixed effects, year fixed effects, and state-specific time trends.
       The first three rows of the table describe the effect of the financial
variables on infant mortality. The Sheppard-Towner accepted grant amount per
capita has no statistically significant impact on infant mortality rates during the
period, and in fact the estimated coefficient on this variable is positive. However,
as discussed above,the amount a state accepted from the federal government may
be a poor measure of its efforts to improve infant and child health. Although
states had to match federal funds above the initial $5000 grant, some states may
have had expenditures that exceeded the match amount.
       State spending on “child life” per 1,000 population as well as overall state
spending on health and sanitation (also per 1,000) both reduce infant mortality.
The elasticity of health and sanitation expenditures is about twice the size of that
of child life expenditures. A one standard deviation increase in child life
spending ($27) reduces infant mortality by 2.8 deaths per 1,000 live births, while
a one standard deviation increase in health and sanitation expenditures (about
$188) reduces infant mortality by 6.27 deaths. These results seem at odds with




                                          16
those of Fox (2011) who finds that public health expenditures by cities have no
effect on mortality rates once allowing for city time trends. This contrast may
reflect the fact that many of the state-level public health initiatives during this
time period -- and particularly Sheppard-Towner programs-- were targeted at rural
areas.
         Of primary interest are the effects of the different types of Sheppard-
Towner interventions on infant mortality. We report results (all per 1,000
population) for nurse visits to homes, the number of child health conferences
conducted, the number of midwives enrolled in classes, the number of public
health centers constructed, and the number of prenatal letters distributed. These
are the most common activities states engaged in using Sheppard-Towner funds,
and are consistently reported for the years 1924 to 1929. All of the estimated
coefficients with the exception of midwife classes and child health conferences
are statistically significant and generate meaningful reductions in the overall rate
of infant mortality. Looking at the magnitudes of the estimated coefficients, Table
2 shows that a one standard deviation increase in the number of home nurse visits
reduced infant mortality by about 1.8 deaths per 1,000 live births (a decrease of
about 2.6 percent when calculated at the mean of the dependent variable). A one
standard deviation increase in the number of health centers (per 1,000) lowers
infant mortality by 2.25 deaths, and a one standard deviation increase in the
number of prenatal letters distributed (an increase of 30 letters per 1,000
population) reduces infant mortality by about 0.2 deaths per 1,000 live births.
These results hold even when all the measures are included in the same regression
model (columns 3 and 4).
         These findings suggest that it was the more direct and personal
interventions that were effective in reducing infant mortality during the period.
Providing child health and prenatal clinics increased access to medical care and
instruction. Likewise, sending nurses to visit the homes of new mothers likely




                                          17
had a greater impact on the care of infants in an area than could be achieved by
holding a child health conference and inviting new mothers to attend.13 By all
accounts, the prenatal and child health conferences were well attended. Building
on the experiences during the “Children’s Year,” many states made them the
centerpiece of their maternal and infant health programs. However, even at the
time, some in the public health community questioned their effectiveness. The
staff at the conferences had limited contact with mothers and their children and
could not always assess the health challenges they faced. There was also no way
to ensure that conference attendees received the follow-up care recommended. In
the 1930s, the Wisconsin Bureau of Maternal and Child Health (MCH) decided to
only conduct conferences in counties where there were county nurses who could
follow up with families. Rural physicians, the MCH found, were often not
interested in providing preventive care and some poor families could not even
afford emergency care (Apple 2011: 175).
         Perhaps the most surprising result is the effect of prenatal letters, but these
too were more personal interventions than activities like health conferences.
These letters provided basic information about prenatal care and cost little to
distribute. Similarly, they enabled pregnant mothers to gain access to this
information at very low cost, which may help to explain their effectiveness.14
         Table 3 reports the results of estimation of equation (1) separately by race.
Panel A reports results for whites while Panel B reports results for blacks. The
story that emerges is that public health interventions had different effects on non-
white and white infant mortality. Spending on both child life and
health/sanitation reduced infant mortality for whites, but did not have statistically

13
   We can also not discount the possibility of selection bias; it could be that mothers who were
more aware of the value of hygiene were more likely to attend child health conferences than other
mothers.
14
   In results not presented, we find that the impact of prenatal letters is most pronounced in states
with larger rural populations, suggesting that it was women with limited to access to medical care
that benefited most from this intervention.




                                                 18
significant effects on the non-white infant mortality rate. For whites, a one
standard deviation increase in child life spending reduces infant mortality by 1.5
deaths per 1,000 births, while a one standard deviation increase in spending on
health and sanitation reduces infant mortality by 3.8 deaths. Strikingly, the
Sheppard-Towner grant accepted per capita has a positive and statistically
significant effect on non-white infant mortality. This could reflect an endogeneity
problem. However given the inclusion of state fixed effects and state time trends,
such a problem could only arise if the year-to-year fluctuations in non-white
infant mortality affected the amount a state accepted in federal grants. A more
likely explanation that finds support in the lack of significance of the other
spending measures is that the bulk of expenditures on public health during the
period were aimed at whites rather than non-whites.
        The data in Table 3 do indicate, however, that non-whites benefited from
certain types of Sheppard-Towner activities. Again, classes for midwives and
child health conferences appear to have no impact on either whites or non-whites.
The variable measuring public health nurse visits per 1,000 population is
statistically significant for whites, but is only marginally statistically significant
for non-whites (p-value of 0.106). Nevertheless, the estimated coefficient is much
larger in magnitude for non-whites. A one standard deviation in nurse visits per
1,000 population reduces black infant mortality by 8.7 deaths per 1,000 births (a
decrease of about 6.8 percent when calculated at the mean of black infant
mortality). For whites, the same increase generates a decrease in infant mortality
by 1.2 deaths, or 1.7 percent. We find similar results when looking at the impact
of a one standard deviation increase in the number of health centers constructed
per 1,000 population. For whites, this increase reduces infant mortality by 1.9
deaths, but the same increase reduces non-white infant mortality by 8.4 deaths per
1,000 live births. The distribution of prenatal letters reduces white infant




                                           19
mortality by 0.2 deaths per 1,000 live births, but has no statistically significant
effect on non-white infant mortality rates.
       Non-white infant mortality appears to have been more responsive to nurse
home visits and the construction of public health clinics than white infant
mortality. To the extent that even rural whites may have been better educated
about hygiene than blacks, this makes sense. In addition, since blacks had lower
literacy rates than whites, the fact that distributing pamphlets about prenatal care
did not lower black infant mortality is not surprising. According the 1920 census,
the illiteracy rate for black females ages 10 and older was 22 percent compared to
only 4 percent for white females (U.S. Census Bureau 1922, 1151). Overall, the
results do not provide support for the idea that Sheppard-Towner resources were
used to discriminate against blacks, although the results do suggest that increases
in broader categories of state spending (child life and health/sanitation) did not
reduce non-white infant mortality rates. We can only speculate as to the
mechanism underlying these differences, but one possible explanation is that
blacks were much less likely than whites to have access to quality health care
initially and thus reaped greater benefits when they finally met with physicians
and nurses (Smith 1999; Almond et al 2001; Thomasson and Treber 2008).


Discussion
       When the Sheppard-Towner act was repealed in 1929, the U.S. Children’s
Bureau strongly asserted that Sheppard-Towner was responsible for the decline in
infant mortality during the 1920s. Between the inception of Sheppard-Towner in
1922 and its repeal in 1929, the overall infant mortality rate fell from 76.2 to 67.6
deaths per 1,000 live births. To get a sense of the magnitude of the total effect of
Sheppard-Towner activities, we use the results of multi-measure regressions from
Tables 2 and 3 to calculate counterfactual infant mortality rates setting all
Sheppard-Towner activity measures to zero. We calculate lower and upper bound




                                          20
estimates. Our lower bound estimates set the outlays on conservation of child life
programs and health and sanitation to their sample means. We view these as
lower bound estimates because they assume that Sheppard-Towner grants did not
affect a state’s expenditures on child health or other public health programs. In
contrast, Moehling and Thomasson (2012) find that per capita expenditures on
child life increased approximately one for one with the per capita level of the
Sheppard-Towner grant a state received (pp. 95-96). Therefore, our upper-bound
estimates of the impact of the Sheppard-Towner program on infant mortality
reduce outlays on child life programs and health and sanitation by the sample
mean of the Sheppard-Towner grant accepted.
       Our estimates indicate that the overall mortality rate would have been
between 0.7 and 1.9 deaths per 1000 births higher in the absence of any Sheppard-
Towner activities, suggesting that Sheppard-Towner explains between 9 and 21
percent of the decline. This aggregate effect, however, is driven primarily by the
experiences of non-whites. The white infant mortality rate would have been 0.15
to 1.0 deaths higher whereas the non-white rate would have been 9.9 to 13 deaths
higher. While the non-white model is estimated with less precision so the error
bounds around this prediction are much wider than those for whites, the large
difference by race is striking. Blacks do not seem to have been excluded from
these programs and in fact, benefited more than did whites.
       Our findings suggest that the Children’s Bureau was a bit too optimistic
about the contribution of its programs to the decline in infant mortality. Much of
the decline in infant mortality in this period seems to be best explained by a
continuation of the trend that began at the turn of the century and was driven by
improvements in nutrition, water supplies, and sanitation. Nonetheless, our
results do show that a number of the activities in which states engaged using
Sheppard-Towner funds reduced infant deaths. They also point to which activities
generated the most impact, knowledge that policymakers could use to guide




                                         21
modern interventions targeted at reducing infant mortality. Specifically,
interventions that were less personal and did not provide a means to follow up
with women and children had little impact for both blacks and whites. Itinerant
health conferences, where physicians and nurses gave lectures and examined
children on a one-time basis and without means for follow-up care also did not
infant deaths On the other hand, health centers that provided women and children
with an on-going source of care, and home visits from public health nurses did
reduce infant mortality, particularly among blacks. Providing educational
literature that women could keep in their homes also reduced infant mortality, but
not among black women who were less literate.
       Further, our counterfactual calculations do not take into account any
cumulative effect of the educational programs provided by Sheppard-Towner.
The knowledge a woman gained from a home nurse visit after the birth of her first
child likely improved the health of her subsequent children as well. Moreover, to
the extent that mothers armed with new information passed this information onto
their children, subsequent generations also benefited from Sheppard-Towner.
       Unfortunately, we do not have good data on how much these specific
interventions cost, so we cannot systematically calculate a cost-benefit ratio. We
can, however, make some speculative calculations based on the pieces of data that
are available. For instance, Ohio paid its 5 public health nurses $9,000 each in
1927. Assuming that the state spent $45,000 annually on public health nursing,
the 19,146 visits by public health nurses that year would have cost $2.35 per visit
on average (Ohio Director of Finance 1927: 88). Our findings suggest that
increasing nurse visits by one standard deviation (or 23 per 1,000 population)
reduced infant mortality overall by 1.8 deaths per 1000 births. Given the
population and fertility rate of Ohio in 1927, this would mean that an additional
infant could be saved for about $1600 (about $20,400 in 2010 dollars). However,
home nurse visits were likely the most expensive type of intervention. Looking




                                        22
beyond specific interventions, we can also calculate a rough “cost per life saved”
using national data. As noted above, our estimates suggest that the various
activities carried out under Sheppard-Towner reduced infant mortality by between
0.7 and 1.9 deaths per 1000 births, thus averting between 1,518 and 4,119 deaths
in 1929 alone. Federal appropriations for Sheppard-Towner in 1929 were
$776,576.54, suggesting that one infant death could be prevented for between
$118 and $512 in federal expenditures (about $2401 and $6518 in 2010 dollars).

 Data for non-whites excludes observations from New Hampshire and Vermont. The non-white
populations in those states during the sample period were very small and for some years the non-white
infant mortality rates are reported as zero.

Notes: Annual population estimates used to calculate per capita figures were constructed by linearly
interpolating between the census years of 1920 and 1930.
