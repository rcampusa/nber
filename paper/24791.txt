                                         ABSTRACT

We show that an occupational license serves as a job market signal, similar to education in the
Spence model. In the presence of occupational licensing, we find evidence that firms rely less on
observable characteristics such as race and gender in determining employee wages. As a result,
licensed minorities and women experience smaller wage gaps than their unlicensed peers. Black
men benefit from licenses that signal non-felony status, whereas white women benefit from
licenses with a human capital requirement. Certification, a less distortionary alternative to
licensing, generates an equivalent wage premium for white men, but lower wage premiums than
licensing for women and black men.

1      Introduction

Occupational licensing requirements affect 1 in 4 workers in the United States (Gittle-
man et al., 2018). Similarly, in the European Union 22% of workers report having an
occupational license (Koumenta and Pagliero, 2018).1 In this paper we study whether an
occupational license can serve as a job market signal in a role analogous to the role played
by education in the Spence model of job market signaling (Spence, 1973).
     In the Spence model of job market signaling, and in standard models of statistical dis-
crimination, a key source of asymmetric information between firms and workers is a po-
tential employee’s productivity (Akerlof 1970; Phelps 1972; Arrow 1973; Coate and Loury
1993; Neal and Johnson 1996; Arcidiacono et al. 2010; Lang and Manove 2011). In the
absence of a sufficiently strong signal of ability, employers may rely on observable char-
acteristics such as race or gender to infer worker productivity. The literature shows that
these inferences are often inaccurate (De Tray 1982; Altonji and Pierret 2001; Goldsmith
et al. 2006; Autor and Scarborough 2008). For instance, Agan and Starr (2018) and Doleac
and Hansen (2016) show that the black-white gaps in resume callbacks and employment
increase in states where employers were restricted from including questions about worker
criminal history on job applications (“ban-the-box” states). These studies provide evi-
dence that withholding information from the labor market may exacerbate inequality. On
the other hand, we posit that occupational licensing may reduce inequality by supply-
ing information to the labor market. This is not a normative statement that occupational
licensing is a good labor market institution, but only that it is a potentially informative one.
     Using a new data set on ex-offender restrictions governing occupational licensing,
which we constructed; detailed licensing data from the Survey of Income and Program
Participation (SIPP); and data on “ban-the-box” state regulations from Doleac and Hansen
(2016), we provide evidence that occupational licensing is an informative job market sig-
nal for African-American men. The license serves as a signal of non-felony status, result-
    1 In   licensed occupations, it is illegal to work for pay without possessing a license.

ing in a higher licensing premium for African-American men in occupations that preclude
felons from having a license. In fact, the positive wage benefits of occupational licenses
with felony bans are largest for African-American men in ban-the-box states where non-
felony status is harder for employers to deduce. In addition to signaling non-felony status
for African-American men, we find that licensing reduces the wage gap between women
and white men. Some of this reduction in the gender wage gap happens through a human
capital channel: many licenses require training and women experience higher returns to
this training than do men.
   Since we do not have an instrument for licensing, we seriously consider a series of
alternative explanations for why racial and gender wages gaps are lower among licensed
workers than unlicensed workers. We show that the returns to occupational licenses that
signal non-felony status for African-American men are not driven by selection of edu-
cated African-American men into licensed occupations with felony restrictions (as op-
posed to licensed occupations without such restrictions) or by differentially higher re-
turns to human capital in licensed occupations with felony restrictions. Moreover, it is
not due to differentially higher returns to African-American men in public sector work,
labor unions or occupations with a high fraction of white workers – all job and individual
characteristics associated with higher wages.
   One limitation of our study is that it relies on cross-sectional variation in licensing laws
and ex-offender restrictions to identify the impact of licensing on gender and racial wage
gaps. Although Pizzola and Tabarrok (2017) show that the cross-sectional estimates of
the wage effects of licensing mirror the true causal effects that they obtain from a natural
experiment, we were still worried that our results could be affected by selection bias,
measurement error, or both. In fact, these are the two most common criticisms of studies
of the wage impacts of occupational licensing.
   To control for selection on unobservables, we exploit the richness of SIPP data relative
to other licensing data sets and construct a set of new proxies for unobserved ability, which


                                              3
is potentially the most serious source of endogeneity in our setup. We show that our
proxies of unobserved ability are positively correlated with wages and that they influence
the licensing decision; however, controlling flexibly for unobserved ability using these
proxies does not change our main result, which is that occupational licenses reduce the
racial wage gap among men through signaling non-felony status for African-American
men. We also directly control for a self-reported measure of a worker’s taste for licensing
and this does not change our results.
   To test for the effect of measurement error in the licensing variable on our results we:
(i) control for the match quality of each felony occupation observation using data from an
occupation matching algorithm, (ii) include a dummy variable for partially licensed occu-
pations in our regression, (iii) drop all partially licensed occupations from our regression,
and (iv) run a series of placebo tests in which we randomize the licensing attainment vari-
ables, keeping the fraction of licensed workers constant at first the national level, then the
state level and finally the state-by-occupation level. The battery of tests that we perform
convince us that our results provide evidence that occupational licensing is a labor market
signal that reduces statistical discrimination faced by African-American men.
   A compelling alternative to occupational licensing proposed in Friedman (1962) is cer-
tification. Under a certification regime, there is open entry into the occupation with the
caveat that only workers who have passed a set of requirements for certification (typically
set by a private body) can use the professional title accompanying the certification.2 Con-
sistent with Friedman’s hypothesis, we find that there is no difference in the wage gains
from licenses relative to the wage gains from certifications for white men. For women and
African-American men, however, depending on the human capital and felony context of
the license, we find that the wage gains to having an occupational license are significantly
larger than the wage gains of having just a certificate. This is not to suggest that occupa-
tional licensing is the only way or the best way to reduce wage inequality.
  2 Forexample, any worker can engage in book-keeping activities but only workers who have passed the
Uniform Certified Public Accountant Examination can refer to themselves as an “accountant.”

2     Related Literature

According to the market power story of Adam Smith and Milton Friedman, occupational
licensing creates economic rents through a quantity restriction on the labor supply (Smith
1937; Friedman 1962; Kleiner and Krueger 2013; Thornton and Timmons 2013). An al-
ternative view is that occupational licensing increases wages because it imposes a quality
restriction on the labor supply (Leland 1979; Ronnen 1991; Anderson et al. 2016; Deming
et al. 2016), and the wage premium earned by licensed workers reflects the higher average
quality of licensed workers relative to their unlicensed peers.3
    Our work contributes to the empirical literature on statistical discrimination and black-
white labor market disparities. Our results on the wage premium for black men in occu-
pations that ban felons provide further evidence that reducing asymmetric information
between firms and workers can reduce racial wage and employment disparities (De Tray,
1982; Holzer et al., 2006; Agan and Starr, 2018; Miller, 2016). Recent studies of ban-the-
box efforts, which remove criminal check-boxes from job applications, focus on the role of
asymmetric information on the probability of employment (extensive margin), but here
we focus on the effect of asymmetric information on wages (intensive margin) (Shoag and
Veuger, 2016; Agan and Starr, 2018). A notable exception is Wozniak (2015), who looks at
both the intensive and extensive margin effects of increased drug testing on employment
and wages, and De Tray (1982), who showed that veteran status confers a higher wage
premium to black veterans than to white veterans, because of firm screening on veteran
status.
    Our work is related to the work of Neal and Johnson (1996) who were the first to show
that the racial wage gap among men is eliminated after controlling for Armed Forces
Qualification Test (AFQT) scores as a measure of ability. This finding was modified in
Lang and Manove (2011), where the authors found that the racial wage gap among men
    3 Friedman  (1962) was skeptical of this view, arguing that restricting supply necessarily restricts the
potential for labor specialization within an occupation and hence diminishes quality.



                                                     5
persisted after controlling for both level of education and AFQT scores, since conditional
on AFQT scores African-American men have higher levels of education than white men.
In this literature on black-white earnings inequality, our paper is most similar to Arcidi-
acono et al. (2010), who show that African-American men with college degrees do not
face a racial wage penalty relative to their white peers whereas African-American men
with a high school diploma, or less, do. To complete the analogy with Arcidiacono et al.
(2010), occupational licenses that restrict felons in our study play the same wage equal-
izing and ability revelation role for African-American men as does college completion in
their study.
    We also contribute to the literature on measuring the licensing premium. Kleiner and
Krueger (2010) and Kleiner and Krueger (2013) provided the first such measures of the
licensing premium using nationally representative data – an approach in the literature
that they pioneered by doing the important work of collecting primary survey data and
making it publicly available.4 The most recent measurement is the estimated premium of
7% in Gittleman et al. (2018), which is an average premium across both race and gender.
Breaking out the licensing premium by race and gender, we find that the licensing pre-
mium for white women (12%), black women (15%), and black men (14%), is higher than
the licensing premium for white men (4%). This heterogeneity in the licensing premiums
is responsible for the smaller wage gaps among licensed women and minorities when
compared to the wage gaps experienced by their unlicensed peers.
    Law and Marks (2009) empirically tested the impact of licensing on female and mi-
nority labor force participation using individual-level data spanning nine decades: (1870-
1960). They found that licensing increased the employment of black and female workers
in skilled occupations including engineers, pharmacists, plumbers, and registered and
practical nurses. Looking at a more recent sample, we find negative labor supply effects
of licensing for both white workers but weaker evidence for negative labor supply effect
   4A notable exception to the literature of positive wage effects of licensing is Redbird (2017). She finds a
negative effect of licensing on wages and a positive effect of licensing on employment.

of licensing on black workers (Blair and Chung, 2018).
    Our work also contributes to the theoretical literature on occupational licensing by
providing an analytically tractable model of licensing as a job market signal in the spirit
of Spence (1973). The standard model of occupational licensing is Leland (1979), which
studied licensing from an optimal legislation vantage point. Whereas Leland (1979) fo-
cused on whether it is socially optimal to have quality standards, Persico (2015) studied
the incentives of incumbent workers to impose occupational requirements for new en-
trants. We build a micro-founded model in which the licensing decision of workers and
the wages offered by firms are endogenous outcomes of a two-period sequential screen-
ing game played by firms and workers.



3    A Screening Model of Occupational Licensing

Our model is a two-sector, two-period model of firms and workers, consisting of a unit
measure of risk neutral workers and an occupational licensing requirement for workers
in sector 1. but not sector 2. In each sector there is a single representative firm. Firms
do not observe a worker’s ability but firms do observe whether a worker has a license or
not. Because licensing is costly and more easily accessible for workers of higher ability, an
occupational license acts as a signal of ability in an analogous way to education in Spence
(1973).
    In period 1, firms set wages to maximize profits, namely ω L for the licensed sector
and ωU for the unlicensed sector. In period 2, workers choose the sector that delivers
the highest utility given the wages offered by firms and given the relative preferences of
workers over employment in the two sectors. The equilibrium of the model is a vector
of wages (ω L∗ , ωU
                  ∗ ) and fraction of licensed workers f ∗ that satisfy the utility maximiza-


tion motive of workers and the profit-maximizing motive of firms. Because firms, which
are the uninformed party in our model, move first, our model falls under the technical


                                             7
definition of a screening model (Stiglitz and Weiss, 1990).



3.1       Description of Workers’ Tastes and Abilities

Each worker, indexed by the subscript i, is endowed with an ability ai and a relative taste
for the unlicensed sector ei . The ability type and the relative sector preference are inde-
pendently and identically distributed across workers and drawn from the following two
uniform distributions: ai ∼ U [µ a − σa , µ a + σa ] and ei ∼ U [µe − σe , µe + σe ]. We assume
uniform distributions for the sake of analytical tractability. The sector taste parameters
µe and σe , are measured in units of dollars so that they enter the worker’s utility func-
tion on the same footing as wages. The ability and preference distribution are allowed to
be different for workers of different racial and gender groups. For notational simplicity,
however, we suppress the group index and solve the model separately for each group.
   Obtaining an occupational license is costly for workers of all abilities. To obtain an
occupational license, a worker of ability ai incurs a cost:


                                             c ( a i ) = c0 − θ ( a i − µ a ).              (1)


The parameter c0 > 0 is the unconditional average cost of obtaining an occupational
license for workers of a given group.5 For example, the average cost of obtaining a license
in an occupation with a felony restriction will be higher on average for workers from
groups that face higher incarceration rates. The parameter θ is the marginal benefit of
ability. Each unit increase in ability lowers the cost of licensing by an amount θ. For ability
measures that make it easier for a worker to obtain an occupational license (e.g., I.Q.) we
will assume a positive marginal benefit of ability (i.e., θ > 0). For ability measures such as
a worker’s level of criminality or criminal history, which make obtaining an occupational
license more difficult, we assume a negative marginal benefit of ability (i.e., θ < 0).
  5 It   is also the cost of licensing for the worker of average ability ai = µ a .



                                                            8
    In the unlicensed sector, a worker i receives utility VU,i , which is the sum of the wages
earned in the unlicensed sector, ωU , and the relative taste that she has for the unlicensed
sector ei :
                                               VU,i = ωU + ei .                                        (2)

In the licensed sector, a worker i receives utility VL,i , which is the difference between the
wages earned in the licensed sector, ω L , and the cost, c( ai ), that she incurred in order to
obtain the license:
                                       VL,i = ω L − [c0 − θ ( ai − µ a )].                             (3)



3.2    Firms

Each firm, j, possesses a technology that converts one unit of worker ability into ω̄ dollars
worth of goods. In the licensed sector, j = 1, the occupational license is also bundled with
an exogenous level of useful human capital (training) 0 ≤ h ≤ 1, which augments the
worker’s ability to utilize the technology by a factor of (1 + h).6 The expected profit for
the representative firm in the licensed occupation is given by:

where E[ ai | Li = 1] is the expected ability of a worker conditional on employment in the
licensed sector and E[ P( Li = 1| ai )] is the fraction of workers in the licensed sector. The
expected profit for the representative firm in the unlicensed occupation is given by:


                  E[π2 ] = ω̄ × E[ ai | Li = 0] × E[ P( Li = 0| ai )] − ωU E[ P( Li = 0| ai )],        (5)

   6 The   cost of acquiring this human capital is borne by the workers as in equation (1).

the unlicensed sector, and E[ P( Li = 0| ai )] is the fraction of workers employed in the
unlicensed sector.

Proof. See Appendix.

    If c0 ≥ c̄, it is not worthwhile to have a license even for the highest ability workers,
hence all workers pool on not having a license, i.e., f ∗ = 0. If the cost of licensing is
sufficiently low, i.e., c0 ≤ c, then licensing is cost-effective even for the lowest ability type
and all workers pool on having a license, i.e., f ∗ = 1. In between these two extremes, we
have an interior solution in which a fraction, 0 < f ∗ < 1, of the workers select into the
licensed sector.

   It makes sense that the higher the cost of licensing, the costlier it is for lower ability
workers to obtain the license and hence the stronger the signaling value of the occupa-
tional license. In the empirical section of the paper, we will think of felony restrictions as
imposing a differentially higher cost of licensing on workers from groups that face higher
average rates of incarceration – in particular black men. We will find that it is primarily in
the occupations where there is a restriction on ex-offenders that the occupational license
provides a larger licensing premium to black men than white men. Moreover, we will
find that the signaling value of these licenses will be largest for black men in states where
firms are not allowed to ask about criminal history on job applications.

Proposition 3. The licensing premium is increasing in the level of human capital bundled with the
license (h), if the licensing premium is less than 100%. The licensing premium is unambiguously
decreasing in the average ability of workers (µ a ).

Proof. See Appendix.

   Intuitively, the more human capital that is bundled with the license, the higher the
marginal product of labor and hence the higher the equilibrium wage. Moreover, the
license is more informative when the expected ability of the worker is lower; hence the
higher premium.

Proposition 4. Define the industry surplus as the sum of firm profits and worker wages net of
the licensing cost. The industry surplus is maximized by a non-negative average cost of licensing:

                                                1
                                        c0∗ =     (c̄ + hω̄µ a ) .                           (10)
                                                2

Proof. See Appendix.

                                                     11
    The intuition for this result is similar to the intuition for the result in Spence (1973)
— a license is informative because it is costly; therefore, in a market with workers of het-
erogeneous abilities, an occupational license functions as a labor market signal that is the
result of workers sorting on unobserved ability.7



4     Data & Descriptive Statistics

Our data comes from Wave 13 to Wave 16 of the SIPP 2008 Panel.8 To select our sam-
ple, we follow the criterion adopted by Gittleman et al. (2018). Our sample is restricted
to individuals between the ages of 18 and 64 who have an implied hourly wage of be-
tween $5 and $100.9 We dropped observations with imputed wages and imputed license
status because using imputed wages would bias our estimates of the license premium
toward zero since license status is not included in the imputation process (Hirsch and
Schumacher, 2004).
    To test our felony hypothesis, we supplement SIPP with a new data set which we
assembled using a database from the Criminal Justice Section of the American Bar As-
sociation (ABA) that contains the universe of license restrictions that felons face when
applying for an occupational license in each occupation and in each state of the US. In
total there are 16,343 such restrictions. We organize legal felony restrictions into three
categories: those imposing a permanent ban on felons from ever having an occupational
license, those imposing a temporary ban on felons, and those imposing no ban at all on
a felon’s ability to hold an occupational license.10 For each state-occupation pair, if there
    7 One important caveat here is that the industry surplus differs from the typical social surplus in that
it abstracts from the welfare loss experienced by customers from higher prices. In this respect, this wel-
fare calculation is closer in spirit to the producer surplus in Persico (2015), where the goal is to determine
whether firms and incumbent workers, acting collusively, benefit from licensing, given that workers will
endure the cost of licensing.
    8 The occupational licensing topical module of the SIPP was conducted during Wave 13.
    9 The hourly wage is implied by the monthly earnings of the main job, hours worked per week, and

number of weeks worked in that month.
   10 Most of the bans involve denying applications and suspending current license holders.

are multiple offenses that result in different consequences for licensing eligibility, we code
our felony variable to correspond to the most severe punishment. This biases us against
finding different effects between the most severe category (i.e., permanent ban) and the
least severe category (i.e., no ban). In essence, our felony results are by construction a
lower bound on the true felony effects.11
    In creating this new data set, we use an online tool developed by the Department of
Labor, O*net SOC auto coder, and a web-scraping application to sort each of the 16,343
citations into correct 6-digit SOC codes. Figure 1 illustrates, for each state, the number
of bans affecting a felon’s ability to hold an occupational license. Ohio, the most restric-
tive state, has 83 such bans: 59 permanent and 24 temporary. The least restrictive state,
Wyoming, has 23 such bans: 13 permanent and 10 temporary.12 Figure 2 illustrate the
extent of occupational licensing of any type across the U.S.



4.1    Summary Statistics

In Table I, we report a summary of the demographic and wage data for workers who
are unlicensed, licensed in occupations without felony bans, licensed in occupations with
felony bans, and workers who are certified. Overall, when compared to unlicensed work-
ers, workers who are licensed are on average older, more educated, more likely to be
female, self-employed, and working in a service industry or for the government. More-
over, on average, workers with a license earn more than unlicensed workers of the same
race and gender. In particular, workers in occupations with felony bans outearn workers
in occupations with licensing requirements that do not exclude felons. When we cut the
data by race and gender, in Table II, a similar pattern emerges for white men, black men,
  11 For  example in New Jersey there are 4 legal citations for offenses that would affect an attorney’s eligi-
bility to practice law. Since “suspend attorney for any felony permanently and without discretion” is one
of the four consequences, we code the attorney occupation in NJ as one with a permanent ban on felons.
   12 Felons are barred from holding licenses as truck drivers in every state, while felons are restricted from

being nursing aides in 48 states. Eight of the 10 most restricted occupations involve the licensee as a direct
personal advocate or helper of the customer. The remaining two concern the operation of motor vehicles.

white women, and black women: increasing mean wages for licensed workers relative
to their unlicensed counterparts. The unconditional licensing premiums in occupations
without felony bans are: 15% for white men, 24% for black men, 32% for white women,
and 38% for black women (Table II). For each group, except for black women, the uncon-
ditional licensing premium is higher yet in occupations with felony restrictions.



5     Empirical Specification

The goal of our empirical model is to estimate the occupational license premium, allow-
ing for heterogeneity by race and gender. Given the estimates of the model, we test
whether occupational licensing reduces or exacerbates the wage gap between white men
and the three other demographic groups that we study: black men, white women, and
black women. We also test whether the source of any changes in the racial and gender
earning gaps is due to the reduction in asymmetric information in the labor market or
due to heterogeneity in the returns to human capital, skills, or training that is bundled
with the occupational license.
    In our full specification, we estimate the following wage regression:


    log(wageijsm ) =τ0 + τ1 BMi + τ2 WFi + τ3 BFi

                     +τ4 licensei + τ5 licensei × BMi + τ6 licensei × WFi + τ7 licensei × BFi

                                                    Baseline Model

                     + τ8 bani + τ9 bani × BMi + τ10 bani × WFi + τ11 bani × BFi

                     + τ12 hcapi + τ13 hcapi × BMi + τ14 hcapi × WFi + τ15 hcapi × BFi

                     +ΓXi + θs + θo + θm +eijsm
                     |       {z        }
                            Controls


The dependent variable is the log of hourly wages for individual i working in profession
j in state s in month m. The indicators BMi , WFi , and BFi equal 1 if individual i is a black



                                              14
man, white woman or black woman, respectively. X is a vector of standard demographic
characteristics including a quadratic in age, education levels (indicators for high school
dropout, some college degree, college graduate, and post-graduate), indicators for union
membership, government workers, and self-employment. θS , θm , and θO are state, month,
and occupation fixed effects. In our context, profession j is defined by 6-digit SOC code
while occupation o is defined by a 3-digit SOC code.13 We also include a separate indica-
tor for certified workers, i.e., workers whose credential is issued by a private body. When
we compare the licensing and certification premiums, we fully interact our certification
indicator with our race and gender dummies.
    Our empirical model is similar to Wozniak (2015) in that we have mutually exclusive
indicators for each racial and gender group. This specification facilitates clear compar-
isons of racial and gender wage gaps by licensing regime. The parameters τ1 , τ2 , and
τ3 represent the mean wage gap between unlicensed white men and unlicensed black
men, white women, and black women (respectively). The license indicator equals 1 if the
worker reports having a license that is required for his/her current or most recent job, and
the ban indicator equals 1 if the worker reports a license and working in a profession that
has mandatory bans against felons. The indicator hcapi equals 1 if the worker reports
that a license has a human capital requirement such as continuous education, training,
or an exam.14 Therefore, τ4 indicates the license premium in non-banned professions for
white men while the parameters τ5 to τ7 capture the heterogeneity of license premium in
  13 In  the SOC, there are twenty-three 2-digit major groups. Each 2-digit major SOC group in turn has de-
tailed 3-digit SOC subgroups that contain professions with similar characteristics. Each 3-digit occupation
code can further be dis-aggregated to collection of occupations with 6-digit SOC numbers. For example,
the 2-digit SOC group (21) “Community and Social Service Occupations” nests the 3-digit sub group (21-1)
“Counselors, Social Workers, and Other Community and Social Service Specialists.” This 3-digit subgroup
in turn contains two separate 6-digit SOC codes for “Social Worker” (21-1020) and “Counsellor” (21-1020).
Our occupation fixed effects are based on the 3-digit detailed subgroups, whereas our licensing variable is
reported as a 6-digit SOC value. The license premium that we estimate is thus estimated by comparing the
wages of workers in the same occupation who work in states that vary in whether a license is required to
practice said occupation. We also test that our estimates are robust to including 6-digit occupation fixed
effects.
   14 In the regression analysis we will specify which human capital requirement we control for in the re-

gression.



                                                    15
non-banned professions for black men, white women, and black women. The parameters
τ8 to τ11 refer to the additional license premiums from working in banned professions.
Likewise the parameters τ12 to τ15 capture the additional license premiums from work-
ing in licensed occupations where obtaining the license is bundled with a human capital
requirement. For example, the expected license premium for black men in a profession
without felony restrictions equals τ4 + τ5 while the license premium for black men in oc-
cupations with felony restrictions equals τ4 + τ5 + τ8 + τ9 . All standards errors that we
report are clustered at the state level.



6     Results

6.1    Occupational Licensing Reduces Gender and Racial Wage Gaps

In Table III we present the results from our baseline wage regression. In column (1), we
first estimate the license premium using a specification in which we do not distinguish
between licenses in occupations with felony bans and licenses in occupations with no
felony ban. Under this specification, the license premium for white men is 7.5%, whereas
the license premium for black men equals 12.5%. White women and black women also
receive higher license premiums than white men: 13.7% and 15.9%, respectively.15 The
returns to occupational licensing are uniformly higher for women and minorities when
compared to white men; moreover, this results in a reduction in both the racial and gen-
der wage gaps for licensed workers when compared to the gender and racial wage gaps
experienced by their unlicensed counterparts.
    The gender wage gaps for unlicensed white women and unlicensed black women,
when compared to unlicensed white men, are 15.1% and 23.3% (respectively), and the
racial wage gap between unlicensed black men and unlicensed white men is 11.6%. By
  15 Gittleman et al. (2018), who employed the same data set, and further pooled their license premiums

across both race and gender, found an average license premium of 7.57%.



                                                  16
contrast, the gender wage gap for licensed white women is 40% lower, while that for
licensed black women is 36% lower, and the racial wage gap for licensed black men is
43% lower. In fact, we cannot reject the null hypothesis of no wage gap between licensed
black men and licensed white men.
    In cases of estimating heterogeneous effects Solon et al. (2015) recommend reporting
the results from both unweighted and weighted regressions. The results that we have
presented so far are from the unweighted regressions. In Table IV, we present the results
using the survey sample weights. Consistent with the empirical guidance in Solon et al.
(2015), we find that the regression results for the unweighted and weighted specifications
are most dissimilar when there is unmodeled heterogeneity. For example, when we regress
the log of wages on license status without accounting for whether the licensed occupation
permanently bans felons, we find an insignificant positive effect of licensing on the wages
of white women in our weighted specification. In our unweighted specification, which
we first reported, we find a positive significant effect of licensing on white women’s wages.
After including interactions to account for heterogeneity in the licensing premiums due
to the existence of permanent felony bans, we find a positive significant effect of licensing
on white women’s wages in both the weighted an unweighted samples.16 In our partic-
ular case, in the presence of unmodeled heterogeneity, we find that the results from the
unweighted regression are more stable as we add more heterogeneity.
    Continuing with the unweighted regressions in remainder of our results sections has
two expository advantages relative to using the weighted regressions. First, the results in
the base case with unmodeled heterogeneity closely parallel the final results in the model
with richer heterogeneity. Second, the point estimates are more precisely estimated, as
noted in Solon et al. (2015). This is important for what we will do next. In the follow-
  16 The  same is true when we look at the license premium for black men: for the weighted regressions,
the black male license premium flips sign from negative to positive as we go from the base case to the case
with the permanent felony ban interactions. The sign on the coefficient for the black male license premium
for the unweighted regressions, by contrast, maintains a positive sign in both specifications. Moreover,
it is similar in magnitude to the coefficient from the weighted regressions with the permanent felony ban
interactions included in the model.


                                                    17
ing sections we decompose the relative wages gains to occupational licensing into two
primary channels: the license as a signal of non-felony status, and the license as a sup-
plement to the human capital of workers. One way to think of this is that in subsequent
sections we add other components of the occupational license, which as of now, are un-
modeled heterogeneity. When we reach our most saturated regression model in Section
7, which includes interactions for felony restrictions, human capital bundled with the li-
cense, and new individual level variables, which allow us to account for selection into
licensing for personal reasons, we will again report both the results from the weighted
regression and the unweighted regression, following the guidance in Solon et al. (2015).
We will find that for this fully-saturated model that the results are very similar. Moreover,
we include all of the results from the weighted regressions in the online appendix to the
paper for the reader to see how weighting the results affects the magnitude and signs of
the coefficients that we estimate for the intermediate results.



6.2      License Signals Non-Felony Status for African-American Men

When we categorize licenses into those with felony bans and those without felony bans,
we find that all workers in occupations with felony bans earn more than their counter-
parts in licensed occupations without felony restrictions. As reported in column (2) of
Table III, white men in banned occupations earn an additional 3.2% wage premium, black
men earn a 16.4% wage premium on top of this baseline premium earned by white men,
for an overall total of 19.6%. The additional wage premium for white women in occupa-
tions with felony restrictions is 1.6 p.p. less than the wage premium of their white male
counterparts.17 Likewise, black women in occupations that bar felons experience an addi-
tional wage premium that is 0.4 p.p. smaller than the wage premium of their white male
counterparts.
   When we further refine our definition of occupations with felony bans to include only
 17 We   use the abbreviation p.p. for percentage points.


                                                     18
those occupations with permanent bans on felons, the wage gains for women in banned
occupations are erased.18 Under both measurements of felony bans in column (2) and
(3) of Table III, we find that men, in particular black men, benefit from the positive non-
felony signal of an occupational license. In fact, black men in occupations with felony bans
earn, on average 5% more than their white male counterparts. By contrast, black men in
licensed occupations without permanent felony bans earn 10.4% less than white men. This
result is consistent with a key prediction of our model in Section 3: licensed workers from
a demographic group that faces a higher average cost of licensing earns higher wages, ce-
teris paribus. Because black men are 6 times more likely to have a felony record than white
men, felony restrictions on occupational licenses impose a higher average cost burden on
black men than white men.
    If the licensing premium experienced by black men is due to the license as a signal of
non-felony status, then this signal ought to be more valuable in states with “ban-the-box”
laws that make it illegal for employers to ask job applicants about their criminal history.
To test this theory, we regress wages on worker characteristics, as in our main regression
specification, and allow for the wage premium for licenses that bar felons to be different in
states with ban-the-box laws and states without these laws.19 As reported in Figure 3, we
find that the licensing premium in occupations with felony restrictions is 3 times larger
for black men in states with ban-the-box laws as compared to those in states without
these laws. Moreover, in states where firms can legally ask about a worker’s criminal
history, the wage premium for occupational licenses that preclude felons is statistically
indistinguishable from zero for workers of all types – not just black men.
    Moreover, if the licensing premium experienced by black men is due to the license
as a signal of non-felony status, then this signal ought to be more valuable to smaller
  18 As reported in column 3 of Table III, white women in licensed occupations with permanent felony bans

earn 0.4 p.p. less than white women in licensed occupations without permanent felony bans. Similarly,
black women in licensed occupations with permanent felony bans earn 1.4 p.p. less than black women in
licensed occupations without permanent felony bans.
   19 In this regression, we also include a control for a proxy of unobservable ability, which we explain the

in robustness section of the paper.


                                                     19
firms than larger firms. The key idea behind this test is that larger firms will have better
employee screening technology than smaller firms and hence should be less reliant on
the occupational licensing as a substitute for background checks by the firm.20 We test
for evidence of firm screening by looking at whether the license premium for black men
in occupations that preclude felons decreases in firm size. In Table V, we split the sample
into different firm sizes. As shown from column (1) to (4), when firm size gets larger
(> 100), the additional ban premium for black men is at first stable, at around 22%, then
begins to fall off monotonically for firms with > 500 and > 1000 employees.


6.2.1   Exploring Alternative Explanations

The wage premium for black men in occupations with felony bans is very large, so natu-
rally we were concerned that the occupations with felony bans were different from those
without felony bans in ways that could explain this very large wage premium. For ex-
ample, we were concerned that states with felony restrictions on occupational licenses
have higher instances of black-white discrepancies in arrests, which could have caused
the felony restrictions in the first place. We were also concerned that occupations with
felony restrictions were disproportionately in government jobs, where wage discrimina-
tion is more closely monitored because of the strict enforcement of anti-discrimination
employment laws (Miller, 2016). In light of Goldin’s pollution theory of discrimination,
we were also concerned that felony restrictions would be more likely to appear in occu-
pations with a higher fraction of white workers as a means of shielding white workers
from competition with black workers (Goldin, 2014). Likewise, we were concerned that
   20 Victor et al. (2012) conducted a study on the use of criminal background checks in hiring decisions.

Their sample includes 544 randomly selected firms from the membership of the Society for Human Re-
sources Management. The study indicated that 52% of small firms (<100 employees), 31% of medium firms
(100 to 499 employees), and 17% of large firms (>2,500 employees) did not conduct background checks for
all job candidates. Firms may not perform background checks on all job applicants for at least three rea-
sons: (i) each background check is costly and total cost scales with the number of applicants rather than the
number of job openings, (ii) background checks by private services are susceptible to human error, and (iii)
some states have restrictions on using criminal records in the job search process (US Department of Labor
2001; Cavico et al. 2014).



                                                     20
bans might appear in union jobs where wages are naturally higher, on average, and dif-
ferentially so for black men.
   In Table VI, we test these competing hypotheses by running four separate regressions
in which we control for heterogeneous returns to wages by race and gender of: (i) the
differences in the log of the disparity in arrest rates between blacks and whites, (ii) the
fraction of whites in the worker’s current occupation, (iii) whether the worker is em-
ployed by the government, and (iv) the worker’s union status. Our key finding here is
that the wage premium experienced by black men in occupations with felony restrictions
is robust even after controlling for these four factors. Previously we found a wage pre-
mium of 18.9% for black men in licensed occupations with felony restrictions when we
did not control for these factors. After controlling for these factors, the estimated wage
premium for black men in licensed occupations with felony restrictions ranges from 17%
to 19%. To put this licensing premium into context, it is 24% larger than the premium that
black men earn from working in the public sector and one third smaller than the union
wage premium for black men. It is also equivalent to the wage increase associated with
working in an occupation that is 30% whiter than his current occupation. Most strikingly,
the wage premium for black men in licensed occupations with felony bans is equivalent
to the wage gains that a black man would earn due to moving from a state where black
men are 6 times more likely to be arrested than white men to a state where white men are
1.7 times more likely to be arrested than black men.
   As an additional check on our results, we also test whether heterogeneous returns to
education can rule out the ban premium that we estimate. In Table I, we saw that the
fraction of workers with a college degree was higher in licensed occupations with felony
restrictions when compared to licensed occupations without felony restrictions and unli-
censed workers.21 In Table VII we run three separate wage regressions — one for licensed
  21 The education gradient is even steeper for the fraction of workers with postgraduate degrees. Workers
in licensed occupations with felony restrictions are 1.5 times more likely to have postgraduate training
than workers in licensed occupations without felony restrictions and more than 3 times as likely to have
postgraduate training when compared to unlicensed workers.


                                                   21
workers in occupations with felony bans, one for licensed workers in occupations with-
out felony bans, and one for unlicensed workers. As our education control, we include
a dummy variable postHS, which equals one if the worker has postsecondary education,
and zero otherwise. In the regressions we also include interactions between this dummy
variable and race and gender, which allows for heterogeneous returns to education by
race and gender. While black men in licensed occupations with felony restrictions earn
on average 7% higher wages than white men, we find no evidence for higher returns to
education for black men relative to white men. The estimated coefficient on the interac-
tion between postHS and the indicator variable for black male is -0.36% and statistically
insignificant.



6.3      Returns to the Human Capital Bundled with Licenses

In addition to signaling felony status, licensing can affect worker wages and racial and
gender wage gaps through a human capital channel. Occupational licensing, because it is
costly, can signal unobserved ability. Moreover, some occupational licenses require work-
ers to undergo training, pass an exam,22 or engage in continuing education as a condition
of obtaining and maintaining the license. We think of training and continuing education
requirements of licenses as primary observable forms of human capital for which work-
ers may be compensated. Heterogeneity in the returns these observable forms of human
capital by race and gender could arise if firms believe that there are differences in the
underlying stock of this human capital by race and gender.
   In Table VIII we regress log wages on licensing and on controls for whether the license
has a training requirement, a continuous education requirement, and a mandated exami-
nation. Comparing the results of these three regressions in columns (2)-(4) with the results
from the baseline regression model in column (1), we find that training and continuous
  22 Pagliero   (2010) showed that there is a positive correlation between wages and the difficulty of licensing
exams.



                                                        22
education account for some of the license premium that we estimate in the baseline model
for all workers. White men in licensed occupations with training requirements earn 4.2%
more than white men in licensed occupations with no training requirements. The license
training premiums are higher still for black men (7.1%), white women (7.9%), and black
women (6.2%). As shown in column (5) of Table VIII, these results are similar when we
control for the skill content of the occupations using the occupation-specific skill indexes
developed by the Occupational Information Network (O*NET).23
     When taken together, these results suggest that differentially higher returns for women
and minorities to the human capital that is bundled with licensing is in part responsible
for the narrowing of the racial and gender wage gaps that we document. To be clear, all
workers, including white men, earn a wage premium because of the training and contin-
uous education undertaken to obtain a license.24



7       Robustness: Unobserved Ability & Measurement Error

7.1      New Proxies for Unobserved Ability

A key concern in any Mincer wage regression is that the estimated returns could be biased
due to unobserved ability (Ashenfelter and Rouse, 1998). We are particularly sensitive to
this concern because in the model section of our paper, the decision to obtain a license
    23 Thisdata uses comprehensive information on worker skills in each 6-digit occupation that is devel-
oped by occupational analysts using the information from a randomly selected pool of incumbent workers.
The skill attributes are: content skills which include reading, listening, writing, speaking, mathematics,
and science; process skills which include critical thinking, active learning, learning strategy, and moni-
toring; complex skills which refer to complex problem solving; social skills which include coordination,
instructing, negotiation, persuasion, service orientation, and social perceptiveness; system skills which
include judging and decision making, systems analysis, and systems evaluation; resource management
skills which include time and management of financial. material, and personal resources; technical skills
which include equipment maintenance and selection, installation, operation control and monitoring, oper-
ations analysis, programming, quality control analysis, repairing, technology design, and troubleshooting.
To ensure that the measures accurately reflect workers’ job requirements in our sample, we use the July
2014 version, which is contemporaneous with our extract of the SIPP data.
   24 Passing an exam to qualify for a license appears to have a significant impact only on the wages of white

women.



                                                     23
is driven by the positive returns to licensing and the fact that more skilled workers, on
average, face a lower cost of licensing. In the data, we observe whether an individual
pursued advanced math, advanced science and advanced English classes in high school.
We construct a proxy for unobserved ability by regressing each of these choices to pursue
advanced course work on observable individual characteristics excluding the licensing de-
cision. In Figure 4, we plot histograms for each of the ability proxies that we constructed,
including a histogram of the sum of ability measures.
    From Table, IX we note that all 3 ability measures are positively correlated. As ex-
pected, the correlation between unobserved math ability and unobserved science ability
(0.63) is stronger than the correlation between unobserved English ability and unobserved
science ability (0.38). Although all three ability measures are positively correlated, con-
trolling for all three in a regression of licensing on proxies for unobserved ability in Table
X reveals that each ability measure induces different variation in the observed licensing
decision. This is also evident in Figures 5 – 7, where we present non-parametric bin scat-
ter plots of the licensing decisions of workers against our proxy of unobserved ability.25
Moreover, we find that higher ability is associated with higher wages, which suggest that
our proxy is capturing useful wage variation in the data. A worker of average math or
English ability earns 2%-3% higher wages than a worker of the lowest ability (Table XI).
This ability wage premium is non-trivial. In fact, it is comparable to returns to licensing
for a white man in an occupation with no human capital requirement or restriction on
felons.
    After controlling for ability in Table XI, we find that the returns to occupational licens-
ing for white men look similar to our baseline results with no ability controls. For black
  25 For example, science ability is positively and significantly correlated with the decision to obtain a li-
cense, whereas math ability is negatively and significantly correlated with this licensing decision and En-
glish ability is not significantly associated with licensing (column 1). By contrast, the decision to select an
occupational license that has a continuous education requirement is positively and significantly correlated
with both English and science ability, but not significantly correlated with math ability (column 3). The
decision to pursue a license for personal reasons, which is a variable reported in the SIPP and a proxy for
relative taste for the licensed sector (µe ), is not significantly correlated with any of the three ability measures
(column 4).


                                                        24
men in occupations with felony restrictions, controlling for unobserved ability, in column
(2), results in an increase in the differential licensing premium of 0.9 percentage points
relative to white men in similar occupations. This is the largest change of any of the point
estimates. The overall licensing premium for black men in occupations with felony re-
strictions increases by 0.5 p.p.26 The returns to licensing for women in licenses of all types
change by 0.1-0.3 p.p. with the ability controls. When we add 5th order polynomials in
all three ability types, as a way of accounting for any non-linearity in the relationship
between our ability proxies and wages, we find similar results to our linear specification
(column 3).27 From this exercise we learn that controlling for ability yields a positive
wage return to ability but does not alter the licensing wage premiums that we previously
estimated. Moreover, these new proxies for unobserved ability that we develop can be
used by other researchers to study the effect of unobservable ability on wages.



7.2    Addressing Measurement Error

In our empirical setting we were also concerned that measurement error could affect our
results. Given our understanding of the data and what other researchers have docu-
mented in the literature, we were particularly concerned with four possible types of mea-
surement error: (i) 3-digit occupation codes are too broad (ii) imperfect matching of felony
restrictions on occupations (iii) partial licensing of occupations and (iv) misreporting of
licensing status (v) attrition bias in the sample.


   1. Occupational Level Controls: the standard in the literature is to use 3-digit oc-
       cupation fixed effects, however, since licensing occurs at the 6-digit level, 3-digit
       controls may introduce measurement error and also mask heterogeneity in occupa-
       tional selection. In Figure 8, we report the estimated gender and racial wage gaps
  26 Thisincrease is partially offset by a 0.4 p.p. reduction in the licensing premium for black men in occu-
pations without felony restrictions.
  27 The one exception is that the negative ban premium for white women goes from being negative and

significant to negative and insignificant.


                                                     25
  for both unlicensed and licensed workers for differing level of occupational controls:
  ranging from no occupational fixed effects 2-digit, 3-digit and 6-digit occupational
  controls. Going from no occupational fixed effects to 2-digit occupational controls
  makes a meaningful difference in the estimated wage gaps. However, going from 2-
  digit to 3-digit and then 6-digit occupational fixed effects, the estimated wage gaps
  are relatively stable for licensed black men and for white women. For example, the
  estimated wage gap for licensed black men goes from 9.3% to 8.5% when we go
  from 3-digit to 6-digit occupational fixed effects. This bounds the bias due to occu-
  pational selection to less than 1 percentage point. For all of the subsequent measurement
  error test, we adopt the 6-digit occupation controls, as a way of imposing the most stringent
  requirement that we can on our estimated wage gaps.

2. Imperfect matching of legal felony bans to occupations: to perform this match-
  ing we use the online SOC auto-coder, which matches description of jobs to occu-
  pations within some tolerance level, which is reported on a scale from 0%-100%.
  We adopt two approaches to test whether imperfect match quality of felony restric-
  tions affects our estimates. First, we include an indicator variable “poor quality’,
  which equals 1 if the reported match quality is below the median match quality of
  68%. Second, we construct a continuous measure of match quality by taking the
  log of 101-quality score. This measure equals zero if the quality of the match is
  100%, and hence if we had a perfect match rate to all of our professions, we would
  see no difference between the coefficient estimates in our baseline model and our
  match-quality-adjusted model. For match quality close to 100, this function is ap-
  proximately linear, however as the match quality declines to zero, the penalty for a
  poor match increases non-linearly. In both specifications the binary specification for
  poor match quality and the continuous measure, we find that a poor match reduces
  predicted wages (Table XII). However, we find that the estimated licensing premi-
  ums are the same as the results from our baseline specification. This suggests that

                                            26
      measurement error from imperfect match does not explain the results that we get.

   3. Partial licensing of occupations: There are 6 digit SOC codes that correspond to
      multiple sub-occupations, some of which may be licensed and others of which may
      be unlicensed. Since we only control for occupation fixed effects at the 6-digit level,
      we were concerned that our licensing premium could reflect differences in the com-
      position of industries rather than differences in wages directly. To address this con-
      cern, we do two things. First, we include a dummy variable into our regression
      which equals 1 if the individual is in a partially licensed occupation and 0 if not. We
      define a partially licensed occupation, as a 6-digit SOC code in which the fraction of
      licensed workers in the state-occupation observation is not 0 or 1. This allows us to
      test for differences in average wages between occupations that are partially licensed
      and those which are fully licensed or fully unlicensed. In our second approach, we
      drop all observations of workers in partially licensed occupations – 83,000 in total
      or 32% of the full sample. Controlling for partial licensing produces results that are
      similar to the baseline model (Table XII, column 6). Dropping the observations in
      the partially licensed occupations does not affect the differential license premium
      experienced by black men in occupations that bar felons, but it does reduce the re-
      turn to uninformative licenses for black women and black men, and also reduces
      the differential return to licenses with human capital for black men and women
      when compared to white men (column 7).28 This exercise suggests that the felony
      results for black men are less susceptible to partial licensing concerns than the other
      licensing premiums.

   4. Misreporting of license attainment: Gittleman et al. (2018) find that just 63% of
  28 The differential ban premium for black men in felony restricted occupations is an imprecisely estimated

14.5%, as compared to a precisely estimated 14.0% at baseline. By contrast, the wage premium for unin-
formative licenses drops by 9 p.p. and 6.4 p.p. for black men and black women relative to baseline and
relative to including a control for partial licensing of the occupation. For white women, the overall ben-
efit of continuing education requirement is unchanged in absolute terms, the relative advantage of white
women over white men is reduced by 2.3 p.p.; and in absolute terms there is no benefit of a continuous
education requirement of a license to black men.

                                                    27
      lawyers in the SIPP report having a license, even though having a license is a uni-
      versal requirement for lawyers to practice. In order to quantify the potential impact
      of measurement error on our results, we estimate wage regressions from 1000 ran-
      dom samples of our data in which the licensing variable is randomly assigned but
      all other observable characteristics of the individual worker are keep fixed at their
      reported value in the SIPP data. For consistency we require that the fraction of
      licensed workers in the random samples equals the observed fraction of licensed
      workers in the data at three levels of aggregation 1) the national level 2) the state-
      level 3) the state-by-occupation level. These requirements allow for an individual
      worker to misreport her license status while holding the overall fraction of licensed
      workers fixed.29

      From these regressions we report the empirical distribution of the race-by-gender
      wage premium of: (i) licenses with no human capital component and no felony
      restriction, (ii) licenses with a continuing education requirement, and (iii) licenses
      with felony restrictions. For each level of randomization there are 12 premiums
      corresponding with the 2 gender, 2 racial, and 3 licensing type categories. Overall,
      34 of the 36 premiums have p-values < 1%. For all levels of randomization, the
      felony ban premium for black men in licensed occupations and the human capital
      premium for both black and white women in licensed occupations have p-values
      < 1% (Table XIII). In Figure 9 , we show the results of this exercise for the expected
      wage premium for workers in occupations with felony restrictions, where we match
      the fraction licensed at the national level.30 The results of these placebo tests sug-
      gest that even extreme realizations of measurement error would not produce the
      licensing premiums that we find.
  29 We also match the fraction of licenses held by workers that require a continuous education requirement

and that are in occupations with felony restrictions by randomly assigning these attributes conditional on
licensing.
   30 We include all of the placebo plots for each license type and at each aggregation level in the online

appendix of the paper.



                                                    28
    5. Attrition bias: In our main specifications, we ran our results on Waves 13-16 of the
      data. Over time, the sample size is falling as households drop out of the sample.
      As reported in Table XIV 92% of the sample remain in wave 14, 90% by wave 15,
      however by wave 16, we only retain 63% of the original sample. Running our main
      specification (inclusive of ability controls and 6-digit occupational fixed effects), on
      waves 13-15, where more than 90% of the sample remains, we find that black men
      earn a statistically significant 20% licensing premium relative to white men in oc-
      cupations that preclude felons. In wave 16, where we have lost close to 40% of the
      sample, the licensing premium for black men in occupations precluding felons, rel-
      ative to that of white men, falls to just 2% and is not statistically significant. This
      suggest that the results that we reported previously are biased downwards because
      of attrition bias in the sample.



8     Comparison of Licenses and Certificates

To summarize our results, in Figure 10, we report bar graphs of the licensing premium
by license type for white men, black men, white women, and black women as well as
the certificate premium for each demographic group. In Figure 11, we graph the differ-
ence between the license premium and the certificate premium by race and gender group
complete with 95% confidence intervals. These results are the fully saturated model with
3-digit and 6-digit occupation fixed effects as well as controls for unobserved ability and
unobserved taste for licensing. For white men, the licensing premiums are small and
uniform in magnitude across the three different types of licenses and indistinguishable
from the certificate premium. For black men, the licensing premium is largest and sig-
nificant for the occupations with felony restrictions and substantially different from the
certificate premium in the model with 3-digit occupational controls. Moreover, as shown
in Figure 3, the license premium for black men in occupations that preclude felons is


                                             29
largest in “ban-the-box” states that regulate whether a firm can ask job applicants ques-
tions about criminal history. For women both the ordinary licenses and the licenses with
a continuing education requirement produce larger returns than the certificate, whereas
the licenses with felony restrictions produce comparable returns to the certificates.



9    Conclusion

Whereas economists have traditionally viewed occupational licensing primarily through
the lens of it being a labor market friction, the evidence in this paper suggests that it is
also an informative labor market signal because it is costly to obtain. A key implication of
our work is that efforts to reform occupational licensing will be Pareto improving if these
efforts can reduce the barriers to entry for the licensed occupations using a mechanism
that informs the labor market of worker productivity as well. Our results on certifica-
tions suggest that certification is a viable alternative to occupational licensing for white
men, but not for women or black men, who in many cases earn more with licenses that
certificates. As licensing reform efforts build, we require further work on the extent to
which the official nature of occupational licenses as a state-issued credential matters dif-
ferentially for women and black men, as compared to white men, given their historical
experience of the labor market frictions of gender and racial discrimination.

   Notes: This table reports a regression of log hourly wages on license status of the worker. The results demonstrate
   that all workers earn a license premium. The license premium earned by black men and both black and white
   women are larger than the license premium earned by white men. The license premium for black men comes
   through most strongly in occupations with licenses that preclude felons. All regressions include month fixed
   effects, a quadratic in age, education levels, a Hispanic indicator, ‘Other race’ indicator, union status, a government
   worker indicator, a self-employed indicator, a service worker indicator, as well as state and 3-digit occupation
   fixed effects. In addition, indicators for ‘certification’ and ‘license not required for jobs’ are included. The sample
   is restricted to respondents aged 18-64 with hourly wages on the main job between $5 and $100 from May 2012
   through November 2013. Observations with imputed wages and license status are dropped. (Robust standard
   errors clustered at state level.)

   Notes: This table reports a regression of log hourly wages on license status of the worker using the survey sample
   weights. The results demonstrate that all workers earn a license premium. The license premium earned by
   black men and both black and white women are larger than the license premium earned by white men. The
   license premium for black men comes through most strongly in occupations with licenses that preclude felons.
   All regressions include month fixed effects, a quadratic in age, education levels, a Hispanic indicator, ‘Other race’
   indicator, union status, a government worker indicator, a self-employed indicator, a service worker indicator,
   as well as state and 3-digit occupation fixed effects. In addition, indicators for ‘certification’ and ‘license not
   required for jobs’ are included. The sample is restricted to respondents aged 18-64 with hourly wages on the main
   job between $5 and $100 from May 2012 through November 2013. Observations with imputed wages and license
   status are dropped. (Robust standard errors clustered at state level.)

               state level.)

  Notes: This table reports a regression of wages on licensing status. To test whether the ban premium experienced by black men
  is robust, we control for heterogeneity by race and gender in four key variables that could also be correlated with whether an
  occupation has a felony ban: (i) the log of the racial disparity in arrest between blacks and whites, (ii) public sector employment,
  (iii) fraction of whites in occupation and (iv) worker union status. (We use robust standard errors clustered at state level.)

         This table reports three separate wage regressions conditional on license status. The goal
         of these regressions is to test whether the licensing premium to black men in occupations
         with felony bans is driven by differentially higher returns to post-secondary education for
         black men in these occupations. We find that black men in these occupations do not ex-
         perience differentially higher returns to post-secondary education relative to white men.

Notes: This table reports wage regressions in which we to test whether the licensing premium is due to occupational licensing increasing the human capital of
workers. All regressions include month fixed effects, a quadratic in age, education levels, a Hispanic indicator, ‘Other race’ indicator, union status, a government
worker indicator, a self-employed indicator, a service worker indicator, as well as state and 3-digit occupation fixed effects. In addition, indicators for ‘certification’
and ‘license not required for jobs’ are included. that are heterogeneous by race and gender. The sample is restricted to respondents aged 18-64 with hourly wages
on the main job between $5 and $100 from May 2012 through November 2013. Observations with imputed wages and license status are dropped. (Robust standard
errors are clustered at state level.)

 Data Source: Wave 13 to Wave 16 of SIPP Panel 2008. This table reports Mincer wage regressions of log wages on
 licensing status interacted with race and gender and license characteristics. In column 1 we report the results
 from our baseline model with controls for unobserved ability and whether an individual obtained a license for
 personal reasons. In column 2, we include linear controls for science, math and English ability. In column 3, we
 include 5th order controls for ability. The race-by-gender dummies are identical across all specifications, so we do
 not report them to conserve space. (Robust standard errors are clustered at state level.)

     This table reports results from our robustness tests. In each column we report results from a regression of log wages on licensing using
     6-digit occupational fixed effects. In column (1) we report our results from our base model. In column (2) and (3) we include linear and
     polynomial controls for science, math and English ability. In column (4), we include a dummy variable that equals 1 if the match quality of
     the occupation from our felony database exceeds the median match quality value of 68%. In column (5) we include a non-linear control of
     match quality log(101-quality) in order to penalize worse matches more. In column (6) and (7) we include a dummy for partially licensed
     occupations and drop all observations from partially licensed occupations, respectively. (Robust standard errors are clustered at state
     level.)

To construct this table, first we generate N = 1000 samples of the data in which we randomize the
license status of each worker, holding the overall fraction of licensed workers in the sample fixed. We
then compute a p-value and a z-score for each of the license premium coefficients from our Mincer
equation using the moments of the empirical distribution from our random sampling procedure. The
columns name the coefficient for which the z-score is calculated and the row the demographic group
for which the z-score is being calculated.

Data Source: Wave 13 to Wave 16 of SIPP Panel 2008. This table reports separate Mincer wage regressions of
log wages on licensing status interacted with race and gender and license characteristics for each wave of the
SIPP in the sample. In each regression we included controls for unobserved ability and whether an individual
obtained a license for personal reasons as well as 6-digit occupational fixed effects. In the first three waves, we
retain upwards of 90% of the sample and we find that black men earn a large licensing premium from having
occupational licenses that preclude felons, when compared to white men. In wave 16, when we have lost close
to 40% of the sample, the licensing premium for black men in these occupations is substantially reduced, which
suggest that our main results are a lower bound, due to attrition bias. (Robust standard errors are clustered at
state level.)

10.1     Proof of Theorem 1
To solve this sequential game, we use the solution concept of sub-game perfect equilib-
rium (SPE). In an SPE, we solve the model using backwards induction. First, workers
in period 2 sort in to the sector that produces the highest net return, given wages and
their preferences. Next in period 1, the representative firm in each sector chooses the
corresponding wage to maximize firm profits, given the sorting of workers.

10.1.1   Period #2: Workers Choose Sector
Starting in period 2, the probability that a worker of ability ai sorts into the licensed sector,
P( L = 1| ai ), is given by the probability that the net benefit of working in the licensed
sector is greater than the net benefit of working in the unlicensed sector:


                   P( Li = 1| ai ) = Prob(VL,i > VU,i )                                      (11)
                                   = Prob(ω L − c0 − ωU + θ ( ai − µ a ) > ei )              (12)
                                     1 ∆ω + θ ( ai − µ a )
                                   = +                     ,                                 (13)
                                     2          2σe

where, ∆ω ≡ (ω L − c0 ) − (ωU + µe ) is the expected net benefit of licensing across workers
of all types. The conditional probability of licensing in increasing the expected net benefit
of licensing. It is also increasing in worker ability for cases where worker ability lowers
the cost of licensing θ > 0 but decreasing in worker ability in cases where worker ability
increases the cost of licensing θ < 0.

10.1.2   Period #1: Firms Choose Wages
Next, we must compute firm profits given the sorting decisions of workers. In order to
compute profits for the representative firms in both the licensed and unlicensed sectors,
we first compute the fraction of workers who sort into the licensed profession and the
unlicensed profession, i.e., E[ P( Li = 1| ai )] and E[ P( Li = 0| ai )], because these quantities
enter the expect labor cost of the firms.

                           2 2σe
Given that we have a two-sector model, a worker is either employed in the licensed or in
the unlicensed sector. Consequently:

                                  E[ P( Li = 0| ai )] = 1 − E[ P( Li = 1| ai )]                              (18)

To compute firm profits, we must also compute the expected ability level of a worker
given that she has a license E( ai | Li = 1) and given that she does not have a license
E( ai | Li = 0) both of which contribute to firm revenue:

The best response function for the wages in the unlicensed sector is increasing with the
quality of the firm’s technology ω̄, the average ability of all workers, and the competing
wages in the licensed sector. It is decreasing in the cost of obtaining a license and the
maximum taste for the unlicensed sector by workers, µe + σe . At the Nash equilibrium
both firms wages are mutual best responses. Substituting the best response of the firm in
the licensed sector into the best response function for the firm in the unlicensed sector, we

Comment: Wages in the licensed sector are larger than wages in the unlicensed sector,
                                                        ∗ > 0 =⇒ ω ∗ > 0.
assuming c0 , µe , σe , µ a are all positive. Hence of ωU          L
   To solve for the fraction of licensed workers, we substitute equilibrium wages into the
expression for the fraction of licensed workers in equation (56):

                                          1 ω̄µ a h − c0 − µe
                                   f∗ =     +                 .                              (56)
                                          2         6σe
Defining c ≡ hω̄µ a − µe − 3σe , it is straight forward to show that if the average cost of
licensing, c0 , is lower than c that licensing is sufficiently cheap that all workers obtain a
license and work in the licensed sector, hence f = 1. Likewise, defining c̄ ≡ hω̄µ a − µe +
3σe , it is straight forward to show that if the average cost of licensing, c0 , is higher than c̄
that licensing is sufficiently onerous that all workers prefer not to obtain a license, hence
f = 0. It is only for intermediate value c0 ∈ (c, c̄), that we observe a non-zero fraction of
workers in both the licensed and unlicensed sectors.
    We further simplify the expression for the fraction of licensed workers in equation (56)
and the equilibrium wages for workers in equations using the definitions for c̄ and c:

                                                    c̄ − c0

Corollary 1. Wages are unambiguously higher in the licensed sector than in the unlicensed sector,
and the wedge between these two wages is increasing in the cost of licensing. In equilibrium,
unlicensed workers also experience a wage benefit from the human capital that is bundled with the
licensing. This wage benefit is half the human capital benefit experienced by licensed workers.
    The fact that licensing is bundled with human capital h increases the market return
to licensed labor and, in doing so, increases the value of the outside option of workers
who opt not to become licensed. Consistent with this prediction of the model, Han and
Kleiner (2016) provide evidence that workers in a licensed occupation who do not possess
a license but can practice because of grandfathering provisions experience a 5% increase
in wages as a result of their occupation becoming licensed, when compared to similar
unlicensed workers in occupations with no licensing requirements. By contrast, the wage
premium to licensed workers in the occupation, when compared to similar unlicensed
workers in occupations with no licensing requirements, is 12 percentage points higher
than the wage premium experienced by grandfathered workers.
Corollary 2. Given two distinct groups of workers B and W such that the average cost of licens-
ing is greater for group B than for group W (i.e., co,B > c0,W ) unlicensed B workers earn less
than unlicensed W workers, whereas licensed B workers earn more than licensed W workers, ce-
teris paribus. This follows from the fact that wages are decreasing in c0 for unlicensed workers
(equation 6a) but increasing in c0 for licensed workers (equation 6b).
    The result of this corollary maps into the empirical fact that we documented in Sec-
tion 6.2, which is that unlicensed black men earn less, on average, than unlicensed white
men, whereas licensed black men working in occupations with felony restrictions earn,
on average, slightly more than licensed white men in similar occupations. The presump-
tion here is that the felony restriction imposes a higher average cost of licensing on black
men relative to white men. Using data from the Bureau of Justice Statistics, Sakala (2014)
documents that black men are six times more likely to be incarcerated than white men,
which is consistent with this assumption.

10.2    Proof of Proposition 3
Proof. By definition the license premium is:

The license premium increases in c0 because the wage gap (numerator) increases in c0
and the wage in the unlicensed sector (denominator) is decreasing in c0 . In particular, the

     The positive relationship between the licensing premium and the dispersion in sector
taste comes from the fact that wages in the unlicensed sector (denominator) fall with
σe .


10.3    Proof of Proposition 4
The total social surplus is the sum of the firms revenue minus the expected cost of licens-
ing. Since the expected wages of employees is a cost to firms and a benefit to workers, it
nets out in the social surplus calculation, in the case where we place an equal weighting
on firm profits and net worker wages:

          Notes: This table reports a wage regression on license status conditional on
          firm size using the survey sample weights. The focal result here is that the
          ban premium for black men is decreasing in firm size as we go from com-
          panies with 200 employees to companies with 500 and 1000 employees. All
          regressions include month fixed effects, a quadratic in age, education lev-
          els, a Hispanic indicator, ‘other race’ indicator, union status, a government
          worker indicator, a self-employed indicator, a service worker indicator, as
          well as state and 3-digit occupation fixed effects. In addition, indicators for
          ‘certification’ and ‘license not required for jobs’ are included. The sample is
          restricted to respondents aged 18-64 with hourly wages on the main job be-
          tween $5 and $100 from May 2012 through November 2013. Observations
          with imputed wages and license status are dropped. (Robust standard errors
          are clustered at state level.)

             Notes: This table reports a regression of wages on licensing status, using survey sample weights. To test
             whether the ban premium experienced by black men is robust, we control for heterogeneity by race and
             gender in four key variables that could also be correlated with whether an occupation has a felony ban: (i)
             the log of the racial disparity in arrest between blacks and whites, (ii) public sector employment, (iii) fraction
             of whites in occupation and (iv) worker union status. (We use robust standard errors that are clustered at
             state level.)

        This table reports three separate wage regressions conditional on license status using survey sample
        weights. The goal of these regressions is to test whether the licensing premium to black men in
        occupations with felony bans is driven by differentially higher returns to post-secondary education
        for black men in these occupations. We find that black men in these occupations do not experience
        differentially higher returns to post-secondary education relative to white men. (Robust standard
        errors are clustered at state level.)

  Notes: This table reports wage regressions in which we to test whether the licensing premium is due to occupational licensing increasing the human capital of
  workers. All regressions include month fixed effects, a quadratic in age, education levels, a Hispanic indicator, ‘Other race’ indicator, union status, a government
  worker indicator, a self-employed indicator, a service worker indicator, as well as state and 3-digit occupation fixed effects and use survey sample weights. In
  addition, indicators for ‘certification’ and ‘license not required for jobs’ are included. that are heterogeneous by race and gender. The sample is restricted to
  respondents aged 18-64 with hourly wages on the main job between $5 and $100 from May 2012 through November 2013. Observations with imputed wages and
  license status are dropped. (Robust standard errors are clustered at state level.)
