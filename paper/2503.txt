     The informational content of different forecasts can be ce.pared by
regressing the actual change in a variabl, to b. forecasted on forecasts of
the change.  We use the procedure in Fair and Shiller (1987) to examine the
informational content of three sets of ex ant, forecasts: the American
Statistical Association and National Bureau of Econonic Research Survey
(SA), Data Resources Incorporated (DRI), and Wharton Economic Forecasting
Associates (WEFA). We compare these forecasts to each other and to quasi
ax ante" forecasts generated from a vector autoregressive model, an
autoregressive components model, and a large-scale structural model (the
Fair modal).

I.   Introduction

        In a previous paper. Fair and Shiller (1987), we proposed a procedure

for examining the     informational content of      forecasts. The procedure

involves running     regressions    of the actual change in th. variable forecasted

on forecasts of the     change,    along the lines described in the literature on

encompassing     tests of non-nested hypotheses.       We   used   this procedure    to

examine forecasts for the period 1976 III        -   1986 II    from the Fair (1976)

model, two     autoregressive    (AR) models, six vector autoregressive (VAR)

models, and eight "autoregressive Components" (AC) models. Th. procedure

requires that forecasted changes for a        period be     based only on information

available    in the period prior to th. first period of the           forecast, and      we

were careful to impose this requirement. All models were estimated only

through period t-s for a forecast of the change between periods t-s and t.

Also,    autoregressive equations for all th. exogenous         variables       in the   Fair
model   were   added to the   model, and these equations       wer,   used to   predict the

exogenous-variable values.         (The other models examined      contain no exogenous
variables.) Finally,         a version of the Fair model was used that existed in

1976 II, which insures that no information after this date was used for the

specification.

        Although all the forecasted changes between period t-a and t were based

only on information through period t-s,       the    forecasts were not ax ante

forecasts in the     sense   of having been forecasts that were actually made at

the time.      In this paper we use our procedure to examine three sets of cx

ante forecasts: the American Statistical Association and National Bureau of
                                                   2

Economic Research Survey (ASA), Data Resources incorporated (DRI)                  &nd

Wharton Economic Forecasting Associates (WEFA).                 The data on the forecasts

were provided     u.s   by Stephen   Ii.   &Nees, who   has bean   collecting forecasts on

a consistent basis frots the forecasters as             the forecasts were made.     He is

thus able to verify the exact date when the forecast became available.

HcNees has done a number       of    studies comparing the accuracy         of the different

forecasts -- see, for example,             flcNees (1981),   (1985),   (1986).

       It is well known     that   forecasts from models like DRI and WEFA are

subjectively adjusted.        One interpretation of the adjustment procedure is

that the model     builders   us. all the       information available to them at the

time   of   the forecast, much of it outside the model,            in deciding how to

adjust the modal.        In other words, the forecasts are an aggregation of a

considerable amount of information a. sifted through the minds of the model

builders.

       We are interested in two sets of questions. The first is whether,                 say,

the DRI forecasts contain information not in the WEFA forecasts and vice

versa. The second is whether the forecasts generated in our previous paper

(based only on information through the period prior to the first period of

the forecast) contain information not             in the cx ante forecasts and vice
versa.      We will call the forecasts generated in our previous paper quasi ax

ante* forecasts to distinguish them from the true cx ante forecasts of ASA,

DRI, and WEFA.

II.     The Procedure

        Let              denote a forecast of             (in our application, log real gross

national      product at       time t) made by forecaster       i   (or modal i with its

associated estimation procedure and forecasting method) at tim. t-s, i                       >   0.

The foundation of the empirical work that follows (as in Fair and Shiller

 (1987))      is the regression equation:



(1)           "t-s   —       ° +   t.sit      'F5)        +           -         +   U.

If neither forecast 1 nor forecast 2 contains any useful information for a-
period-ahead forecasting of                  then the estimates of          and p should both be

zero.    In this case the estimate of the constant term                    would be the average

a-period-change in Y.              If both forecasts contain independent information

for s-period-ahead forecasting, then                  and p shouldboth be nonzero.          If

both forecasts contain information, but th. information in, say, forecast 2

is completely contained in forecast 1 and forecast 1 contains further

relevant information as well,              then p   but   not p should be nonzero.       (If both
forecasts contain the seas information, than they are perfectly correlated,

and     and p are not separately identified.)

        The procedure we have proposed is to estimate equation (1) for

different forecasts and test the hypothesis    that                       — 0 and the hypothesis
                                            H1
          —
H2 that p 0. H1 is the hypothesis that forecast 1 contains no information
relevant to forecasting s periods ahead not in the constant term and in

forecast 2, and    is the hypothesis that forecast 2 contains no information
                H2
not in the constant term and in forecast I.

        Our testing procedure is similar to the C-test of Davidson and

MacKinnon (1981)         -   - which   is a special case of the 'Wald encompassing test'
                                                   4

of i4izon and Richard   (1986)1   -   - but   it differs from this procedure in a

number of important ways.

     First,    in our procedure the tests will be done for a equal to four as

well as one.    Davidson and HacKinnon, along with many others, have focussed

attention exclusively on one-period-ahead forecasts.2 The information

content of forecasts may differ depending on forecast horizon, as we will

see below.    Second, the C-test restricts             and   -y   to sum to one.3 In our

application this restriction does not seem sensible. As noted above, if

both models'   forecasts are   just noise, the estimates of both              fi   snd   -y   should

be zero.   Third, the C-test restricts the constant term a to be zero.4

Again, in our application this restriction does not seem sensible.                            If, for

example, both forecasts were noise and we estimated equation (1) without a

constant term, then the estimates of          fi   and i would not     generally    be zero

when the mean of the dependent variable is nonzero.

     Fourth, we requir. that forecast. beginning in period t                  contain only
information through period t-l.         Davidson and I4acKinnon do not require this.

The cx ante forecasts obviously satisfy thi. requirement, and we have made


     1See also Hendry and Richard (1982) and Chong and Hendry (1986).
Nelson (1972) and Cooper and Nelson (1975) are early examples of the use of
encompassing-like tests.

 -   2Their doing so was dictated by their setup of the model, wherein
multi-period forecasts are not defined.

     3Granger and Newbold (1986) in their discussion of combining forecasts
also speak of constraining the coefficients to sum to one, without
presenting an argument why one should do so. In their work, constraining
the coefficients to sum to one and setting the constant term to zero makes
possible some simple theorems that offer interpretations of the single
parameter estimated in their regression.

     4Chong and Hendry'. (1986) formulation of (1) also does not contain a
constant term, although they do not constrain fi and y to sum to one.
                                                          5

sure   that   the quasi cx ante          forecasts also satisfy it. Forecasts that are
based on rolling estimation of a model may have different properties from

those made with a model estimated with                     future data.        If   the model    is
misspecified (e.g., parameters change through time), then the rolling

e8timation forecasts (where estimat.d parameters vary through time) may
carry rather different information from forecasts estimated over the entire
sample.    Also, coma models may use up more degrees of freedom in estimation

than others,       arid   with varied estimation procedures it is often vary

difficult     to   take formal account of the number of degrees of freedom used

up.    In the extreme case where there were so many parameters                           in     model 1

that the degrees of freedom were completely used up when it was estimated.

it would be the case that                —                and there would be a spurious perfect

correspondence       between    the variable forecasted and the forecast.                       This would

cause     —   1 in (1) whether or not model 1 were a good model.                          On. can guard

against this degree of freedom problem by requiring that no forecasts ha

within-sample forecasts.5

       Fifth, we do not assume that                   is identically distributed, as do
                                                  u
Davidson and NacKinnon.          It seems quite likely that                  u is heteroskedastic.
If,    for example, a — 0,      ft
                                     —   1, and       —   0,   then   u,.   is simply the forecaat

error from modal 1, and in general forecast .rrrs are heteroskedastic.

Also, we will be considering four-period-ahead forecasts in addition to one-

period-ahead forecasts, and this introduces a third-order moving-average



     5Nelson (1972) and Cooper and Nelson (1975) do not require the
forecasts to be based only on information through the previouu period.
Chong and Hendry (1986) do, however, require this.  In their protedure the
models that give rise to the forecasts are estimated using sample period 1
through T and their regression analogous to equation (1.) is run using sample
period beginning in T+l.

 process to the error tern          in equation    (l).6         We correct for both

 heteroskedasticity and the moving Average process in the estimation of the

 standard errors of the coefficient estimates.                   For the one-quarter-ahead

 forecasts we use the method of White (1980), and for the four-quarter-ahead

 forecasts we use the method suggested by Hansen (1982),
                                                         Cumby, Huizinga, and
Obstfeld (1983), and White and Domowitz (1984). The exact formula that we

used for the covariance matrix of the coefficient estimates is presented in

Fair and Shiller (1987).



III.      The Forecasts and Models

       Any   comparison of ax       ante forecasts must      confront      the problem of date

revisions.         The data   for CNP   are revised back three years every               year,   and

from time     to   time   the   data are revised back to the very beginning of the

ssmple.      Let   Y , represent the value of time t log real CNP that is the
latest available from the U.S. Commerce Department At time I, T                            t.    (It
is understood that when the second subscript T is omitted, we mean T — end

of the full sample available now.)            Let                be the ax ante forecast of
                                                        t-s1"t
log ON? for quarter t that existed at time t-s (the                   '
                                                                          replacing      the    ).   The

problem    is how to compare               and          given that                 and
                                                 'tb'                 Y      t-s                 may be

quite different because of data revisions?                  There is obviously no right

answer to this problem.           What we have done is to adjust                      to make        the

forecasted change (from
                                 Y) be     the same as the ex ante forecasted change.



     6The error tern in equation (1) could, of course, be serially
correlated even for the one-period-ahead forecasts. Such serial correlation
does not appear to be a problem with any of the models we study here,
however, and we have assumed it to be zero.  One should not, of course,
uncritically apply procedures such as ours to all models, as Granger and
Newbold (1986) have warned.
                                                7

In other words, we hay, taken the new value of the forecasted lev.l of log

real GNP    for quarter   t,   tsY t   to be:


(2)            -Y' + Y-
Adjustments of this type are fairly common when dealing with cx ante

forecast.      see, for .xampls, McNee. (1981).



      We will now briefly discuss th. three models whose quasi cx ante

forecasts we are comparing to the actual cx ante forecast..



The Fair Model _IFAIR)

      The first version of the Fair model was presented in Fair (1976) along

with the estimation method and method of forecasting with the model.            This

version was based on data through 1975 I.            On. important addition that was

made to the model from this version was the inclusion of an interest rate

reaction function in the model.         This work ii described in Fair (1978),

which i. based on data through 1916 II.             The version of the model in Fair

(1976)   consists of 26 structural stochastic equations, and with the addition

of the interest rate reaction function, there are 27 stochastic equations.

There are 106 exogenous variables, and for each of these variables an eighth

order autoregressive equation with a constant and time trend was added to

the model.    This gave a model of 133 equations, and this 1. the version that

was used.

      For the rolling estimations, the first estimation period ended in 1976

II, which i. the first quarter in which the model could definitely           be said

to exist.    This allowed the model to be estimated 40 times (through 1986 I).
                                                      B



The VAR Model

       We considered six VAR models in Pair and Shiller (1987), but here we

consider only the VAR model that gave the beet results.                    This model is the

same as the model used in Sims (1980) except that we have added the three-

month Treasury bill rate to the model.                    There are seven variables in the

model: real GNP, the CNP deflator, the unemployment rate, the nominal wage

rate, the price of imports, the money supply, and the bill rate.                     All but

the unemployment rate end the bill rate are in log..                    Each equatic'n

consists of each variable lagged one through four times, a constant, and a

time trend, for a total of 30 coefficients per equation.                    We have imposed

Bayesian priors on the coefficients of the model.                   We imposed the Litterman

prior that the variables follow tmivariate random walks.                    The standard

deviations of the prior take the form

(3)        S(i,j,k) —
where i indexes the left-hand-side variable, j indexes the right-hand-side

variables, and k indexes the lag.
                                               s is       the standard error of the

unrestricted equation for variable i.                 The parameter value, chosen imply

fairly tight prior.:            1) f(i,j)   — 1 for       i—j.   f(i,j) — .5 for i       j, 2)

g(k) —         and   3) y   —   .1.   These are the values used by Litterman (1979,              p
49).

       The VAR model was estimated 40 times using the same sample periods as

were used for the Pair model.           The model was then used to make 40 forecasts

of real CHP.
                                              9
The AC Model

       Eight AC models were considered in our earlier paper, but again we

consider only the on. that gave the          beat results.   An AC modal    is   one in

which each of the components of real CNP is determined by a simple

autoregressive equation and CNP is determined as the           cuss   of the components

(1.., by the CNP identity). The version we u.s. here has 17 components.
Each equation for a component contains the first eight lagged values of the

component.   a   conStant, a tie.   trend,   and the first four lagged values of

real GNP    itself.   equations are not in log form. The same sample
                      The

period, and procedures were used for the AC model as were used for the Fair
and   VAR models.




IV.   The   Regult
      The resultsof estimating equation (1) are presented in Table 1. The
sample period used for the one-quartsrahead results is 1976 III - 1986 II,

for a total of 40 obaervations. The sampis period for the four-quarter-
ahead results is 1977 II -1986 II, for a total of 37 observations. As
mentioned above, for the quasi cx ante forecasts each forecast observation

is based on a different set of coefficient estimates          of   the model     -   -   rolling
estimation is used.     Also, for the Fair model all exog.nous variable values

are generated from the autoregressive equations; no actual values are used.

Finally, the one-quarter-ahead regressions White's (1980) correction for

heteroskedasticity has been used and for the four.quarter-ahead regressions

the method of Hansen (1982), Cumby, Huizinga, and Obstfeld (1983), and White

 and   Domowitz (1984) has been umad (with a moving average of orcter.3).7

           Consider now the results in Table 1.       For the one-quarter-ahead

 forecasts, the ASA forecast dominates in the lens,           that   it has   the largest

 coefficients.         It is the case, however, that the ASA forecasts are made

 later in the period than the others, which gives them a considerable

 advantag, for the one-quarter-ahead results. (McNees (1985) classifies the

 ASA forecasts as "mid quarter," whereas the DRI and WEFA forecasts are

 classified as "early quarter.")           What the present results show is that by

 the time the ASA forecasts are made, they contain substantial information

not in the other forecasts.           For the four.quartar.ahead results, both the

DRI and FAIR forecasts appear to contain information not in the ASA

forecasts       --   the   t.statistic for the DRI forecast ii   2.12   and the t-

statistic for the FAIR forecast is 4,94.
           It is interesting to note that when the DRI and WEFA one-quarter-ahead

forecasts are compared to the ASA one-quarter-ahead forecast, the DRI and

WEFA forecasts are significant at the 5 p.rcent level, but with nesative

weights.       The negative coefficient estimates do not mean, however, that the

DRI and WEFA forecasts are not necessarily optimal forecasts givsn their

(early quarter) information set.           Consider the following    example. Let X1       be

the    optimal forecast given th.       early   quarter information set, and let       +

X2
      the optimal forecast given the aid quarter information sat, where
      be

and X2 are uncorrelated. Assume that only a third of the ASA respondents

     71n one case for the four-quarter-ahead results - - ASA versus DRI - -
the estimated covariance matrix of the coefficients estimates was nearly
singular and the results were not sensible. In this case we assumed a
second order MA process for the error term instead of a third order, which
solved the problem. Had this been a more wide spread problem, we would have
used one of the estimators in Andrews (1987), but this seemed unnecessary
given only one failure.
                                         11

use   the   new information available after the date of the early quarter

forecast.     If the DRI forecast is    and the ASA forecast is    +               a
                                                                        (l/3)X2,

regression of the actual value on the two forecasts will give a coefficient

of 3 for ASA and    -2 for DRI, thu.s achieving the optimal forecast
                                                                       X1 + X2.
The DRI forecast is in effect correcting" the ASA forecast for using only a

1/3 weight on X2.

      The comparisons of the DRI and WEFA forecasts in Table 1 show that the

two forecasts are too collinear for any strong conclusions to be drawn.

None of the forecasts individually is significant. The VAR forecasts
                                                                     appear
to contain no information not in the DRI and WEFA one-quarter-ahead

forecasts (the VAR coefficient estimates are highly insignificant), but
                                                                        they
do carry a weight of about a third for the four-quarter-ahead forecasts.

The AC forecasts get a weight of about a third when compared with either the

DPJ or WEFA forecasts for both the one-quarter-ahead and
                                                         four-quarter-ahead
results.     The DRI and JEFA forecasts are significant at the 5 percent level

when compared with the VAR and AC forecasts, and so they appear to contain

information not in the VAR and AC forecasts.

      For the one-quarter-ahead results the FAIR forecasts contain

information not in the DRI and WEFA forecasts and the DRI and WEFA forecasts

contain information not in the FAIR forecasts.     For the four-quarter-ahead

results it is still true that the FAIR forecasts contain information not in

the DEl and WEFA forecasts, but it is now no longer the case that the DEl

and WEFA forecasts are statistically significant when
                                                      compared with the
FAIR forecasts.    They get weights of about a third, with t-statistics for
DEl and WEFA of 1.64 and 1.75, respectively.
                                         12

      The following points thus emerge   from   the results:

1.   The procedure cannot discriminate well between DRI and WEFA.      both sets

of model builders seem to use very similar information sets, and the two

forecasts do not contain much independent information.

2.   No one-quarter-ahead forecast carries a. much information as in the ASA

forecast, the ASA forecast being mad. later than the others.

3.   The VAR and AC quasi ax ante forecasts appear to contain only a modest

amount of information not in the ASA, DRI, and WEFA forecasts. Another way

of looking at this is that the ASA forecasters and the DRI and WEFA model

builders have not overlooked a lot of useful forecasting information in the
                                   8
variables in the VAR and AC models.

4.   The FAIR model quaci ax ante forecasts, on the other hand, do contain a

substantial amount   of   information not in the ASA, DRI, and WEFA forecasts

(except for the one-quarter-ahead ABA forecast).       In other words, the ASA

forecasters and the DRI and WEFA modal builders have overlooked useful

forecasting information in the FAIR model forecasts.

5.   For the one-quarter-ahead results the ASA, DPI, and WEFA forecasts

contain useful forecasting information not in the FAIR forecasts.          The large

amount of information sifted through the minds of the model builders when

they make a forecast does appear to contain some useful information for

forecasting one quarter ahead that is    not   in the FAIR quasi ex ante

forecasts. On the other hand, this is much les. the case for the four-



     8NcNees (1986) found that the Litterman Bayesian VAR forecasts did
better than any of the other forecasts studied for the four-quarter-ahead
forecast of real GNP for the sample period 1980-Il to 1985-I. On the other
hand, the Bayesian VAR forecasts were not relatively good at forecasting
one-quarter-ahead real GNP. This sample is only a third as long as ours,
and so it is of questionable relevance to our results.
                                        13

quarter-ahead results except for the ASA forecast, which has a head start.

In this sense the quasi ex ante FAIR forecasts look quite good.



IV.   Conclusion

      The procedure that we have proposed for examining the informational

content of forecasts appears to be a useful alternative to the stanthrd

procedure of comparing forecasts by the size of their root mean squared

errors (RSEs) or mean absolute errors (MAE5).     In many cases our procedure

may be able to discriminate better.    It is often the case, for example, that

the R}tSEs and MAEs for two forecasts are go close that one Is not sure if

the differences are economically meaningful. In at least some of these

cases our procedure may be more informative. For example, the dominance of

the one-quarter-ahead ASA forecasts in this paper is not something that is

obvious from simply looking at the R}ISEs and MAEs.   The same is also true of

the dominance of the ASA, DRI, and WEFA forecasts over the VAR and AC

forecasts.    There -are also, of course, cases where our procedure does not

discriminate either, such as the DRI versus WEFA comparison, but there

appear to be fewer of these cases for our procedure than for the procedure

of comparing RSMEs and MAEs.

      Our results also suggest that combining forecasts way be useful.

Although there is not much point in combining the DRI and WEFA forecasts,

since they are so similar, some gain may be achieved by combining either of

them with the FAIR model forecast for one-quarter-ahead forecasting.     There

is,   of course, no assurance that such combined forecasts will work well.

The forecasts that go into a regression may have changing stochastic

properties through time.    For example, as time progresses and a model is
                                       14

reestimated, the forecast from a modal is   based on more     and more data.

Thus, a model estimated using rolling •stiaation methods may       forecast much
better now, at the end of the   sample, than   it did   on average over the entire

sample.   The ax ante forecasts are also updated using nay data, and the

model builders who put their judgment into the forecasts are themselves

learning from past errors, just as we are with our regression analysis.

They may have already in effect combined the forecasts.       One must thus be

cautious in combining forecasts from regressions like those in Table 1.
