                                             ABSTRACT

We develop an empirical approach for identifying specialization in bank lending using granular data
on borrower activities. We illustrate the approach by characterizing bank specialization by export market,
combining bank, loan, and export data for all firms in Peru. We find that all banks specialize in at
least one export market, that firms take the pattern of bank specialization into account when selecting
their lending banks, and that credit supply shocks disproportionately affect a firm’s exports to markets
where the lender specializes in. Thus, bank specialization makes credit difficult to substitute, which
has consequences for competition in credit markets and the transmission of credit shocks to the real
economy.

1        Introduction

A central function of banks is to monitor and screen borrowers. Banks invest in collect-
ing borrower-specific information, often proprietary in nature, and evaluate new projects
through repeated interactions with the same borrower. Over time, banks form relation-
ships with borrowers that constitute an important source of a bank’s comparative advan-
tage. On the one hand, such relationship lending give banks an ex-ante incentive to invest
in information collection on new borrowers. On the other hand, it creates an ex-post infor-
mation monopoly that limits competition across banks and enables rent extraction. This
trade-off is at the center of much theoretical and empirical work on financial intermedia-
tion and considered a primary reason why banks exist in the first place.1
        In this paper, we explore a complementary, but theoretically distinct, source of com-
parative advantage of banks. We ask whether banks specialize by lending to firms in
specific markets. We distinguish between bank specialization due to “market-specific”
information, such as expertise in evaluating projects in a specific market or in a specific
activity, and “firm-specific” information, such as the information gathered from relation-
ship lending. Importantly, we analyze whether there is a distinct role for market-specific
bank specialization independent of firm-specific information collected through relation-
ship lending.
        To provide compelling evidence of market-specific bank specialization, one needs to
address several challenges. The first is deriving a theoretically sound measure of market-
specific bank specialization that can be taken to the data. The second is to empirically
identify the consequences of market-specific bank specialization separately from other
bank characteristics that could affect lending directly. The third is to distinguish clearly
between the impact of market-specific specialization and firm-specific information gath-
ered through relationship lending.

                                                    1
   Our analysis addresses these challenges using a new dataset that combines bank, loan,
and export data on all firms in Peru. We start by constructing a new measure of market-
specific bank specialization based on cross-country variation in firms’ export activities.
We define a bank to be specialized in a country if its portfolio share of lending to exporters
to the country is a right-tail outlier in the distribution of portfolio shares of lending by all
banks. We show that this measure emerges naturally from a model in which firms op-
erate across different markets (e.g., exports to multiple geographical markets), and each
firm demands credit from banks that are differentiated in providing intermediation ser-
vices across markets (e.g., banks have an advantage in funding exports to specific coun-
tries). This approach captures market-specific bank specialization (e.g., better screening
and monitoring of local risk, more value-added local services attached to credit issuances,
etc.) that is independent of firm-specific information.
   Using our new measure of bank specialization, we show that all banks are specialized
in at least one export market. We further find that market-specific bank specialization is
highly persistent. A bank that is specialized in a market today has a 50% probability of
being specialized in the same market in ten years. These findings indicate that banks have
market-specific expertise and knowledge regarding specific export markets.
   We examine how firms’ choice of lender is related to market-specific bank specializa-
tion. A direct implication of market-specific bank specialization is that firms will dispro-
portionately fund exports to a specific country with credit from a bank specialized in that
country. We develop a revealed preference approach that directly tests this implication.
We exploit the disaggregated nature of the data to control for firm demand shocks (firm-
time fixed-effects) and bank credit supply shocks (bank-time fixed-effects) that may affect
lending for other reasons. Using our revealed preference approach, we find that when
firms expand exports to a country, they increase borrowing by 79% more from banks that
are specialized in the destination country relative to non-specialized banks, suggesting
that firms value market-specific bank specialization.
   We further analyze how market-specific bank specialization affects the impact of credit


                                               2
demand and supply shocks. On the demand side, we use macroeconomic innovations in
export markets (changes in GDP and exchange rate) as country-specific export demand
shocks while still saturating the model with firm-time and bank-time fixed effects. We
find that the elasticity of credit demand to export shocks is 0.50 for banks specialized, 50%
larger than the one from non-specialized banks (0.33). This shows that, for the same firm,
the demand for credit from a specialized bank increases when the firm tilts its production
towards the market of specialization. On the supply side, we use the reduction in bank
credit induced by international capital flow reversals during the 2008 financial crisis and
control for demand shocks by comparing changes in exports in narrowly defined product-
destination export markets (e.g., cotton T-short exports to Germany).2 We find that the
elasticity of exports to a credit supply shock is 6.6 times larger to countries where the
lender specializes in, relative to countries it does not, suggesting a direct effect of market-
specific bank specialization on exports.
       Next, we explore how market-specific bank specialization differs from firm-specific
information gathered through relationship lending. Firm-specific information emerges
because of private information collected as part of an ongoing lending interaction.3 In
contrast, market-specific bank specialization is tied to all firms operating in a market re-
gardless of whether or not the bank has private information on each firm. We can thus
distinguish these two sources of informational advantage by focusing on new firm-bank
relationships (i.e., extensive margin) for which banks have no firm-specific information.
       We find that the probability that a firm starts a new banking relationship after export-
ing to a new country is 6.9 times higher for a bank specialized in that country relative to
a non-specialized bank. Moreover, a firm is 4.8 times more likely to start exporting to a
new country the year after it starts borrowing from a bank specialized in that new market
relative to a non-specialized bank. Starting a new relationship with a bank not specialized
in that market, on the other hand, is not associated with any change in the probability of
   2
    This identification strategy is based on the empirical setting in Paravisini et al. (2015).

    On the role of banks in collecting firm-specific information see, for example, Leland and Pyle, 1977;
Diamond, 1984; Ramakrishnan and Thakor, 1984; Fama, 1985; Sharpe, 1990; Diamond, 1991; Rajan, 1992;
Rajan and Winton, 1995; and Holmstrom and Tirole, 1997.

                                                   3
export entry. These findings show that the impact of market-specific bank specialization
is not driven by firm-specific information.
       Market-specific bank specialization and firm-specific information also have different
implications regarding bank size. Relationship lending is based on firm-specific informa-
tion gathered through the lending process, which is difficult to scale and gets lost as banks
grow larger.4 Contrary to this prediction of relationship lending models, there is no rea-
son to expect that market-specific bank specialization is lost as banks grow larger. Indeed,
we find no evidence of a trade-off between bank size and market-specific bank specializa-
tion in export markets. Market-specific bank specialization does not vary systematically
with bank size in the cross-section or in the time series. Moreover, using bank mergers
as a source of variation in bank size and specialization, we find that market-specific bank
specialization before a merger carries over to the combined entity after the merger. These
results indicate that market-specific bank specialization is scalable and not hindered by
organizational constraints.
       As a final step, we consider the implications of market-specific bank specialization
for the estimation of credit supply shocks. A large literature in economics and finance
is concerned with estimating the economic impact of credit supply shocks such as bank
failures, runs, liquidity shortages, or tighter monetary conditions. The now-standard ap-
proach of identifying the impact of banks’ credit supply shocks, pioneered by Khwaja
and Mian (2008), is to control for credit demand using firm-time fixed effects. The iden-
tifying assumption behind this approach is that changes in firms’ credit demand are, in
expectation, equally spread across all banks lending to the firm. In many settings this
assumption is plausible assuming there is no market-specific bank specialization.
       However, in the presence of market-specific bank specialization, this assumption holds
only under restrictive conditions— e.g., for shocks to bank credit supply that are ei-
ther uncorrelated with market-specific demand or that proportionally affect all activi-
ties in which banks may specialize. We illustrate how this identification assumption can
   4
   The trade-off between relationship lending advantages and bank size is theorized in Stein (2002) and
documented in Berger et al. (2005).


                                                  4
be tested using within-firm specifications that account for banks’ pattern of export spe-
cialization using the empirical setting in Paravisini et al. (2015). We show that demand
shocks can explain a larger amount of the within-firm variation in credit than bank fund-
ing shocks, which implies that ignoring market-specific bank specialization can lead to
biased estimates.
       Our paper relates to two main strands in the literature. The first strand is the work on
the industrial organization of bank credit markets and its consequences for the real econ-
omy. Market-specific bank specialization provides a rationale for why firms have mul-
tiple banking relationships and why banks form syndicates: multiple bank relationships
and syndicates arise naturally when banks are differentially equipped to fund different
projects by the same firm.5 Our results also highlight the limits of bank diversification.
Traditional banking theory argues that full diversification across sectors and projects is
optimal (e.g., Diamond, 1984; Boyd and Prescott, 1986). However, diversification may
prove costly when it implies expanding to markets in which the bank is not specialized.6
It also implies that market-specific bank specialization directly affects the economy’s pat-
tern of comparative advantage across non-financial sectors.7
       The second strand is the work on the impact of credit supply shocks on the real econ-
omy. This work focuses on the role of shocks in the presence of firm-specific information
gathered through relationship lending (e.g., Bernanke, 1983; Khwaja and Mian, 2008; Par-
avisini, 2008; Gormley, 2010; Amiti and Weinstein, 2011; Chava and Purnanandam, 2011;
Schnabl, 2012; Bolton et al., 2013; Jimenez et al., 2014; Chodorow-Reich, 2014; Drechsler
   5
      Leading theories for multi-bank relationships hinge on arguments of ex post-renegotiation (Bolton and
Scharfstein, 1996), information rents by relationship lenders (Rajan, 1992), and diversification of firms’ ex-
posure to bank failures (Detragiache et al., 2000), while existing explanations for loan syndicates include
risk diversification and regulatory arbitrage (Pennacchi, 1988).
    6
      Winton (1999) argues theoretically that there is a trade-off between diversification and the quality of
loan monitoring. Acharya et al. (2006) find that more diversification leads to riskier lending among Italian
banks. Berger et al. (2017) find that banks are more likely to rely on soft information in areas and industries
to which they have high exposure. Granja et al. (2017) examine auctions of failed banks and show that
banks specialize in certain business lines and geographic areas.
    7
      This mechanism is distinct from, and complementary to, the well documented pattern of compara-
tive advantage across countries with different levels of development of the banking sector (e.g., Rajan and
Zingales (1998), Manova (2013)).

et al., 2017; and Amiti and Weinstein, 2018). Our findings highlight the complementary
role of market-specific bank specialization in the transmission of credit supply shocks.
Market-specific bank specialization limits competition across banks, which amplifies the
impact of financial crisis on the real economy. Our paper offers a way to separately iden-
tify the impact of market-specific bank specialization and credit supply shocks.
    The rest of the paper proceeds as follows. Section 2 describes the data. In Section 3 we
present a theoretical framework that guides our exercise and in Section 4, the empirical
methodology to identify bank’s lending advantage. The results are presented in Section
5. In Section 6 we discuss the difference between market-wide lending advantage and
firm-specific relationship lending. In Section 7 we narrow down the potential sources of
bank lending advantage. Finally, Section 8 concludes.



2    Data

We use two datasets to construct our measure of bank specialization by export market:
monthly loan-level data for each bank in Peru and customs data for Peruvian exports over
the period 1994-2010. Both datasets cover the universe of firms operating in Peru.
    We collect the customs data from the website of the Peruvian tax agency (Superinten-
dence of Tax Administration, or SUNAT). Collecting the export data involves using a web
crawler to download each individual export document. To validate the consistency of the
data collection process, we compare the sum of the monthly total exports from our data,
with the total monthly exports reported by the tax authority. On average, exports from
the collected data add up to 99.98% of the exports reported by SUNAT.
    Peru is a highly bank-dependent country with most firms relying on banks as the pri-
mary and only source of external capital. The Peruvian bank regulator (Superintendencia
de Banca, Seguros, and APF, or SBS) provides loan-level data covering the universe of
firms. These data consist of a monthly panel of the outstanding debt of every firm with
each bank operating in Peru. We also collect the time-series of bank financial statements


                                             6
from the SBS website. We check the validity of the loan-level data by aggregating total
lending by bank, and we find that total loan volume corresponds to total lending volume
reported on bank balance sheets. We match the loan data to export data using a unique
firm identifier assigned by SUNAT for tax collection purposes.
       Table 1 shows summary statistics describing the data. The unit of observation in our
empirical analysis in Section 4 is at the bank-firm-country-year level. Each observation
combines the annual average bank-firm outstanding debt with the firm’s annual exports
to each destination country expressed in U.S. dollars. The total number of observations
in the full dataset, described in Panel 1, is 378,766. The average annual firm-bank out-
standing debt is US$ 2,044,488, and the average firm-destination annual export flow is
US$ 2,148,237 (conditional on bank debt being greater than zero). As usual for this type
of data, exports and debt are right-skewed. The median debt and exports are US$ 259,764
and US$ 87,218, respectively.
       We emphasize that all loan-level data is reported at the bank-firm level, not the bank-
firm-country level. This is a common limitation when using credit registry data because
loans are recorded as being provided to firms, not firm-country pairs. Yet, even if infor-
mation on credit by firm and country were available, it is not obvious that it should be
used. The reason is that credit is fungible and can be used for other purposes than the
stated loan objective. For those reasons, our paper proposes a measure of bank special-
ization that does not require information to directly link credit to countries within firms.
       Panel 2 in Table 1 describes the 14,267 exporting firms in our data. The average num-
ber of banking relationships per firm is 2.42 and the average number of export countries
is 2.65. We restrict the sample to include the export destination to the 22 main export mar-
kets, which represent 97% of Peruvian exports across the period of analysis.8 The share
of Peruvian exports across the main ten destinations, during the entire sample, is shown
in Figure 1.9

3     Specialization: Framework, Measurement, and Descrip-
      tive Statistics

To motivate our definition of bank specialization, we present a model in which: 1) funding
from one bank is not perfectly substitutable with funding from another, and 2) banks are
heterogeneous in their lending capabilities for specific economic activities. In the data,
these activities will correspond to export markets, and bank specialization may come
from providing credit at a lower cost, more credit for the same borrower characteristics,
or more value added services attached to the issuance of credit than other lenders. Since
the source of advantages is unobserved by the econometrician, we model specialization
in reduced form. We use the model to derive observable and testable implications of the
existence of market-specific bank specialization (whichever their source) on bank lending
portfolios and the equilibrium relationship between credit from specialized banks and
the economic activity in the sector they specialize in. This framework also guides the
revealed preference approach used to assess whether our specialization measure (based
on the stock of existing loans) is an indicator of an advantage in lending to exporters to
that destination (based on the flow of new loans).


3.1    Theoretical Framework of Specialized Bank Lending

We use a nested logit model with deterministic second stage, adapted from Anderson
et al. (1987). Each bank b is characterized by an interest rate rb and a vector of absolute
lending advantage for each economic activity c = 1, ..., C (e.g., export destination coun-
try), γb = [γb1 , ..., γbC ]. Each firm i is defined as a collection of activities. For each activity
c the firm proceeds in two steps. First, it chooses a bank, and then, how much to borrow
from the chosen bank. If a given bank b is chosen in the first step, then the optimal amount
of credit demanded for the activity c, Lcib , is the one that maximizes output in activity c,
economic significance in our setting because they are difficult and costly to enforce in the Peruvian judicial
system.



                                                      8
qic , given a total cost of credit for that activity, rb Lcib ≤ Eic .
       We assume a log-production function: qic = ln(γibc Lcib ) + µcib , where cib is an idiosyn-
cratic factor, unobserved to the econometrician. Since the production function is mono-
tone in Lcib , the demand for credit that maximizes output, provided b is the chosen bank
to finance activity c, is given, simply, by the cost of credit, rb , and the size of the activity,
               Eic
Eic : Lcib =   rb
                   .
       Given this credit demand, firm i’s choice of bank for each activity in the first stage is
the one that maximizes output for a given credit cost:


                 qic = max {ln(γbc Lcib ) + µcib } = max {ln(γbc ) − ln(rb ) + ln(Eic ) + µcib } .
                         b                              b



       This firm-activity specific credit follows a bang-bang solution. For each activity c, the
firm i chooses a single bank depending on the interest rate rb , the absolute advantage γbc ,
and its idiosyncratic motive cib .
       The discrete-choice micro-foundation highlights two features of the framework. First,
firms may have multiple banking relationships because they may choose different banks
to fund different activities. Thus, our analysis provides a rationale for multiple banking
relationships as a consequence of the multi-activity nature of the firm and the activity-
specific advantage of banks.10 Second, firms in the discrete-choice model do not establish
banking relationships with all banks. Instead, they choose one bank per activity (although
this is not hard-wired, as it may well be that the same bank is chosen for more than one
activity). The discrete model with differentiated banks delivers this result without having
to introduce a fixed cost of establishing a relationship with a bank.11
       The within-firm distribution of credit across banks is driven, one-to-one, by the within-
  10
      In a previous version of the paper we derived this result from a love-of-variety utility function. We are
grateful to the associate editor and an anonymous referee to encourage us to provide a micro-foundation
for this result.
   11
      This assumption is consistent with the new structural literature in banking in which banks provide dif-
ferentiated services and these services are imperfect substitutes (e.g., Benetton (2017), Buchak et al. (2018),
Egan, Hortaçsu and Matvos (2017), Egan, Lewellen and Sunderam (2017), and Xiao (2017).

where Eic is total cost associated with productive activity c and Icb is an indicator function
                    γc
equal to one if ln( rbb )µcib is the maximum across all banks.
   The interpretation of the lending advantage parameter, γbc , is broad. It could represent
a bank service attached to credit issuances. Or, given that it determines the firm’s choice
through the ratio γbc /rb , it could refer to an activity-specific interest rate discount. Absent
the idiosyncratic factor (i.e., µ = 0), this Ricardian differentiation naturally implies that all
firms would choose the same bank to fund an activity. Any given activity would be fully
funded by the bank with highest lending advantage in that activity, relative to its cost of
credit, γbc /rb . This motivates the specialization measure defined in the next subsection.
   The idiosyncratic factor adds noise to the choice. If this idiosyncratic noise is predomi-
nant (i.e., µ is large) or if banks do not differ in γbc /rb across activities, variations in Eic (size
of activity c for firm i) would not predict a systematic shifts of credit across banks. This
is the null hypothesis of the empirical tests that we develop in Section 4. The alternative
hypothesis is that banks are heterogeneous in their activity-specific advantages. Under
the alternative hypothesis, variations in Eic are associated with systematic shifts in credit
composition towards banks the bank with high γbc /rb .


3.2    Specialization Measure

Our goal is to develop a measure of specialization that is consistent with the above frame-
work and that can be implemented with micro-data. Absent noise, a bank is specialized
in sector c if it has the maximum γbc /rb across all {γbc0 /rb0 }b0 . The first empirical challenge
is to identify the bank(s) with the highest γbc /rb in the presence of noise. The second chal-
lenge derives from the limitations of the observable data, which do not differentiate the
amount of c-specific credit from the chosen bank b, only total borrowing by each firm


                                                   10
from each bank. We construct an outlier-based measure of specialization that meets these
two challenges. A bank is specialized in a given activity c (export destination country) if
it is an outlier of bank export-weighted lending across banks within a given activity.
       The first step in constructing the specialization measure is to aggregate the firm-activity
specific credit demands across all firms. The optimal amount of c-specific credit from the
chosen bank b is Lcib = Eic /rb and firm i chooses bank b to fund activity c if:


                               b = arg max {ln(γbc ) − ln(rb ) + µcib } .                        (1)


       Assuming that {cib }i are identically, independently Gumbel distributed, the probabil-
ity that a firm chooses b for activity c is given by:

                                                                         c 1/µ
                                                                             γb
                                 exp {ln(γbc ) − ln(rb )} /µ         rb
                       P rbc = P              c
                                                                 =    γ c 1/µ .
                                 b0 exp {ln(γb0 ) − ln(rb0 )} /µ        b0
                                                                   P
                                                                        b0        rb0


       The second step, necessary to make the measure feasible, is to aggregate activity-
specific demand across all destinations c (we do not observe activity-specific credit). Sum-
ming across c, we obtain the demand for the representative firm:12

                                                                                  γc     1
                                1 X c c                                 ( rbb ) µ
                      E[Lib ] =      γ
                                     e E           where :     ebc
                                                               γ     ≡              .
                                rb c b i                               P  γ c  µ1      b0
                                                                             b0         rb0


              ebc captures the comparative advantage of b in lending towards activity c.
The parameter γ
It compares the lending advantage of bank b (relative to the cost of lending), with those
of the entire market {γbc0 /rb0 }b0 . As explained in the previous subsection, the strength of
the pattern of comparative advantage (i.e., its skewness) is mediated by the importance
of the idiosyncratic noise (µ).
       The third step is to substitute total cost of goods exported to c, Eic , for its empirical
  12
    This representative-agent demand function coincides with the one derived from CES preferences with
elasticity of substitution ρ ≡ 1−µ
                                µ , which we used in a previous version of this paper.



                                                   11
counterpart. Since in our setting activities c = 1, ..., C correspond to export destination
markets, this cost can be proxied by Xic , total exports to c. This approximation is ex-
act (Eic ∝ Xic ) under perfect competition or constant markup, a good approximation for
Peruvian exports (mostly commodities). Thus:

                                                1 X c c
                                    E[Lib ] =        γ
                                                     e X .                                    (2)
                                                rb c b i

A direct implication of Equation 2 is that the elasticity of demand for loans with respect to
the value of goods exported to country c is increasing in the comparative lending advan-
tage of bank b in activity c. We use this result to develop a revealed preference approach
to identify the effect of lending advantages in the next section.
   A second implication of Equation 2 leads to our measure of specialization. Equation 2
implies that the bank with the highest lending advantage in activity c will have, all else
equal, the highest share of lending associated with activity c, Sbc , defined as:

                                              PI
                                                  Lib Xic
                                   Sbc   ≡ PC i=1
                                                PI         k
                                                             ,                                (3)
                                            k=1   i=1 Lib Xi

which represents bank-b borrowers’ exports to country c, weighted by their debt in bank-
b, as a share of bank-b borrowers’ total debt-weighted exports.
   To understand the intuition behind this measure and the definition of specialization,
it is useful to consider the case of single-activity firms, which endogenously choose to
have a single banking relationship. If the idiosyncratic component {cib }i plays no role in
bank choice (i.e., µ = 0), all firms in the same activity c would choose the same bank.
The bank b with the highest γbc /rb in country c will have Sbc = 1 and all other banks −b
           c
will have S−b = 0. If the importance of the idiosyncratic motive is not zero, the shares of
                              c
other banks will be positive S−b > 0. Importantly, for sufficiently small µ, the bank b with
highest γbc /rb will have the largest share of lending associated with activity c, Sbc . That is,
the bank with highest advantage in c will appear as an outlier in the distribution of shares
of weighted exports to country c across all banks in the data. We demonstrate this with


                                                12
simulated data in the Internet Appendix.
                                                                       c
       With panel data we can measure the lending share every period, Sbt . We propose a
non-parametric approach to systematically identify the outlier banks in the distribution
     c
of {Sbt } for each country-year. Formally:

                                                                             c
Definition 1 (Specialization). We consider a bank-country-year observation, Sbt , to be an outlier,
                                  c             c
which we denote with the dummy O(Sbt ) = 1, if Sbt is above the upper extreme value, defined by
the 75th percentile plus 1.5 interquartile ranges of the distribution of {Sbt
                                                                           c
                                                                              } across banks for a given
country-year. We refer to an outlier bank as specialized in the corresponding country during the
corresponding year.

       Identifying outliers using percentiles and interquartile ranges has the advantage that
it does not rely on any assumptions about the distribution of bank portfolio shares.13 In
a normally distributed sample, our definition would correspond to observations above
the mean plus 2.7 times the standard deviation, which corresponds to observations in the
1st-percentile of the distribution.14
       It is worth highlighting two additional features of the identifying bank specialization
using share outliers. The first is that identification of outliers is not affected by the bank
size distribution. Each bank’s share of exports to a country is measured relative to its
own portfolio, and thus impervious to scale. Second, the identification of outliers is also
                                                                        c
not affected by size of the export markets. The share of bank lending, Sbt , associated
with large markets (e.g., China or U.S.) will be systematically higher across all banks,
but outliers are identified by comparing bank shares for a given country. The dummy
            c
variable O(Sbt ) = 1 captures whether bank b is specialized in country c, and not whether
bank b is specialized in general. In fact, with as many banks as destination markets, all
banks can be specialized, each bank in a different country. In other words, our proposed
measure captures a bank’s departure from the overall specialization pattern of exports.
  13
    See Hodge and Austin (2004) for a survey of outlier detection methods.
  14
    In an online appendix, we simulate data using a simple version of the discrete choice model in Sub-
section 3.1 and show that this measure of specialization correctly captures the underlying pattern of banks’
lending advantage.


                                                    13
   To illustrate the approach, we use a box-and-whisker plot to represent the distribution
     c
of {Sbt } for two countries, Switzerland and the U.S., in 2010 (Figure 2). To facilitate the in-
                        c     c                c
terpretation, we plot {Sbt −S t } instead of {Sbt }, so that the share distributions are centered
at zero for each country. The top and bottom edges of the box denote the 25th and 75th
percentiles of the distribution, and the size of the box is the interquartile range (IQR). The
whiskers denote the highest (lowest) datum within 1.5 × IQR of the 75th (25th ) percentile.
Then, for a given country and year, we consider a bank to be an outlier of the distribution
if its share of portfolio lending to the country lies outside the whiskers (outliers are identi-
fied with dots in the plot). For example, according to our definition, in 2010 Citibank and
Scotiabank are specialized in lending to firms exporting to Switzerland, while Santander
is specialized in lending to firms that export to the U.S.
   To summarize, our measure of specialization has three important and desirable fea-
tures. First, a measure based on outliers of portfolio shares is consistent with a theory
where banks have advantages in lending towards specific activities. Second, it is based
on observable measures and thus straightforward to implement with available micro-
data. For contrast, a measure of specialization based on the amount of credit from bank b
to firm i devoted to activity c would be impossible to implement with existing data-sets.
And third, a measure of specialization based on the value of exports to a market captures
portfolio share outliers that are driven by both the number of firms and firm size. This is
an important characteristic. According to our definition, a bank may become specialized
in a country because it lends to a large number of exporters relative to other banks, or
because it provides a large fraction of its credit to a few large exporters relative to other
banks. Both extremes are captured by the proposed specialization measure.


3.3   Bank Specialization Descriptive Statistics

In our data, the firms i = 1, ..., I are Peruvian exporters, c = 1, ..., C are the destination
country of exports, Xitc are exports by firm i to destination country c in year t, and Libt is
the outstanding debt of exporting firm i with bank b in year t. We compute the shares of

                                               14
lending associated with each export market using the outstanding debt of Peruvian firms
in the 33 banks operating in Peru between 1994 and 2010, as well as the firm-level export
data by shipment to the 22 largest destination markets.15
                      c
       The values of Sbt defined in (3) provide information on the heterogeneity in lending
                                                                                  c
shares by country across banks. In Table 2, we present descriptive statistics of Sbt by
country, demeaned by the average share across all banks in the corresponding country,
 c                   c     c
S t . The median of Sbt −S t is negative for every country, indicating that the within-country
                  c
distribution of {Sbt } is right-skewed. This is confirmed in column 5, where we report
a large and positive skewness for every country. This skewness implies that for every
destination country in the sample, there is at least one bank that specializes in financing
exports to that destination. Figure 3 confirms this finding. It shows the box-and-whisker
                             c      c
plot of the distribution of Sbt − S t for each country during the years 1995, 2000, 2005, and
2010. The dots outside the range of the whiskers, for each country-year, correspond to the
specialized banks according to Definition 1.
       Table 3, column 1, reports the number of countries in which each bank specializes at
least once in the sample period. Banks specialize in several countries during the 17-year
period, with one bank (code 73) reaching a maximum of 15 countries out of a total of
22. These numbers decline considerably once we count the countries in which each bank
specializes for at least 25%, 50%, or 75% of the time that the bank appears in the sample
(columns 2 to 4). Even using a stringent definition of specialization—in which the bank
must be an outlier in the country for at least 75% of the observed sample period in order
to be considered specialized—25 out of 33 banks in the sample specialize in at least one
country. This is because the pattern of bank specialization is very persistent, as shown in
Figure 4. The auto-correlation between bank-country specialization is constant at around
0.45 over a 10 year period.
       In summary, banks specialize in the export markets of its borrowers, and each bank
is associated with a subset of countries for which it exhibits long-lasting specialization.
  15
   The bank panel is unbalanced because of entry, exit and M&A activity (we discuss M&A activity in
more detail in subsection 6.3).


                                                15
Whether this measure is associated with an underlying bank advantage in lending to
the market of specialization is an empirical question. Our empirical approach, explained
in the next section, tests not only whether banks have an advantage in lending towards
specific destinations, but also whether this measure of specialization indeed provides in-
formation about such an advantage.16



4     Identifying Advantage in Lending

We use three different empirical strategies to characterize lending advantages. The first is
aimed at testing in the data whether lending advantages exist, and is based on the predic-
tion, derived from Equation 2 in Subsection 3.1. This approach to evaluate advantages is
robust and generalizable, as it circumvents the problems involved in attempting to infer
advantages from the direct observation of its potential sources or relying on instrumental
variables.
    The two other empirical approaches are aimed at identifying the magnitude of the
advantages and their consequences for how demand shocks affect the health of the bank-
ing sector, and how credit supply shocks affect output. We measure how the following
elasticities vary with the degree of bank specialization: the elasticity of firm’s credit in
response to a demand shock in the export markets, and the elasticity of exports to a credit
supply shock. The estimation of these elasticities relies on using plausible exogenous
variation to export demand and to the supply of credit, which we explain in more detail
below.
   16
      Our work focuses on bank specialization in export activities. In related work, Granja et al. (2017) use
bidding data from failed bank auctions to document bank specialization in asset business lines and geo-
graphic areas. Though different in focus, the common thread across both papers is a focus on bank special-
ization.




                                                     16
4.1      Revealed Preference Identification

Consider the following general characterization of the amount of lending by bank b to
firm i at time t:
                                        Libt = L LSbt , LD
                                                                  
                                                         it , Libt .                                   (4)

Bank-firm outstanding credit is an equilibrium outcome at time t, determined by the over-
all supply of credit by the bank, LSbt , which varies with bank-level variables such as over-
all liquidity, balance-sheet position, etc.; the firm’s overall demand for credit LD
                                                                                   it , which

varies with firm-level productivity, demand for its products, investment opportunities,
etc.; and, finally, a firm-bank specific component, Libt , our object of interest: the compo-
nent of bank-b’s lending that depends on its relative advantage in markets supplied by
the firm i.
       Our baseline empirical specification isolates the bank-firm pair component of lend-
ing, Libt , using saturated regressions. Specifically, we account for the bank-specific credit
supply shocks LSbt (common in expectation across all firms) and all firm-specific credit
demand shocks LD
               it (common in expectation across all banks) by saturating the empirical
                                                           00
model with a full set of bank-time and firm-time dummies, αbt and αit0 .17 Thus, for each
country-bank-firm-year, our baseline specification is:

                         c
              ln Libt = αib + αit0 + αbt
                                      00
                                         + β1 ln Xitc + β2 Sibt
                                                            c         c
                                                                + β3 Sibt × ln Xitc + cibt ,          (5)


where Libt is the observed amount of debt of firm i from bank b at time t, Xitc are exports
                               c
from firm i to country c, and Sibt is a measure of bank specialization in country c. Under
the null hypothesis that funding across banks is perfectly substitutable, β3 = 0, mean-
ing that firm exports to a country are not systematically correlated with borrowing from
banks specialized in that country.
  17
    This methodology builds on the recent literature that uses micro-data to account for firm credit demand
shocks that are common across all banks with firm-time dummies, and for bank credit supply shocks that
are common across all firms with bank-time dummies (see, for example, Jimenez et al., 2014). Estimation
based on demeaning the dependent variable instead of using fixed effects yields biased results (Gormley
and Matsa, 2014).

                                                    17
                                                             c
       The measure of specialization used in this analysis, Sibt , is based on a rolling period
of three years up to the year of the loan: for every year t, it corresponds to the fraction of
years between t − 2 and t in which bank b is an outlier in the loan distribution associated
with country c.18 To avoid any potential spurious correlation between lending by bank b
to firm i (Libt ) and the specialization measure of bank b, we employ the following leave-
one-out measures of the share of bank b’s borrower exports to country c to construct the
specialization measure:
                                                  PI                 c
                                    c                   k6=i   Lbkτ Xkτ
                                   S(−i)bτ   ≡ PC PI                        c
                                                                                 ,                   (6)
                                                  c=1          k6=i   Lbkτ Xkτ

       Using this leave-one-out share in our measure of specialization in Definition 1 leads
to the following firm-varying measure of bank specialization:

       Note that although outstanding debt is a firm-bank-year value, Libt , there are 22 re-
lationships like the one in (5) for each firm-bank-year—one for each country c in our
analysis sample. To estimate the parameters of (5), we stack the observations for all coun-
tries and adjust the standard errors for clustering at the bank and firm level to account
for the fact that Libt is constant across countries for a given bank-firm-time triplet. The set
                                                    c
of time-invariant firm-bank-country fixed effects, αib , accounts for all unobserved hetero-
geneity in the firm-bank-country lending relationship, such as the distance between bank
headquarters and the destination country.
       The advantage of the revealed preference approach for identifying the existence of
lending advantages is that it can generalized to other settings. Our framework can be
used as long as there is variation across activities and banks have lending advantages
across activities (e.g., bank specialization by industry). Moreover, our framework does
not require parametric assumptions. We are testing the following joint hypothesis: that
  18
    As an alternative, we also constructed estimates based on two-year and four-year rolling windows. The
results are qualitatively and quantitatively unchanged.


                                                    18
banks have advantages in lending, and that our measure of specialization captures it. The
disadvantage is that the magnitude of the covariance measure, β3 , requires careful inter-
pretation. Thus, we turn next to estimating elasticities to demand and supply shocks,
which have direct economic meaning and provide information on the magnitude of lend-
ing advantages.19


4.2      Elasticity of Credit Demand to Exports

To obtain the elasticity of credit to changes in the demand for exports we use again specifi-
cation (5), and estimate it by instrumenting exports to country c, Xitc , with two macroeco-
nomic performance measures in the destination country: real appreciations and variation
in GDP growth in the country of destination. We implement this strategy by adding the
destination country exchange rate and GDP growth as instruments in the first stage re-
gression.20 This exercise is similar to the gravity equation estimates in Fitzgerald and
Haller (2014), which uses firm-destination-year export data from Ireland and absorbs any
firm-level change in costs or productivity with firm-time fixed effects.21
       The exclusion restriction is that foreign export demand variation and its interaction
with bank specialization only affect firm borrowing through its effect on export activity.
This assumption is plausible given that any direct effect of international macroeconomic
shocks on bank lending is controlled for through bank-time and firm-time fixed effects, αit
and αbt . In fact, it is to expect that, given bank abnormal exposure towards the country of
specialization, destination-country innovations in macroeconomic performance may be
correlated with credit supply. This general variation in bank credit supply is absorbed by
  19
      An equivalent approach to test for bank specialization is to regress lending on firm and bank time effects
and examine whether the residuals are persistent. Our test is more stringent, as it requires the residuals to
be correlated with our measure bank-industry specialization interacted with exports.
   20
      The fixed-effects specification implies that our estimates derive from changes in the exchange rate level
and changes in the growth rate of GPD.
   21
      Fitzgerald and Haller (2014) also analyze the effect of tariffs on export because they want to compare
the effect of low-frequency tariff changes with high-frequency exchange rate changes. Tariffs are less useful
in our setting because they tend to be uniform across destination countries and only change infrequently.
See also Berman et al. (2012) for the effect of real exchange rate shocks on exports using firm-country panel
data for French firms.


                                                      19
the bank-time fixed effects. Therefore, coefficient β3 in this specification can be interpreted
as the elasticity of the firm-bank credit component (Libt in equation 2) to destination-
specific export variation for banks specialized in the destination country, relative to non-
specialized banks (for which the elasticity is β1 ).


4.3    Elasticity of Exports to Credit Supply

The goal is to evaluate how shocks to the credit supply of specialized banks affect firm
output in the market of specialization (relative to other markets). To isolate bank-specific
credit supply shocks, we use the empirical setting in Paravisini et al. (2015) (hereafter,
PRSW): bank-level heterogeneity in the exposure to the 2008/09 financial crisis as an in-
strument for changes in credit supply. In 2008, international portfolio capital inflows to
Peru decreased sharply, and, as a result, funding to banks with a high share of interna-
tional liabilities dropped substantially. To account for variation in the demand for exports
PRSW use country of destination-product-time dummies. We augment their analysis to
assess whether a bank credit supply shock has a larger impact on exports to the bank’s
country of specialization:

                    c      c      c                     c         c
                ln Xipt = αibp + αpt + β1 ln Libt + β2 Sibt + β3 Sibt × ln Libt + cibpt             (8)

       c
where Xipt is the (volume) of exports of product p by firm i to country c during the inter-
vals t = {P re, P ost}, P re and P ost periods correspond to the 12 months before and after
July 2008. Libt is firm-i’s credit from bank-b in the period t. We instrument the change in
credit supply in t = P ost with Exposedb × P ostt , where Exposedb is a dummy equal to 1
if the bank has a share of foreign debt above 10% in 2006, and P ostt is a dummy equal to
1 during the 12 moths after July 2008.22 Together with the results, we show in Subsection
5.3, that this instrumental approach is still valid in the context of specialized banks. The
coefficient β3 in specification 8 can be interpreted as the elasticity of exports to credit sup-
  22
    The threshold is the average exposure taken across the 13 commercial banks in 2006. The entire sample
of 41 banks also includes 28 S&Ls at year-end 2006 with minimal exposure.

                                                   20
ply for banks specialized in the market of export destination, relative to other banks (for
which with elasticity is β1 ).
                                                                      c
    The regression includes firm-product-bank-country fixed effects, αipb , which control
for all (time-invariant) unobserved heterogeneity across firms and banks in exporting that
product to that destination.23 It also includes a full set of country-product-time dummies,
 c
αpt , that accounts for non-credit determinants of exports. In particular, these dummies
account for demand shocks originated in narrowly defined export markets.24 Note that
                                                       c
although export is a firm-product-country-year value, Xipt , the right-hand side of the
relationship (8) varies also at the bank level. To estimate the parameters in (8), we stack
the observations for all banks and adjust the standard errors for clustering at the product-
                                            c
country level to account for the fact that Xipt is constant across banks for a given product-
country-firm-time combination.
    A coefficient estimate β3 > 0 indicates that, for a given firm, the elasticity of exports to
a bank credit supply shock is larger for exports to countries in which the bank specializes
in. This specification tests an augmented joint hypothesis: that banks have advantages
in lending, that our measure of specialization captures it, and that firms cannot easily
substitute credit from specialized banks to sustain export activities. The importance of
the last component of the joint hypothesis lies in that if it were rejected, then differences
in bank advantages would have no impact on the patterns of exporting activity. Finding
β3 > 0 implies that bank advantages do affect exports and competition across lenders.



5     Bank Specialization, Lending, and Exports

This section presents the estimates from the three empirical specifications described in
Section 4: 1) a test of whether the correlation between credit and exports is larger for
  23
     Our approach is stringent in that we control for time-invariant bank specialization at the firm-product-
bank-country level and only use variation over time. We examine time-invariant bank specialization in our
analysis of global banks in section 7.1.
  24
     Products are defined according to the four-digit categories of the Harmonized System. For example,
product-country-time dummies account for changes in the demand for cotton T-shirts from Germany.

banks specialized in the market of destination (revealed preference), 2) an estimate of
the effect of demand shocks to product markets on the demand for credit of specialized
banks, and 3) an estimate of the effect of a supply shock from a specialized bank on output
in the market of specialization.


5.1      Revealed Preference Results

We present in Table 4, column 1, the estimates of specification 5. Our coefficient of interest
on the interaction of exports and the specialization measure is positive and significant at
the 1% level. This result shows that when a firm expands its exports to a country, it
increases its borrowing disproportionately from banks that specialize in the same country.
The inclusion of firm-time fixed effects implies this correlation holds within a firm: if a
firm’s export composition shifts from country A to country B, its borrowing composition
shifts from a bank specialized in country A to a bank specialized in country B.25 The
bank-time fixed effects imply that this correlation is not driven by generic shocks to credit
supply that affect all firms in the same manner.
       To interpret the magnitude of the effect, we compare the estimates for specialized and
non-specialized lenders in the same specification. The coefficient on exports with non-
specialized lenders is 0.024, while the point estimate on the interaction term of exports
and the specialization measure is 0.019. The relative size of the coefficients implies that,
for the same change in exports to a country, the increase in borrowing is 79% larger for
banks specialized in that country, relative to non-specialized banks.
       These results reject the hypothesis that debt is perfectly substitutable across banks,
and confirm that banks have advantages in lending to the countries in which they spe-
cialize in. The results also validate that our measure of specialization captures lending
advantages.
  25
    This coefficient captures the correlation between the firm-bank specific component of debt and the
firm’s average exports to the countries in which bank b does not specialize. Note that there is independent
bank-firm variation in exports —variation that is not captured by the firm-time dummies— because not all
banks specialize in the same countries.



                                                    22
5.2      Export Demand and Credit

Table 4, columns 2 and 3, present the first-stage and instrumental variables (IV) estimation
of specification 5, using GDP growth and real exchange rate in the destination country
(and their interaction with specialization) as an instrument for export demand (and its
interaction with specialization).
       The first stage (Table 4, Column 2) is a regression of exports to country i on GDP
growth and real exchange rate in the destination country. The coefficients on both vari-
ables are positive and significant, and the F-statistic exceeds 30. The same is true for the
second first-state regression (not shown for brevity), in which the left hand-side variable
is the interaction of exports to country i with the specialization measure.
       The IV estimates of the elasticity of credit from specialized and non-specialized banks
to an export demand shock (Table 4, Column 3) are both positive. However, the credit
elasticity from non-specialized banks is noisily estimated and not statistically different
from zero. In contrast, the point estimate of the credit elasticity from specialized banks
(relative to non-specialized ones) is 0.169 and statistically different from zero.26
       The elasticity to an export demand shock of credit from specialized banks is 50% larger
than from non-specialized banks. The order of magnitude of the effect of specialization
on the elasticity is similar to the effect of specialization on the covariance of exports and
credit obtained in the revealed preference approach above (79%). This result is important
because it implies that lending advantages have a first order impact on firms’ marginal
credit demand decisions. The result also implies that the same export market shock will
have very heterogeneous impact across banks with different markets of specialization.
       We note that the point estimates of the credit elasticities are an order of magnitude
larger than the OLS estimates discussed in the previous subsection (column 1). The IV
approach isolates the variation in exports and credit due to market-specific export de-
mand shocks. In contrast, the OLS estimates of the revealed preference approach capture
  26
     A one-standard deviation in specialization is 0.17. Hence, a one-standard deviation increase in special-
ization raises the credit elasticity by 2.9%.



                                                     23
covariances between exports to a country and borrowing from specialized banks that
may be driven by export-demand shocks, firm shocks (e.g., productivity, credit, etc) and
product shocks (e.g, changes in world prices, cost). The comparison of the two estimates
indicates that a small fraction of the total variation in exports is driven by aggregate de-
mand shocks in the country of destination.


5.3   Credit Supply and Exports

The results so far indicate that banks have lending advantages across different markets
and that firms demand credit disproportionately from specialized banks to expand output
in their market of specialization. These results, however, do not answer the question of
whether differences in bank lending advantages are large or whether they have important
implications for output. The reason is that even small differences in lending advantages
may lead to large swings in demand across banks if banks are close substitutes as capital
suppliers. To shed light on this issue we turn to exploring how a firm’s output in a market
responds to changes in the supply of credit from specialized and non-specialized banks.
   Table 4, columns 5 and 6, presents the OLS and IV estimates of specification 8. The
endogenous variable, credit by bank b to firm i, and its interaction with bank special-
ization, are instrumented with the bank exposure instrument, Exposedb × P ostt , and its
interaction with specialization measures. Table 4, column 4, shows the bank exposure
instrument is negatively and significantly correlated with lending, implying that banks
with more exposure to foreign liabilities reduced lending more after the crisis. The two
first stage regressions have F-statistics of 7.1 and 16.
   The IV estimate in column 6 measures the elasticity of exports to a market to a credit
supply shock and how this elasticity varies with the specialization of the bank in that
market. The point estimates imply that a 10% reduction in a bank’s credit supply leads
to a 7% decline in exports to countries in which the bank specializes in, and a 1% decline
in exports to countries in which the bank does not specialize in. All point estimates are
precisely estimated and the difference between the export elasticities across specialized

                                              24
and non-specialized lenders is statistically significant at the 10%-level.27
    These elasticity estimates and their variation with bank specialization imply that lend-
ing advantages make specialized bank credit difficult to substitute. It implies that even
isolated shocks to the balance sheet of one bank may have a large impact on output in
the market where the bank has lending advantages. It also implies that market-specific
lending advantages hinder competition across seemingly similar lenders. Thus, lending
advantages have important implications for the equilibrium outcomes in credit markets
and their real outcomes. Our proposed measure of specialization provides a useful tool
to analyzing these implications.


5.4    Identifying Credit Supply Shocks

In this subsection we discuss the implications of our findings for the empirical identifi-
cation and measurement of bank credit supply shocks. The state-of-the-art methodology
to empirically identify credit supply shocks relies on the assumption that credit demand
shocks may be accounted for by using empirical models that saturate all firm-time varia-
tion.28 Put simply, the approach assumes that credit demand shocks cannot induce firms
to systematically shift their borrowing from one bank to another, and thus can be con-
trolled for with firm-time fixed effects. This assumption is only true in general if banks
do not have lending advantages and do not specialize, an assumption that is shown not
to hold in our setting. The assumption may hold under restricted circumstances: if the
source of the credit supply shock is uncorrelated with anything affecting specialized de-
mand. We can illustrate in our setting how regressions saturated with firm fixed effects
and augmented with specialization measures can be used to evaluate the validity of this
identification assumption.
   27
      As in the previous subsection, the elasticity estimates (column 6) are much larger than the OLS esti-
mates in (column 5), indicating that a small fraction of the total variation in bank credit during the 2008
financial crisis was driven by credit supply.
   28
      For examples of recent papers using this approach, see Khwaja and Mian, 2008; Paravisini, 2008; Schn-
abl, 2012; Jimenez et al., 2014; Chodorow-Reich, 2014. An alternative approach is to estimate a structural
model of the banking sector, see Egan, Hortaçsu and Matvos, 2017.


                                                    25
   We begin by estimating the standard saturated regression using our dummy measure
of bank exposure to the financial crisis as a source of variation. That is, that Exposedb
–i.e., a dummy equal to 1 if the bank has a share of foreign liabilities above 10% in 2006–
is a predictor of bank-specific credit supply shock during 2008-2009. Using credit data we
estimate the following specification:


                     ln(Libt ) = αib + αit + β · Exposedb × P ostt + νibt ,               (9)

where the definition of the variables and time periods coincide with those in (8). The
regression includes firm-bank fixed effects, αib , which control for all (time-invariant) un-
observed heterogeneity in the demand and supply of credit. It also includes a full set
of firm-time dummies, αit , that control for the firm-specific evolution in credit demand
during the study period.
   The coefficient β measures how lending by exposed and not-exposed banks changed
before and after the capital flow reversals, and it is typically interpreted as the effect of
the capital flow reversals on the supply of credit. The estimated coefficient is presented in
Table 5, column 1 (this is an exact replication of the within-firm estimates in PRSW). The
point estimate suggests that the supply of credit by exposed banks dropped by 16.8%, rel-
ative to not-exposed banks, after the capital flow reversals. However, firm-time dummies
absorb credit demand variation only if a change in firm credit demand is, in expectation,
equally spread across all banks lending to the firm, an assumption that may not hold in
the presence of bank specialization.
  We augment specification 9 with the variable (C(Xic > 0) C(Sibc > 0)) × P ostt . The
                                                            T

dummy (C(Xic > 0) C(Sibc > 0)) is equal to one if the set of countries supplied by firm
                 T

i, C(Xic > 0), has at least one country that belongs to the set of specialization of bank
b, C(Sibc > 0)—i.e., countries for which Sibc defined in (7) is positive in the P re period.
The coefficient on this additional term measures the change in the equilibrium amount
of credit to firms that export to the country in which bank b specializes, relative to the
change in credit to firms that do not. The estimated coefficients of the augmented specifi-

                                              26
cation are shown in Table 5, column 2. The estimated coefficient on the additional term,
−0.199, most likely has a demand interpretation: the global demand for Peruvian exports
declined during 2008, and firms reduced their demand for credit from banks specializing
in their exporting activities. The magnitude of the coefficient indicates that the demand
for export-related credit dropped by 20% during the sample period. Thus, the variable
(C(Xic > 0) C(Sibc > 0)) recovers bank-specific credit demand shocks that are not ac-
             T

counted for by the firm-time dummies in specification 9.29
   Adding (C(Xic > 0) C(Sibc > 0)) to specification 9 does not have a statistically sig-
                        T

nificant impact on the magnitude of the coefficient on Exposedb . This implies that, in the
context of the PRSW application, the foreign funding shock affecting Peruvian banks was
virtually uncorrelated with confounding effects related to the banks’ export market of ex-
pertise. This is a necessary condition for disentangling credit supply from credit demand.
       The signs and magnitudes of the estimated supply and demand effects are informative
of the potential bias that may result if the two sources of variation simultaneously affect
the bank and its market of expertise. Both estimates have the same sign, indicating that,
in this setting, confounding demand and supply would lead to an overestimation of the
credit supply shock. The magnitude of the potential bias is large. Interpreting the entire
within-firm variation in credit as supply-driven would lead to overestimating the size of
the supply shock by a factor of 2.3 —i.e, (0.199 + 0.155)/0.155.30
       We emphasize that the results are estimated in the context of the 2008 financial crisis.
In a financial crisis banks are likely to be credit constrained, which may strengthen the
effect of bank specialization on lending outcomes. Even though the coefficient may be
different during regular times, the estimate in a crisis period is an important parameter
for policy analysis because it is during a financial crisis that the welfare cost of credit
  29
      An alternative explanation for the negative coefficient is that bank specialization is correlated with loan
losses, which reduced bank equity and therefore affected lending. We believe this explanation is unlikely
to explain our findings since Peruvian banks were not directly exposed to the U.S. financial crisis and loan
delinquencies were in line with historical standards.
   30
      We focus on comparing the coefficients rather than the marginal R2 because most variation in bank
specialization is controlled for by fixed effects.



                                                       27
supply shocks may be the largest.
         The role of market-specific bank specialization is also important when considering al-
ternative methods for estimating the impact of credit supply shocks. For example, Amiti
and Weinstein (2018) develop a methodology to separate firm borrowing shocks from
bank supply shocks with matched bank-firm data. The paper notes that the approach
is based on the assumption that all variation in lending is either firm or bank specific,
as is often assumed in the financial intermediation literature. However, this assump-
tion may not hold in a setting with market-specific bank specialization because market-
specific shocks affect only certain lending relationship within bank and only certain activ-
ities within a firm, thereby violating the identification assumption. Similar to the setting
above, one therefore needs to adjust for market-specific bank specialization when apply-
ing this methodology.



6         Market Advantage vs Relationship Lending

In our analysis so far we have assumed that banks may have advantages in lending to
firms operating in a market or sector of economic activity. This type of market- or sector-
specific advantages are potentially distinct from the firm-specific advantages in lending
emphasized by the existing literature on banking and relationship lending.31 The dis-
tinction is important because market-specific and firm-specific advantages have different
implications for the industrial organization of bank credit markets but may lead to the
same observed phenomena. For example, consider the following two rationales for firms
borrowing from multiple lenders. In the presence of market-specific advantages, the firm
borrows from lenders specialized in each market it operates in to exploit the lending ad-
vantages. In the presence of firm-specific advantages, in contrast, firms borrow from
multiple lenders to avoid the monopoly rents that a privately inform bank extracts from

it.
           In this section we explore whether the lending advantages uncovered here are market-
specific or firm-specific, through three approaches: 1) by estimating whether specializa-
tion predicts extensive margin decision of where to export and whom to borrow from, 2)
by exploring the connection between lending advantage and the size of firms and banks,
and 3) by exploring the lending advantage patterns of banks before and after a merger or
acquisition.


6.1          New Banking Relationships and Export Entry

The basic premise behind the firm-specific advantages gained through relationship lend-
ing is the following: banks gather private information through repeated interactions with
a firm, which implies an advantage vis a vis other uninformed banks. If the observed pat-
terns of specialization in export markets and their associated advantages are firm-specific,
then our specialization measure should not predict firm behavior in the extensive mar-
gin. We begin by testing whether the probability that a firm starts borrowing from a bank
increases after the firm starts exporting to the country of specialization.32 We estimate the
following linear probability model (parallel to specification 5):

                                        c
               (Libt > 0|Libt−1 = 0) = αib + αit0 + αbt

                                                                              = 0) + β2 Sibt

       Our coefficient of interest in specifications 10 and 11 is β3 . A coefficient β3 > 0 indi-
cates that the probability of starting to borrow from a bank increases after the firm starts
exporting to the bank’s country of specialization (equation 10), or that the probability of
starting exporting to a given destination increases after the firm starts borrowing from a
bank specialized in that country (equation 11).
       Table 6, columns 1 and 2, present the OLS estimates of the entry margin specifica-
tions in (10) and (11) respectively.33 The coefficient estimates in column 1 indicate that
exporting to a new destination increases the probability of starting a banking relationship
                              c
with a non-specialized bank (Sibt =0) by 0.06 percentage points. Instead, the probability
of starting a banking relationship with a bank that has specialized in that destination for
                                 c
the full sample period up to t (Sibt =1) increases by 0.40 percentage points, almost seven
times more than with a non-specialized bank. This is an economically large effect given
that the unconditional probability that an exporter starts a new relationship with a bank
at any point in time is 0.74%.
       The probability of exporting to a new country increases by 2.6 percentage points the
year after a firm starts borrowing from a bank specialized in that destination (column
2). There is no effect for non-specialized lenders. To assess the economic importance of
this effect, we compare the magnitude of the coefficient with the unconditional probabil-
ity that an exporting firm with positive credit adds a new destination in any given year
(0.69%). It follows that the likelihood of exporting to a new destination increases 4.8 times
  33
    The sample for this estimation is the combination of all possible bank-firm relationships—meaning all
the bank-firm pairs that do not have a positive outstanding balance in any given year (thus the large sample
size and the low probability of a new relationship).



                                                    30
after a firm starts borrowing from a specialized bank.
   Taken together, these results indicate that bank specialization plays an important role
in financing export activity even when the firm and the bank have no prior lending re-
lationship. The extensive margin results underline the presence of market-specific bank
advantages in lending, as opposed to firm-specific ones emphasized by prior work on re-
lationship lending.


6.2   Specialization and Bank and Firm Size

We explore the connection between lending advantage and the size of firms and banks.
This is motivated by the theoretical framework in Stein (2002), which suggests that there is
a trade-off between bank and firm size and the firm-specific advantage generated through
relationship lending. The informational wedge between insider and outsider banks is
understood to be more acute for small firms, which are more opaque than large corpora-
tions. Moreover, this firm-specific information is understood to be lost in large banks, as
it is communicated across more hierarchical layers of the organization (soft information).
In contrast, if the source of the lending advantage is scalable, not only will the advantage
persist for large banks and firms, but the banks with larger advantages will be larger.
   Table 7, columns 1 and 2, show the correlation between our measure of specialization,
defined in (7), and bank size, measured by total (real) lending in Peru. Since foreign-
owned banks are much larger than implied by their lending in Peru, we also include the
dummy F oreignbt to capture this global size difference. Larger and foreign-owned banks
are not more likely, in the cross-section, to specialize in export markets (column 1). For a
given bank over time (column 2), the number of countries in which banks specialize does
not grow with size, but banks do increase their set of specialization after being acquired
by a foreign bank.
   We are interested in whether the patterns obtained from estimating the baseline re-
gressions in Table 4 are similar in the cross-section of bank size and foreign ownership
status. We estimate specification 5 augmented with interactions of the right-hand-side

                                            31
variables with F oreignbt and SmallBankb , a dummy equal to 1 if b is not one of the ten
largest institutions measured in total loans over the full sample period.34 The results are
reported in Table 7, columns 3 and 4. The coefficient on exports interacted with special-
ization is similar to that in the baseline specification in Table 4. This implies that the ten
largest banks in Peru have a significant advantage in lending to the countries in which
they specialize. The coefficient on the interaction with SmallBankb is negative but sta-
tistically insignificant (column 3). Although the point estimate is noisily estimated, its
magnitude suggests that smaller banks may have a smaller lending advantage or none at
all. Similarly, the lending advantages of foreign and domestic banks are not significantly
different from each other (column 4). In column 5 we analyze whether the lending advan-
tage is related to the firm size, measured by total exports. The correlation between export
flows and credit is larger for firms in the top 10% of the total exports distribution during
at least one year in our sample. But the lending advantage, measured by the interaction
      c
term Sibt × ln Xitc , does not vary across firm size.


6.3      Transmission of Lending Advantage into Merged Banks

To further explore the transmission and communication of the lending advantage within
the financial institution, we explore the lending patterns of banks before and after a
merger or acquisition. We test whether the pattern of lending advantage that character-
ized the two banks prior to the M&A is preserved and expanded to the entire corporation
after the merger.
       We modify the data and specification 5 to perform event studies around the years in
which bank mergers take place. Eight-year interval subsamples around the time of the
merger—four years before and four years after the event—are drawn from the original
data and stacked to perform a single estimation. We use as a measure of bank special-
ization the variable defined in Definition 1, Sibc = O(Sibt
                                                        c
                                                            ), computed the year before the
  34
   Since not all banks appear in all years, we rank the banks according to their average inflation-adjusted
amount of total loans outstanding during the years they appear in the sample to create this variable.



                                                    32
merger. We combine the merging entities into a single one before the merger, and we
use the maximum of the outlier indicators of the two banks as a measure of their com-
bined specialization (e.g., if, before the merger, bank 1 specialized in country A and bank
2 specialized in country B, then the combined entity is considered to specialize in A and
B before the merger).
   We first replicate our baseline estimation in (5) without the merger interaction term to
corroborate that the point estimates are robust to the change in sample and specification
(Table 8, column 1). The coefficients on the term Sibc × ln(Xitc ) are positive and signif-
icant, similar in magnitude to those in our baseline result in Table 4. The relationship
between exports and lending is somewhat smaller (0.012 vs. 0.024 in the baseline re-
gression), which implies that, in this subsample, the elasticity between exports and bank
credit of specialized banks is about 130% larger than for non-specialized banks (it was
79% in the baseline regression).
   In column 2, these regressions are augmented with the interaction of M ergerbt , a
dummy equal to 1 during the four years after the event for the merging entity. We
also augment the bank-time, firm-time, and bank-country sets of dummies with an event
dummy interaction (e.g., there is a separate bank-time dummy for every merger event).
The coefficient on the triple interaction with the Merger indicator, Sibc × ln(Xitc ) × M ergerbt ,
measures whether the link between the specialization and lending is affected by the
merger. The point estimate in column 2 is positive and statistically significant at the 5%
level. That is, the merged entity inherits, and even deepens, the specialization of the
original banks.
   These results imply that banks retain their capabilities in their markets of specializa-
tion even as they grow or merge into larger institutions. Thus, the source of the lending
advantage analyzed here is distinct from that derived from firm-specific information (as
emphasized in Stein, 2002), and it is not hindered by organizational constraints.

7    Characterization of the Bank Lending Advantage

Banks provide a variety of services supporting firms’ export activities. Bartoli et al. (2011)
report the results of a survey on Italian firms precisely about this question. They find
that, beyond ordinary services such as online payments or insurance and guaratees, there
is a substantial request of advisory services, in the form of legal and financial advisory,
in loco support during fairs, and investment opportunities abroad. These services and
the cross-bank advantage in providing them are typically unobservable. And, even if
they were observable, one cannot conclude that specialization implies an underlying bank
advantage on the provision of that specific service.
    To illustrate this point, consider for example the case of letters of credit, which is an
observable financial instrument that can be associated to a specific export destination.
Niepmann and Schmidt-Eisenlohr (2014) document that U.S. banks are specialized in ex-
port countries when issuing letters of credits, which coincides with the specialization
patterns in Subsection 3.2. However, one cannot conclude whether the bank specializa-
tion implies an advantage in the issuing of letters of credit towards a specific destina-
tion, or whether the demand for such instrument is a consequence of another underlying
destination-linked bank advantage. Then, although our methodology can identify the ex-
istence and importance of a lending advantage associated to an export destination, the
specific source of the bank lending advantage is unknown.
    In this section we use our empirical methodology to characterize the lending advan-
tage in our data, which narrows down potential mechanisms. First, we explore whether
bank specialization patterns are related to the international presence of global banks such
as the country of ownership and the location of international subsidiaries. Second, we ex-
amine whether the local distribution of bank branches is correlated with the geographical
distribution of firms exporting to same destinations. And finally, we explore an alterna-
tive source of lending specialization based on the mix of products exported by the firms.




                                             34
7.1      International Presence of Global Banks

We first evaluate the correlation between our measure of bank specialization in a country
and the variables that capture the geographical advantages conferred by the ownership
country and subsidiary network. Table 9, column 1, shows the cross-sectional correlation
between the bank-country specialization index and: 1) CountryOwnershipcb , a dummy
equal to 1 if bank b’s headquarters are located in country c; 2) CountrySubsidiarybc , a
dummy equal to 1 if bank b has a subsidiary in country c in 2004;35 3) CommonLanguagecb ,
a dummy equal to 1 if the language in bank b’s headquarters coincides with that in coun-
try c; and 4) DistanceT oHeadquarterscb between the country of ownership and the export
destination c.36 For this cross-sectional analysis, we use the measure of specialization in
                 c
Definition 1, O(Sbt ), averaged during the entire life of the bank.37 We find that, indeed,
there is a connection between the bank’s country of ownership and the set of special-
ization. Banks are more likely to specialize in the country of their headquarters or in
countries with the same language.
       We then explore whether the bank’s country of ownership is a sufficient statistic of
the market-specific lending advantages found in our baseline regressions in Table 4. If
lending advantages were driven exclusively by the location and network of the headquar-
ters, including the above variables in our baseline revealed preference regression would
make the specialization measure redundant. We explore this possibility by expanding
the baseline regression in (5) with the four indicators above, interacted with exports (i.e.,
CountryOwnershipcb ×ln(Xitc ), CountrySubsidiarybc ×ln(Xitc ), CommonLanguagecb ×ln(Xitc ),
DistanceT oHeadquarterscb × ln(Xitc )). Results are presented in Table 9, columns 2 and 3.
None of these interaction terms is statistically significant, and their inclusion in the re-
  35
      We construct the subsidiary network using Bankscope data. We start by identifying the ultimate owner
of the Peruvian bank (e.g., Citibank U.S. for Citibank Peru). We then use the Bankscope subsidiary data
to identify all countries in which the ultimate owner has a subsidiary as of 2005 (e.g., all countries with
Citibank subsidiaries).
   36
      We obtain these bilateral measures from Mayer and Zignago (2011).

gression does not change the magnitude or the significance of the interaction of exports
and specialization.38
       We conclude that, even though our specialization measure is correlated with the bank’s
country of ownership, banks’ advantage in lending for an export destination cannot be
summarized as a home-country advantage.


7.2      Geographical Distribution of Local Branches

Another potential source of destination-specific lending advantage is the geographical
proximity between exporters and banks in Peru. If firms that export to a specific country
are geographically clustered, then banks that have a larger presence in that area may end
up specializing in funding exports to this country.
       There are 1,853 districts in Peru and each denotes a relatively small geographical area.
Exporter location, obtained from the tax authority web page (SUNAT), is concentrated
in 305 districts, and the top ten districts account for 52.3% of the exporters. Bank branch
location data are from the bank supervision agency in Peru and are only available after
2001, so we restrict the sample to the 2001 to 2010 period for this analysis. Bank branch
location is also geographically concentrated. The 1,455 bank branches in Peru in 2010
were located in only 144 districts.
       We test whether the destination-specific lending advantage can be explained by local
clustering. To do so, we augment the baseline regression 5 with two measures of prox-
imity between firm i and bank b (and their interaction with firm exports, ln(Xitc )): 1) a
dummy if bank b has a branch in year t in the district in Peru where firm i is located,
and 2) the number of branches that bank b has in year t in the district where firm i is lo-
cated. Table 10, column 1, replicates the baseline regression estimates on the 2001 to 2010
and obtains very similar estimates to those in Table 4. Column 2, shows the estimated
coefficients on the specification augmented with the local distance variables and their in-
  38
    Our results are different from those in Bronzini and D’Ignazio (2012). Using a different methodology
and data from Italian firms, they find that the geographical distribution of the bank foreign subsidiaries
affects the export performance of related firms.


                                                   36
teraction with firm exports. We find that the coefficient on the interaction between the
bank specialization measure and exports does not change after the inclusion of the local
geography variables. This implies that local distance to a branch does not explain the
bank advantages related to specialization.


7.3   Product or Destination Advantage?

There are potentially many confounding effects behind banks advantage in lending to-
wards export destinations. In our sample, for example, export markets differ greatly in
the mix of Peruvian products demanded. Coffee, which in 2010 totaled approximately
2.5% of Peruvian exports, accounted for 18% of the exports towards Germany. Possibly,
banks’ advantage in lending to firms exporting to Germany may not only involve exper-
tise related to this destination but also on monitoring the activities of coffee producers.
   We test for industry-specific lending advantage in Table 10, column 3. We further
disaggregate firms’ annual exports into product-destination flows, Xitpc (products defined
according to 2-digit categories of the Harmonized System). We can therefore analyze
                                                                                      c
whether the baseline measure of bank specialization based on country of destination (Sibt )
                                      p
or the one based on export products (Sibt ) is a better predictor of the pattern of credit.
When both interactions are included, the baseline results are maintained. The elasticity
of credit to exports, at the product-destination level, is 53% larger for a bank that has
been specialized in the country of destination during the whole sample relative to a non-
specialized bank. The interaction with product-specialization, on the other hand, turns
insignificant when the two measures of specialization are included. We conclude that in
our sample, although both measures of specialization are highly correlated, bank special-
ization on export destination is a better predictor of bank lending patterns.




                                             37
8    Conclusions

Our paper proposes a new measure of market-specific bank specialization that captures
a bank’s expertise in evaluating projects in specific markets. Using data an all Peruvian
firms and exports between 1994 and 2010, we measure market-specific bank specialization
for each bank and export market and show that market-specific bank specialization is an
important determinant of the supply of bank credit and export activity, independent of
firm-specific information gathered through relationship lending.
    The findings in this paper have important implications for the industrial organization
of bank credit markets. Market-specific bank specialization provides a new rationale for
why firms have multiple banking relationships and why banks form syndicates. The
reason is that firms borrow from more than one bank because they value banks’ market-
specific specialization across different markets. Hence, multiple lending relationships
naturally emerge in a setting with specialized banks and multi-market firms. Market-
specific bank specialization can also explain why there are limits to bank diversification.
    The paper also has important implications for the assessment of credit supply shocks
such as those caused by bank failures, runs, liquidity shortages, or tight monetary condi-
tions. If bank expertise varies across markets or activities, then a credit supply shortage
by a single bank may have first-order effects on the real output of the market or activity in
which the bank specializes. Hence, the results in this paper call for caution when apply-
ing the empirical strategy—now standard in identifying the lending supply channel—of
absorbing the demand for credit with firm-time fixed effects. This methodology relies on
banks being perfectly substitutable sources of funding for firms with whom they already
have a credit relationship. Our results suggest that this assumption may not hold in the
presence of market-specific bank specialization.

entire sample period. Columns 2 and 3 show the results of an augmented
version of specification 5 (demeaned). CountryOwnershipcb is a dummy
equal to 1 if the destination country of the export flow coincides with the
country of ownership of the bank. Similarly CountrySubsidiarybc is equal
to 1 if the bank has a subsidiary in the destination country of the export
flow. The variables distance (in (log) km) and common language (dummy
variable) refer to the connection between the bank’s country of ownership
and the export destination. Standard errors are two-way clustered at the
bank and firm levels. ***p< 0.01, **p < 0.05, and *p < 0.1.

A.1     Data simulation of a discrete choice model
In this appendix we simulate data to illustrate how a simple version of the discrete choice
model of firms, borrowing from banks with different lending advantages, translates into a
distribution of loan-weighted export shares used to measure specialization in Subsection
3.2. We purposely simplify the framework to make it symmetric. Thus, any heterogeneity
across banks in the simulated data comes from firms’ bank choice.
    The firm-i’s choice of bank for export market c is given by equation (1):
                                              c          
                                                  γb      c
                                b = arg max ln         µib
                                                  rb

where cib is a random variable drawn from Gumbel(1,1) distribution.
    In this simulation, markets are perfectly competitive, each firm exports $1 to only one
country (a firm is an activity) and an equal number of firms exports to each destination
(therefore, all countries have the same market size). Banks are symmetric; that is, rb = r
for all b, the lending advantage takes two values only, γcb = {γH , γL }, with γH > γL , and we
assume that banks are specialized in a single country. That is, for each bank b, there is only
one country c for which γbc = γH . We set the parameter γH and γL so that log(γH /r) = 1
and log(γL /r) = 0. Without loss of generality, we normalize r to one.
    The simulations presented here are generated with 100,000 firms, nine banks, b =
b1...b9, and nine export markets, c = c1...c9 of equal size. Bank b1 has lending advantage
in c1; bank b2 has lending advantage in c2, and so on.
    With firm choices simulated this way, we construct the shares of export-weighted
lending for each country-bank pair, as defined in equation 3, Subsection 3.2. To illus-
trate the role of idiosyncratic noise versus bank lending advantage in the identification of
specialization, we show two simulations, Figure A.1 sets µ = 2 and Figure A.2, µ = 20.
    With µ = 2 and cib follows Gumbel(1,1), the random component is still relevant: µ cib
has median 2.73, while the lending advantage parameter ln(γH /rb ) = 1. Still, firms choose
banks on the basis of their lending advantage. The distribution of bank-country lending
shares has clear outliers and all bank are specialized, according to our definition (Figures
A.1a and A.1b) .
    When µ = 20 (Figures A.1c and A.1d), on the other hand, the firms’ idiosyncratic
non-observable motives (i.e., the random component) for choosing the lending bank are
too powerful relative to the advantage parameter. Definition 1 in Subsection 3.2 would
identify only one specialized bank (bank b9 specialized in country c9). In this case, the
bank lending advantage is not a relevant factor behind firms’ choice.
