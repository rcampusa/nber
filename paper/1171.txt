                 CONSENSUS AND UNCERTAINTY IN ECONOMIC PREDICTION


                                       Abstract

     The usual   practice in   economic forecasting is to report point predictions
without specifying the attached probabilities. Periodic surveys of such
forecasts produce group averages, which are taken to indicate the "consensus"
of experts. Measures of the dispersion of individual forecasts around these
averages are interpreted as indicating "uncertainty."

     However, consensus is best defined as the degree of agreement among the
corresponding point predictions reported by different forecasters, while
uncertainty is properly understood as referring to the diffuseness of the
distributions of probabilities that individual forecasters attach to the
different possible values of an economic variable. The NBER-ASA quarterly
economic outlook surveys provide unique information on probabilistic forecast
distributions reported by a large number of individuals for changes in GNP and
the implicit price deflator in 1969-81. These data permit comparisons of
related point and probability forecasts from the same sources.

     The matched mean point forecasts and mean probability forecasts are found
to agree closely. Standard deviations of point forecasts are generally smaller
than the mean standard deviations of the predictive probability distributions
for the same targets. Thus the former tend to understate uncertainty as
measured by the latter. This is so particularly for short horizons.

                     I. Introducing the Problems and Data


     Although all forecasts are by their very nature probabilistic statements,

most economic predictions quote but a single value to be assumed by a certain

variable, without specifying the attached probabilities. Often many such point

forecasts are available for a given target variable from a business outlook

survey. If they show a high degree of agreement, does this indicate that the

forecasters confidently expect the outcome they commonly predict to come true?

More generally, does the dispersion of the point forecasts reflect their

authors' uncertainty (i.e., their relative lack of confidence)? This paper

will deal with these and other related questions, drawing on a set of data

which is very rare in economics in that it includes related point and

probabilistic forecasts from the same sources.


Consensus

     Averages from economic outlook surveys are frequently called "consensus"

forecasts or treated as such. The term has entered the popular discourse with-

out having been defined in a generally accepted way. But it is clear that the

degree to which a survey average is representative of the collected individual

predictions can vary greatly depending on the nature of the underlying distri—

bution. There may be no meaningful consensus if the distribution of the point

forecasts in question is highly diffuse or multimodal; on the other hand, a

consensus would be strongly in evidence for any unimodal, symmetrical, and

sufficiently tight distribution (cf. Schnader and Stekler, 1979).

     The point forecasts for sortie target variable      obtained from a survey

taken in period t could be distributed as shown by the histograms in the

left-hand panel of Figure 1. The smoothed frequency curves represent the cor-

responding theoretical distributions. In such cases the existence of a

    are available (see

 consensus is not in doubt, though the degree of consensus varies (it is clearly

 much higher for I than for II). In the right-hand panel, the distributions

 (shown for simplicity in smoothed form only) are strongly skewed or bimodal so

 that no well-defined consensus may exist.

        Expectations or forecasts for the same aggregate variables are likely to

 draw upon common, publicly available information and widely recognized tech-

 niques and relationships (models)., Also, people interact and influence each

 other directly or indirectly, through informal exchanges, opinion polls, media

 dissemination of public predictions, and market arrangements for the sale of

 expert advice. The lack of independence would tend to produce clustering,

 i.e., tightening of the representative distribution, of the point forecasts.

 This suggests an influential role for the prevalent "consensus" prediction from

 which many risk-averting forecasters may not wish to deviate much at any time.

        For all the above reasons, positive correlations can be expected to pre-

 vail among the corresponding expert forecasts and agent expectations. Yet

 genuine predictions do not simply mimic one another but contain some indepen-

 dent information, so their collinearity will be limited and combining them

 should result in some net gains in accuracy. Indeed, simple averages of fore-

 casts from successive business outlook surveys have proved to be more accurate

 over time than most of the corresponding forecast sets of the individual
                 1
 participants.




     1See Zarnowitz, 1967, pp. 123—126, and 1983a. Methods to choose a
diversified "portfolio" of forecasts and weights that reduce the variance of
the resulting composite have been proposed in the literature, and some success
in their application was reported (Bates and Granger, 1969; !Tewbold and
Granger, 1974). On the conditions under which unweighted aggregate predictions
are optimal or nearly optimal, see Einhorn and Hogarth, 1975; also, Hogarth,
1978.

     An important aspect of the consensus is the dispersion of a sample of

point forecasts, which can be measured simply by standard deviation. If the

cross—sectional distributions of forecasts come in a variety of shapes illus-

trated in Figure 1, however, other aspects such as skewness and modality or

kurtosis will also require attention.


Uncertainty

     Recent studies have used the variance of predicted prices changes across

survey respondents as a positive measure of "inflation uncertainty."2

To generalize, high (low) dispersion of point forecasts is thus interpreted as

being indicative of high (low) uncertainty. Thus "uncertainty" here is simply

an inverse, of what was labeled "consensus" in the previous section.

     It is important to recognize that this approach certainly does not involve

any direct measurement of uncertainty in the usual sense of that term. The

latter is a function of the distribution of the probabilities that a forecaster

attaches to the different possible outcomes (values) of the predicted event

(variable). The tighter this distribution, the lower is the associated

uncertainty. Hence some knowledge of the probabilities involved would seem

necessary for any outside assessment of this aspect of the situation.

Inferences from point forecasts are altogether a different matter.

     Suppose that the standard deviation of a set of corresponding predictions

by different individuals is taken to indicate uncertainty. The underlying

assumption is that this interpersonal dispersion measure is an acceptable proxy

for the dispersion of intrapersonal predictive probabilities or beliefs held by

the same individuals. The validity of this assumption can by no means be taken

for granted.

        The point forecasts reported by the individuals A, B, C, ... may be viewed

 as the expected values of their respective probability distributions. The

 degree of consensus among the survey respondents is said to be "high" when

 their point predictions are clustered, "low" when they are widely dispersed.

 The degree of uncertainty is said to be "high" when the predictive probability

 distributions of A, B, C, ...    are diffuse, "low" when they are tight.
        As illustrated in Fioure 2, high consensus may be associated with either

 low or high uncertainty (compare panels a and b). Similarly, low consensus may

 be associated with either low or high uncertainty (panels c and d). These

 graphs are believed to be self-explanatory, but it should be noted that they

 are of necessity starkly oversimplified. But the schematic diagrams suffice to

 support our main argument concerning the important distinction between

 consensus and uncertainty.

        Recent literature has found both theoretical and empirical reasons to

 stress the role of uncertainty with regard to inflation.3 Uncertainty about

 real growth prospects received little attention but may deserve thuch more. The

 effects of changes in the "confidence" of consumers, investors, and businessmen

 are often emphasized, but these changes themselves and their determinants are

 extremely difficult to measure and analyze. There is little firm knowledge in

 this area, a major reason for this being the lack of data that are directly

 related to uncertainty as defined above.


 Data

        In the sphere of economics, point predictions dominate and reported proba-

 bilistic distribution predictions are regrettably rare. Business outlook

 surveys generally do not collect information on the uncertainty that a partic-

 ipant connects with his or her forecast or expectation. The materials used in

 this study came from a survey which is to our knowledge unique in regularly

 eliciting some replies on this point.

      The survey has been conducted quarterly since 1968 by the National Bureau

 of Economic Research (NBER) and the Business and Economic Statistics Section of

 the American Statistical Association (ASA). The survey questionnaire, mailed

 by ASA, reaches a broadly based and diversified group of persons who are pro-

 fessionally engaged in the analysis of current and prospective business

 conditions. A report on each survey is prepared by NBER, and the historical

 results from the surveys have been used in basic studies by NBER authors and

 others.4

      The ASA-NBER survey members report their point predictions for more than

 ten important macroeconomic variables including the gross national product in

 current dollars and constant dollars and the GNP implicit price deflator (GNP,

 RGNP, and IPD, respectively). These forecasts refer to the currant and the

 next four quarters. In addition, the respondents are asked to fill in the

 probabilities they attach to a list of possible year—to-year percentage changes

 in IPD and GNP (through mid-1981) or RGNP (thereafter). The probabilities are

 specified in percentage form, to add up to 100 in each case. Another regular

 question concerns the probabilities of a downturn in real GNP in each of the

 quarters covered.

      This study covers 80 individuals who participated in at least 12 of the 51

 quarterly ASA-NBER surveys taken during the period 1968:4-1981:2. The total

 number covered was 192, but this includes many sporadic respondents who could

  not be individually evaluated because of paucity of data. The performance of

  these infrequent respondents was on the whole less satisfactory than that of

  the "regulars." Concentration on the latter also improves the quality of the

  data by reducing the variation of the coverage over time.5

       The actual and predicted values are expressed in terms of percentage

  changes, at unit period (quarterly or annual) rates. The actual values used to

  compute the forecast errors are the last estimates available prior to the

 benchmark revisions of January 1976 and December 1980.6

      The sequences of quarters covered by the point forecasts overlap the years

 covered by the probabilistic forecasts, so that we are able to construct time

 series of summary measures for the two sets which are strictly comparable in

 coverage. That is, the paired series refer to the forecasts by the same

 individuals for the same target variables and periods. This analysis, presented

 in the immediately following section, addresses directly the questions raised

 before and forms the core of this paper.


             II. Time Series of Probabilistic Distribution Forecasts


 Samples and Measures

      The NBER—ASA survey questionnaires include the question "Please indicate

 what probabilities you would attach to the following possible percentage

 changes from 19.. to 19.. in current dollar GNP and the implicit price deflator

 (annual figures) .   . •" followed   by lists of one-percent intervals with blank



     5Each of the 51 surveys still has an adequate coverage: on the average 41
participants, with a standard deviation of 10, maximum of 60, and minimum of
21. Each of the 80 individuals also had an adequate exposure: the range is 12
to 34 surveys, with a mean of 23 and a standard deviation of 8.

and errors, and on the role of revisions, see Zarnowitz 1967, 1979, and 1982a;

spaces to write the numbers in. The replies specify the chances in 100 that

the forecasters associate with the changes falling in the selected intervals.

For example, an individual might enter the figures, 15, 35, 40, and 10 in lines

labeled +11.0 to +11.9, +10.0 to +10.9, +9.0 to +9.9, and +8.0 to 8.9 percent,

respectively, for the expected distribution of GNP changes in 1979—80.

     Although the data concern annual changes from year t —   1   to year t,

they come from quarterly surveys extending over the two years, so that the

predictions vary considerably in length. The four consecutive surveys from the

last quarter of year t -1 through the third quarter of year t provide the

bulk of the information. The distances between the dates of these surveys and

the end of the target year are approximately 4—1/2, 3—1/2, 2—1/2, and 1—1/2

quarters. Proceeding in the reverse order from the shortest to the longest

forecasts, we shall refer to these categories simply as horizons 1, .   . ., 4.
     For the years 1969-81, the total number of the reported probabilitistic

forecast distributions (pb) exceeded 4,600, about evenly divided between GNP

and IPD. This "all respondents" sample was subjected to some analysis, but our

main concern is with a smaller sample comprising only those "regulars" who

participated in at least 12 of the 51 surveys covered. Earlier analysis of

data from the same surveys, which had to impose some minimum—response restric-

tion on the individual sets of point forecasts (pt) under study, used the "12

or more" rule to good advantage, and the approach is followed here in the

interest of consistency and comparability.

     We have screened the data from the completed questionnaire forms available

in the NBER files so as to (1) strictly match the pb and pt forecasts made by

the same persons for the same targets, and (2) eliminate unusable replies and

obvious errors. This resulted in a collection of 3,378 individual pb distri-

butions, with a matching number of corresponding pt predictions. The coverage

         This collection does not include the pb predictions issued in the second

 and third quarter of year t -           1   and in the fourth quarter of year t. The

 former cannot be matched with Pt forecasts and the latter are extremely short,

 since by Q4 of t most of the target year is already over and covered by at

 least some preliminary "actuals." Moreover, these replies for horizons "6",

 "5"    and   "0" are available in one or two surveys only.7

         Summary       statistics such as the mean,     standard deviation, skewness, and

 kurtosis     were calculated for      each of the accepted individual probability

 distributions.          Uniform distribution within each     of the selected intervals was

 assumed.      Thus the kth order moment about zero of          the distribution is computed

these pb distributions have pt counterparts. In addition, careful editing led
to the elimination of 210 faulty or unusable replies (120 for GNP, 90 for IPD)
associated with the following reasons: degenerate distributions with single
"100" entries, 116; cases in which the probabilities do not add up to 1.00, 47;
mistaken applications to real rather than nominal GNP, 47.

The mean forecast implicit in the th respondents probability distribution for

horizon h and year t will be denoted as jht (All this applies, of course,

to GNP and IPD forecasts alike.)

     For each jht there is a matching point forecast                       The latter

numbers are computed from corresponding estimates and predictions of quarterly

levels. For example, in the fourth quarter of year t04, a respondent would use

data on the "actual" values of GNP in the preceeding quarters (. .              . A,    A03)

and make predictions through the end of the year t +      1

Accordingly,   the annual percent change forecast for any j          and    t   and for

h = 4 is

Similarly, f3 made in the first quarter of the year t +          1    would equal the

ratio 1oo( P./1A. —i), where the P's and A's are the new quar-

terly level predictions and estimated realizations, respectively (note that

P04 is now replaced by A04). Still more recent predictions and estimates

would be available for f2 (including A11, instead of P11) and

time series of group averages. Thus, the means of the individual probability

distributions are averaged across all members of the "12 or more" sample

 Probabilistic and Point Forecasts: Mean Errors

         Figure 3 compares each of the eight pairs of the h and Fh series in

 terms of the discrepancies of the forecasts from common actual values, that is,

 the group mean errors                 —          and (Fht -                 It demonstrates that the

 paired mean error series are remarkably close in virtually all instances.8

         This is a strong finding of considerable significance. Evidently, the

 respondents on the whole equated their preferred (point) forecass to the

 expected values or means of their predictive probability distributions. As

 shown below, the pb distributions tend to approximate symmetry. For unbiased

 forecasts, these results seem mildly suggestive of symmetrical loss functions,

 though they are not inconsistent with bias or asymmetrical loss functions for

 many of the individuals covered.

         Actually, the forecasts clearly are not free of bias. Of the 46 mean

 errors of       predictions for GNP, H1-H4, (where H denotes the horizon), 34

 (74 percent) are negative. For IPD, the proportion of underestimates is still

 larger (38/46 or 83%). The underestimates are relatively large, particularly

 for IPD, while the overestimates are small. On the average, the mean errors

 are all negative, for either variable and each horizon, as shown in Table 1,

 lines 1—4. Taken without regard to sign, the average error levels tend to

 increase with the horizon, while the corresponding variability measures (in

 brackets) are rather remarkably stable. All of this refers to both the point

 forecasts (columns 2 and 4) and the mean probability forecasts (columns 3 and

 5), confirming the close similarity of the paired        and Fh series.9

 Series of Dispersion LMeasures

      Figure 4 shows the series of the means of the standard deviations calcu-

 lated from the individual probability forecast distributions (s) and matches

 them with the series of standard deviations for the corresponding sets of point

 forecasts (Sf). For the GNP growth rates,        > s in each year at Hi and in

 all but two years at H2, but the differences between       and s are much
 smaller and less systematic at H3 and H4. For the IPD inflation rates, s

 exceed Sf as a general rule (with exceptions of one year each at Hi and H2

 and two years each at H3 and H4). The         series vary much less over time

 than their Sf counterparts.

      Table 1 quantifies some of the inferences from these graphs (lines 5—8).

 The average levels of the        series vary narrowly from .80 to .98 for GNP and

 from .76 to .90 for IPD, with some propensity to increase between iii and H3.




     9The point forecasts for 1968—80 tend to underestimate the inflation (IPD)
rates, increasingly so for the successive quarters of the year ahead, but they
also overestimate the real growth (RGNP) rates, so that the changes in nominal
GNP are predicted with little bias (Zarnowitz, 1983a). However, the mean
errors of the ON? forecasts for the successive quarters (QO, ..., Q4), while
small, are generally negative, and they cumulate. This produces much larger
underestimation errors in the annual forecasts. Thus the average of the
entries in lines 1—4 of Table 1, column 2, is —.63; in contrast, the
approximately comparable figure for the quarterly Pt forecasts is -. 17.

           For coverage, see the tabulation in text. Horizons 1, 2, 3, and 4 refer
      to forecasts of percentage change from year t - 1 to year t in the third,
      second, and first quarters of year t and the fourth quarter of year t — 1,
      respectively. For both the mean errors (lines 1-4) and the standard deviations
      of errors (lines 5—8), entries without brackets are means, entries within
      brackets the corresponding standard deviations. All measures are in percentage
      points, referring to the percent changes at annual rates. The entries in lines
      1—4 correspond to the series shown in Figure 3, those in lines 5-8 to the
      series shown in Figure 4.

  In contrast, the levels of the s series are much lower at Hi and increase

 strongly and monotonically with the horizon, from .37 to 1.11 for GNP and from

  .34 to .68 for IPD. The differences   s —   s   are positive and relatively

 large in six of the eight categories (for GNP—H3 the difference is small, for

 GNP-H4 it is negative). In each case, the variability of the s is much less

 than that of the paired Sf series, as shown by the bracketed figures.

      Indeed, assuming our findings can be generalized, they have the important

 implication that the consensus statistics tend to understate uncertainty. As

 noted early in this paper, the use of common data, methods, and models would

 tend to narrow the differences even among the independently derived predictions

 of the widely monitored economic variables. The spread of influential views

 and interaction among experts and agents works in the same direction, producing

 further homogenization of the reported point forecasts.

      One could argue that it is precisely when high uncertainty prevails that

 people will invest more resources in interactive prediction, with the result

 that their point forecasts or expectations would then tend to be more closely

 bunched. Also, in aiming at common targets in the not so near future about

 which little can be known or confidently prejudged, many individuals may try to

 avoid getting out on a limb; they would rather stay close to others and share

 in common errors than risk making eccentric errors. Under such conditions,

 strong consensus would be associated with high uncertainty (as in Figure 2,

 panel b).

      If the above arguments had general validity, Sf and         should be

 negatively correlated.1° However, it is easy to think of other hypotheses

 which would produce different results. Thus, if greater uncertainty induced

 greater interpersonal differentiation of expectations, the correlation between

 s and ;         (called   rS) would be positive.

           IPD        —.29 (.42)       .33 (.29)      .55 (.05)    .54 (.09)


       As the above tabulation shows, the findings on this score are mixed: of

 the eight r coefficients, four are positive and significant at the ten per-

 cent level and others (of which two are positive and two negative) are not

 significantly different from zero. This is consistent with the notion that the

 different hypothetical situations we have considered, being by no means mutu-

 ally exclusive, may all apply to a varying degree, frequently with mutually

 offsetting effects (although the prevalence of positive correlations deserves

 to be noted). This much is surely not implausible, although it is inevitably

 somewhat speculative: it must be emphasized again that our results are based

 on small samples (10-13 annual observations for each horizon) and cannot claim

 to be conclusive.


 Skewness and Kurtosis

       Figure 5 presents the pairs of skewness series for each horizon: an aver-

 age of the measures for the individual probability distributions (sk) and

 statistics relating to the point forecasts from the same sources (Skf). The

 skewness coefficient is defined as

in terms of the calculated third and second moments about the mean. If the

distribution is symmetrical, sk and                 equal zero; if it is not, sk will

show the sign of the departure from symmetry and give some indication of its

extent. 12

      It is evident from the chart that, on the average, there is very little

skewness in the probabilistic forecast distributions. Each of the sk series

runs close to zero; the deviations are predominantly negative for the GNP

growth and positive for the inflation predictions but they are small through-

out, irrespective of the horizon. In contrast, the skf series for the point

forecasts fluctuate irregularly over broad ranges including numbers of both

signs, although here, again, minuses prevail for GNP and pluses for IPD. No

systematic horizon effects are discernible.

      Figure 6 compares the series of kurtosis measures k and kf. The k

coefficient is-calculated as a ratio of the fourth moment about the mean to the

variance squared,

This has the value 3 if the distribution is Normal.12 On the average, the
measures based on the individual probabilistic forecast distributions display

no significant departures from that value: each of the               series in the

chart lies extremely close to the horizonal line drawn at the level of 3.00.

On the other hand, some of the kf series, particularly those for the infla-

tion series, show great volatility, often attaining values much higher than 3.

This suggests that the underlying distributions of point forecasts across the

  individuals   may be leptokurtic, i.e., having sharper peaks and fatter tails

  than the Normal curve.13


                             III. Summary and Conclusions


       This study starts from an operational distinction between "consensus" and

  "uncertainty." The former is defined    as   the degree of agreement among the cor-

  responding point   predictions reported by different forecasters; the latter

  refers to the diffuseness of the distributions of probabilities that the fore-

  casters attach to the different possible values of an economic variable. Using

 this conceptual framework, section II addresses data on point and probabilistic

 forecasts of annual percentage changes in current-dollar GNP and the implicit

 price deflator (IPD). The source, here and later, is the quarterly ASA—NBER

 survey of macroeconomic forecasts, 1968—198 1.

      The matched mean point forecasts and mean probability forecasts agree

 closely. Apparently, on the whole, the prefered predictions coincide with the

 expected values of the probability distributions assessed by the survey

 respondents.

      Measures of consensus such as the standard deviations of the point predic-

 tions, have been used as proxies for prior forecast uncertainty. Our own com-

 parisons of the standard deviation of point forecasts and the mean standard

 deviation of predictive probability distributions indicate that the former tend

 to understate uncertainty as measured by the latter. This is so particularly

 for short horizons. There is some evidence that these measures of consensus

 and uncertainty are for-the most part positively correlated.




     3Symmetric leptokurtic distributions have been viewed as implying a
considerable degree of consensus because of their peakedness; but they also
have more outliers. See Schnader and Stekler, 1979.

     The distributions of point predictions in each period are, on the average,

approximately symmetrical but they show considerable variation over time.

These distributions tend to be leptokurtic, that is, they have heavier concen-

trations in the tails than in Normal distributions.

    The examined predictive probability distributions are almost exclusively

unimodal, with average measures of skewness and kurtosis conforming closely to

Normal. The average standard deviations of the distributions increase only

slightly with the forecast horizon (HO, ..., H4).
