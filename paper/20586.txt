                                           ABSTRACT

This paper reviews empirical evidence on the micro-level consequences of family planning programs
in middle- and low-income countries. In doing so, it focuses on fertility outcomes (the number and
timing of births), women’s health and socio-economic outcomes (mortality, human capital, and labor
force participation), and children’s health and socio-economic outcomes throughout the life cycle.
Although effect sizes are heterogeneous, long-term studies imply that in practice, family planning
programs may only explain a modest share of fertility decline in real-world settings (explaining 4-20%
of fertility decline among studies finding significant effects). Family planning programs may also
have quantitatively modest - but practically meaningful - effects on the socio-economic welfare of
individuals and families.

1. Introduction

        The twentieth century witnessed the birth of modern ‘family planning’ and its

evolution from an early target of anti-obscenity laws (Comstock, 1873) to a focus of

global efforts to improve human welfare (Cleland et al., 2006). 1 Many observers date the

modern family planning movement to the famous 1916 opening of New York City’s first

birth control clinic. Mid-century, the International Planned Parenthood Federation and the

Population Council were instrumental in both the development of modern contraceptive

technologies (including the first oral contraceptive, Enovid, and plastic intrauterine

devices) and, along with aid agencies and international organizations, promoting their

widespread distribution – ushering in the ‘modern’ era of fertility control.

        Heightened concern about world’s unprecedented rate of population growth (and

its potential macroeconomic and environmental consequences) also arose mid-century

(Coale and Hoover (1959) – and Neo-Malthusian alarm grew in tenor with Paul Ehrlich’s

publication of The Population Bomb in 1968. In response, aid agencies supported the

establishment of large-scale family planning programs around the world. Global funding

for family planning tripled during the 1970s and early 1980s – and by the mid-1990s,

large-scale family planning programs were active in 115 countries (Cleland et al., 2006).

Remarkably, the total fertility rate in developing countries also fell by more than half

over this period (Sinding, 2007).




1
 For the purposes of this review, we consider family planning to be the use of modern methods of birth
control to attain the desired number of children and timing of births. We consider a ‘family planning
program’ to be any formalized program designed to promote, distribute, or subsidize modern
contraceptives.

                                                    2
         Academics have long debated the primary forces responsible for global fertility

decline – and in particular, the contribution made by family planning programs. One view

largely credits family planning programs directly (Bongaarts et al., 2012, Bongaarts et al.,

1990, Casterline and Sinding, 2000, Robey et al., 1993). Others give them less credit,

arguing that fertility decline largely reflects reductions in the demand for children, even if

aided by family planning programs (Pritchett, 1994a). These demand-side factors include

economic development, gains in education, industrialization, and an increase in the

opportunity cost of time generally (and for women in particular) (Breierova and Duflo,

2004, Galor and Weil, 2000, Lavy and Zablotsky, 2011, Schultz, 1985); the price of child

‘quality’ (Becker, 1960, Becker, 1991, Davis, 1967, Voigtlander and Voth, 2013);

expectations about future labor market conditions and relative income (Easterlin, 1968,

Easterlin, 1975, Macunovich, 1998); and falling infant and child mortality rates (Angeles,

2010, Cleland, 2001, Kalemli-Ozcan, 2002, Mason, 1997, Palloni and Rafalimanana,

1999, Schultz, 1985). 2 A third view, promoted in part by the European Fertility Project,

emphasizes the importance of social networks in facilitating the diffusion of ‘cultural

innovations,’ including the social acceptability of small families (Coale and Watkins,

1986, Cleland and Wilson, 1987). 3

        As dire predictions about Malthusian demographic catastrophe failed to

materialize (Lam, 2011), the rationale for population policy became more nuanced during




2 These factors are not independent of each other – for example, the opportunity cost of women’s time is
related to women’s intra-household bargaining power (Lundberg and Pollak, 1996, Rasul, 2008), and the
mortality environment creates incentives for human capital investments (Jayachandran and Lleras-Muney,
2009)
3
  The European Fertility Project’s methodology and central findings have also been called into question
(Brown and Guinnane, 2003).

                                                    3
the 1980s and 1990s (Kelley, 2003). 4 Stances on the relationship between population

growth and economic development became more neutral (Finkle and Crane, 1985, NAS,

1986), emphasizing the centrality of mediating institutions. 5 At the 1994 International

Conference on Population and Development in Cairo, feminist, rights-based rationales

supplemented modern macroeconomic justifications for population policy (see Birdsall et

al. (2001). Family planning programs increasingly emphasized individual needs and

desires, stressing socio-economic and health benefits for women and their families

(Glasier et al., 2006). 6

        In the spirit of contemporary emphasis on a wide range of individual-level

benefits of family planning programs, this chapter reviews existing empirical evidence on

their consequences for women and children in low- and middle-income countries. In

doing so, it focuses on three types of outcomes: (1) fertility outcomes (the number and

timing of births), (2) women’s health and socio-economic outcomes (mortality, human

capital, and labor force participation), and (3) children’s health and socio-economic

outcomes throughout the life cycle. We exclude studies that simply relate family




4
  Many scholars question whether or not alarmism over population growth is justified generally. Some
argue that population growth strengthens incentives for technological progress capable of averting
Malthusian calamity (Boserup, 1965, Simon, 1981). A famous wager between Paul Ehrlich and Julian
Simon illustrates this point. In 1980, Simon bet Ehrlich that the price of any five commodity metals chosen
by Ehrlich (chromium, copper, nickel, tin, and tungsten) would decline over the subsequent decade (rather
than rise). Commodity metals exist in fixed supply, while population growth raises demand for them, all
else equal – exerting upward pressure on prices. However, in response to rising prices, technological
progress (in industrial processes, etc.) also leads to substitution away from them, placing downward
pressure on prices. By 1990, the inflation-adjusted price of all five metals had fallen.
5
  Institutions have been proposed to play a central role in a population’s ability to earn a ‘demographic
dividend’ – for example, see Bloom and Williamson (1998), Bloom, Canning et al. (2003), and Bloom and
Canning (2009).
6
  As the definition of reproductive health expanded, so did the scope of family planning programs –
growing to encompass safe delivery, prevention and treatment of sexually-transmitted infections, safe
abortion, and violence against women (Greene and Merrick, 2005).

                                                    4
planning programs to contraceptive use or knowledge without directly estimating their

effect on these outcomes. 7

        The remainder of this review is organized as follows. Section 2 summarizes

background debate about the relative importance of supply- vs. demand-side factors in

explaining fertility decline. The third section reviews empirical studies of the

relationship between family planning programs and fertility outcomes, while the fourth

covers program effects on health and socio-economic outcomes among women and their

children. Pooling across studies, the fifth section concludes by summarizing ranges of

estimates that emerge from the empirical literature.



2. Background Controversy: Supply vs. Demand and the Pritchett (1994) Critique

        Among the competing explanations for fertility decline, an important distinction

emerges between demand- and supply-side factors. While there is little debate about the

association between use of modern contraceptives and fertility, the underlying

determinants of contraceptive use are controversial. The crux of the debate pits the

relative importance of changes in the demand for children (and for contraceptives)

against changes in the availability and price of contraceptives (generally accomplished

through family planning programs). 8 Before reviewing empirical studies of family

planning in Sections 3 and 4, we first summarize this controversy.


7
  Many studies estimate the impact of family planning programs on contraceptive use and knowledge, but
because modern contraceptives may substitute for traditional methods of birth control (prolonged
breastfeeding, rhythm, and postpartum abstinence, for example), inferences by these studies about the net
effect of family planning on fertility and socio-economic outcomes are difficult (Schultz, 1992). Our
review also excludes a large literature relating the number, timing, and spacing of births to downstream
socioeconomic benefits without directly estimating the role of family planning programs on these outcomes
(for a review, see Schultz (2010) ).
8
  This distinction is not always clean. For example, some studies that we reviewed analyze family planning
programs that include information or reproductive health education campaigns. These programs

                                                    5
         Lant Pritchett’s 1994 article entitled “Desired Fertility and the Impact of

Population Policies” published in Population and Development Review is a landmark

paper in this debate. Specifically, it argues that because contraceptive prevalence (or use)

is jointly determined by both supply and demand (and not by supply alone), 9 the close

relationship between a country’s contraceptive prevalence rate and its total fertility rate

fails to isolate the importance of either. In doing so, the paper challenged conventional

wisdom about the centrality of contraceptive supply in determining total fertility rates in

developing countries (Bongaarts et al., 1990).

         To disentangle the effect of demand from that of supply (and to address specific

concerns that survey measures of demand may reflect ex post rationalization or may

depend on contraceptive supply), Pritchett uses two different instrumental variables (IV)

estimation strategies. 10 In doing so, the paper finds a nearly one-to-one correspondence

between a country’s total fertility rate and the number of children that women report

wanting. 11 Pritchett therefore concludes that women are largely able to have the number




simultaneously aim to increase both the availability of contraceptives and demand for them. Examples
include programs in Zimbabwe and Tanzania (Rogers et al., 1999), Rwanda (Westoff, 2013), and China
(Hesketh and Zhu, 1997). The debate also distinguishes “distal” and “proximate” causes of fertility decline.
We do not emphasize this distinction because behaviors that change when a key constraint to reproductive
behavior is relaxed are by definition “proximate,” regardless of whether they reflect demand or supply.
9
  Except in the unlikely case that demand is perfectly price elastic
10 Specifically, Pritchett addresses concerns about ex post rationalization and about the dependence of

desired fertility on contraceptive availability using two related instrumental variables (IV) methodologies.
First, he uses the proportion of women with four children who desire no more (a forward-looking statistic
free of ex-post rationalization) to instrument for a retrospective measure of the demand for children fertility
(DTFR). Second, he uses a retrospective measure of demand (DTFR) to instrument for a forward-looking
measure (WTFR).
11
   Pritchett (1994) uses three measures of desired fertility contained in the Demographic and Health
Surveys (DHS): Average Ideal Number of Children (AINC), which is calculated directly from survey
questions about women’s ideal family size; the Desired Total Fertility Rate (DTFR), which is calculated
from “age-specific birth rates after subtracting from the number of actual births those prior births that
exceed each woman's reported desired family size;” and the Wanted Total Fertility Rate (WTFR), which is
calculated using age-specific birth rates after subtracting births determined to be unwanted according to
reported desire for future children .

                                                      6
of children that they want – and that contraceptive supply can at best explain 10% of the

cross-country variation in fertility rates. 12

         Pritchett’s findings are controversial (Bongaarts, 1994, Knowles et al., 1994,

Pritchett, 1994b), and his econometric strategy requires two important assumptions that

we highlight. 13 The first is that the share of women in a country who have a given

number of children and report not wanting more is unrelated to the country’s total fertility

rate – except through desired fertility (demand). In answering questions about wanting

more children, if women have in mind the costs of fertility control that they face in

practice (despite survey instructions to the contrary), this assumption would be violated. 14

These costs may be difficult for respondents to disregard – the interpersonal costs that

women face in bargaining over fertility with their partners, for example. The second

related assumption is that past and current/future costs of fertility control are

uncorrelated. Because such a correlation is plausible, current/future costs of fertility

control could in fact be related to past fertility decisions. Ultimately, these assumptions

are not directly testable.

         On a more general level, Pritchett argues that the financial cost of modern

contraceptives is too small relative to the importance of fertility decisions to exert

meaningful influence. However, these costs may nonetheless be prohibitive for poor


12
   This relationship is generally robust to controlling for contraceptive prevalence (coefficient estimates for
DTFR and WTFR decrease from 0.89 to 0.74 and from 0.91 to 0.77, respectively). The rationale for
controlling for contraceptive prevalence is unclear, however, given that it captures demand as well as
supply. Although Pritchett argues women are largely able to have the number of children that they want to
have, the presence of a positive intercept term in his regression results indicates some level of persistent
unwanted fertility.
13
   These two related assumptions are required for the IV strategy’s necessary ‘exclusion restriction’ to be
met (Angrist and Krueger, 1991).
14
   Pritchett (1994) argues that all female DHS respondents should have costless fertility control in mind; all
that the IV strategy really requires is that women have the same cost of fertility control in mind (regardless
of their magnitude).

                                                       7
households facing tight credit or liquidity constraints, and importantly, the total cost of

fertility control extends far beyond the financial cost of contraceptives – bargaining with

spouses over fertility and direct disutility from using of contraceptive devices, for

example. Some empirical evidence suggests that these costs may be substantial. 15

         More generally, critics of Pritchett’s analysis argue that although reductions in the

demand for children may be an important determinant in fertility decline, changes in

demand alone are not generally sufficient. Instead, they contend that modern family

planning is necessary for preventing increases in unwanted fertility as wanted fertility

declines (and for reducing unwanted fertility independent of changes in wanted fertility)

(Bongaarts 1994). 16 In practice, few studies examine large, plausibly ‘exogenous’

declines in the demand for children in environments lacking modern contraceptives,

making it difficult to assess this claim empirically. 17 Related work using two decades of

additional data also argues that changes in wanted total fertility rates explain about half of

changes in Total Fertility Rates in more recent decades, implying that reductions in

unwanted fertility (and by extension, family planning – although not directly measured)

have played a more important role (Gunther and Harttgen, 2013, Lam, 2011).




15 On bargaining, Ashraf et al. (2014) show that among the subset of couples in their sample with different

fertility preferences, offering vouchers for contraceptives to women privately is reduces fertility more than
offering vouchers to them in the presence of their husbands (reducing unwanted births by 57%). On the
direct disutility of modern contraceptives, research on commercial sex markets suggests that men are
willing to pay 23% more for sex without a condom (and double that for unprotected sex with attractive
commercial sex workers) (Gertler et al., 2005). See also Casterline and Sinding (2000) for a discussion of
the full cost of contraception.
16
   Some studies emphasize meeting an otherwise ‘unmet need’ for contraceptive services (for discussions of
‘unmet need,’ see Bongaarts et al., 2012; Bradley and Casterline, 2014; Casterline and Sinding, 2000).
Both the concept and measurement of ‘unmet need’ is controversial (Westoff, 1988; Bradley et al. 2012;
Pritchett 1996)
17
   This contrasts with scholarship on sustained fertility declines observed in Europe and other industrialized
countries prior to the availability of modern contraception. See Coale and Watkins (1986) for a summary.

                                                      8
         Despite some unresolved concerns with Pritchett’s (1994) analysis, its

overarching point – that the demand for children may be more important than supply-side

factors (including contraceptive supply) in determining fertility – may nonetheless stand.



3. Family Planning Programs and the Number, Timing, and Spacing of Births

         The empirical literature on family planning is vast. To aid in our review, we used

a strategy akin to the ‘systematic review’ methodology in the biomedical sciences,

although we emphasize that we did not undertake a formal systematic review. Using

explicit criteria to search four major databases of indexed journals (together with a

‘snowball’ approach), our initial search yielded 9,501 studies for consideration. We then

reviewed abstracts, applying inclusion criteria for: methodological rigor, 18 direct analysis

of family planning program effects in developing countries, and an explicit focus on at

least one of our three types of primary outcomes. Our final list includes 30 studies

meeting these criteria 19 (studies estimating the relationship between family planning and

fertility are summarized in Table 1).



18
   For non-experimental (observational) studies, we restricted our review to those using commonly-
accepted methodologies for addressing the role of confounding factors and endogenous program
placement/intensity. These include (but are not limited to) conventional panel data techniques, difference-
in-difference estimation, and instrumental variables strategies using plausibly exogenous instruments.
19
   We searched four major databases: PubMed, CAB Global Health, SCOPUS, and POPLINE. See the
accompanying electronic appendix (at the time of writing, available at
https://people.stanford.edu/ngmiller/) for details. Our review is limited to microdata studies of family
planning programs in middle- and low-income countries; for examples of cross-country studies, many of
which use an index of family planning ‘effort’ at the national level, see Schultz (1994), Tsui (2001), Jain
and Ross (2012) and Kohler (2012). Specific inclusion criteria were: (1) a focus on middle- and low-
income countries, (2) a quantitative evaluation of one or more family planning programs using microdata,
and (3) analysis of at least one fertility, health, or socioeconomic outcome (rather than just contraceptive
use or knowledge, for example). For non-experimental (observational) studies, we restricted our review to
those using commonly-accepted methodologies for addressing the role of confounding factors and
endogenous program placement/intensity. These include (but are not limited to) conventional panel data
techniques, difference-in-difference estimation, and instrumental variables estimation using plausibly
exogenous instruments (and admittedly subjective criterion).


                                                      9
Randomized Controlled Trials

Arguably the most prominent study of family planning conducted to date is the famous

Matlab family planning experiment. Beginning in 1977, the experiment randomly

assigned 141 areas in Matlab, Bangladesh to either the study’s ‘treatment’ arm (70) or a

control arm (71). In treatment areas, female reproductive health workers visited the

homes of married women of childbearing age every two weeks to educate women about

reproductive health, provide nutrition counseling, and offer modern contraceptives free of

charge. Maternal and child health services were integrated into the experimental

treatment in 1982 (Muhuri, 1995), and safe motherhood services followed (Chowdhury et

al., 2009). 20

        The Matlab experiment has produced a large volume of academic papers. Early

papers report a 25% reduction in the general fertility rate (GFR) over the first two years

of the experiment (Phillips et al., 1982), and these reductions lasted throughout the 1980s

(Foster and Roy, 1997, Koenig et al., 1992). Longer term follow-up suggests that these

fertility effects persisted for at least 20 years, reducing the number of children ever born

by 1-1.5 children and extending birth intervals by 8-13 months (Joshi and Schultz, 2007).

Estimates of implied lifetime fertility reductions range from 13% (Sinha, 2005) to 23%

(Joshi and Schultz, 2013).

        The Matlab experiment has also generated debate. First, critics note that the

intensity and expense of the program would be unrealistic on a large scale. In its first 10

years, program costs were approximately $180 per birth averted (120% of Bangladesh’s

20
   These maternal and child health services included, tetanus immunizations for pregnant women, and in the
1980s, Vitamin A supplements, other childhood vaccinations, nutritional interventions, and diarrhea
treatment. The safe motherhood program distributed safe home delivery kits and iron supplements to
pregnant women, increased the supply of community midwives, provided free transportation to emergency
obstetric facilities for women with birth complications, and promoted institutional delivery generally.

GDP per capita in 1987) (Simmons et al., 1991) – nearly 10 times more than mean family

planning spending in developing countries at the time (Pritchett, 1994a). Second,

bundling child health services into the family planning treatment effectively reduced the

‘price’ of child survival – and could have therefore exerted independent influence on

fertility (Becker, 1991, Caldwell, 1976, Sah, 1991). Third, Schultz (2009) suggests

possible deviations from true randomization in the experiment’s implementation.

       There are few other randomized controlled trials of family planning services. The

Navrongo experiment in Ghana studied 37 communities randomized across four

treatment arms (Binka et al., 1995, Phillips et al., 2006). Although balance across arms

was not achieved, treatment arms combining family planning service training and

community outreach were associated with a 15% reduction in the total fertility rate

among married women (Debpuur et al., 2002). Effects on parity progression persisted for

15 years (and have largely been attributed to the promotion of contraceptive use through

community organizations) but have declined over time (Phillips et al., 2006, Phillips et

al., 2012). Two other experiments integrated family planning services into existing

programs: a microcredit program in Ethiopia (Desai and Tarozzi, 2011) and an HIV

treatment program in Kenya (Kosgei et al., 2011). Both experiments find null results in

the first few years following implementation.

Observational studies

       Two influential observational studies analyze contemporaneous effects of

Indonesian National Family Planning Coordinating Board’s programs during the late

1970s and 1980s. Gertler and Molyneaux (1994) combine birth history data with

community-level information about family planning program activity to study program



                                            11
effects on community-level birth hazards between 1982 and 1987. Accounting for

changes in the demand for children and community fixed effects, the authors show that

taken together, family planning program inputs explain only 4-8% of Indonesia’s decline

in fertility (a 2% reduction in the quarterly birth hazard) during the study period (Gertler

and Molyneaux, 1994). 21 Relatedly, using both survey and population census data and

explicitly modeling village-level family planning program placement, (Pitt et al., 1993)

fail to find that the program had any significant effect on fertility between 1976 and 1986.

        Also estimating short-run program effects, two additional studies use strategies

that exploit program variation due to idiosyncratic public finance rules governing local

government resource allocation. Specifically, Molyneaux and Gertler (2000) find that in

conjunction, family planning subsidies, clinics, and village distribution centers were

associated with 17% lower quarterly birth hazards in Indonesia between 1985 and 1994.

Studying family planning in Ethiopia, Portner, Beegle, and Christiaensen (2011) find

that among uneducated women, the presence of a family planning program in a woman’s

1990 district of residence was associated with roughly one fewer child ever born in the

1994 Ethiopian population census (a reduction of about 20% in this sub-group).

        Other studies examine the cumulative effects of family planning programs over

longer periods of time. To study the long-run effects of PROFAMILIA, Colombia’s

predominant family planning provider from 1965 until the 1980s, Miller (2010) combines

1985 and 1993 population census data with information about its staggered geographic

expansion across the country to estimate changes in fertility outcomes associated with

age-specific program exposure. Controlling for cohort and birth area fixed effects as well

21
   Gertler and Molyneaux (1994) show that factors associated with economic development drove reductions
in fertility primarily through increased demand for modern contraceptives, noting the role of family
planning programs in allowing couples to achieve demand-driven reductions in their desired fertility.

                                                  12
as area-specific time trends, he finds that the presence of family planning services

explains about 6-7% of Colombia’s fertility decline over this period (postponing first

births and reducing completed fertility by approximately 0.25-0.33 children). 22

         Three studies by Angeles, Guilkey, and Mroz also use spatial and temporal

variation in program exposure to estimate long-run effects on cumulative fertility. In

Tanzania and Peru, the authors use random effects models to estimate the relationship

between community-level program placement and individual birth hazards over two

decades. They find 25-35% reductions in children ever born in Peru (Angeles et al.,

2005a) and 10-20% reductions in Tanzania, reporting that half of these effects is linked to

program exposure during adolescence (Angeles et al., 1998). In Indonesia, the authors

model both indirect and direct pathways through which family planning might influence a

woman’s lifetime fertility. Jointly estimating equations for educational attainment,

marriage, and fertility, they find that the long term presence of family planning programs

is associated with a 20% reduction in completed fertility (or about one child) (Angeles et

al., 2005b).

         Another set of studies examines the role of family planning in Iran’s striking

fertility decline during the 1980s and 1990s (as Iran’s total fertility rate declined from

over 7 births per woman to about 2 (Hashemi and Salehi-Isfahani, 2013). Family

planning was banned at the time of the Islamic Revolution, but in 1989, Iran abruptly

legalized modern contraceptives and launched family planning programs through its

large, pre-existing cadre of community health workers (Behvarz). Salehi-Isfahani (2010)

combine data from the Iranian Ministry of Health with population census records from

22
  These effect sizes are similar to the reductions of 0.1-0.33 children ever born reported by Angeles and
coauthors, who study of family planning programs in 11 African, Asian, and Latin American countries
(Angeles et al., 2001).

                                                    13
1986 and 1996; using a difference-in-difference approach to study variation in the timing

and location of community health worker activity, they find a 4% decline in the child to

woman ratio associated with program activity, explaining 8-20% of the decline during the

study period. Analyzing age-specific program exposure among cohorts of women in the

2006 Iranian census, Modrek and Ghobadi (2011) find an 18% reduction in children ever

born among women first exposed to family planning between ages 20 and 34 as well as a

28% reduction among women first exposed between ages 15 and 19. Using a similar

approach, Hashemi and Salehi-Isfahani (2013) report that the presence of a program was

associated with a 5-7% increase in birth spacing.

        Additionally, a recent group of studies examines the short-run consequences of

unanticipated ‘shocks’ to family planning programs. We note that the interpretation of

these papers’ estimates is complex because longer-term fertility behavior (which may

offset the consequences of short-lived shocks) is not observed. In Eastern Europe, where

abortion was historically the predominant form of fertility regulation, many countries

limited or banned abortion during the 1980s and 1990s. 23 Examining the abrupt end of

Romania’s ban on abortion and family planning in 1989, Pop-Eleches (2010) uses survey

data on births among reproductive age women two years before and after the end of the

ban to employ a single difference approach (akin to a regression discontinuity design).

The author finds that lifting the ban was associated with a 30% decline in fertility – and

conducting simulations using his estimates, he suggests that the cumulative effect of the

abortion ban was an increase of approximately 0.5 children (a 25% increase) among

women who spent all of their reproductive years under the ban (Pop-Eleches, 2010).


23
  Levine and Staiger (2004) conduct a cross-country study of these abortion policy changes, finding that on
average, restrictive policies led to a 17% higher birth rate (compared to a liberal policy).

                                                   14
         Studying disruptions in the supply of free condoms to Filipino provinces due to

supply chain irregularities, Salas (2013) finds that a 6% reduction in contraceptive supply

is associated with a 15% increase in short-run birth hazard. Similarly, analyzing

fluctuations in contraceptive supply in Ghana due to the instatement and repeal of the

United States’ ‘Mexico City Policy,’ Jones (2013) finds that the policy led to a 10%

increase in pregnancies (or a 0.2 percentage point increase in the monthly pregnancy

hazard) among rural women and women with little education. 24

         Finally, several studies examine the consequences of population policy in China.

Although there is substantial heterogeneity across all family planning programs included

in this review, we emphasize that these studies are distinct in estimating program effects

associated with compulsory (rather than voluntary) programs. 25 One recent unpublished

paper uses retrospective fertility history records from China’s “2-per-thousand” fertility

survey to study the staggered introduction of China’s early family planning campaign

(Wan Xi Shao, or “Later, Longer, Fewer”) across provinces during the 1970s (Babiarz et

al., 2016). In an event study framework, the authors find large reductions in third and

higher parity births associated with the campaign; for example, birth hazards at third and

fourth parity declined by 35% and 76%, respectively. Given the smaller (and declining)

share of births occurring at higher parities, however, these estimates explain 22-32% of

China’s Total Fertility Rate decline during the 1970s.

         Studying the famous One-Child policy (enacted around 1980) that followed the

Wan Xi Shao campaign, Li et al. (2005) uses variation in the legal birth limits across

24
   Although complete data is not available for all study years, Jones also reports that the policy was
associated with an immediate decline of roughly 40% in family planning funding and a 13% reduction in
contraceptive supply.
25
   Accounts of abuse under China’s compulsory fertility policy, while anecdotal, report cases of forced or
coerced abortions and sterilizations, threats of violence and excessive fines.

ethnic groups to estimate the changes in the probability of having a second birth

associated with the policy. With data from the 1% sample of the 1990 Chinese Population

Census, the authors find an 11% reduction in the probability of a second birth - a decline

of about 13% relative to 1982. 26

4. Family Planning Programs and Health and Socio-Economic Outcomes among Women

and Children

         Beyond their impact on fertility, family planning programs may also have

important health and socioeconomic benefits for mothers and their children (Canning and

Schultz, 2012). Intuitively, these benefits could stem from changes in the number,

timing, and spacing of births or from changes in sibship size and composition – but

isolating the specific mechanisms or pathways through which they are produced is often

not possible. Studying these benefits is also difficult because some do not emerge for

many years, requiring long study periods. 27

Benefits among Mothers

         Given high maternal mortality rates in many low- and middle-income countries,

reductions in the number of births may have an important effect on maternal mortality

rates simply by reducing the number of times women are at risk of maternity-related

death (Rahman and Menken, 2012). However, if family planning programs also

selectively reduce the relative incidence of riskier pregnancies (such as higher parity




26
   Age-specific effects among 30-34 year olds are as high as 22% in the general population and over 30% in
urban areas (a 25% decline relative to 1982) (Li et al. 2005).
27
   A large literature in development economics studies the relationship between these dimensions of fertility
and the well-being of women and children (see Schultz, 2007a and Schultz, 2007b). We restrict our review
to direct analyses of family planning programs. See the accompanying electronic appendix (at the time of
writing this review, available at https://people.stanford.edu/ngmiller/) for details.

                                                    16
births), they may also reduce the maternal mortality ratio (Cleland et al., 2012, Jain,

2011, Winikoff and Sullivan, 1987). 28

         Few studies analyze the direct relationship between family planning programs and

maternal mortality. One exception is an early study of the Matlab experiment reporting

that the maternal mortality rate in treatment areas declined to about half of the rate in

control areas between 1976 and 1985 (Koenig et al., 1988). This effect was attributed to

relative reductions in fertility and a corresponding decline in lifetime exposure to

maternal mortality risk. However, there was no change in the maternal mortality ratio

(and hence no change in average mortality risk conditional on pregnancy).

         Among surviving women, long-term studies of the Matlab experiment find

anthropometric gains associated with the treatment. 29 Canning and Schultz (2012) report

that in 1996, reproductive-age women in treatment areas had a 1 kg/m2 higher Body Mass

Index (BMI) than women in control areas. Adjusting for characteristics of women and

their households, Joshi and Schultz (2013) find that this BMI advantage among women in

treatment villages is only present at older ages. However, they also find that women in

treatment areas are roughly 2kg heavier on average and are less likely to be underweight

(defined as BMI<18 kg/m2). 30 (Al, 2012) In interpreting these findings, we emphasize




28
   The maternal mortality rate measures the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 women of reproductive-
age; the maternal mortality ratio measures the number of maternal deaths per 100,000 live births. The
medical literature suggests that nulliparous and grand multiparous births (first births and births of parity
higher than four) may be riskier (Bai et al. 2002, Ezegwui et al., 2013, for example). The evidence on
elevated risk associated with ‘unwanted’ births, births to younger mothers, and short interval births is more
tenuous (see Tsui et al. (2010), DaVanzo, Razzaque et al. (2005), and Conde-Agudelo and Belizan (2000)
for example).
29
   Selective mortality may bias anthropometric estimates downwards if marginal survivors are weaker (or
have lower anthropometric indicators) than the average woman.
30
   These BMI and weight differences could potentially imply differences in future survival; studying
Matlab, Menken, Duffy et al. (2003) report that a one point increase in BMI is associated with a 17%
decline in mortality hazard.

                                                    17
that improvements in women’s health could be due to bundling of women’s health

services into the family planning ‘treatment’ beginning in 1982.

        By allowing women greater control over the number, timing, and spacing of

births, family planning programs may also influence their educational attainment, labor

force participation, and lifetime earnings (Greene and Merrick, 2005). 31 Studying

Colombia, Miller (2010) reports that the presence of a local family planning program

early in women’s reproductive years is associated with a 1% increase in educational

attainment (0.05 years of schooling) and a 4-7% increase in the likelihood formal sector

employment (1-2 percentage points). 32 Using simulations, Angeles and coauthors

(2005b) report larger effects on educational attainment in Indonesia, suggesting that

lifetime exposure to family planning programs is associated with gains of 25-27% (or an

additional 1.3 years of schooling).

Benefits among Children

        Family planning programs could also influence children’s health and socio-

economic outcomes through a variety of mechanisms (through changes in birth spacing

and sibship size or through gains in women’s educational attainment, for example).

Although a large literature links various dimensions of fertility decline to improved child

welfare, including increases in parental investments per child (and child ‘quality’)

(DaVanzo et al., 2005, Li et al., 2008, Molyneaux and Gertler, 2000, Rosenzweig and

Wolpin, 1980, Rutstein, 2005), few studies focus directly on family planning programs.


31
   Although not well-developed theoretically or empirically, some authors suggest that family planning
programs could potentially influence women’s bargaining power within households and the status of
women generally. For example, one study finds that home visits by family planning service providers may
enhance women’s social standing (Phillips and Hossain, 2003).
32
   Although beyond the scope of this review, studies of the United States mid-century find a relationship
between the availability of modern contraceptives and both women’s educational attainment and earnings
(Goldin and Katz, 2002, Bailey, 2006, Bailey et al., 2012).

                                                   18
        Studying child survival, two experiments find that family planning programs are

associated with substantial reductions in child mortality under the age of five (decreases

between 30% and 50%) (Joshi and Schultz, 2007, Joshi and Schultz, 2013, Phillips et al.,

2006). However, we emphasize that these programs bundled family planning services

together with other health services – and in particular, ones targeting infant and child

health, making it difficult to isolate the contribution of family planning services per se. 33

Focusing more directly on family planning services alone, Miller (2010) and Portner,

Beegle, and Christiaensen (2011) report no significant program effects on infant and

child mortality.

        Several other studies examine anthropometric measures of child health. 34 Joshi

and Schultz (2007) report that girls in Matlab’s treatment villages have BMI z-scores that

are 0.4 standard deviations larger on average than those of their control village

counterparts. Studying children in the Philippines, Rosenzweig and Wolpin (1986) use

longitudinal data to estimate within-child changes in anthropometrics associated with the

share of a child’s life for which family planning services were available (accounting for

both regional and family characteristics potentially correlated with birth spacing). They

find that lifetime exposure to family planning is associated with a 7% gain in child height

and a 12% gain in child weight.

         Beyond child health, family planning may benefit children in other ways

throughout their lifetime, too – by increasing parents’ investments in their education, for

example (Becker, 1991). Evidence on the direct relationship between family planning

33
   Some research suggests that much of the reduction in child mortality in both Bangladesh and Ghana may
have been due to child health and vaccinations programs (Koenig et al., 1990, Phillips et al., 2006).
34
   As with maternal anthropometrics, mortality effects of family planning may bias anthropometric
estimates downwards if marginal survivors are weaker (or have lower anthropometric indicators) than the
average child.

                                                  19
programs and children’s educational attainment is again thin, however, and limited to

long-term studies of the Matlab experiment. Foster and Roy (1997) report that the

Matlab treatment increased both girls’ and boys’ years of completed schooling (by 6-15%

and 5-12%, respectively), an effect they link to reductions in sibship size. Joshi and

Schultz (2007) find that relative to their peers in control villages, gains in educational

attainment of 0.5 standard deviations persisted among boys (but not girls) in treatment

villages.

        Finally, a study of Romania’s 1966 ban of abortion and family planning services

compares cohorts born just after the ban (which include additional ‘unwanted’ children)

with cohorts born just before it (Pop-Eleches, 2006). Controlling for family

characteristics, children born after the ban were less likely to complete either high school

or college (by 1.7% and 1.4%, respectively) and were instead 2.1% more likely to

complete a lower-return vocational degree. The paper attributes these changes in

educational outcomes not only to the ‘wantedness’ of children, but also to crowding in

schools among post-ban birth cohorts (the role of sibship size is not explicitly studied)

(Pop-Eleches, 2006).



5. Conclusion

        This chapter reviews empirical studies of family planning programs in developing

countries, focusing on fertility as well as on the health and socio-economic welfare of

women and children. Because the family planning literature is vast, we used an informal

approach akin to the ‘systematic review’ methodology in the biomedical sciences in an

effort both to be comprehensive and to explicitly define our focus.



                                             20
        Pooling across studies, we propose several generalizations about family planning

program effects. First, we find that program effects on fertility vary substantially,

ranging between 5% and 35% fewer children ever born and 5-7% longer birth intervals

(see Table 1 for a summary). Estimates from the famous Matlab experiment generally

fall in the upper-end of this range – but we note that the experimental intervention was

likely too intensive to be replicated at scale, limiting the generalizability of these results

(and also presumably reflecting reductions attributable to other health services bundled

into the experimental treatment). Findings from compulsory programs in China also fall

into the upper-end of this range and may reflect an upper-bound on what can be achieved

through real-world programs at scale. Long-term studies of voluntary real-world

programs yield more modest effect sizes, implying that in practice, family planning

programs may explain only about 4-20% of fertility decline in real-world settings (with

three studies finding no effects). Although not all major family planning programs have

been studied with adequate rigor, we believe that based on existing evidence, it is

difficult to argue that family planning programs alone explain a large share of the fertility

decline in developing countries over the past half-century. Demand-side factors may

instead play a more important role (Gertler and Molyneaux, 1994, Pritchett, 1994a)

        Second, we find evidence that family planning programs may have quantitatively

modest – but practically meaningful – effects on the socio-economic welfare of

individuals and families. We believe that existing evidence on the relationship between

family planning programs and maternal and child health outcomes is insufficient to draw

firm conclusions. However, long-term studies of socio-economic outcomes suggest that

family planning programs may raise educational attainment among women (by 1%-30%)



                                              21
and among children (by 5-18%). Although socio-economic effects in the lower end of

these ranges appear small, we note that they are not dissimilar in magnitude to gains

associated with programs explicitly aiming to boost educational attainment.

       Finally, we conclude by highlighting the considerable heterogeneity in the

magnitude of program effects in the family planning literature. Although explaining

variation in effect sizes is beyond the scope of this review, more research on the

importance of programmatic attributes, contextual factors, and local institutions is

needed. Explaining this variation is important for the design of better family planning

programs and policies.

Appendix 1: Search Methodology
         To identify the universe of relevant studies, we developed explicit search criteria
for three key databases: PubMed, CAB Global Health, SCOPUS, and POPLINE. Search
criteria are detailed below. This initial search returned 9,501 results. We narrowed our
initial results to studies that (1) focused on middle- and low-income countries, (2) that
undertook a micro-level quantitative evaluation of one or more family planning
programs, and (3) that studied at least one fertility, health or socioeconomic outcome
(rather than just contraceptive prevalence, for example). For non-experimental
(observational) studies, we restricted our review to those using commonly-accepted
methodologies for addressing the role of confounding factors and endogenous program
placement/intensity. These include (but are not limited to) conventional panel data
techniques, difference-in-difference estimation, and instrumental variables strategies
using plausibly exogenous instruments.
         As we proceeded with our review, we also used a ‘snowball’ method to identify
additional studies not returned by our original search but that otherwise met our inclusion
criteria. We emphasize that our review should not be considered a formal systematic
review. Our specific search criteria for each database are as follows:

SCOPUS

KEY(effects)) AND SUBJAREA(mult OR agri OR bioc OR immu OR neur OR phar OR

POPLINE
For POPLINE, we made use of hierarchical indexing, searching publications indexed
under subheadings Family Planning Program Evaluation, Evaluation, Program
Effectiveness, Fertility, Program Evaluations, Fertility Changes, Socioeconomic Status,
Maternal Health, Child Health, Birth Spacing, Parity and Mortality, each indexed more
broadly under: Family Planning Programs > Program Monitoring, Evaluations,
Indicators > Developing Countries
