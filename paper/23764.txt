                                         ABSTRACT

We study the cross-sectional variation of carry-trade-generated currency excess returns in terms
of their exposure to global macroeconomic fundamental risk. The risk factor is the cross-country
high-minus-low conditional skewness of the unemployment rate gap. It gives a measure of global
macroeconomic uncertainty and is robustly priced in currency excess returns. A widening of the
high-minus-low skewness of the unemployment rate gap signifies increasing divergence,
disparity, and inequality of economic performance across countries.

Introduction

In this paper, we study the cross-sectional variation of carry-trade-generated portfolios of
currency excess returns as a function of their exposure to systematic global macroeconomic
risk. The proposed risk factors are high-minus-low differences between the top and bottom
quartiles of conditional moments of country-level macroeconomic performance indicators.
Movements in these easily computable risk factors are interpreted to reflect variations in
global economic uncertainty. The high-minus-low concept is used extensively in finance.
By sorting into quartiles, our high-minus-low variable is similar to the interquartile range,
which is a robust measure of distributional dispersion and thus captures an important
aspect of global uncertainty. Our analysis includes conditional first, second, and third
moments of country-level macroeconomic data. Conceptually, conditional second and third
moments measure some aspect of country-specific macroeconomic risk and uncertainty,
while the high-minus-low differences capture aspects of global risk and uncertainty.
      Our main result is that the high-minus-low conditional skewness (HMLskew ) of the un-
employment rate gap is a global macroeconomic fundamental risk factor, robustly priced
into the carry-trade-generated currency excess returns.1 The connection of the unem-
ployment gap to currency returns, is that it is a variable of interest to central banks in
conducting monetary policy and setting the policy rate (Orphanides and Williams (2005,
2006, and 2007)). At the country level, negative conditional skewness of the unemploy-
ment gap represents a high probability of lower than normal unemployment, while positive
values represent a high probability of higher than normal unemployment. Whether a coun-
try’s conditional skewness is negative or positive, an increase in the measure is generally
not good. The global factor is the high-minus-low across country-level unemployment gap
skewness. An increase in the factor is an increase in global uncertainty–a widening and

      We use the terms unemployment rate gap and unemployment gap interchangeably.

increased dispersion of the economic state across countries. In a globally integrated finan-
cial market, investors pay attention to the state of the global economy as summarized by
global risk factors.
       A legacy literature sought to understand currency excess returns by trying to resolve
the forward premium anomaly–recognized as an empirical regularity since Hansen and Ho-
drick (1980), Bilson (1981), and Fama (1984).2 Although the forward premium anomaly
implies non-zero currency excess returns, they are two different and distinct phenomena
(Hassan and Mano (2014)). Recent research in international finance has de-emphasized the
forward premium anomaly, focused directly on currency excess returns, and has produced
new insights. A methodological innovation introduced by Lustig and Verdelhan (2007), was
to change the observational unit from individual returns to portfolios of returns. Identifica-
tion of systematic risk in currency excess returns has long posed a challenge to this research,
and the use of portfolios aids in this identification by averaging out idiosyncratic return
fluctuations. Since the returns are available to global investors, and portfolio formation
allows diversification of country-specific risk, presumably only global risk factors remain
to drive portfolio returns. Following the recent literature, our test assets are interest-rate
ranked portfolios of currency excess returns.
       The factor is constructed by computing the conditional skewness of each country’s
unemployment gap and subtracting the average of the bottom quartile of countries from the
average of the top quartile. The factor is robust to alternative conditional moments (mean
and volatility), alternative macro fundamentals (change in unemployment rate, output

    Regressions of the future currency depreciation on the interest differential typically give a negative slope
coefficient in violation of the zero-profit uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) condition. Hodrick (1987),
Engel (1996), and Lewis (1995) survey earlier work on the topic, which viewed excess returns as risk
premia and emphasized the time-series properties of individual currency excess returns. Whether through
estimation or quantitative evaluation of asset pricing models, explanatory power was low and this body
of work was unable to produce or identify mechanisms for risk premia that were sufficiently large or
acceptably correlated with the excess returns. This is not to say interest in the topic has waned. See, for
example, Alvarez et al. (2009), Bansal and Shaliastovich (2012), Chinn and Zhang (2015), Engel (2016),
and Verdelhan (2010).

gap, output growth, real exchange rate gap, real exchange rate depreciation, consumption
growth, and inflation rate), and the two risk factors (dollar risk factor and carry trade risk
factor) for currency excess returns considered by Lustig et al. (2011). The significance of
the conditional skewness measure underscores the importance of asymmetries in the state
of nature–asymmetries which are obscured by volatility measures of uncertainty.
   While the HMLskew of the unemployment gap factor looks like a risk factor to the
portfolio returns, the mechanism differs across portfolios. The betas for low interest (and
hence low currency excess return) portfolios are negative. This is due primarily to the
exchange rate component. Currencies in these portfolios lose value when there is an increase
in global uncertainty, as measured by the factor. In contrast, beta on the high interest
portfolio is positive, primarily on account of the interest rate component of returns. When
the factor spikes up, the yields in this portfolio increase as global investors flee the debt of
these countries. The currencies of the high interest portfolio countries also fall in the bad
state but not enough to offset the increase in the interest rate differential.
   In a complete-markets setting, the carry-trade-generated excess returns are priced by
our HMLskew of the unemployment gap if country-level stochastic discount factors (SDF)
load heterogeneously on the global factor. How much heterogeneity is there in SDF global
factor loadings? We explore this issue with two illustrative examples. In the first instance,
we report on heterogeneity in individual consumption growth exposure to the factor. In a
world of constant relative-risk aversion utility, consumption growth is proportional to the
log SDF. Our second illustration examines the heterogeneity in SDF loadings on the global
factor from simulated method of moments estimation of an affine yield model (adapted from
Lustig et al. (2011) and Backus et al. (2001)) of the term structure of interest rates, applied
to pricing currency excess returns. Simulations of this reduced form model show that
estimated heterogeneity in the loadings on HMLskew of the unemployment gap qualitatively
replicates key features of the data.

                                               3
   Our paper is part of a literature that studies portfolios of currency excess returns in the
context of asset pricing models and is closest to the absolute asset pricing strand of the liter-
ature, which examines currency returns in terms of their exposure to macroeconomic funda-
mental risk (Lustig and Verdelhan (2007), Burnside et al. (2011), Jorda and Taylor (2012),
Hassan (2013), Menkhoff et al. (2013), and Della Corte et al. (2013), Ready et al. (2015),
and Colacito et al. (2015)). The relative asset pricing strand (Lustig et al. (2011), Daniel
at al. (2014), and Ang and Chen (2010)) studies risk factors built from other asset returns.
Clarida et al. (2009) and Christiansen et al. (2011) focus on regime switches. Our paper is
also aligned with a strand of the literature that connects notions of uncertainty to currency
excess returns. Menkhoff et al. (2012) price returns to global foreign exchange volatility,
Della Corte et al. (2015) price currency returns to sovereign risk, Brunnermeier et al. (2008),
Jurek (2014), and Lettau et al. (2014) study the relation of returns to crash risk.
   Although our paper is mainly empirical, from a macroeconomic modeling perspective,
an improved understanding of currency excess returns can help inform future developments
in modeling uncovered interest rate parity shocks. Frequently, macro models impose exoge-
nous dynamics into deviations from uncovered interest rate parity (UIP) for the models to
generate realistic exchange rate dynamics (Kollmann (2002), Devereux and Engel (2003),
Engel (2015), and Itskhoki and Mukhin (2016)). An empirical analysis, such as ours, may
aid in developing general equilibrium models with endogenous deviations from UIP.
   The remainder of the paper is organized as follows. The next section discusses the
construction of portfolios of currency excess returns. Section 2 describes the data, Section 3
describes the construction of the macroeconomic risk factors, Section 4 implements the main
empirical work, Section 5 presents the affine asset pricing model, and Section 6 concludes.

1         Portfolios of Currency Excess Returns

Identification of systematic risk in currency returns has long posed a challenge in interna-
tional finance. In early research on single-factor models (e.g., Frankel and Engel (1984),
Cumby (1988), and Mark (1988)), the observational unit was the excess U.S. dollar return
against a single currency. Lustig and Verdelhan (2007) innovated on the methodology by
working with portfolios of currency excess returns instead of returns for individual curren-
cies. This is a useful way to organize the data because it averages out noisy idiosyncratic
and non-systematic variation and improves the ability to uncover systematic risk. Since
global investors have access to these returns, they can form such portfolios and diversify
away country-specific risk. In a world of integrated financial markets, only undiversifiable
global risk factors should be priced.
        Before forming portfolios, we start with the bilateral carry trade. Let there be nt + 1
currencies available at time t.             Let the nominal interest rate of country i be ri,t for
i   =       1, ..., nt , and the U.S. nominal interest rate be r0,t . The United States will al-
ways be country ‘0.’ In the carry, we short the U.S. dollar (USD) and go long in currency
i if ri,t > r0,t . The expected bilateral excess return is

                                                     
                                  Si,t+1
                   Et (1 + ri,t )        − (1 + r0,t ) ' Et (∆ ln (Si,t+1 )) + ri,t − r0,t ,     (1)
                                   Si,t

where Si,t is the USD price of currency i (an increase in Si,t means the USD depreciates
relative to currency i). If r0,t > ri,t , we short currency i and go long in the USD.3
        Next, we extend the carry trade to a multilateral setting. We rank countries by interest
rates from low to high in each time period and use this ranking to form portfolios of currency
excess returns. As in Lustig et al. (2011), we form six such portfolios, called P1 , . . . , P6 . The
portfolios are rebalanced every period. Portfolios are arranged from low (P1 ) to high (P6 ),

        The right hand side of equation (1) is the excess return in log-units.


                                                         5
where P6 is the equally weighted average return from those countries in the highest quantile
of interest rates and P1 is the equally weighted average return from the lowest quantile of
interest rates. Excess portfolio returns are stated relative to the U.S.,

                                  1 X                 Si,t+1
                                          (1 + ri,t )        − (1 + r0,t ),                              (2)
                                 nj,t i∈P              Si,t
                                         j




for j = 1, . . . , 6. In this approach, the exchange rate components of the excess returns are
relative to the USD. The USD is the funding currency if the average of Pj interest rates are
higher than the U.S. rate and vice-versa. An alternative, but equivalent approach would be
to short any of the nt + 1 currencies and to go long in the remaining nt currencies. Excess
returns would be constructed by ‘differencing’ the portfolio return, as in Lustig et al. (2011)
and Menkhoff et al. (2013), by subtracting the P1 return from P2 through P6 .4 It does
not matter, however, whether excess returns are formed by the ‘difference’ method or by
subtracting the U.S. interest rate. As Burnside (2011a) points out, portfolios formed by
one method are linear combinations of portfolios formed by the other. The next section
describes the data we use to construct the portfolios of currency excess returns.



2       The Data

The raw data are quarterly and have a maximal span from 1973Q1 to 2014Q2. When avail-
able, observations are end-of-quarter and point-sampled. Cross-country data availability
varies by quarter. At the beginning of the sample, observations are available for 11 coun-
tries. The sample expands to include additional countries as their data become available,
    4
    If there are nj,t currencies (excluding the reference currency) in portfolio Pj , the USD ex post P6 − P1
excess return is
                              1 X                 Si,t+1    1 X              Sk,t+1
                                      (1 + ri,t )        −       (1 + rk,t )        .                     (3)

                               i∈P6                        k∈P1

and contracts when data vanish (as when countries join the euro). Our encompassing sam-
ple is for 41 countries plus the euro area. The countries are Australia, Austria, Belgium,
Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Ger-
many, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Malaysia,
Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, the Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Roma-
nia, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand,
Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The data set consists of exchange
rates, interest rates, consumption, gross domestic product (GDP), unemployment rates,
and the consumer price index (CPI). The macro data are not seasonally adjusted. Census
seasonal adjustment procedures impound future information into today’s seasonally ad-
justed observations, which is generally unwelcome. We remove the seasonality ourselves
with a moving average of the current and three previous quarters of the variable in question.
   Currency returns are formed using interbank interest rates and spot exchange rates.
The exchange rate, Sj,t , is expressed as USD per foreign currency units so that a higher
exchange rate represents an appreciation of the foreign currency relative to the USD. The
data source from 1996Q1 to 2014Q2 is Datastream for three-month yields and Bloomberg
for exchange rates. Before 1996, coverage from both sources was very thin. To extend the
sample back to 1973Q1, exchange rates and interest rates for Australia, Belgium, Canada,
France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and
the United States are from the Harris Bank Weekly Review. These are quotations from the
last Friday of the quarter from 1973Q1 to 1995Q4.
   One consideration in selecting countries in our sample was based on the availability of
rates on interbank or Eurocurrency loans, which are assets for which traders can take short
positions. Because the rates for alternative currencies are often quoted by the same bank,
Eurocurrency/interbank rates net out cross-country differences in default risk. Imputing
interest rates from the foreign exchange forward premium is not a good idea since covered

                                             7
interest parity has been reported to fail since the onset of the global financial crisis (Pin-
nington and Shamloo (2016) and Du et al. (2016)).5 Additional details on the interest rate
data are provided in Appendix A.
        Real consumption and GDP are from Haver Analytics. The unemployment rate and the
consumer price index (Pj,t ) are from the FRED database at the Federal Reserve Bank of St.
Louis. The log real exchange rate between the United States (country ‘0’) and country j
is qj,t ≡ ln ((Sj,t Pj,t ) /P0,t ).
        In many cases, because of the relatively short time span of the data, the real exchange
rate and unemployment rate appear to be non-stationary. To induce stationarity in these
variables, we work with their ‘gap’ versions. The gap variables are cyclical components
from a recursively applied Hodrick-Prescott (1997) (HP) filter. The HP filter is applied re-
cursively so as not to introduce future information into current observations. The GDP gap
is constructed similarly. The next section discusses the construction of the macroeconomic
risk factors using the data described above.



3         Global Macro Fundamental Risk in Currency Ex-

          cess Returns

This section addresses the central issue of the paper. Does the cross-section of carry-
trade-generated currency excess returns vary in proportion to their exposure to risk factors
based on macro-fundamentals? Burnside et al. (2011) found little evidence that any macro-
variables were priced. Lustig and Verdelhan’s (2007) analysis of U.S. consumption growth
as a risk factor was challenged by Burnside (2011a). Menkhoff et al. (2012) price carry-
trade portfolios augmented by portfolios formed by ranking variables used in the monetary
    5
    We also found imputed interest rates to be excessively volatile and were often negative (in periods
before central banks began paying negative interest).



                                                  8
approach to exchange rates.
       The macroeconomic performance indicators we consider are,

   1. Unemployment rate gap, U E gap

   2. Change in unemployment rate, ∆U E

   3. GDP growth, ∆y

   4. GDP gap, y gap

   5. Real exchange rate gap, q gap

   6. Real exchange rate depreciation, ∆q

   7. Aggregate consumption growth, ∆c

   8. Inflation rate, π

       The rationale for the unemployment rate, consumption growth, and GDP measures is
obvious. Both the gap and rates of change are employed to induce stationarity in the
real exchange rate, unemployment rate, and GDP observations. The output gap is a key
variable of interest to central banks in the conduct of monetary policy and setting the
policy interest rate. The unemployment rate gap is closely related through Okun’s law.6
Orphanides and Williams (2005, 2006, and 2007) employ the unemployment rate gap in
their models of central bank interest rate feedback rules.
       Inflation, especially at higher levels, is associated with the economic state by depressing
economic activity. In the stochastic discount factor (SDF) approach to exchange rates, the
real depreciation is the foreign-U.S. difference in log real SDFs (mt ), ∆qi,t = mi,t − m0,t .
   6
    Okun’s law states that a one percent increase in the unemployment rate gap results in a two percent
decline in the output gap.




                                                  9
We try to obtain information on the international distribution of the log SDFs through
consideration of the real exchange rate gap.
        For each country, we compute time-varying conditional mean, conditional volatility, and
conditional skewness of the macro variables. The conditional moments are estimated by
sample moments computed from a backward-looking moving 18-quarter window.7 We then
form high-minus-low conditional mean (HMLmean ), high-minus-low conditional volatility
(HMLvol ), and high-minus-low conditional skewness (HMLskew ) versions of these variables
by subtracting the average value in the bottom quartile from the average in the top quartile.
        We consider volatility since it is a popular measure of uncertainty. The skewness mea-
sure provides an alternative measure of macroeconomic uncertainty and highlights the role
of distributional asymmetries. High (low) skewness means a high probability of a right
(left) tail event. The high-minus-low construction is similar to the interquartile range,
which captures the concept of global uncertainty.8 Our primary interest is in the higher-
ordered moments (volatility and skewness), but Menkhoff et. al (2013) found first-moments
to be priced, so we include them for comparison.



4         Empirical Results

We study systematic macroeconomic risk in carry-trade-generated excess returns by esti-

alternative window lengths. These results are reported in Appendix C.
    8
      We point out that there is a literature that attempts to measure macroeconomic uncertainty. For
example, Baker et al. (2016) build their measure by counting the frequency with which newspaper articles
mention words like ‘policy uncertainty,’ and Jurado et al. (2013) which is based on the conditional volatility
of forecast errors. In contrast, our measures are comparatively low tech and easily computable.

                        t=1 rit   and the slope coefficient λk is the risk premia associated with
the k − th risk factor. We draw inference about the λs from generalized method of mo-
ments (GMM) standard errors as described in Cochrane (2005) and Burnside (2011b).
GMM standard errors recognize that the betas in equation (5) are not themselves data,
but are estimated from the data. They also account for potential serial correlation and
heteroskedasticity in the errors.9
       We begin with estimation of a single-factor model (K = 1), where the single risk factor
is one of the HMLmean , HMLvol , and HMLskew global macro risk factors discussed above.
Table 1 shows the second stage estimation results for the single-factor model.10 We see that
the HMLskew of the unemployment gap factor is priced in the excess returns. The price of
risk λ is positive, the t-ratio is significant, and the R2 is very high. Several other factor
candidates also appear to be priced, such as HMLskew measures of ∆U E and ∆y, HMLvol
measures of ∆U E, y gap , ∆y, q gap , ∆c, and π, and HMLmean measures of ∆y, q gap , ∆q, and
π. For these factor candidates, the t-ratios on λ estimates are significant at the 5% level,
and many of the R2 values are also quite high. However, it is not the case that generically
   9
    Details of the GMM estimation and inference are given in Appendix B.

    Note that construction of the factors requires 18 start-up observations. Estimation uses observations
from 1977Q3-2014Q2.

formed high-minus-low specifications on conditional moments of macro fundamentals will
automatically get priced. For example, the HMLskew measures of the real exchange rate
gap and real exchange rate changes are not priced, and these specifications have low R2
values.11
       The single-factor results give an informal impression that the HMLskew of the unem-
ployment gap factor dominates the alternative measures of the global risk factor. The price
of risk has the highest t-ratio and the regression has the highest R2 . Figure 1 displays the
scatter plot of the average portfolio currency excess returns against the HMLskew of the
unemployment gap betas multiplied by lambda.
       To more formally assess the impression that HMLskew of the unemployment gap dom-
inates, we estimate a series of two-factor models with the HMLskew of the unemployment
gap as the maintained (first) factor and each of the alternative factor constructions as the
second factor. Table 2 shows the two-factor estimation results.
       Here, the HMLskew of the unemployment gap factor is significantly priced at the 5%
level in all cases, while only HMLvol of inflation and HMLmean of inflation are significantly
priced as a second factor at the 5% level. We continue to find the Wald test on the pricing
errors to be insignificant. These results provide additional support that the HMLskew of
the unemployment gap factor is the global macro risk factor for carry trade excess returns.
  11
    In closed-economy asset pricing, the excess return is constructed relative to what the investor considers
to be the risk-free interest rate and if the model is properly specified, the intercept γ should be zero. In
the international setting, the carry trades are available to investors all around the world. When the trade
matures, the payoff needs to be repatriated to the investor’s home currency, which entails some foreign
exchange risk. Hence, the excess returns relative to the U.S. are not necessarily relative to ‘the’ risk-free
rate, so there is no presumption that the intercept γ is zero.

start-up to compute initial high-minus-low factors. Model estimated on returns from 1977Q3 to 2014Q2. ∆y, y gap , ∆c, ∆U E,
U E gap , π, q gap , and ∆q represent the GDP growth rate, GDP gap, consumption growth rate, change in the unemployment
rate, unemployment rate gap, inflation rate, real exchange rate gap, and real exchange rate depreciation, respectively. For
each country (41 countries plus the euro area) and each macroeconomic variable, we compute the ‘conditional’ mean, volatility,
and skewness using an 18-quarter window. To form the portfolio returns, we sort by the nominal interest rate (carry) for each
country from low to high. The rank ordering is divided into six portfolios, into which the currency returns are assigned. P6 is
the portfolio of returns associated with the highest nominal interest rate countries and P1 is the portfolio of returns associated
with the lowest nominal interest rate countries. This table reports the two-pass procedure estimation results from a one-factor
model. In the first pass, we run N = 6 individual time-series regressions of the excess returns on the K factors to estimate

values of the conditional mean, volatility, and skewness of ∆y, y gap , ∆c, ∆U E, U E gap , π, q gap , and ∆q. Each high-minus-low
value is equal to the average in the highest quartile minus the average in the lowest quartile. In the second pass, we run a

Notes: Currency excess returns are in log-units. The total excess return, interest rate differential, and
exchange rate return βs come from equations (6)–(8). The factor is HMLskew of the unemployment rate
gap. t-ratios are computed by Newey-West and are in brackets.


Decomposition. To delve deeper into the risk-return relationship, Table 3 reports the de-
composition of the betas of the portfolio excess returns in log-units into contributions from
the interest rate differential and the exchange rate return components.12 The total excess
return β is from the regression

    Statistical significance of the betas are not the key issue as the GMM standard error estimates on the
λ estimates take into account that the betas are estimated.

where i = 1, ..., 6 and ftHM L is the HMLskew of the unemployment rate gap factor. Notice
that the betas on exchange rate returns are uniformly negative. Currency values of all the
portfolios decline relative to the USD in times when the factor is high. Similarly, the betas
for the interest rate differentials for P1 through P4 are negative. However, the beta for the
interest rate differentials for P5 and P6 are positive. For P6 , the magnitude is so large that
it more than offsets the negative beta for the exchange rate return. Why do yields increase
for these portfolios in times of high global uncertainty? Because global investors flee the
debt of these countries in the bad state which drives bond prices down and yields up.

Factor Dynamics and Country Composition. A visual of the factor is presented in Figure 2,
which plots the high, low, and high-minus-low average values of skewness of the unemploy-
ment rate gap. Low skewness is typically negative. The figure also shows Europe and U.S.
business cycle dating.

   To see which countries are key in constructing the factor, Table 4 lists the top 10 coun-
tries that appear most frequently in construction of the HMLskew of the unemployment gap
factor. They are roughly a mix of developed and emerging economies. In the carry trade,
the Australian dollar is typically a long currency and the Japanese yen is typically a short
currency. Consistent with this, Australia is featured in the top quartile of unemployment
gap skewness 51% of the time and Japan is featured in the bottom quartile 26% percent of
the time.

Relation of Factor to Other Uncertainty Measures. We interpret a high value of the factor
to represent a high degree of global uncertainty, but is the HMLskew of the unemployment
gap simply replicating other uncertainty measures proposed in the literature? We examine
this question by regressing the factor on alternative news-based measures of economic
uncertainty constructed by Baker et al. (2016). We consider the uncertainty indices for




                                                 18
the U.S., Europe, Japan, Australia, and a global measure.13 We also regress the HMLskew
of the unemployment gap on the log VIX and a log measure of U.S. financial uncertainty.
Table 5 shows the results.

Notes: Bold indicates significance at the 5% level. Log U.S., Europe, Japan, Australia, Global Uncer-
tainty, and U.S. Finance indices are from Baker et al. (2016) which were downloaded from their website,
http://www.policyuncertainty.com/index.html. They are indices built from the frequency of words appear-
ing in major newspapers that refer to economic or policy uncertainty. The VIX is the Chicago Board of
Options Exchange volatility index.


       Our proposed factor is negatively correlated with the news-based measures of uncer-
tainty and the regression R2 are quite low. Although the slope on the log VIX is positive
and significant, the R2 on this regression is also very small. Our factor is also positively
correlated with the U.S. financial uncertainty index, but the slope is not significant. The
information content in the HMLskew of the unemployment gap variable is very different
from that contained in these more popular measures of uncertainty.

Predictive Value. The factor is constructed by conditioning on past observations. Does this
formulation of the past have predictive value? To examine this issue, we regress the cross-
sectional mean of interest rates and consumption growth, and the cross-sectional standard
deviation of interest rates and consumption growth on one lagged value of the factor.
  13
    Baker et al. (2016) create uncertainty indices for Australia, China, Europe, France, Germany, Great
Britain, India, Italy, Japan, Korea, Russia, Spain, and the United States. We form the global index by
taking the cross-sectional average of the individual country indices.

                                                  19
Table 6 shows the results. These in-sample predictive regressions show support that the
factor has predictive power for the cross-sectional mean of interest rates, the cross-sectional
volatility of interest rates and the cross-sectional volatility of consumption growth.

    Why might a higher value of the factor predict increased international dispersion of
interest rates and consumption growth? A potential channel is if there are heterogeneous
responses by central bankers across countries to the unemployment gap in conducting mon-
etary policy. When global economic uncertainty rises, country policy rates react differently.
Investors flee the debt of risky countries and households adjust consumption differentially as
well, which generates higher cross-sectional average interest rates and higher cross-sectional
volatility of interest rates and consumption growth.

Pre-Crisis Sample. Since we are using quarterly observations due to the availability of the
macro variables, we do not have a surplus of time-series observations. Nevertheless, we can
do some limited subsample analyses. Here, we ask if our results are driven by the global
financial crisis. Lustig and Verdelhan (2011) point specifically to the poor performance of
the carry trade during the crisis as an example of the risk borne by international investors
in the carry trade. To answer this question, we end the sample in 2008Q2.

      Table 7 shows the results from the single-factor estimation over the pre-crisis sample.
The HMLskew of the unemployment gap factor remains significantly priced at the 5% level
and gives the second highest R2 . In the specification with the highest R2 , the macro risk
factor is not significant. Fewer of the alternative factor measures are significantly priced.
This could be because they were more pronounced during the crisis or because we have a
smaller sample, having lost 24 quarterly observations–a reduction of 16% of the time-series
observations.
      In Table 8, we evaluate robustness in the pre-crisis subsample, by maintaining HMLskew
of the unemployment gap as the first factor and alternating the second factor. HMLskew of
the unemployment gap remains significantly priced at the 5% level in 14 specifications and
at the 10% level in 4 specifications. The only alternative factor that is significantly priced
at the 5% level is the HMLvol of consumption growth.

Sorting currency excess returns by beta. In the foregoing analysis, we sorted countries into
portfolios and found that their excess returns varied proportionately with their betas on the
HMLskew of the unemployment gap factor. Additional evidence that this variable provides
a risk-based explanation would be if the betas of individual excess returns vary and are
increasing in those returns. To investigate along these lines, for each individual currency i,
at time t, we create an excess return by going long (short) in that currency if its interest
rate is higher (lower) than the U.S. interest rate. We then estimate beta for each currency
individually and sort the excess returns into three portfolios by their beta.

there are both positive beta and negative beta currencies. The identification by individual

Notes: The raw data are quarterly (1973Q1 to 2014Q2) and, when available, are end-of-quarter and point-
sampled. For each country (41 countries plus the euro area), we compute the ‘conditional’ unemployment
rate gap skewness using an 18-quarter window. Individual currency excess returns are in USD, set relative
to the U.S. nominal interest rate, and are stated in percent per annum. The figure plots individual country
carry-trade-generated average excess returns against their betas.


    Our results share similarities with Lustig et al. (2011). In both papers, the global
risk factor connects with the concept of global macroeconomic uncertainty. Their relative
asset pricing work identifies the high-minus-low currency excess returns between P6 and P1
portfolios as the global risk factor, which they argue is associated with changes in global
equity market volatility.

Developed Countries. Are our results driven entirely by emerging market economies? To
address this question, we restrict the sample to developed economies.14 As seen in Table 10,
  14
     We omit Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Czech Republic, Hungary, Indonesia, India, Malaysia, Mexico, Philip-
pines, Romania, South Africa, Thailand, and Turkey.


                                                                      24
the factor is significantly priced at the 10% level, into the six portfolio excess returns formed
only by developed countries.

Relation to Lustig et al. (2011) factors. Does the HMLskew of the unemployment gap factor
dominate successful risk factors previously found in the currency excess return literature?
We address this by comparing our factor with the dollar risk factor (RX) and the carry
trade risk factor (HMLF X ) from Lustig et al. (2011). Lustig et al. (2011) show that these
two factors can adequately explain carry-trade-generated excess returns. The dollar risk
factor is the cross-sectional average of carry-trade-generated excess returns. The carry
trade risk factor is the excess return from going long in the high interest rate portfolio and
going short in the low interest rate portfolio.

Notes: We estimate a two-factor model with the HMLskew of the unemployment rate gap as the maintained
first factor (associated with λ1 ) and each of the alternative factor constructions (HMLF X and RX) as the
second factor (associated with λ2 ) to assess the impression that HMLskew of the unemployment rate gap
is the dominant factor. HMLF X is the carry trade risk factor and RX is the dollar risk factor. These two
factors are from Lustig et al. (2011). See notes to Table 1.


    Table 11 shows the estimation results from the two-factor model where HMLskew of the

                                                   25
unemployment gap is the maintained first factor and the second risk factor is either RX
or HM LF X . The HMLskew of the unemployment gap factor remains significantly priced
into the excess returns. Neither the dollar factor nor the carry trade factor are significantly
priced into the excess returns when the HMLskew of the unemployment gap is included as
a factor.



5     Two Illustrations

The empirical work above does not say that countries with high (low) unemployment gap
skewness have high (low) interest rates and pay out high (low) currency excess returns. It
says investors pay attention to the HMLskew of the unemployment gap factor, as a global
risk factor.
    In this section, we give two illustrations of how this global risk factor might be connected
to currency returns and to give some interpretation and context for the empirical results.
We do not intend these to serve as serious quantitative models, but as illustrative examples
of the heterogeneity in the way SDFs across countries load on the global factor.

       Systematic variation in the currency excess return Ri,t+1 results from systematic vari-
ation in V0,t − Vi,t . Country-level SDFs may load on country-specific factors, but in order
for portfolios with higher HMLskew of unemployment gap betas to have higher returns, the
SDFs must also load differentially on the global factor. Thus, heterogeneity across coun-
tries in the SDF loading on the global factor is an essential ingredient for understanding
patterns in the variation of international currency returns. We give two illustrations of this
heterogeneity.

Consumption Growth and Constant Relative Risk Aversion Utility. If investors have con-
stant relative risk averse utility, then the log SDF is proportional to the consumption
growth rate, and heterogeneity in consumption growth exposure is also heterogeneity in
SDF exposure. Our first illustration of heterogeneity in exposure to the HMLskew of the
unemployment gap is where we regress the consumption growth rate of each country on
the HMLskew of the unemployment gap. Figure 4 is a histogram of country-level consump-
tion growth exposure (estimated slope coefficients). The result is substantial heterogene-
ity in exposure–some countries exhibiting positive and others negative exposure. Many
of the more extreme exposure estimates are statistically significantly different from zero.
This heterogeneity might have been expected, given the low cross-country correlation of
consumption–a long-standing puzzle in international macroeconomics.

       Colacito and Croce (2011) estimate long-run risk across various countries by regressing
a country’s consumption growth on lagged macro and financial variables.16 Is it possible
that the lagged HMLskew unemployment gap is also capturing a long-run risk component
in consumption? The Eurozone and Chile are two countries where we have relatively long
time-series of quarterly consumption and where their consumption growth rates appear to
exhibit some systematic variation. Figure 5 plots actual consumption growth and the fitted
values for the Eurozone and Chile, where it appears that the factor is capturing a long-run
risk component in consumption growth.

    Their variables were the lagged price-dividend ratio, consumption-output ratio, default premia, and
consumption growth.

An Affine-Yield Model. As an alternative illustration, we draw on a no-arbitrage model for
interest rates and exchange rates. The model is closely related to Backus et al. (2001) and
Lustig et al. (2011)’s affine-yield models of the term structure to pricing currency excess
returns.
     To ease notation, we will call the global risk factor zg,t = HMLskew of the unemployment
gap. Let zi,t be a country-specific risk factor. Investors pay attention to both the global and
country-specific risk factors through their impact on the log nominal SDF, ni,t+1 , according
to

and vg,t and vi,t are independent standard normal variates. Since the global factor must
be built from an aggregation of country factors, we allow the country-specific innovation
to be correlated with the global innovation E (ui,t ug,t ) = ρi .

                µi,t = −θi (zi,t + zg,t )                                                           (17)

       Heterogeneity in the risk-factor loadings on the log SDFs is not necessary to generate
time-varying currency excess returns (i.e., differences in conditional variances), which can
be achieved through differences in the realizations of country-specific risk zi,t . What is key,
however, is that the log SDFs load on the global factor zgt . If they do not, excess currency
returns may be non-zero, but they will not be priced by the global risk factor.
       We proceed by estimating the model by simulated method of moments, then simulating
the model and assessing the properties of the implied currency returns as described in
equations (9)-(11).17
       We begin by estimating the process for the global risk factor (HMLskew of the unem-
ployment rate gap) zg,t separately. Parameters in equation (13) are estimated by simulated

    Next, we estimate the parameters of each country’s nominal SDF. Recall that we do not
have a balanced panel, as the time-span coverage varies by availability. Our data sample
consists of 41 countries that can be bilaterally paired with the United States (country ‘0’).
Of these 41 countries, 38 have sufficiently long time-series data that we use in the estimation.
Estimation is done bilaterally. The 14 moments we use in the estimation are E (hi,t ), where

We estimate three versions of the model. In one version, the SDFs do not load on the global
factor. In the other restricted model, the SDFs load only on the global factor but not on the
country-specific factors. In the third version, the SDFs load on both the country-specific
and global factors.
    We are primarily interested in seeing if the heterogeneity in the estimated parameters
is sufficient to generate carry-trade-generated currency returns as found in the data. There
are a large number of estimation results, the details of which are not essential. To provide
a sense of the heterogeneity uncovered in estimation, Figure 6 presents histograms of the
estimated values of the loadings on the global factor, θi and δi , from the unconstrained
model.

   We simulate the three versions of the estimated model. In each of the 2,000 simulations,
we generate 87 observations on exchange rate returns and interest rates across the 38 coun-
tries and the United States. In the data, we had, on average, 87 time-series observations.
For each replication, we sort currencies into six interest rate ranked portfolios, compute
their mean excess (over the U.S.) returns and Sharpe ratios, and estimate the single-factor
beta-risk model. Table 13 reports the median values over the 2,000 simulations.

Notes: We simulate the model of equations (9)–(11) 2,000 times. For each simulation, we generate 87
observations (to match the 87 time-series observations available, on average, in the data) on exchange rate
returns and interest rates for 38 countries and the United States. For each simulation, currencies are sorted
into six interest rate ranked portfolios. We then compute their mean excess returns (over the U.S.), their
Sharpe ratios. Panel A shows the median values across the 2,000 simulations. Panel B shows the median
of the second stage estimates of the beta-risk model. λ is the slope on the global factor beta and γ is the
constant term. t-ratios are in brackets and p-values are in parentheses.


    In each of the models, the simulated carry-trade-generated average excess returns are
increasing as one moves from P1 to P6 (panel A). Even when country SDFs load only on
country-specific factors, the carry trade is profitable, the average implied return on P6 being
31 percent. The estimated heterogeneity in the two versions where country SDFs load on
HMLskew of the unemployment gap imply average excess returns that are more realistic,
but still somewhat larger than seen in the data.
    Panel B shows median estimates of the implied beta-risk model. Here, it is verified
that the global risk factor is unpriced if the SDFs do not load on that factor. The median


                                                     33
t-ratio on λ is far from 2, even though the median R2 value is quite high. The median
point estimate of λ is negative.
    The global-risk factor is priced in the other two versions of the model. The median R2
is similar to that obtained from the data, the median t-ratio is significant, and the median
point estimate of λ is positive.
    The point of the exercise in this section is not to replicate exactly the moments of the
data but to illustrate the link between the global factor and carry-trade-generated excess
returns. The unconstrained model captures three broad features of the data. Average excess
returns are generally increasing in the carry-trade portfolios P1 through P6 , the forward
premium anomaly is more pronounced when portfolio interest rates are more similar to
U.S. rates, and investor SDFs must load on the global factor. Probably, their SDFs load
also on country-specific factors as well.



6     Conclusion

It has long been understood that systematic currency excess returns (deviations from un-
covered interest parity) are available to investors. Less well understood is what risks are
being compensated for by the excess returns. In a financially integrated world, excess re-
turns should be driven by common factors. We find that a global risk factor, constructed
as the high-minus-low conditional skewness of the unemployment rate gap, is priced into
carry-trade-generated excess returns. Carry-trade-generated currency excess returns com-
pensate for global macroeconomic risks.
    There are three notable features of this risk factor. First, it is a macroeconomic fun-
damental. As Lustig and Verdelhan (2011) point out, since the statistical link between
asset returns and macroeconomic factors is always weaker than the link between asset re-
turns and return-based factors, the high explanatory power provided by this factor and its


                                             34
significance is noteworthy. Second, the factor is global in nature. It is constructed from av-
erages of countries in the top and bottom quartiles of the unemployment rate gap skewness.
Since the portfolios of carry-trade-generated excess returns are available to global investors,
only global risk factors should be priced. Third, the factor measures something different
from standard measures of global uncertainty. Embracing notions of both country-level
uncertainty and global uncertainty, the high-minus-low global macro risk factor captures
asymmetries in the distribution of the global state that reflect the divergence, disparity,
and inequality of fortunes across countries.

where β i is a k-dimensional vector of the factor betas for excess return i and λ is the
k−dimensional vector of factor risk premia. The expectation is taken over t. The beta-risk
model’s answer to the question as to why average returns vary across assets is that returns
with high betas (covariance with a factor) pay a high-risk premium (λ). The cross-sectional
test can be implemented with a two-pass procedure. Let f t be the k-dimensional vector of
the macro factors. In the first pass for each excess return i = 1, ..., n, estimate the factor
betas in the time-series regression,

The αi are the pricing errors. When the cross-sectional regression is run without a constant,
set γ = 0.
                                         rei = γ + β 0i λ + αi .

OLS standard errors give asymptotically incorrect inference because the βs are not data
but are generated regressors. Cochrane (2005) describes a procedure to obtain GMM
standard errors that delivers an asymptotically valid inference that is robust to the gener-
ated regressors problem and robust to heteroskedasticity and autocorrelation in the errors.
Cochrane’s strategy is to use the standard errors from a GMM estimation problem that
exactly reproduces the two-stage regression point estimates. We will need the following

We do Newey-West on ut (θ) to get ST . We will want to plug in our estimated λ and βs into dT . This

                                             T g T (θ) = 0

and can be recast as having a weighting matrix on the moment conditions

                                                    aT g T (θ) = 0

The covariance matrix of θ for this problem is,
                                                        1            −1

                                                        T
but this is not the covariance matrix for the two-pass estimation problem. The reason is that the last set
of n moment conditions in gT (θ) isn’t the cross-sectional regression estimated by least squares (which is

   We do not use GMM to estimate the model. We use the two-step procedure to get
the point estimates for the betas and lambdas and plug those estimates into the GMM
formulae to get standard errors.

     Notes: We estimate a two-factor model with the HMLskew of the U E gap as the maintained first factor (associated with λ1 ) and each of the alternative factor
     constructions as the second factor (associated with λskew , λvol , and λmean ) to assess the impression that HMLskew of the U E gap is the dominant factor. 16 quarters

     Notes: We estimate a two-factor model with the HMLskew of the U E gap as the maintained first factor (associated with λ1 ) and each of the alternative factor
     constructions as the second factor (associated with λskew , λvol , and λmean ) to assess the impression that HMLskew of the U E gap is the dominant factor. 20 quarters
