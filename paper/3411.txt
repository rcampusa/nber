I. Introduction
    Over the past century, the world economy has passed through a succession of phases

characterized by very different levels of international capital flows. This paper asks what

accounts for these dramatic shifts in the extent of capital movements across national borders.

    The broad trends to be explained are as follows. Between 1880 and 1913, capital

movements among industrial and industrializing countries reached heights never scaled

subsequently. The absolute value of the current account of the balance of payments

averaged 2.9 per cent of CINP for a sample of 9 rapidly industrializing countries. Berween

1924 and 1936, current account balances were very considerably smaller; for the same

sample of countries they averaged 0.8 per cent of GNP. Between 1965 and 1986 they

recovered alightly, to an average of 1.3 per cent of ONPJJ

    These broad trends conceal other facts that require explanation. Each of the three

epochs, for example, contained a shorter period of 5 to 10 years marked by a dramatically

higher volume of international capital flows. Between 1902 and 1913, the absolute value of

the corrent account balance for our sample of 9 countries avenged 4.0 per cent of GNP.

Between 1925 and 1928, the comparable figure was 1.4 per cent;between 1973 and 1981. it

was 1.7 per cent. The 20th century has also been marked by repeated shifts in the

composition of foreign investment. Between WOO and 1913, U.S. direct foreign investment

(DFI) consistently exceeded foreign portfolio investment. Then from 1914 through 1928,
portfolio investment took the lead. For the next four decades, DPI was once more

consistently greater than portfolio investment abroad. After 1973. the relationship between

the two magnitudes reversed again.

    The literature contains no wholly satisfactory explanation for these shifts in the extent of

capital flows, Three schools of thought may be distinguished. The first focuses on the

intemational financial and monetary regime. The exceptional volume of international capital
flows in the three decades prior to 1913 is atuibuted to the operation of the international

gold standard (MclCinnon, 1989; Bayoomi, 1989). Exchange rare stability under the gold

standard minimized currency risks that otherwise discourage investment abroad. The

price-specie flow mechanism smoothly absorbed shifts in the volume of foreign lending

through accommodating changes in prices and/or spending and hence in the balance of ffadc.

Policymakers rook no steps to regulate foreign lending or to minimize current aciount

imbalances, so long as the current and private capital accounts were roughly offsetting and

central banks did not gain or lose significant reserves. Since the 1960s, in contrast,

exchange risk has discouraged investment abroat In this view, the surge of lending in the

1970a took place despite, not because of, the increased volatility of exchange rates,

     The second school of thought focuses on the stages of indebtedaess through which

countries are thought to pass (de Vries, 1971; Siebert, 1989). Nations at the earliest stages

of development, according to this theory, lack the poiiticai and economic infrasmicturc

necessary to borrow abroad. As soon as those preconditions are put in place, borrowing

commences. The return on investment is high in the early stages of development, while

little saving is undertaken by households whose current income is less than their expected

future income. Hence there is considerable incentive to import financial capi;ai from sbrosd.

As development proceeds, incomes rise, as do savings. The stock of high-return investments

is depleted. Domestic saving comes to exceed domestic investment, and the infant capital

importer becomes a mature capital exporter. This model suggests that epochs of large-scale

foreign lending axe those characterized by pronounced divergences among countries in their

stages of development.

    The third school focuses on the boom-and-buss cycles through which intemstional

capital markets ostensibly pass. Lending seems to be characterized by 20 year cycles

marked by, in succession, a surge of lending, a sudden halt, severe debt-servicing difficulties


                                               2
culminating in default ox rescheduling, and an extended period of inactivity (iCindleberger,

1986; Eichengreen and Lindert, 1989) Each cycle is inidated by financial innovation or a

disturbance to the pattern of international setdementa. The innovation or disturbance

provokes excessive enthusiasm which raises lending to unsustainable heights. Eventually, a

shock to financial or commodity markets curtails lending abruptly, revealing the difficulties

the borrowing counu-ies will face in servicing their debts. Reckless enthusiasm gives way to

extreme caution. International capital markets remain becalmed for a decade or more, until

another displacement reinitiases she process. Epochs of large-scale lending are those

characterized by long, heated booms and ahort, shallow busts.

    The three main sections of this paper assess these three explanations fnr changes in the

volume of foreign lending. Though each approach has something to contribute to the

discussion, none of them is totally satisfactory. In the conclusion, I therefore suggest a new

direction in which research will have to proceed if it is to provide an adequate explanation

for the differences in the volume of international capital flows that have characterized the

last 100 years.



H. The Policy Regime

    A standard way of analyzing international capital movements, following Feldstein and

1-lorioka (1980), is through aaviogs-investment correlations. Recently, Bayoumi (1989) has
replicated Feldatein and Horioka's analysis of recent decades for the classical gold staodard

period. His finding of a lower correlation between domestic saving and investment before

1913 has been taken as evidence that the fixed exchange rates of gold standard encouraged

capital mobility and enhanced the efficiency with which resources were allocated

intemationally.2J In this section I reassess his findings and provide some additional results.




                                               3
     As those who have worked with Feldssein and Horioka's data know, measurement

problems arise when one attempts to compare savings and investment rates across countries.
Domesdc investment is commonly taken as the sum of fsxed and inventory investment.

Different depreciation conveneons prevail in different countries, creating different wedges

between gross and net capital   formation. Data on inventories are gathered or imputed in

different ways For developing counnies, domestic saving is consmscsed typically as the
sum of domestic investment and the current account of the balance of payments. Not only

wsU errors in measuring investment therefore contaminate measures of saving, but the current

account is ttself measured with error. (Wimess the failure of global current account balances
to sum to zero.)

    These problems are compounded when one attempts to utilize historical statistics. The
underlying data base is fngile. Historians who use it to retrospectively estimate national

income accounts are forced to adapt their accounting conventions to the imperatives of data

availability. Lack of information on stocks makes it all but impossible estimate inventory

investment for some cotsntries, for example.

    Data problems pose special difficulties for comparisons over time. As the underlyiog
data base changes, so do the methods used to construct the national income accounts. I

attempt to minimize these problems by using, insofar as possible, components that are

constructed in similar ways and by combining the same components to construct aggregates.

Except where noted otherwise, I take investment as the sum of gross domestic fixed capital

formation (ODFCF) and net inventory investment, I take saving as the sum of investment

and the current account of the balance of payments, even for those portions of the 20th

century for which alternative savings measures exist3J

    Bayoumi drew estimates of investment and the current account from Mitchell (1980) for

Denmark, Germany, Italy, Norway, Sweden and the U.K., and from Mitchell (1983) for


                                               4
Canada and Australia He averaged annual data, except for Canada prior to 1924, where for

investment and GNP it was necessary to interpolate between the estimates for the first year

of each decade.

    A problem with these investment data is that inventories are not included for the U.K.,

Denmark, Sweden, Australia and Canada4j For the U.K., estimates of inventory invcstment

are in fact available in Feinstein (1972). Inventory investment is small relative to GDFCF

but highly variable. Between 1880 and 1914 its extreme values are on the order of -20 per

cent and ÷35 per cent of GDFCF. In what follows, I combine inventory investment with

GDFCF for the U.K.

    In addition, subsequent work has improved earlier estimates nf capital formation. I have

subetituted recent figures from Feinstein (1988) for the U.K. and Urquhart (1986) for

Canada, and used some alternative estimates of U.S. savings constructed by Ransnm and

Sutch (1983)jJ I have extended these data using IMF (1988) for 1965-86.

    Bsyoumi omits data for the U.S. on the grounds that American savings and investment

rates are higher and more correlated than those for other countries. The correlation

presumably reflects the fact that the U.S. current account was a smali and stable share of

UN? throughout the period. There are no obvious grounds for challenging either of these

properties of the series. It is not clear why U.S. investment rates should be more suspect

than analogous figures for other countries, since they are constructed using similar methods.

I have therefore included the U.S. throughout, although I utilize in addition to the standard

series an alternative measure of U.S. savings rates constructed by Ransom and Sutch (1983).

    Table I reports regressions of investment on savings (expressed as shares of GDP) for

vanous subperiods. The slope coefficient of 0.63 in the basic regression for 1880-1913 is

nearly twice as large as Bayoumi's and, in contrast with his results, significantly different

from zero at the 90 per cent confidence level. The next three lines show that essentially the

same result holds for the individual decades that comprise the period. The

savings-investment correlation is highest before 1900; only for the final decade preceding
World War I is it impossible to reject the null of a zero coefficient at standard confidence

levels.

    While these results weaken Bayoumi's conclusion of no savings-investment correlation

for the gold standard period, the contrast with recent decades remains, For the period

1965-86. using data for ten industrial countries, Bayoumi estimated a slope coefficient of

0.97 with a standard error of 0.11. My estimate of 1.04 with a standard error of (US for

the same 9 counties considered for the gold standard period is consistent with Bayoumi's

and Feldstein-Horioka's results. Although domesdc savings appears to have mattered for

invesmient in both periods, international capital movements did mure to weaken the

savings-invesssnenc correlation in the earlier era.

     An objection to these inferences is that savings is an endogenous variable. A rise in

invesussenc will plausibly raise income and observed savings. When both savings and

investtoent are expressed as shares of GNP, however, the extent and perhaps even the

direction of the bias is unclear. Frankel (1989) finds that correcting Feldstein and Horiuka's

regressions for simultaneity has little impact on the coefficients. The same result obtains

here4/

    Bus is the contrast between 1880-1914 and 1965-86 properly attributable to the policy

regime? Table 1 also provides results for the interwar gold standard period (1925-31). The

savinga-inveaunent correlation is considerably stronger than prior so 1913. Thus, it does not

appear that institution of the gold standard is sufficient to reduce the savings-investment

correlation to 1880-1913 levels,

    One could argue in rebuttal that the interwas- regime was not a true gold standard. I am

not sure what such an objection would mean. Certainly the interwar system was universal in


                                                 6
scope; at its height in 1931, 47 countries participated. It combined the three distinguishing

features   of a gold standard: fixed prices of gold, freedom tn import and export gold, and
rules linking central bank liabilities to their gold reserves. True, a numher of countries had

to intervene to defend convertibility early in the period, and the system collapsed starring in

1931. But similar problems characterized the prewar gold standard. Latin American

countries were repeatedly forced off the gold standard in the final decades of the 19th

century. In 1895 the U.S. caine close to suspending convertibility, events of which investors

were fully aware (Garber and Grilli, 1986). The interwar gold standard reduced the

exchange risk premium to low levels, the effect ostensibly so conducive to international

capital rnobiliry.Z'
    What then accounts for the smaller volume of capital flows under the inrerwar gold

standard compared to the gold standard of prewar years? A plausible explanation lies in the

measures taken by govemments to discourage lending       and borrowing after World War I.
The British government discouraged long-term overseas lending, especially outside the

Commonwealth, when Britain's balance-of-payments position was weak. The German

government discouraged long-term foreign borrowing atarting in 1927. Overseas borrowing

by the Australian Commonwealth and States was strictly controlled by a centralized Loan
Council starring in 1928. The U.S. State Department screened foreign loans prior to theft
issue and nceasionslly raised objections, although these were not always effectively enforced.

Thus, a likely explanation for the decline in overseas lending and borrowing after World

War I is capital-marker intervention by governments.

    Such interference in the operation of the market was not unknown prior to 1913. Then

too the Bank of England had discouraged lending when capital outflows threatened to

exacerbate a balance-of-payments crisis, as in 1906-01. The French and German




                                                7
governments consistently regulated the direction and level of foreign lending (Fishlow,

19S5). Still, intervention was less prevalent before World War I than it became thereafter.

    The observation that official management of overseas lending was more prevalent in the

1920s than before 1913 only pushes the question back a step further. Why did governments

find it necessary to defend convertibility by regulating international lending in the 1920s but

not before 1913? This raises the complicated issue of why the interwar gold standard

seemed to operate less smoothly than its prewar predecessor. The popular hypotheais that

the ratio of international reserves to monetary liabilities was lower after World War I,

making disturbances more difficult to abosorb, does not withstand scrurioy.PJ More

important was the international distribution of reserves: the U.S. and France were in strong

surplus throughout the period, draining gold reserves from other central banks and

intensifying the balance-of-payments pressure on countries like the U.K. The intemadonal

monetary policies of the U.& and France placed balance-of-payments pressure on other

nations, to which their governments responded by curtailing capital flows. Insofar as the

scale of lending prior to 1913 was possible only given a smoothly-operating international

monetary system, the explanation lies in the absence of significant ssymmetries between

surplus and deficit countriea and specifically in the willingness of surplus countries to

adjust9i
    Three additional explanations for the contrast between the prewar and interwar gold

standards warrant mention. First, it is argued that foreign lending was encouraged before

1913 by linkages between capital and commodity markets, Countries that borrowed from

Britain imported capital goods from British suppliers. Hence a debit to the British

balance-of-payments due to a capital outflow was quickly offset by a credit due to increased

merchandise exports. Though these linkages operated, the induced increase in merchandise

exports was smalI.j/ Foreign lending typically financed population-sensitive investnsents in


                                               8
infrasnuesure, notably housing, which did not generate a significant demand for British

capital goods. Insofar as a county like Canada used foreign finance to import capital goods,

it purchased them from the United States. There is little evidence that the U.S. used its

revenues from merchandiae exporta to Canada to purchase commodity imports from the U.K.

There is even less evidence of the operation of these linkages in the case of the other

creditors. French lending to Russia generated little demand for French commodity exports.

for example (White, 1936).

     Second, a less turbulent political environment may have encouraged lending prior to

1913. Default on sovereign debt typically was associated with political revolution, after

which a new government repudiated or renegotiated the debta incurred by its predecessor.

British lending to Canada, Aoatalia, New Zealand and the United States was lending to

regions of exceptional political stability. Aside from the U.S. Civil War, which came toward

the end of the period of large-scale US. foreign borrowing, there were few notable instances

of political instability in the regiona so which Britain lens. Local adminiauations were ron

by British emigres. Members of the British Commonwealth of Nations retained formal

political tiea so the mother county which aurely reduced the likelihood of sovereign default.

This argument does not carry over, however, to counties like Argentina and Brazil, to which
Britain alao lent heavily. Nor does it apply to the loans so Russia, Turkey and Latin

America undertaken by France and Germany.

    A third possibility is that overseas lending was encouraged in the final decades of she

19th century by exceptional rate of return differentials between domestic and foreign

investment. This is the hyposheaia suggested by she stages of indebtedness approach, to
which I now turn.

Ill. Stages of Indebtedness

    The simplest way of exposing the logic of the stages of indebtedness approach is with

the model of Blanchard (1983). Assume no gowth of populadon L, no depreciation of the

capital stock K, no repudiation of foreign debt B, and no technical change. Assume

further that the subjective discount rate is equal to the world interest rate 0.

The solution takes a simple form. in each period, the country invests to the point where the

marginal product nf capital, net of adjustment cnsts, equals the world interest rate. This

determines the capital stock, which determines output From the sssnmptinn that the

discount rate equals the interest rate, consumption is constant over time.

    Starting from a position where its marginal efficiency of capital is high relative to thc

world interest rate, a country horrows abroad to finance a high level of current investment in

addition to its constant level of consumption. When the backlog of unusually pmfitable

investment opportunities is exhausted, foreign borrowing stops. From this point domestic
output must exceed domestic consumption to service deht to foreigners.

    Note that this gets us only part way to the debt cycle resolt. Althoogh the current

account of the balance of payments swings from deficit to surplus, debt is not repaid. It is
simply serviced for the rest of time (Siebert, 1989). Were we to make the subjective rate of

discount a declining function of contemporaneous utility, however, the shadow price of

consumption would fall over time and debt would be repaid. (Note that this assumption is

the opposite of the Uzawa (1968) formulation.) If this effect is sufficiently strong, the infant

debtor will become a mature creditor.



                                                11
    The model suggests that one should observe large capital flows across borders when the

marginal efficiency of investment and the propensity to save are very different across

countries. The marginal efficiency of investment will differ moss markedly across countries

that are at very different stages of development. The incentive for international capital flows

therefore increases with the gap between income and productivity in the leading enuntry --

Britain prior to 1913, the U.S in the l970s -- and the rest of the world.

    Table 2 shows Kravis er al's estimates of incomes per capita in 1970 U.S. dollars for a

selection of countries, along with Crafts' (1983) estimates for 1870 constructed using similar

procedures. Russia, Italy and (for the beginning of she period) the United States

are the main 19th century capital importers included in the sable, Russia and Italy's incomes

per capita are estimated so have been 30 and 50 per cent, respectively, of Britain's in 1870.

Per capita incomes in the U.S. were 80 per cent of those in Britain by these calcuiations.UI

Per capita incomes in Canada were probably slightly lower than this, while those for

Australia were quite close to those of the United StasesjZ/

    In 1970 the gap between bon-owers and lenders was considerably larger. According to

Kravis es al., Colombian CINP per capita was 18 per cens of that in she United Stases. Other

estimates include 23 per cent for Bran, 28 per cent for Mexico and 30 per cent for Chile.

Of the major Latin American borrowers, only Argentina and Venezuela, with 39 and 41 per

cent of U.S. per capita incomes respeesively, overlap with the range occupied by the leading
19th cenmry borrowersjj/ This implies that the incentive so reallocate capital

internationally was greater in the l970a than a century before. Of course, only under

restrictive assumptions is output per capita an appropriate proxy for she marginal efficiency
of snvessmens. Still, the available statistics do not readily support a stages-of-indebtedness

explanation for the extent of capital flows.14/

    This discussion has focused on investment. The magnitude of international capital flows

depends on international divergences in savings rates as well. It may be that capital

movements were encouraged prior to 1913 by an unusually low level of savings in the

regions of recent settlement. Figures 1-4 provide some support for this hypothesis. Figure 1

shows that the savings rate in Ausowlia rose steadily from less than 5 per cent in the second

half of the l860s to roughly 13 per cent by the end of the l870sJ5/ Capital inflows

financed approximately a third of domestic investment in this period but considerably less

after 1895. Other movements io savings rates, notably the 1895-1900 decline, are less easily

reconciled with the model. Savings and investment rates fluctuated sympsthedcally over the

period, as if the former remained an important determinant of the latter. (The correladon

coefficient between the two series plotted in the figure is 0.33.)

    Figure 2 shows the same series for Great Britain. There was no comparable rise in the

savings rate over the half century prior to 1913. The figure's most notable feature is the

Kuznets-cycle.-like fluctuation of domestic investment, a phenomenon familiar to economic

historians.

    Canada experienced a dramatic rise in savings around the tam of the centiuy, as ahown

in Figure 3. The rise in the rate from roughly 10 per cent of GNP to nearly 20 per cent is

consistent with the stages model. As in Auswalia, however, there are periods early in the

development process, such as the late 1880s, when the savings ratio declines As in

Auswalia, savings and investment ratea axe positively correlaxed. The period of largest

capital inflows (1905-13) was also the period when domestic saving was highest

capital.   Suggestively, savings rates were unusually low. An unusually large share of

domestic i.nvesunent was financed by foreign borrowing. The U.S. savings rate then rose in

steps to a peak around the turn of the century. U.S. net foreign borrowing came to an end,

setting the stage for America'a shift from net foreign debtor to net foreign creditor during

World War I. As lii Canada and Australia, however, other fluctuations in the savings ratc

are not easily reconciled with the model. Notable among these are declines in the ratio
during the 1880s and in the fsrat decade of the 20th century.

    This evidence suggests that savings rates, and by implication international capital

movements which are a function of savings among other variables, have significant

determinants other than the relationship of current to permanent income emphasized in the

stages model. The determinant of savings highlighted in much of the literature (e.g.

Edelstein, 1982) is popolatioo structure. When there is a high propostnn of dependent

children and young workers in the population, savings rates will he low. Conversely, when

there is a high proportion of persons in their prime savings years (ages 40-49), savings rates

will be high. By this interpretation, savings rates were low in early 19th America and late

19th century Canada and Australia not simply because these countries were in the early

stages of economic development, but because they were regions of recent settlement

populated by immigrants who had not yet reached their prime savings years. Evidence in
Table S on population structure is consistent with these tends. There is a more pronounced

downward tend in the share of population under the age of 15 in the U.S., Canada and

Australia than in Great Britain, conaistent with the hypnthesis that there should have been a

more drasnatie rise in savings rates.

    These same demographic factors go some way toward explaining cyclical fluctuations.

In Australia, population composition was driven by the arrival of immigrants in their 20's in

eesponse to the gold rush of the 1850s. As these immigrants aged, the share of the

Australian population aged 40 to 49 peaked in the late 1870s and early 1880s, Kelly (1968)

notes that the subsequent decline in Australian saving waa associated with a rise in the

dependency ratio and a fall in the share of the population aged 40 to 49. As these ratios
reversed themselves in the 1890a, the savings rate recovered. Similar fluctuations are

evident in Canada and the Uoitcd States, The rise in Canadian savings rates arostud the turn

of the century, for example, was associated with a decline in the share of population under

15 and, more importantly, in the share over 65. The share in the prime earning years of

40-49 peaked between 1901 and 1913, coincident with the peak in savings rates.

    Still, Canadian population structure does not seem to fluctuate enough to produce so

dramatic a rise in savings behavior as occurred after the turn of the century. Nor is there an

obvious demographic explanation for the fluctuation of U.S. savings rates. This serves tu
remind that other factors contributed to tends and fluctuations in savinga. The development

of financial intermediaries which rewarded savers for thrift and reduced the nattiness of

financial assets, a factor emphasized by Davis and Gallman (1973) for the United States,

surely operated in the other countries as well. Table 4 suggests that its influence was likely

to be felt in Britain up through 1880 and in Canada as late as 19l3J5/ Shifts in the
distribution of income between industry and agriculture and in its concentration within the

population may have also played a role.

    Perhaps most importantly, changes in the profitability of investment and hence in the

rate of return may have stimulated savings. Only this can explain why foreign borrowing
and domestic saving covsried positively in the regions of recent settlement. Domestic

savings would have crowded out capital inflows and vice versa, producing a negative

correlation, unless both were driven by fluctuations in domestic retums. The literatures on

the opening of the frontier, the westward expansion of the railways, and induced technical

change in labor-scarce, land-abundant economies provide ample basis for analyzing

fluctuations in the rate of return that were autonomous from the point of view of saving and

investment.

    Yet the extent of the correlation -- in other words, the responsiveness of capital inflows

to the same factors that heightened the incentive for domestic saving sod investment --

seems   to have varied over time. This brings us to the third school of thought which

emphasizes hoont-and-bost cycles in intemational capital markets.



IV. Boom-and-Bust Cycles
    The boom-and-bust approach extends to the international setting Minsky a (1972) model

of financial instability. incomplete information combines with departures from rationality to

produce excess volatility in financial marketsj9f The result is decades of large-scale foreign

lending altemating with periods during which little if any lending takes place.
    The process is set off by a disturbance to the markets which focuses investors' attention

on foreign opporsunidea. A decline in the case of retom ott domestic investments or a rise in

returns abroad causes them to redirect their attention to opportunities overseas. A financial

innovation, such as the rise of securities affiliates of commercial banks in the 1920s or the

growth of international loans by banks themselves in the 1970s, may stimulate the supply of

foreign loans. Alternatively, a disturbance to the pattem of balance-of-payments settiements,

such as war debts and reparations in the 1920s or the oil shock in the 1970s, may stimulate

the demand.

    Whatever the displacement, lending, once underway, quickly reaches unsustainable

heights. During the period of excessive enthusiasm, virtually any overseas issue is

enthusiastically subscribed. So long as lending continues, the situation is sustained.

Borrowers obtain new loans to service existing obligations. Problems arise when sonic event

intervenes to stem the free flow of capital. That event might be a political upheaval in a


                                               16
borrowing county, as iii 1890, o the increased attractiveness of domestic invesenents, as in

1928.2P1 Once lending is curtailed, the debt-servicing difficulties of the borrowers are

revealed. Interest payments see interrupted. Default and extended negotiations over a new

repayment schedule then follow. Excessive enthusiasm in the intemational financial centers

gives way to extreme pessimism. Debtors are unable to secure long-term exsemal finance at

any price. Creditors search out alternative inveatnent vehicles that are less risky than

foreign loans. Little international lending takes place for a decade or more, until the crisis is

forgotten and another displacement sets off the process anew.

    The first modem debt cycle is usually placed at the beginning of rhe 19th century. U.S.

states and Latin American republics borrowed heavily in the 1 820s. Latin American

independence set off a speculative mania in London, as scores of companies were formed to

exploit the natural resources of what had previously been a Spanish domain. When the

prices of raw materials slumped in 1825 and banks with links to commodity markett

experienced distress, lending ground to a halt. All but one of the newly-independent Latin

American states quickly defaulted on their debts, followed by many U.S. states in the 1830s.

Renegotiation of these obligations took 20 years or more. In the meantime, potential

borrowers found themselves bereft of external finance.

    With the passage of a quarter century, the problems of this earlier era were forgotten:

By the late 1860s, large-scale lending to Argentina, Brazil, Peru, Chile and she United States

had resumed. Financial crises its Vienna, Berlin and New York in 1873 then brought this

second cycle to a halt. Another wave of Latin American defaults ensued. Turkey and

Egypt suspended debt service. The collapse of the bond marker reinforced the financial and

commercial crisis of the European financial centers. Once more the intemational capital

market lapsed intn inactivity.




                                               17
    This dma, however, Britain had new institutions in place. The Council of Foreign

Bondholders. linked to the London Stock Exchange, threatened to impose sanctions on

recalcitrant debtors and negotiated effectively on behalf of the creditors. Defaults were

resolved more rapidly, arid by the 1880s a new lending wave was underway. This time a

large volume of direct investments accompanied portfolio capital inflows to Latin America.

Argentina. Mexico and Brazil were favored by direct investors, Argentina and Uruguay by

bondholders. The United States and Canada also enjoyed a large volume of capital inflows.

In 1890 this third lending boom was brought to a halt by the Baring Crisis. Leading

recovered after the turn of the century. This time, however, the creditors favored counnies

where for political reasons default was unlikely: Canada and South Africa before 1905,

Canada and India thereafter.

    The two great lending booms of the 20th century can be characterized in similar terms.

The need for external funds to finance European reconstruction after World War I combined

with the rise of securities affiliates and international branching by New York banks to

encourage Americsn lending to Central Europe and Latin America between 1925 and 1928.

The leading New York baoks had scores of representatives in the field, competing for the

business of sometimes reluctant foreign bonowers. The banks opened storefronts to market

foreign bonds to American investors previously unacquainted with their merits. By the

late-1920s government officials and other observers were already warning of the market's

excesses. Even before the Great Depression struck, the Wall Street boom siphoned off the

available liquidity, bringing lending to an end. Any tendency for foreign investment to
rebound following the Wall Street crash and the decline in U.S. interest rates was dashed by

default in Latin America in 1931, in Eastern Europe in 1932, and by Germany in 1933.

    The market's recovery was difficult and delayed. Many defaulted loans were not

successfully renegotiated until the l940s and, in some instances, until the middle of the


                                               18
1950s. This residue of nonperforming loans discouraged portfolio investment abroad. Fmm

the mid-forties through the mid-'sixties, US. capital exports took the form mainly of direcs

foreign investment (Pigure 5). Only in the early 1970s, when memory of these defaults had
dimmed, did money center banks awash in liquidity hazard another round of portfolio

investment abroad,

    This passage paints the history of international lending with a broad brush, in tones

intended to suggest consonance with the boon-and-bust model. The picture has obvious

appeal Not only does it provide a rationale for the episodes of large-scale lending that

seem to alternate with periods of inactivity in international capital markets, but it goes some

way toward explaining shifts between direct and postfolio investment. The importance of

DR in the 1ES[}s and after World War Il can be seen as a reaction against the risks of

portfolio lending. The experience of the 1930s, in particular, is seen as having driven home

the dangers of government loans. Direct investment, notwithstanding the possibility of

nationalization, was perceived as a less risky enterprise. There are other, complementary

explanations for the rise of DR after World War II. New technologies may have offered

economies of scale and scope that cried our for internstional application. The growth of

Fuin-specific knowledge that its owners did not wish to licence or sell may have led them to

exploit it by establishing branches abroad, Still, none of these complementary explanations

is inconsistent with the notion that lingering memory of the defaulted bonds of the l930a

contributed to the rise of direct investment.fl/

    The assumption that investors do not leans from experience and are doomed to repeas

she same mistakes every 30 years is troubling, to say the least. This assumption is

rationalized in various ways. The bankers who extended sovereign loans in the l97lls werc

a different generation from those responsible for the bond flotations of the 1920s. It is hard

to imagine that many had first-hand experience with this earlier episode, espetially given the

youth of the typical bank loan officer. Even bankers who studied the past would not have

concluded that sovereign lending did not pay. Even when defaults intervened, creditors

typically recovered their principal and enjoyed a return comparable to that on low-risk assets

(Eichengreen, 1989c; Linden, 1989). In other words, interest-rate premia adequately
compensated investors for the special risks of foreign lending. if the borrowing countries

were the same, the govemments were of a totally different complexion from those that had

defaulted on their obligations 40 years before. Changes in political and economic regime

gave little cause for concern that previous experience, however ditatu'ous, would be

repeated.

    Ultimately, however, the model does not provide a satisfying explanation for variations

in the volume of lending across historical epochs. It implies that the volume of lending was

large in the half century prior to 1914 because the period contained three boom phases (the

early 1870s, the late i8BOs, and the first decade of the 20th century). In contwst. the

lending boom of the 1920s lasted only four years and that of the 1970s only a few years

more, while the two 20th century lending booms were separated by a 40 year interval in

which little foreign portfolio investment took place. Yet the institutional changes highlighted

by the model (development of bondholders' committees, the Paris Club and the International

Monetary Fund, all of which presumably reduced the costs of rescheduling) suggest that the

lulls between booms should have grown shorter, not longer. They provide no obvious

explanation for variations in the magnitude of lending during the boom periods themselves.

Thus, while this approach captures the cyclical character of the lending process, it does not

adequately explain the contrasts between epochs.

V. Conclusions and Speculations

    None of the standard explanations for shifts over time in the volume of foreign lending

accounts adequately for the phases through which international capital markets have passed

over the last 100 years Minsky's model of financial instability captures the boom andbuss
character of lending hut does oot explain why the booms are sometimes more pronouocad.

more extended and more frequent. The stages-of-lodebtedness model, by focusing oo

domestic savings sod investment, speaks more directly to the question of why the volume of

lending has changed ao markedly ever time. Em its prediction, that the volume of lending

should be greatest when international divergences in the stage of development and hence is

incentives for savings and investment are greatest, is not clearly supported by the data.

Factors other than the incentives for savings and investment associated with counties' stages

of development teem to play a dominant role in determining the volume of foreign lending.

    Analyses that focus on the policy regime come closest to providing a satisfactory answer

to the qoestion. Sot the contrast between the classical and ioterwar gold standards suggests

that it was not exchange-rate stability per se that promoted international lending prior to

1913, but minimal current-account targeting by the authorities. As noted above, this Ending

only transforms the question into another: why did governments find it unnecessary to

defend exchange rste stability by regulating international lending prior to 1913, whereas they
found such intervendon essential thereafter?

    Perhaps these explanations are incomplete because each one neglects another critical

determinant of the volume of foreign lending, Lending proceeds for extended periods and

reaches high levels when it is not interrupted by crisis. One deterrrunant of the frequency

and severity of debt crises, emphasized by authors such as Marichal (1989), is the instability

of commodity prices and interest rates. Interest-rate shocks and cyclical instability in the

developed world disrupt the free flow of capital to borrowing regions. When disruptiont to

these shocks impact snevenly on the creditor countriet, those suffering balance-of-payments

deterioration intervene to discourage foreign lending.

    Hence the greater volume of lending prior to 1913 may reflect a lower incidence of

interest-rate and cnmmodity-price shocks that disrupt thc lending process. Figures 6-8 are

consonant with this hypothesis. Figures 6 and 7 display the level and variability of the

Lewis (1978) and Grilli-Ysng (1988) indices of the relative price of exports of nonfuel

primary commodities and exports of manufactures. It is clear that this relative price wae

more stable prior to 1913 than it became subsequently, Figure 8 shows two measures of thc

real interest rate. Again, it appears that this series was more stable prior to 1913 than

subsequendy./
    At a minimum, these series are nor inconsistent with the notion that the inereaseri

prevslence of interest-rate and commodity-price shocks has conthbuted to the relative decline

of intemational lending in the 20th century. Understanding the exceptional volume of

foreign lending in periods like 1880-1913 therefore requires an explanation for the

exceptional stability of commodity prices and interest rates. Perhaps this brings ss back to

the operation of the inremational monetary and fmsncial system, although it is now more

than the singular stability of exchange rates under the gold standard that is at stake.
                                         FOOTNOTES

 1. The counties are Australia, Canada, Denmark, Cierrnany, Italy, Norway, Sweden, the
IlK. and the U.S. The figures in the text are unweighted averages of county statistics.
The underlying data are described in Section ft The rationale for focusing on these
countries will become clear below. Note that this introduction refers to the extent of
capital flows rather than to 'the degree of capital mobility." The volume of capital flows
across borders depends both on the costs of capital movements (transactions costs and border
taxes, factors commonly thought to determine "the degree of capital mobility) and the
benefits thereof (rate of return differentials and other factors that provide capital an incentive
to move). In other words, capital may be highly mobile but may not move if it has no
incentive to do so.

2. Bayoumi (1989) is appropriately cautious in interpreting his results. Others (viz
Economist Magazine, 1989) have, however, attributed his findings to the operation of the
gold standard, and specifically to its reduction of exchange risk. "So todays global capital
market might be divided after all — not by factors such as sovereign credit risk, legal
differences and what have you, but by sheer uncertainty over currencies. Govemments have
boldly dismantled their capital controls, but in tolerating exchange-rate volatility they may
have left an equally effective -- and equally harmful -- barrier in place. See also Bayoumi
(1990) for another description of his results which attaches more weight to the exchange-risk
view.

3. Exceptions to these rules and the rationale for each are detailed below,

4. Analogous problems arise when attempting to measure national savings in developing
counties today. See Aghevli et al. (1990). p. 57. An additional problem is that for
Germany the data measure net investment and net national product rather than figures gross
of depreciation. The fact that depreciation is netted out of both the numerator and
denominator of the ratio minimizes the bias.

5: For Canada, Urquhart's new annual estimates of capital formation remove the need to
interpolate between figures for the beginning of each decade,

6. Instruments included letters posted, working age population, total population, coal
consumed, and the infant mortality rate. The use of instruments tended to alter the standard
errors but to have little impact on the point estimates.

7. In Eichengreen (1989) I estimated the risk premium using monthly data for seven
currencies against sterling. It was on avenge only 20 per cent as large during the gold
standard period as during the period of managed floating in the 1930s and only 17 per cent
as large as during the free float of 1922- 26.

8. The evidence is discussed in Eichengreen (1989a),

9. This is not to argue that the system was symmetrical, only that the entire burden of
adjustment was not placed on the deficit counties. Evidence on this question is discussed
further in Eichengreen (1987). New developments in the 1920s which reduced the
willingness and ability of the surplus counties to adjust are discussed in Eiehengreen
(1989a).

                                                23
10. There is some evidence that foreign lending stimulated merchandise exports and at
improvement in the trade balance in the case of Britain, as shown in Eichengreen (1989b).
The increment to merchandise exports and the improvement in the trade balance were small,
however, compared to the capital outflow.

11. Comparing the U.S. Department of Commerce (1976, p.224) estimate of per capita U.S.
income in 1869-78, converted to 1970 dollars, with Crafts' figures for Britain for 1870 and
1880 yields 79 per rent.

12. Urquhart (1986) provides new per capita income figures for Canada, although the lack
of purchasing power parity conversions renders direct comparitons difficult. Similarly, while
it is often argued that Australian incomes per capita in the late 19th century were higher
than those for the U.S. (or even for Britain), it is likely that the available figures are inflated
by inadequate price indices that fail to capture the high enst of Australian nontraded goods.

13. Figures quoted in this paragraph are drawn from Kravis et al. (1978), Table 4, cul. 2.

14. Assume for example, following Lucas (1990), that production in all counties obeys the
same Cobb Douglas production function y = Ax5, where y is output per capita, x is the
capital/labor ratio, and A is the common intercept If 3 = 0.4. then the marginal product
of capital is approximately (3* as large in a country where y y as in another cnontry
where y 3y0.
15. The five year moving averagea are for years t-4 through t. The figure for 1875 is a
five year average of the data for 1871-75, for example.

16. The annual estimates of gross domestic fixed capital fnrmadon and (SN? are from
Kuznets (n.d.), variant 1. Data on she current account are from U.S. Department of
Commerce (1976). There is a break in the current account series in 1900, I have averaged
the two figures for that year designed to be consistent with the pre-1900 and post-1900
series 1 use the Kurnets (IMP series because it was constructed in a manner consistent with
the capital formation series. Recent work hat questioned the cyclical properties of the
Kuanets series but not their level. Taking five-year moving averages filters nut cyclical
movements nf less than this perindicity, which should dir nate moat of the bias.

17. Robert Gailman has constructed estimates of capital formation by decade, however.
These can be combined with independent estimates of the current account to gauge broad
trends in U.S. savings. Edelstein (1982, p.234) calculates that they imply a rise in the U.S.
savings rate from 9.1 per cent in 1834-43 to 10.9 per cent in 1839-48, 12.5 per cent in
1944-53, and 14.4 per cent in 1849-58.

18. One worries, of coume, that the podtive association between the savings rate and the
financial asset/inenme ratio reflects the impact of savings on financial deeping as well as the
Converse,

19.  The version of the model described in the text is estentially that of Kindleberger
(1986). An application to sovereign lending in the 1970s is Ounentag and Herring (1985).

20. In both instances it can be argued that declining primary commodity prices undermined
the debt-servicing capacity of the borrowing regions and contribuced to the slump in lending.
Sec Eichengreen (1990).

21. One can argue that borrower country preferences also mattered for the composition of
lending. In the 1970a, for example, bank finance was viewed as more permissive and less
politically onerous than JET. One can argue similarly that this preference was reversed in
the 1980g.

22. Though the 1950s and 1960a are an exception to this rule, the 1970s and 1980s again
fit the pattern. The cx post real interest rete is shown in Figure 8. The two interest rates
and the wholesale price indec underlying this figure are from U.S. Department of Commerce
(1976). MeKissnon and Robinson (1990) analyze nominal interest rates (in contsdistinctinn
to the real rates analyzed here) and argue similarly that (1) rates were less volatile under the
gold standard, and (ii) foreign investment was promoted by this stability of interest rates.
