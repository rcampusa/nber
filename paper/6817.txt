I.           INTRODUCTION

             The measurement of the output of the medical care system is necessary to assess the productivity levels and

growth of a country's economy and of course its medical care system. This is true in countries with universal health care

coverage or incomplete coverage, and regardless of the mix of public and private provision of medical care.

             For most industries in most countries, real output measurement is accomplished by dividing data on

revenues or sales by a price index to obtain a measure of real output. Reliable output measurement for an industry

therefore requires correspondingly reliable revenue data and a price index. A number of conceptual difficulties and

institutional characteristics of medical care markets, however, make reliable price measurement of medical goods and

services particularly difficult and challenging.

             For countries where medical care goods and services are provided by the government without direct charge,

or with only nominal direct charges, data on revenue or receipts for medical care may not be available or may not be

relevant. For these countries, the problem of measuring the output of medical care goes well beyond the inherent

difficulty of measuring medical care prices. In such cases the difficult problem of measuring prices and output of

medical care is combined with the equally formidable problem of measuring the output of the government sector.1

             Medical price indexes have uses other than those involving output and productivity measurement. In the

US, both within the health sector and more generally, contracts occasionally contain provisions that depend on growth of

the medical Consumer Price Index (CPI).2 Medical CPIs and medical Producer Price Indexes (PPIs) are also employed

in updating of fee schedules for certain administered pricing schemes and payments to some health plans. Medical CPIs

and PPIs are also employed by public policy analysts in making projections of the impacts of changes in public policy.

             Although medical CPIs and PPIs play prominent roles in private and public sector transactions and

analyses, both the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) and its critics have acknowledged that current BLS practices
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 5 -




for tracking price changes in the medical care industries, industries characterized by dynamic technological and

organizational changes, are likely to be inaccurate and in need of substantial improvement and overhaul.3

             Several aspects of the medical care industry make the BLS' task of constructing accurate and readily

interpretable medical CPIs and PPIs particularly difficult. Output measurement of the health care system is inherently

difficult when mortality is but one possible outcome from treatment. Mortality is particularly inappropriate as an output

measure for treatments of a variety of acute conditions that are not life-threatening, and for many increasingly prevalent

chronic illnesses. Additional attributes, such as morbidity, pain and suffering, functional and emotional impairment, and

quality of life are each highly valued aspects of treatment response.

             Another output measurement challenge that is rather unique to the medical care sector arises from the

moral hazard caused by health insurance which causes marginal private and social costs to diverge. As emphasized by,

among others, Newhouse et al. [1993], the existence of demand side moral hazard is likely to make it inappropriate to

attribute the usual normative properties to medical CPIs that are commonly associated with other such price indexes.

The provision of medical care services also involves a principal-agent relationship: in choosing treatment, patients

typically rely considerably on the advice and counsel of their physician, whose incentives and financial interests may or

may not align well with those of the patient. Any misalignment of interests may result in inefficient outcomes.

             A third dimension of medical care that poses significant price measurement challenges relates to

technological progress. While not unique to medical care, technological progress is nevertheless of great significance in

this sector of the economy. New treatment technologies are continuously emerging and being introduced into common

clinical practice. This creates many of the problems of new goods that economists interested in index number and

productivity measurement have struggled with for many years.4

             Finally, organizational changes have been dramatic in the medical care sector. The manner in which

medical technologies are rationed, delivered and even priced has evolved rapidly during the last decade. Managed care

arrangements have resulted in changes in the locus of care, the organization of medical practice, contractual relations

between buyers and sellers, and the manner in which inputs are combined to create treatment. Thus the way in which

typical treatment for an illness such as depression is organized and provided has been remarkably altered in just a few

years. Even given a known set of treatment technologies, important qualitative differences have emerged in the supply

of treatment and in the way care is experienced by patients.

             In this paper we review in considerable detail the measurement issues that underlie construction of medical

care price indexes, we describe procedures employed by the BLS in the construction of its medical CPIs and PPIs

(including recent revisions and changes), we discuss alternative notions of medical care output that involve the price of

an episode of treatment rather than the prices of fixed bundles of inputs, we outline salient features of a new medical

care expenditure price index, and we suggest future research and measurement initiatives that are likely to be most

fruitful. We begin with a description of the market environment underlying medical care CPIs and PPIs in the U.S.

II.          THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT UNDERLYING MEDICAL CARE CPIs AND PPIs

             Viewed by an economic statistician, the medical care sector is large and intimidating. As with an elephant,

one can employ several approaches in cautiously observing, walking around and measuring it. We begin by describing

the principal actors, characteristics and incentive structures that must be taken into account in providing a foundation for

the measurement of medical care prices.

             A. DISTINGUISHING FEATURES OF THE U.S. MEDICAL CARE MARKETPLACE

             Economists generally presume some form of consumer optimization and efficiency in the purchase of

goods and services. As in other markets, consumers of medical services are envisaged as maximizing some notion of

utility, buying goods and services that generate direct utility, and using some of these goods and services as intermediate

goods to produce utility. In the medical care marketplace, however, this optimization and efficiency is exceedingly

complex, it involves behavior based on the use of asymmetric information and personnel who act as imperfect agents for

consumers, under rationing constraints that are not nearly as pervasive as in other consumer markets.

             The medical care industry provides goods and services in a number of specific sub-sectors: hospitals

(including hotel and cafeteria services), physician practices, laboratories, pharmaceuticals, clinics, medical devices,

nursing homes, home health agencies, and so on. These services are provided to consumers, but consumers typically do

not value these services per se. Rather, they value the health outcomes resulting from medical interventions provided by

the medical care industry.5 These impacts on health are conceptually the composite good that we want to price. But the

nature of transactions in this industry is exceedingly complex.

             As in any industry, market structure affects the industry's price level, and perhaps the rate of price growth,

particularly if production effiency is affected over time. Licensing, reputation, the regulatory environment and

intellectual property rights provide suppliers of medical services with varying amounts of market power, particularly
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 7 -




since some medical service suppliers such as hospitals and physicians face limited competition outside rather narrow

geographical market boundaries. In many cases fixed costs are high, to a great extent consumers arrive at random times,

and price is greater than short-run marginal cost.

             Buyers also have market power. Although the federal government has long been a major purchaser of

medical services (providing funds for about 39% of personal health care expenditures in the US in 1996)6, within the last

decade there has been much consolidation of buying power among health maintenance and managed care organizations.

Thus on both the supply and demand sides of the medical care marketplace, market power is present. Moreover, since

most medical care services are not resellable, price dispersion is not easily eliminated by arbitrage, price discrimination

is prevalent, and thus the "law of one price" typically does not hold.

             There are several other features of the market structure of the medical sector that, while present to some

extent in other sectors, are particularly pervasive in medical goods and services. First, the vast majority of medical care

payments are not made directly by consumers. Indeed, in the US in 1996, out-of-pocket payments by consumers

accounted for only about 19% of total personal health care service expenditures.7 The remainder of medical care is

largely paid for by insurers.8 Insurance programs may be run publicly, as with Medicare, Medicaid, and other federal

state and local funds, who together accounted for 53% of personal health care service expenditures in 1996; or the

sources of funds may be private, which in 1996 made up 37% of personal health care service expenditures, primarily for

the non-elderly. Ultimately, the insurance payments not paid directly by individuals are passed back to individuals, in

the form of higher taxes or reduced other government spending when the insurance payments are by the public sector, or

in the form of an adjusted employee compensation package when insurance is provided by employers.9

             The predominance of the indirect nature of payments creates several difficulties for constructing and

interpreting consumer price indexes. The most significant of these is moral hazard. If consumers pay for only, say, 20%

of medical care at the margin, they will seek to consume medical care until its marginal value is only about twenty cents

per dollar of spending. This is true even though people on average must pay for the full dollar of medical care.

Individuals will therefore tend to overconsume medical resources -- resources will be consumed that cost society $1 but

are worth less than that at the margin.

             The second important feature of the medical care market is that consumers do not always know what

services they want. Patients tend to rely on physicians both to provide them services and to recommend the services
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 8 -




they need. As a result, there is a principal-agent problem: patients would like physicians to act in the patients' best

interests, but physicians might not always have an interest in doing so.

             In traditional U.S. health insurance arrangements, physicians and patients both had incentives for excessive

medical care. Patients were well-insured at the margin and physicians were paid on a fee-for-service basis -- earning

more when they did more since fees were generally above marginal cost. The result was an incentive structure on both

the demand and supply side that induced excessive care. Today's environment in the US is much changed, and

increasingly involves more complicated rationing. Health plans now often operate under fixed budgets, whereas before

they typically passed costs through to the employer or government. Thus they have begun to employ administrative

mechanisms and financial incentives to control health care spending. The result is that, with increasing frequency,

patient demand incentives are at odds with those of their health plans or physicians.

             The implication of both of these pervasive features of the medical care industry is that revealed consumer

purchases are not a reliable guide to the marginal value of medical care. This is in contrast to other markets, such as that

for, say, compact disks, where consumers' marginal valuations are likely to be well-reflected in prices and expenditures.

Consumers may receive too much medical care, as they likely did under traditional insurance arrangements, or too little

care, as some allege they do under managed care or capitated insurance (one price per patient per year, independent of

the amount of services the patient actually receives). In many markets, it is eminently reasonable to relate relative prices

to marginal rates of substitution in consumption, but in medical care this assumption is simply not tenable. As a

practical matter, this inability to employ the assumptions underlying traditional revealed preference theory severely

hampers the ability of economic statisticians to construct accurate and readily interpretable price indexes for medical

care.

             The extent to which medical care services differ from other services can be illustrated by considering a

hypothetical transaction in a restaurant. Suppose an individual places an order for a particular set of items on the menu,

and then leaves. Another person enters the restaurant, sits down at a table, eats the meal that was ordered, and then

leaves. Finally, a third person comes in and pays for the meal. In medical care, these three persons are the physician,

the patient and the insurer. Whose valuation shall one measure?

             As with many other services such as ATM banking services, the production function for medical care

involves interdependent efforts of suppliers and consumers. This interdependent aspect of medical care production
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 9 -




makes it more difficult to distinguish between producer and consumer price indexes. Moreover, for consumers, medical

care, health and utility are quite different. This occurs in part because the production function for health has a number of

arguments, other than medical care. One formulation of the production function is as follows:

             Health = H(medical care, knowledge, time, lifestyle, environment, etc.).

It is useful to consider these other inputs into the production of health.10 Many of the inputs have been shown to

contribute more to health than medical care .11 Knowledge, for example, mediates between medical care and health.

Medical treatments must not only be produced, but they must be used as well, and knowledge about how to use them

changes over time. To the extent knowledge is non-rivalrous in nature and has public good properties, its existence

together with the interdependent nature of production makes it difficult to assess uniquely the impacts of changes in

knowledge on prices for suppliers vs. that facing consumers.

             As an example of the importance of medical knowledge, suppose that medical research discovers that a

particular pharmaceutical agent is just as effective when taken in half a dosage strength as when taken at full strength;

something like this occurred for contraceptives several decades ago. Has the price of medical care changed? From the

consumers' perspective, the answer is likely yes, for the cost of achieving a particular health state has fallen.12 From the

pharmaceutical manufacturers' perspective, however, the answer may be no, for the marginal cost of producing a

milligram of the medication may not have changed. From the vantage of the family practitioner physician, whether the

price has fallen depends in part on how one views physician services. The advice provided by the physician to the

patient may still take the same amount of billable time, but if the physician is part of a staff model health maintenance

organization with total pharmaceutical coverage, the price of providing family planning services may have fallen.

             Knowledge, of course, is just one form of technological change. The reason we distinguish knowledge

from other forms of technological progress is that knowledge is often envisaged as disembodied technological progress,

while most new technologies are embodied in a particular service or product. Although the absorption of knowledge is

not without cost, to some extent knowledge has public good properties and is non-rivalrous, quite unlike say, a piece of

medical diagnostic equipment.

             These two types of technological change overlap, yet it is useful to distinguish between them. Significant

quality changes are often embodied in new medical care-related goods and services, but use of the new good may

require additional knowledge. For example, a new non-invasive operation is typically performed by physicians using
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 10 -




novel inputs (endoscopic instruments), and knowledge about such new treatments can be usefully employed by patients

and clinicians alike. In any case, it is appropriate to envisage knowledge as an input into the production of health,

distinct from medical treatments.13

             Another input into the production of health is time. Producing better health requires time inputs from

households as well as providers: time is spent in seeking and receiving treatment, in recovery, and in assisting others.

Some medical innovations, for example, new anaesthetics, have shortened the recovery time for patients.14 This too will

reduce the consumers' cost of better health, but may well leave the producer's costs unchanged (say, if the new

anaesthetic cost the hospital as much as the old).

             An individual's lifestyle is another input into the production of health. Eating habits, drinking patterns,

exercise regimens, and the pursuit of risky behavior all affect an individual's health. In some cases greater use of

medical care and unhealthy behavior occur simultaneously to maintain a given health state. For example, with the
introduction of over-the-counter H2-antagonists such as Pepcid AC, individuals can preemptively take a heartburn

prevention medication and then eat a high calorie, highly spiced meal.

             Yet one more input affecting health is the environment. Environmental changes may improve or retard

health. For example, new diseases such as AIDS may develop and be discovered, while other diseases such as smallpox

may be eradicated. Changes in air and water pollution, in climate and weather, as well as in rates of criminal activity,

will also have important impacts on health. It is important that such environmental changes be envisaged as primarily

affecting the quantity or quality of medical services provided, not their price.

             The age distribution of the population might also be envisaged as an environmental input affecting health

care spending of populations. As people age, typically more inputs of medical care are required to maintain health, or to

mitigate deterioration. Increased medical care expenditures, or increased health insurance premiums that reflect impacts

of an aging population are appropriately viewed as quantity rather than price increases; in such cases medical

expenditures rise due to increased quantity consumption, not price changes.

             Finally, it is important to emphasize that while the marginal utility of health is positive, health is not the

only argument in an individual's utility function. Thus a utility function might be envisaged as follows:

             Utility = U(health, lifestyle, leisure time, other consumption goods and services, environment, etc.).

Note that some factors such as lifestyle and environment not only have a direct impact on utility, but also have an
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 11 -




indirect impact via health. One important implication of this, as has been emphasized elsewhere by Triplett [1998a,b], is

that the output of the medical care industry is not something like the average health of the population, but rather is best

viewed in marginal terms as the health implication of a medical intervention, conditional on lifestyle, environment and

other inputs affecting health.

             The production function for health, as well as the utility function, has intertemporal aspects. Some current

consumption goods affect future health states as well as current utility, while some medical interventions impact future

consumption possibilities and patterns. Here we put these complications aside, but see Grossman [1972a,b] and Meltzer

[1997] for further discussion.



             B. PRICING MEDICAL CARE SERVICES

             With this discussion of salient characteristics of the medical care marketplace as background, we now

consider approaches to price measurement. A representative consumer can be envisaged as an individual who is making

decisions before knowing what diseases he or she might eventually experience. Extensions to heterogeneous consumers

complicate matters, but for our purposes it is sufficient initially to work here with the simpler representative consumer

framework.15 Let this representative consumer have a utility function that depends on consumption of goods and

services (other than medical care) and health. For concreteness, assume there is only one disease, which everyone

contracts; extending the analysis to multiple diseases and probabilities of having each disease is straightforward. Denote
Y as exogenous income, H as the health state, M as the quantity of medical care and pM its (normalized) price, I and pI

as the quantity and price (premium) of a constant-quality insurance policy, K as medical care knowledge, E as the state
of the environment, L as leisure time, and TM as time allocated to receiving medical treatments. For simplicity, M and

PM include both consumers' direct health expenditures and indirect medical services obtained through health insurance

in a competitive, actuarially fair insurance market where changes in costs of medical services to insurers are passed on to
consumers via insurance premium changes. In this context, I and PI are associated only with pure insurance services.

The utility function is then written as:
                           U = U[Y - PMM - PII, H(M,K,E), L - TM].                                                       (1)

             The first term is non-medical care consumption (non-medical expenditures divided by numeraire price), the

second is health, and the third is non-medical care time.16 Although Eqn. (1) embeds a multi-year framework, for
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 12 -




simplicity we assume but one time period. Notice also that Eqn. (1) makes no assumption about how medical treatment

decisions are made, or how medical prices are set.17

             Over time, medical care and its price may change, or there may be changes in knowledge, the environment,

and time devoted to medical care. For concreteness, consider changes between periods 0 and 1. The question posed is:

What is the correct price index for changes between periods 0 and 1, assuming that consumers optimize in each time

period? We can define the cost of living in one of several natural ways -- the change in the cost of living between

periods 0 and 1 is the additional funds the individual needs in period 1 to be just as well off as he or she was in period 0.

This amount may be positive, in which case the cost of living has increased, or it may be negative, in which case the cost

of living has fallen18. This hypothetical is associated with the Laspeyers, base period utility notion of cost of living. An

alternative, associated with the Paasche notion, uses the current period utility as the point of reference, and asks: What is

the change in funds the individual needs in period 0 to be just as well off as he or she is in period 1? We consider this

distinction in further detail below.

             Consider the amount C of additional money the consumer requires in period 1 to make him or her

indifferent between living in periods 0 and 1(the Laspeyers notion):
                           U[Y - PM1M1 - PI1I1 + C, H(M1,K1,E1), L - TM1]

                           = U[Y - PM0M0 - PI0I0, H(M0,K0,E0), L - TM0].                                     (2)

C is the change in the cost of living -- a positive C implies an increase in the cost of living, and a negative C a decrease.

             To form a price index, one can scale C by the income required to produce utility in period 0, i.e., Y. The

cost of living index could therefore be:

                           Cost of Living Index ≡ 1 + C/Y.                                                   (3)

Using a first order difference approximation, we differentiate and rearrange Eqn. (2), yielding
             C ≅ [d(PMM + PII)/dt - (UH/UX){HM(dM/dt) + HK(dK/dt) + HE(dE/dt)} + (UL/UX)(dTM/dt)                            (4)

where UH is the marginal utility of health, UX is the marginal utility of non-medical consumption (X ≡ Y - PMM - PII),

UL is the marginal utility of leisure, and HM, HK and HE are partial derivatives of H with respect to M, K and E.19

Several comments are worth noting.
             The first term on the right hand side of Eqn. (4), d(PMM + PII)/dt, is additional spending on medical care

and insurance services over time. A spending increase may be due to increased quantities of medical services provided
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 13 -




(direct or via health insurance), increases in the prices paid for those medical services by consumers/insurers, increases

in the carrying cost of insurance or in the quantity of pure insurance services provided. Thus it is clear that an increase

in the cost of medical services, ceteris paribus (in particular, health outcomes and environment assumed constant),

increases the cost of living index. Notice that if the medical environment changes, e.g., a new disease such as AIDS

appears, medical expenditures will likely increase, but this is not properly viewed as a change in the cost of living, for

the latter assumes an unchanged environment. As Griliches [1997] has pointed out, price index computations assume an

average, unaging, unchanging individual living in a world in which nothing changes except prices. When a country’s

population becomes more aged, medical expenditure and the quantity of medical resources consumed increases, but as

stated earlier, this is properly viewed as an expenditure and quantity increase, not a price increase. Similarly, since

outcomes are being held fixed in the Laspeyers type hypothetical, if bacteria develop drug resistance and low priced

antibiotics are replaced by more expensive drugs, the price index should increase, reflecting the reduced efficacy

(quality deterioration) of the older antibiotic.
              The second set of terms in the first line of Eqn. (4), -(UH/UX){HM(dM/dt) + HK(dK/dt) + HE(dE/dt)}, is

the dollar value of change in health over time. Health may change because the quantities of M, K and/or E change, or
because of, say, changed efficacy of a given medical treatment (change in HM). The -UH/UX term multiplying {·} is

the marginal rate of substitution between health and all other goods. Multiplying the health change by this amount

expresses health in dollars. Note that an improvement in health through any of these three channels, ceteris paribus,

reduces the cost of living index, i.e., C < 0.
              The final term in Eqn. (4), (UL/UX)(dTM/dt), is the change in the time cost of receiving medical care.

Hours are converted into dollars by multiplying hours by the marginal rate of substitution between leisure and goods (in

most cases, equal to the after-tax wage). If more efficient delivery of medical care reduces patient travel and waiting

time for medical care, or if recovery time from orthopedic surgery is reduced due to increased use of arthroscopic

surgery, ceteris paribus, the cost of living falls.

              Our discussion to this point on cost of living is that for a representative consumer. There are various ways

in which group or aggregate cost of living measures and price indexes can be constructed, even when consumers'

preferences are diverse and income (or total expenditure) has an unequal distribution. As discussed by, among others,

Pollak [1980,1998] and Fisher-Griliches [1995], a common aggregation procedure is to weight each person's utility in
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 14 -




each of the two time periods by his/her dollar share in total expenditures; the share weights can be base period, current

period, or some average of the two. The aggregate cost of living indexes, analogous to Eqn. (4), then include terms that

represent share-weighted averages of various expenditures. Notice also that such aggregate cost of living indexes are

conditional on the distribution of income and demographic composition of the population.20
             Several other issues merit attention. First, it is useful to consider the PMM + PII term in Eqn. (4) further.

One possible price index to compute would involve asking, what price would the consumer pay in two adjacent time

periods for an actuarially fair medical care insurance policy to keep on the same expected level of utility, ceteris

paribus? Note that this is not the same as a disability insurance policy, for with that the beneficiary only recovers lost

income and medical care costs, and is not compensated, for example, for lost utility due to loss of vision. The consumer

may have an expected life pattern in mind, with age-related probabilities of experiencing certain diseases. Thus the

price index would be based on the price of contracting for a year of medical costs, given expected disease susceptibility,

technology, efficacy, environmental factors and so forth.

             Realizations over the ensuing time period could well change the market price of such an insurance contract,

for a variety of reasons, with differing implications for price and quantity. If the consumption of more medical related

goods is induced by the expansion of technological opportunities (new artificial hips) or changes in the environment

(increased sensitivity to allergens), the change is appropriately viewed as one of quantity or quality, not price. The

premium paid on repriced insurance policies might increase as a result, but that is because of the changed technology or

environment, not because of a price change. Note also that because of moral hazard, when improvements in technology

occur, they may be difficult to value properly within the medical marketplace.

             Earlier we noted that a Laspeyer’s type of cost-of-living index uses the base period utility as reference,

whereas the Paasche employs the current period utility as the reference point. Suppose that in the time interval between

the base and current period, the individual experiences a deterioration in health state so severe that it no longer is

biologically feasible for the individual in period 1 to maintain the period 0 level of utility, e.g., the individual loses

eyesight or develops an illness such as AIDS. In such a case, there may not be any feasible answer to the Laspeyers

question, but one might still be able to answer the Paasche question, i.e. what would the necessary change in funds be in

period 0 to make the individual as well off as in period 1?

             A still deeper problem occurs when unexpected changes take place, such as those that result in the
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 15 -




unanticipated lengthening of life expectancy. An individual might want to alter considerably his/her lifetime

optimization plan given a change in information, yet he/she may lack the resources to modify consumption to a new path

that has now become optimal. Hence it is possible for the cost of living per year to increase, for the cost of living a

lifetime to increase, all as a result of this unanticipated benefit of increased life expectancy. This raises difficult issues,

and mixes up changes in cost of living indexes with technological progress. Cost of living indexes typically refer to the

cost of a flow of services over a relatively short time period. Converting from, say, a lifetime stock to an annual flow

may be reasonable if the population is assumed to be ageless or has a fixed age composition, if there are no unexpected

changes, and if ex ante decisions are still correct ex post. If these conditions are not met, paradoxes may well emerge.

             C. FORMING A PRICE INDEX

             A fundamental issue is how one estimates the values of the variables in cost of living index equations such

as those in Eqns. (3) and (4). Suppose we focus attention just on how changes in the medical sector affect the cost of

living index. Although current procedures used by the BLS in its medical care related CPIs and PPIs are discussed in

detail below, here we briefly consider several alternative procedures.

             One approach used in other settings is hedonic price analysis. If one estimates a regression model where

the price of a medical service is the dependent variable, and where attributes of the medical procedure, the patient and

the provider are explanatory variables, then one can decompose price changes over time into changes in the value of

services to patients and pure changes in price. An example of this type of hedonic price measurement, for the treatment

of acute phase depression, is in Berndt, Busch and Frank [1998].21

             There are a number of problems with using hedonic analysis in this market. At the level of individual

diseases, hedonic prices are not necessarily equal to consumers' marginal valuations. Since consumers are insured, the

price they pay for medical care at the margin is different from the cost of medical care to society. Further, providers

have their own incentives in recommending treatment decisions, which may reinforce or contradict consumer

preferences. Thus, both because of moral hazard and principal-agent issues, we would not necessarily expect treatment

decisions to be made optimally. Estimated parameters in hedonic price equations could therefore be based on data

points reflecting socially (and privately) inefficient actions by consumers/physicians/insurers. This raises difficulties in

placing any social welfare interpretations on movements in hedonic price indexes over time.

             Alternatively, one might perform hedonic analysis at the level of the insurance plan, as was recommended
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 16 -




by Reder [1969] and has been implemented by Jensen and Morrisey [1990]. One could estimate an hedonic model for

the price of insurance, using the attributes of the insurance policy as regressors, and thus infer the residual price increase.

The difficulties here are both theoretical and practical.

             At the theoretical level, a theory about how consumers choose health insurance plans is required that

incorporates consumers' self selection, moral hazard (augmented by tax subsidies), and preferences for compensation.

Since most private health insurance is provided through employment, this involves a link between workers and

employers, and between different workers within a firm. Our knowledge about how insurance decisions are made in

firms is very limited.22 Hedonic analysis also presumes that consumers are fully aware of the attributes of the good they

are buying. But with health insurance, there are often fundamental parts of the insurance contract that consumers do not

know -- indeed, cannot know -- in advance.23

             At the practical level, we probably are unable to control for many of the other factors that influence plan

costs. For example, plan premiums will depend on the health status of people who are enrolled in the plan as well as the

benefits offered. But plan enrollment reflects adverse selection. When premiums change, we need to be able to

decompose them into changes in the cost of a given set of benefits, and changes in the sickness of the people enrolled in

the plan. Without knowing in detail who is enrolled in each plan and what their expected medical spending would be,

we cannot adequately control for the many factors involved in premium variation. Moreover, data to control for these

factors are typically unavailable.24 As with observations on disease-specific treatment costs, the analysis of cross-

sectional and/or time series insurance policy data might well be comparing various inefficient equilibria.25 This is

particularly likely with non-contractable aspects of health plan rationing under managed care.

             Pauly [1998] has recently revived Reder's proposal to use medical insurance prices as the basis of a price

index for medical care. Pauly contends that the development of willingness to pay techniques in economics has become

sufficiently advanced that one could now ask respondents to put evaluations on an insurance policy that covered some

new medical technique, or a bundle of new medical techniques, compared with an insurance policy that did not cover

those techniques. One advantage of this form of pricing insurance policies would be that it would in theory capture

behavior towards risk in a way that is typically neglected in studies that address only the ex post cost of treating an

illness/condition. If one has a disease, the cost of treating the disease matters. If one does not have the disease, then

insuring against the risk of a costly medical bill, if the disease is contracted, is important. Though this alternative
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 17 -




approach may have advantages over attempting to construct price indexes for the treatment of specific diseases, pricing

insurance policies also has significant disadvantages, as discussed above and by Feldstein [1969] many years ago, and

willingness to pay techniques remain subject to framing reference point and other issues. Moreover, empirical work to

implement Pauly's suggestion is not yet available.

             Yet another alternative to the hedonic and insurance policy approaches is to make specific assumptions

about the way that medical treatment decisions are made. For example, one can assume that consumers have a specified

known distribution of preferences for one prescription drug over another, as in Fisher-Griliches [1995] and Griliches-

Cockburn [1994], or that consumers are making purchase decisions for goods with a high out-of-pocket share, such as

for prescription drugs in Cockburn-Anis [1998]. One can then combine this model with observed data on treatment and

prices to form a component of the cost of living index. While this approach is reasonable in some applications, it does

not work well in markets where consumer information is poor and the share of out-of-pocket costs is low, as occurs in

most medical care markets.

             A third option involves more direct measurement. Suppose one focuses on a particular disease or condition

and estimates empirically the changes in treatment costs and medical outcomes for that disease. If in addition one makes

an assumption concerning the dollar worth of health improvements, one can calculate the various individual factors in a

cost of living index. This approach has recently been implemented by Cutler, McClellan, Newhouse and Remler

[1998a,b]. If such an approach were to be followed more generally, it would of course be necessary to undertake such

analyses for a representative mix of illnesses, where outcomes could be reliably measured. We return to a discussion of

this approach later in this paper.

                                                      **********

             With this discussion on the difficulties of conceptualizing and implementing price measurement of medical

care services as background, we now turn to a review of price measurement procedures currently employed by the BLS

in its medical care related CPIs and PPIs. As we shall see, while changes have recently been implemented at the BLS in

its medical care CPI and PPI programs, for the most part the BLS still treats medical care in the same way it treats other

industry and consumer prices. The combination of inherent difficulties in measuring service industry prices, distinctive

features of the medical care industry, and use of traditional index number procedures for measuring prices makes clear

interpretation of the BLS' current medical care CPIs and PPIs very difficult.
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 18 -




III.         CONSTRUCTION OF MEDICAL CARE CPIs AND PPIs AT THE BLS

             The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) constructs and publishes CPIs and PPIs for various components

and aggregations of medical care goods and services. Hereafter we designate these medical care CPIs and PPIs with the

acronyms of MCPIs and MPPIs, respectively. Although the essential structure and conceptual foundations of these price

index measurement efforts have been in place for some time, the BLS has recently announced and undertaken a

considerable number of changes in its MCPI and MPPI programs. Here we summarize both continuing and recently

changing procedures. We begin with a more general overview of the CPI and the PPI, and then we consider issues

particularly important to measuring prices and quantities of medical care goods and services in the MPPI and MCPI

programs.

             A.            A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE CPI

             According to the BLS, the CPI is "...a measure of the average change in the prices paid by urban consumers

for a fixed market basket of goods and services."26 It is calculated monthly, and is published about two weeks after the

end of the month to which it refers.27

             From its first regular publication in 1921 until the end of World War II, the CPI was called a "Cost of

Living" index. In March 1944 the Chairman of the President's Committee on the Cost of Living appointed a group of

technical experts (Wesley Mitchell, Simon Kuznets and Margaret Reid) to examine whether the BLS' cost of living

index was properly accounting for war-related quality deteriorations in goods and services, as well as the effects of

rationing and shortages. Controversy had emerged in part because in 1942 the "Little Steel Formula" had been adopted

which linked permissible wartime wage increases to the index, but representatives from organized labor argued that the

cost of living index understated true price inflation.28

             Along with a Special Committee of the American Statistical Association appointed in 1943, the technical

experts concluded that "...the index understated the wartime price rise to some extent because of a number of factors, of

which incomplete account of quality deterioration was only one".29 To avoid confusion with popular notions of cost of

living, the President's Committee, as well as the union critique of the index, also recommended that the name be

changed to "Consumers' Price Index", a change which was adopted in August 1945.30

             Since 1945 many changes have occurred involving the BLS' construction of the CPI, but its underlying

hierarchical structure has been relatively stable. We now summarize this hierarchical structure.
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 19 -




             The identity and number of items sampled, and the weights used in aggregating sampled items into

increasingly comprehensive sub-indexes, constitute a hierarchical structure of market baskets that the BLS changes

infrequently. Based on data from its Consumer Expenditure Surveys (CEX), the BLS identifies and defines a fixed

'market basket' of goods, employing a classification system known as the item structure. The item structure is updated

approximately every ten years, the most recent being in January 1998.

             For example, based on data from the 1993-95 CEX, the BLS identified eight major product groups of items

for representation in the CPI beginning in January 1998: food and beverages, housing, apparel and upkeep, education

and communication, transportation, medical care, entertainment, and other goods and services. In turn, these major

groups are divided into 70 expenditures classes, which are disaggregated further into 211 item strata. Weights for the

211 item strata are fixed in between major revisions, as are those for the higher level of aggregations of strata into

expenditure classes, intermediate aggregates, major groups and all items indexes. The CPI calculations are done

separately for 38 geographic areas.31

             CPI calculations are undertaken based on a modified Laspeyres price index. The Laspeyres price index is a

weighted sum of price relatives, where the weights are revenue shares of each of the N item strata in the market basket.

For month t, the Laspeyres price index is:

      N                                         N
Lt ≡ ∑ wib [pit/pib] , wib ≡ pib qib      /   ∑ pib qib                                                        (5)
    i=1                                        i=1


where pit is the price of the ith item in time period t, i = 1,...,N, pib are base period prices, qib are fixed base period

quantities, and wib is the fixed base period expenditure weight. The term pit/pib is often called the "price relative" of

good i. An attractive feature of the Laspeyres index is that it is consistent in aggregation, i.e., one obtains the same

composite Laspeyres index by aggregating over all items simultaneously, or first aggregating items into a set of sub-

indexes, and then constructing a master aggregate from the weighted sub-indexes.
             Because the CPI has 211 item strata, the terms pit/pib in Eqn. (5) are in fact price indexes, often called

"basic components" or "elementary aggregates". There are thousands, perhaps millions, of "items" in a modern

economy. Within each of the 211 item strata, BLS takes a probability sample of the detailed items that are grouped

together into each of the item strata. For example, in the medical care component, there are 13 item strata. Based on a
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 20 -




nonlinear programming optimization algorithm, the BLS determines the optimal number of price quotes at the

expenditure class level.32 For some of the item strata (e.g., babysitting, car pooling), it is very difficult to obtain sample

price data; thus for 27 of the 211 item strata, the BLS does not sample prices, but instead imputes prices from other

goods and services in the same expenditure class.

             When a detailed item is selected for pricing in the CPI, a price for the exact same item is collected at

regular intervals, usually monthly or bi-monthly. These detailed prices are formed into the basic component price

indexes, which are the lowest level for which price index information is published in the CPI.

             To accommodate practical issues involving the fact that some products are discontinued and cannot be

repriced, that consumers' point of purchasing items changes, and that the CEX provide data on expenditures rather than

prices, current BLS practice involves modification of the above simple Laspeyres formula. These issues are discussed in

further detail in U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics [1997b,1998] and in Moulton-Stewart [1997].33

Here it is worth emphasizing that while weights may change for elementary items within item strata, at the item strata

level and above the weights are fixed over time between major revisions, and thus for aggregate price indexes at the

level of item strata and higher, use of Eqn. (5) with its fixed weights is essentially what is done by the BLS.

             In 1997 the BLS began issuing a monthly experimental measure constructed with use of the geometric

mean formula for all index components at levels of aggregation underneath the item strata. Although the geometric

mean is unweighted (or unequally weighted), use of the geometric mean index at the detailed level may imply fixed (and

equal) expenditure share weights. The arithmetic mean in the form formerly used by the BLS implies equal expenditure

weights which are not fixed. The geometric mean index thereby permits limited substitutability among products within

the item strata. Provided that commodity substitution is the primary economic behavior that affects these lower level

indexes, the difference between geometric and arithmetic mean item strata indexes can be interpreted as a measure of

"lower level" substitution bias.34 This experimental index using geometric means appears to lower the growth of the all-

items CPI by approximately one-quarter of one percent per year.35

             Recently the BLS announced that beginning in January 1999, the aggregating formula for constructing

most of the elementary aggregates (comprising approximately 61% of total consumer spending) will be moved over to a

geometric mean. Medical care CPI components are largely exceptions, however; all but prescription drugs, and non-

prescription drugs and medical supplies will continue to be constructed by the traditional arithmetic mean calculation.36
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 21 -




Note that for each of the more highly aggregated 211 item strata, fixed quantity weights will still be employed, reflecting

the continuing assumption of zero substitutability between these strata.

             With this overview of the CPI hierarchical structure, weights, and aggregation formulae as background, we

now move on to a brief summary of the PPI.

             B. A BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE PPI

             The Producer Price Index (PPI) "measures average changes in selling prices received by domestic

producers for their output".37 Before 1978 the BLS named this price series its Wholesale Price Index (WPI). The

change in name to Producer Price Index emphasized that its conceptual foundations were based on prices received by

producers from whomever makes the first purchase, rather than on prices paid to wholesalers by retailers or others

further down in the distribution chain.38 At the same time, the structure of the index was changed substantially. The old

WPI corresponded, roughly, to the P in the well known quantity theory of value expression, MV≡PT. In this view of an

inflation index, all transactions mattered, so the WPI combined into one index the prices of, e.g., iron ore, steel and the

automobile in which the steel was an input.39 The resulting substantial double counting in the WPI was regarded as a

serious problem.40 In response, the BLS converted the old price index to the concept of an industry output price index.41

As a result, the basic measurement unit for the PPI has become an industry -- in the case of medical care, hospitals,

physicians' offices and clinics, and nursing homes are each separate industries. The PPI publishes separate price indexes

for the outputs of each of these industries.

             The PPI is calculated monthly, and is usually published in the second or third week following the reference

month. The PPI involves pricing the output of domestic producers, while the BLS' International Price Program

publishes price indexes for both imports and exports.

             The PPI program at the BLS takes as its definition of an industry that based on the Standard Industrial

Classification (SIC) code.42 Since its inception in 1902, the PPI has focused heavily on the goods-producing sectors of

the U.S. economy, but ever since 1986, in recognition of the growing importance of services in the U.S. economy, the

BLS has gradually begun to broaden the PPI's scope of coverage into the service sectors.

             Currently the BLS does not calculate and publish an economy-wide aggregate goods and services PPI,

although it plans to do so beginning January 2002. Rather, PPIs are published by industry (based on the SIC 4-digit

industry code and higher levels of aggregation), by commodity classification (by similarity of end use or material
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 22 -




composition, regardless of whether these products are classified as primary or secondary in their industry of origin, for

fifteen major commodity groupings), and by stage of processing (according to the class of buyer and the amount of

physical processing or assembling the products have undergone), separately for finished goods, intermediate materials,

and crude materials, both by commodity and industry classifications. Hereafter we focus primarily on PPIs by industry.

             Within each industry, the BLS calculates aggregate PPIs using the same Laspeyres price index formulae as

for the CPI (see Eqn. 5 above). At the most disaggregated level of PPI price measurement (called the "cell index"), the

BLS defines a price as "...the net revenue accruing to a specified producing establishment from a specified kind of buyer

for a specified product shipped under specified transactions terms on a specified day of the month".43 Prices are for

output currently being provided or shipped, and not for order or futures prices.44 Although in general the BLS seeks

transactions rather than list prices for its price quotes, responses by firms are less cumbersome when list rather than

transactions prices are reported.45 Participation in the PPI by firms is on a voluntary basis. As of December 1992, the

overall PPI "productive" response rate was 63%.46

             The PPI is also based on a hierarchical system, though as noted above, unlike the case of the CPI, currently

there is no economy-wide measure of the PPI. The BLS constructs and publishes aggregate PPIs for the total mining

and total manufacturing industries, but apparently because of a lack of sufficient coverage, the BLS does not currently

publish an aggregate PPI for total services; the BLS hopes to publish such an aggregate services industry PPI by January

2002.47

             Price quotes from the most disaggregated cell indexes are aggregated via a Laspeyres weighting scheme,

where fixed weights are based on value of shipments data collected primarily by the Bureau of the Census; industry net

output weights are employed to take account of intraindustry sales. The net output weights therefore vary with the level

of industry aggregation (e.g., four-digit to two-digit); the detailed industry flow data required to distinguish net from

gross output are derived for the most part from use of input-output tables compiled by the Bureau of Economic Analysis.

Beginning in January 1996, industry price indexes have been calculated primarily with net output weights based on 1987

input-output relationships. The 1992 input-output tables have just recently been released, and the BLS envisages using

them by the end of 1998.48

             With respect to the specific establishments and items sampled by the BLS in its PPI program, the BLS

currently draws a sample of items for each industry on average every seven years or so, and then reprices this fixed set
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 23 -




of items monthly until an entirely new sample is drawn. Since 1978, the BLS has attempted to employ a sampling

procedure that makes the probability of selection be proportional to a product's value of shipments. Because it

recognized that in some technologically dynamic industries a seven year time lag between samples could result in a

sample of products and services much older and quite unrepresentative of market transactions, in 1996 the BLS

announced that for certain industries, including pharmaceuticals and electronics, samples would be supplemented at one

or two-year intervals.49

             Issues surrounding the reliability and possibility of biases in price index measurement have recently

received much less attention for the PPI than for the CPI. Use of the Laspeyres weighting procedure, accounting for

unmeasured quality changes, and discontinuation and exit of sampled goods and services, raise issues which in many

respects are similar for the CPI and PPI. On the other hand, a number of significant differences exist between the CPI

and PPI medical care components.

             First, the lowest level of aggregation is defined differently in the two indexes: the PPI is defined on four-

digit SIC industries, and below that, the item detail is defined specifically to each of the diagnosis related medical care

industries (major groups for the hospital index, medical specialties for the physicians' index, and so forth). The item

strata in the CPI are based on groups that, in principle, should correspond to consumer demand categories.50

             Second, the frequency and nature of major revisions differ. The CPI is revised every ten to twelve years,

when new weights are assigned based on the consumer expenditure survey. The PPI is normally rebased every five

years, with weights drawn from the economic censuses.51

             For the medical price indexes, another major difference exists between CPI and PPI. In the case of the PPI,

revenues and output prices collected from the sampled unit refer to revenues from all sources -- government, industry

and final consumers. For the CPI, only consumers' out-of-pocket costs are included. Government expenditures made on

behalf of consumers and financed by taxes, and health expenditures by insurance companies where employers (but not

consumers directly) pay the premiums are out of scope for the present definition of the CPI. We return to discuss this

difference in scope in Section D below.

             With these overview discussions of the CPI and PPI as general background, we now move to consideration

of issues of particular importance to medical care goods and services. We begin with the MPPI.
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 24 -




             C. PPIs FOR MEDICAL-RELATED GOODS AND SERVICES

             As noted above, the BLS does not construct and publish a PPI for an aggregate of services. Nor does the

BLS publish a PPI for an aggregate consisting of medical-related goods and services. Indeed, it is only within the last

decade that the BLS, as part of its increased effort to measure prices in the various service industries, has begun

publishing price indexes for hospital and physician services.

             Among the manufacturing industries associated with health care, the BLS has published PPIs for some time

for industries such as pharmaceuticals; hospital beds; medical books; surgical, medical and dental instruments and

supplies; ophthalmic goods and others. Among the service industries, separate PPIs for numerous health care related

industries are a rather recent development. A PPI for health services was introduced by the BLS effective 1994:12, that

for offices and clinics of doctors of medicine in 1993:12, for skilled and intermediate care facilities 1994:12, for

hospitals in aggregate and by type in 1992:12, and for medical laboratories in 1994:6.

             If the BLS is ever to construct an aggregate MPPI, as with other industry aggregates, it will need to

distinguish net from gross output by industry, using some form of an input-output matrix to measure inter- and intra-

industry flows. Given the major changes in the health care sectors over the last decade, including impacts from the

growth of managed care, it will of course be necessary to employ input-output matrices that are based on much more

recent data than the 1987 input-output matrix currently employed by the BLS for defining net output in other industries.

While the BLS plans to begin using 1992 input-output data beginning in late 1998, these data will already be six years

out of date, and much organizational and technological change has occurred in the health care industries since 1992.



             1. OUTPUT MEASUREMENT IN THE MPPI

             A central measurement issue in the construction of MPPIs involves the specification and implementation of

a concept of industry output. Although the PPI program utilizes the four-digit SIC classification system to identify and

define industries, this SIC structure does not provide information enabling the BLS to define what is the appropriate real

output concept in medical care industries, and on how this output quantity and output price can best be measured.52 As

we shall see, important problems also emerge when medical treatments from distinct SIC industries are substituted for

each other in treating an illness or condition.

             In the U.S., medical goods and services were traditionally paid for by fee-for-service arrangements. In a
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 25 -




fee-for-service context, a reasonable business procedure involves identifying and separately billing for each particular

component of medical care from, say, a physician, a hospital and a pharmacy. The fee-for-service was essentially the

price for the inputs to medical care.

             In 1983 the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) introduced major changes in how general acute

care hospitals treating Medicare patients were to be reimbursed. Specifically, beginning in 1983 HCFA implemented a

prospective payment system for inpatient hospital care, whereby general acute care hospitals received a fixed payment

for almost every Medicare patient admission, regardless of the amount or duration of services actually provided the

patient. This prospective payment mechanism represented a sharp departure from the retrospective cost-based

accounting framework used for many years.

             Medicare prospective payment schedules are based on estimates of (average accounting) costs for the

resources utilized in providing services for a typical patient in a given geographical area being treated for a particular

medical case. As of 1995 payments were distinguished for treatments of 24 major diagnostic categories, which are

broken down further into 495 medical and surgical groupings, known as diagnostic related groups (DRGs).53 The DRG

prospective payment schedules have been updated regularly by the Congress utilizing recommendations from HCFA

and the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission (now the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission); updates

include changes in “medical costs” and case-mix indexing to account in part for secular trends in upcoding, also known

as "DRG creep".

             DRGs provide one possible output concept, and while DRGs in theory are applicable to all populations,

Medicare currently employs DRGs only to reimburse hospitals for inpatient hospital care ; many outpatient commodities

(e.g., home health care) and services for illnesses of the elderly, and particularly of the non-elderly, are not included in

the DRG system.54

             Classification schemes used for other services include version four of Current Procedural Terminology

(CPT4) codes, a list containing thousands of procedures for which physicians and hospitals can bill; these CPT4 codes

can be envisaged as inputs into the treatment of an illness or condition.55

             A systematic structure of diagnostic codes for illnesses and conditions is version nine of the International

Classification of Diseases (ICD-9).56 Relationships among ICD-9, CPT4 and DRG codes are multifaceted. A single

DRG encompasses treatment of somewhat arbitrary aggregations of distinct ICD-9 diagnoses, alternative combinations
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 26 -




of CPT4 codes can be used in the treatment of a particular ICD-9 diagnosis, and a given CPT4 procedure can be used in

the treatment of various ICD-9 diagnoses. Other diagnostic-related systems used in setting risk-adjusted capitation rates

include the Ambulatory Care Group algorithm57 and the Hierarchical Coexisting Conditions model.58

             DRGs and their offspring represent the beginning of a structure which could facilitate defining, measuring

and pricing the output of medical care providers. In particular, the output of a particular DRG billing involves the

treatments for an episode of hospitalization for a particular condition/diagnosis. Instead of pricing each of the

components of a hospitalization, with DRGs the composite bundle of hospital services is given a single ex ante price.59

             Along with the development of CPT4 and ICD codes, the notion of an episode of illness or treatment has

expanded far beyond the hospitalization realm, suggestive of yet alternative ways of measuring medical care output.

Numerous professional medical associations, as well as the Agency for Health Care Policy and Research (AHCPR)-- an

agency of the Public Health Service in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, have developed clinical

practice guidelines and treatment protocols for various illnesses and conditions. These treatment guidelines, which

change over time, define ex ante medically acceptable and often therapeutically similar bundles of treatment involving

medical inputs such as laboratory tests, pharmaceuticals, minutes of service from physicians and other medical

personnel, and various other inpatient and outpatient procedures. Health insurance plans, hospitals and pharmaceutical

companies have developed programs and protocols for the management of certain diseases. These disease management

programs implicitly, and sometimes explicitly, suggest outputs of the medical sector that facilitate the pricing of

treatment bundles and the accounting framework for assigning payments to providers.60

             With this as background, we now turn to a discussion of how the BLS' PPI program has implemented

medical care sector output price and quantity measurement, and how it has built on the notion of DRG treatment

episodes as output measures in the health care sector. As noted earlier, within the last decade the BLS's PPI program has

made major changes in, and introduced many new, health-care related PPIs. We begin with a discussion of medical

services -- physicians and hospitals, and then we discuss selected medical goods, such as pharmaceuticals.

             A. PHYSICIANS' SERVICES IN THE MPPI

             The PPI program has initiated procedures for constructing medical service PPIs at two rather aggregate

levels, physician services and hospital services. Each of these two classes of services in turn encompasses a variety of

more detailed physician and hospital service industries. In Table 1 we list the entire set of detailed physician, hospital
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 27 -




and medical laboratory industries in SIC 80 for which the BLS is currently constructing health services sub-index PPIs.

             With respect to offices and clinics of doctors of medicine ("physician services"), the new BLS procedures

distinguish Medicare from non-Medicare treatments Within the non-Medicare treatments, multispecialty group

practices are treated separately from one and two physician practices and single specialty group practice, with the latter

in turn being broken down into nine specialties. For skilled and intermediate care facilities, public payers are

distinguished from private.

             The second principal sub-index within health services is hospital services. As is seen in the bottom panel

of Table 1, general medical and surgical hospitals are differentiated from psychiatric hospitals, and specialty hospitals

except psychiatric. Both inpatient and outpatient treatments are separated into those involving Medicare patients,

Medicaid patients and all other patients; for the non-Medicare and non-Medicaid inpatients, hospital treatments are

differentiated involving 23 distinct illnesses/diseases/conditions.

             Development of the BLS' PPIs for physician services has benefited considerably from the prior

implementation and common usage of the DRG, CPT4 and ICD classification systems by insurers, hospitals, physicians,

and other providers.61 Based on a sampling universe including all physician practices in the US, the BLS employs

probability sampling stratified by size and specialty. The size of a physician practice is based on the number of

physicians in a given practice (not the number of employees, or revenues); the sample is stratified further into nine

single specialty categories and one multi-specialty category. Initially in 1993-4 it was expected that the total number of

physician practices sampled would be about 400 and the number of quotes obtained would be about 1150,62 but by mid-

1997 only 158 units remained in sample, yielding 845 quotes.63

             Given the sampling unit, at the price quote initiation point in time, the BLS randomly chooses a bill that

measures the net prices paid to a physician's practice for the entire set of services or procedures provided during an

office visit, distinguished by type of payer (cash, third party insurance, Medicaid, Medicare, etc.).64 The physician's

output from this visit is represented by the content of the patient's bill, including all the CPT codes associated with that

visit. To ensure that the unique combinations of inputs listed on a bill associate with a particular medical condition or

surgical procedure, an association which is critical for repricing, the BLS also employs the ICD system, a coding scheme

with which physician offices have considerable familiarity.65
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 30 -




             It is worth noting that the net transactions price by payer type requested by the BLS represents the actual

anticipated revenues, including discounts, and not billed charges based on, for example, a "chargemaster".

             With this sample bill, the BLS contacts the sampled physician unit each month, and asks it to reprice what

the current net transactions prices would be for that particular bundle/payer of services. Thus items on the sample bill

remain fixed over time (between major revisions), but item prices could change. Because transaction prices may vary

from private payer to private payer, this may present considerable difficulty in practice. Indeed, some payers pay the

physician in part or in whole by capitation, thereby making the price for any specified mix of services arbitrary.

             PPIs for physicians' services have been published beginning December 1993. Monthly repricing of

physicians' bills presents the BLS with numerous practical difficulties. In some cases, bills are purged from the

physicians' accounting system, and therefore cannot be repriced; this has occurred for about 35 (4-5% of all) quotes each

year. In other cases, the reporter at the sample unit has refused to provide line by line quotes; this has transpired for

about 25 (3% of all) quotes each year.66

             In addition to facing such repricing difficulties at physician practices continuing to cooperate with the PPI,

the BLS is operating in an environment in which the organization of physician practices has undergone dramatic

changes in the last few years as practices have been consolidated and sold to larger provider groups. Thus it is not

surprising that sample attrition for physicians services has been considerable. The impact of this physician practice and

bill repricing attrition on the representativeness of the current sample frame is currently unknown.

             Finally, in terms of quality change, serious difficulties remain, even with the use of CPT codes. For

example, if a new laboratory test becomes available that is more sensitive, reliable and expensive, yet is used for

diagnosis of the same condition and has the same CPT code as its predecessor, it will be considered a price change.67 In

such a case, quality improvements will not be incorporated. On the other hand, if the laboratory tests are read and

examined by less experienced technicians having larger error rates but price is constant, quality declines would be

overlooked. Currently the BLS makes no quality adjustments for the physician or laboratory services component of the

MPPI.68

             B. HOSPITAL SERVICES IN THE MPPI

             We now turn to the PPI for hospital services, which the BLS has published since its December 1992 base

period. The hospital services PPI measures anticipated net prices paid to hospitals for the entire bundle of services
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 31 -




received during a hospital stay, given the type of payer. The hospital's output is represented by the content of a patient's

bill, including all room, medical supplies, drugs and ancillary services provided the patient during a single hospital stay;

for an outpatient visit, the hospital output is the anticipated net revenues to be received for medical supplies, drugs and

ancillary charges accruing from a single hospital visit.

             As with the PPI for physicians' services, the hospital service PPI attempts to be based on patients' bills that

specify the purpose of the hospitalization, as recorded by ICD codes; such an association is important so that repricing is

based on a unique combination of inputs listed on the bill with a particular medical condition or surgical procedure.

This focus on hospitalization episode for a particular treatment is preferable to pricing based on bed-days, drugs, tests,

etc., irrespective of the patient's illness. To take into account the possibility that price per bed-day is increasing along

with a reduction in average length of stay, when repricing the BLS' PPI program now explicitly asks whether the there

has been a change in average length of stay for the hypothetical price quote. If such a change has occurred, it is treated

as a quality change, not simply a price change. As of 1998, the change in average length of stay is the only adjustment

the hospital PPI makes for quality change.69

             In principle, net transactions prices incorporate effects of discounts, and therefore are not "list" or

"chargemaster" prices. It is not known what proportion of transactions in hospitals actually involve only list prices, list

prices less certain adjustments, or capitation, and how this has changed since, say, 1992. Although the BLS clearly

seeks to obtain price quotes based on net transactions prices, in a recent GAO report involving the MCPI it was noted

that only about 15% of the hospital price quotes obtained by the BLS included discounts.70 In Catron-Murphy [1996],

however, it is reported that with the MPPI, 43.4% of the sampled inpatient price quotes and 64.6% of its outpatient price

quotes initially collected in 1992 were based on list prices.71 As with physician services, capitation for hospitals raises

further issues, for it calls into question the whole basis of pricing, since it is based on health plan enrollment rather than

use of hospital services by any given patient.

             The sampling frame for the hospital services PPI is based on a universe compiled by the American Hospital

Association, with the probability of a hospital being sampled being proportional to its revenues.72 The sample is

stratified on the basis of size (measured by number of beds), public vs. private ownership, and type of medical specialty.

When initially implemented in 1992, given an expected voluntary response rate of 63% (similar to that for other PPI

industries), the expected sample size was 558, and the total number of expected monthy price quotes was 2707. By mid-
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 32 -




1997, however, the actual sample size had fallen 42% to 322,73 while the number of quotes fell by a smaller 15% to

2302.74

               Once a hospital is identified as a sample unit, at the time of sample initiation the BLS chooses a fixed

subset of DRGs, and each hospital is then asked on a monthly basis to report on net transactions prices of a single

representative patient bill (typically, the last patient bill on file for that DRG) for each of the randomly assigned DRGs.

The DRGs are selected using selection probabilities proportional to expenditures in each DRG based on HCFA and

other data from a number of payer sources. Since the identical treatment bundle is not always observed in subsequent

months, BLS reporters construct subsequent hypothetical DRG bundle prices by repricing the identical inputs. BLS

notes that when a particular hospital does not perform the targeted DRG service, the hospital can instead provide quotes

for several alternative DRGs listed by the BLS on the Quote Assignment Sheet.75 Attrition in the BLS's hospital

repricing program is likely to be affected by movement away from DRG billings by hospitals, particularly for non-

Medicare patients, and is therefore an important issue worthy of close scrutiny in the very rapidly changing hospital

marketplace.

               It is also worth noting that in recent years, as hospital length of stay has fallen, the use of post-acute care

services such as skilled nursing facilities and rehabilitation units has increased. Often these treatment centers are owned

by and even physically located in the hospital. Pricing a hospital stay may present a substantially biased picture of the

price of an episode of treatment.

               Finally, as noted earlier, the PPI distinguishes as "industries" the "hospital industry" and the "physicians'

office industry," largely because the mixes of production processes observed in these two types of establishments are, if

not completely disjoint, at least demonstrably not the identical set of production processes. On its own terms, this is

clearly reasonable. However, this industry distinction creates a substitution bias with respect to an index for the

purchasers of health care. Specifically, the problem that arises is that from the purchasers' vantage, the same "product"

or service might be "produced" by different industries or by different production processes. For example, with both the

physicians' services and hospital services PPI, the nature of the fixed and itemized components for the price quotes

requested by the BLS does not permit major input substitution for the treatment of a condition, such as changing the mix

of psychotherapy and psychotherapeutic drugs used for the treatment of acute phase depression. When this occurs, even

if the industry price indexes are in some sense measured correctly, the PPI measures will miss the purchasers' gain from
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 33 -




shifting between different suppliers.

             C. MEDICAL PRODUCTS IN THE MPPI: PHARMACEUTICALS

             To this point we have discussed the services component of health care, rather than the goods or

commodities components. Although numerous manufacturing products are related to the provision of health care, here

we focus on one industry class that has received considerable treatment to date and is perhaps the most significant

medical goods industry, namely, prescription pharmaceuticals.76

             Prescription pharmaceuticals is a relatively research-intensive industry characterized by a considerable

number of new product introductions, and therefore it creates substantial challenges for accurate price measurement.

Not surprisingly, the BLS' treatment of prescription pharmaceuticals has long been the subject of controversy. As

Dorothy Rice and Loucele A. Horowitz noted thirty years ago, for many years the BLS sample tended to focus

excessively on old products: "Until 1960, only three prescribed drugs -- penicillin, a narcotic, and a non-narcotic -- were

included. In that year the list of prescripted drugs was increased to 16 items."77 Describing the Stigler Commission's

Report of 1961, Rice-Horowitz noted that "The Subcommittee urged more prompt introductions of new products--a

matter of particular importance in the case of drugs and prescriptions."78

             More recently, a detailed audit of the BLS' PPI for prescription pharmaceuticals was conducted by Berndt,

Griliches and Rosett [1993], which was updated and extended by Berndt-Greenberg [1995]. Although these studies

examined transactions at a slightly different point in the distribution chain than does the PPI (transactions from

wholesalers to retail drug stores, rather than from manufacturers to their initial customer, typically wholesalers), the

Berndt et al. studies raised a number of significant issues. In particular, three important findings from these studies were

that: (i) the BLS oversampled older goods and undersampled new and middle-aged pharmaceuticals; and (ii) prices of

older products increased more rapidly than those of products earlier on in their life cycle.79 As a result, (iii) the BLS

overstated prescription drug price inflation, by perhaps as much as three percentage points a year over the 1986-91 time

period. Corroborating evidence has since been reported by others, including the BLS.80

             Partly in response to this research, the BLS implemented a new sampling method by which newer products

are introduced more rapidly. Specifically, to compensate for the age bias in the BLS prescription pharmaceutical

sample, in 1995 the BLS linked in a Supplement I sample of about 49 additional drugs newly approved by the FDA

since 1992 (the original 1993 sample had 522 products from 92 manufacturers, but attrition to 1995 reduced the 571 to
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 34 -




544), and included these in their sample effective December 1995. As noted by Kelly [1997], the resulting PPI with

supplemental sampling rose 2.1% in 1996. Had this supplement not been introduced, the PPI would have risen 2.7%

(based on a BLS research index); in three of the 14 months since the introduction of the supplement, price changes in the

published index exceeded that of the research index. One year later the BLS constructed and linked in a Supplement II

sample, bringing the total number of observations to 561 (after additional attrition). As is noted by Kelly [1997, p. 17],

"In the 14 months since January 1996, the published index has risen 3.3%. Had Supplements I and II not been

introduced, the index would have risen 4.1%." Apparently the BLS now plans to add supplements to this industry on an

annual basis.

                Another area in which the BLS MPPI has recently made substantial changes involves generic drugs. Until

several years ago, the BLS procedures for its pharmaceutical PPIs treated generic drugs as entirely unrelated to their

patented antecedents. Griliches and Cockburn [1994] noted that generic drugs were a special case of the more general

"new goods" problem facing statistical agencies such as the BLS. Since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration

certifies generics as being therapeutically equivalent to brand name versions of the same chemical entity, conventional

problems encountered when valuing new goods are much simpler with generic drugs. Griliches and Cockburn

illustrated the empirical significance of linking generic drugs to their patented antecedents (based on an assumed

uniform distribution of tastes between brands and generics), and contrasted their preferred price index construction

procedure with that employed by the BLS at that time. Based on data for two antibiotic drugs, Griliches-Cockburn

showed that with a Paasche approximation to the "true" index, using reservation prices based on the uniform distribution

yielded a price index 25% lower after two years than a Tornqvist index that introduced generics as quickly as was

feasible but treated them as new goods, and was 36% lower than an index that mimicked the procedures then employed

by the BLS. Several years later, Berndt, Cockburn and Griliches [1996] extended the Griliches-Cockburn research and

showed that for the entire class of antidepressant drugs, the BLS' overstatement of price inflation due to the way it

handled generic drugs was more than four percentage points per year from 1986 to 1996.81

                The BLS has announced major changes in how it treats generic drugs in its PPI; these changes are

summarized in Kanoza [1996] and Kelly [1997]. In particular, effective January 1996, for drugs in the BLS sample

losing patent protection and experiencing initial generic competition, the BLS split the fixed weight for that molecule

into two parts -- 64.2% for the generic, and 35.8% for the brand. Thus the new BLS procedure treated the composite
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 35 -




molecule price change as a pure price change. The 64-36 percentages were arrived at as a result of a BLS literature

review on typical generic penetrations following the expiration of patent protection. The percentage splits were the

same for all molecules, and were fixed over time. Beginning with the Supplement II sample introduced in late 1996,

however, the BLS brand-generic split was based on actual brand-generic dollar sales, using data purchased by the BLS

from IMS America.82

             There is one other curiosum involving the prescription pharmaceutical PPI. As noted in Berndt, Cockburn

and Griliches [1996], for historical reasons involving preferential federal tax treatment, many US pharmaceutical firms

currently manufacture drugs in Puerto Rico; the Puerto Rican value of shipments for prescription pharmaceuticals is

roughly 20-25% of that on the mainland, and is likely to be higher for newer molecules. For purposes of its PPI

calculations, however, the BLS is mandated to treat Puerto Rico as outside the US, and thus the PPI excludes all Puerto

Rican production.

             It turns out that how one deals with Puerto Rican economic accounts differs across government statistical

agencies, and even within the BLS. For example, the Bureau of Economic Analysis' national income and product

accounts exclude Puerto Rican production and that of other dependencies, but in the balance of payments accounts,

Puerto Rico is treated as domestic. The Census Bureau defines the U.S. as the U.S. customs territory, which consists of

the fifty states, D.C. and Puerto Rico, plus U.S. foreign trade zones and the U.S. Virgin Islands. However, within the

BLS' International Price Program (IPP), Puerto Rico is considered as part of the U.S., and thus currently no IPP price

quotes are obtained for Puerto Rican pharmaceutical products shipped to the fifty United States.

             The issue of how one treats Puerto Rican production is important to the reliability and interpretation of the

prescription drug PPI. If Puerto Rico is to be excluded, as is now the case for the PPI, then to the extent public policy

analysts and others seek to track the price growth emanating from US producers (many of whom have chosen to produce

significantly in Puerto Rico), it will be necessary to collect and publish "import" price series from Puerto Rico, and then

to combine those data with the more narrowly defined "domestic" mainland price series.83 Of total pharmaceutical

shipments "imported" into the U.S. from throughout the world, it appears that about 15% emanate from Puerto Rico.84

             D. MEDICAL CARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN THE CPI AND MCPI

             Medical components of the CPI and PPI programs at the BLS have rather different heritages. It is only

within the last decade that the BLS' PPI has extended coverage to a wide variety of service industries, such as medical
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 36 -




care. Thus, construction and design of the recently introduced medical care-related PPIs, such as those for physicians'

and hospitals' services, have had the opportunity of benefiting from recent thinking and developments on what in fact are

the outputs of the service industries, and how one might measure prices in the context of rapidly changing market

structure. By contrast, the medical CPI has been published for a very long period of time, regularly since 1935.85
             A remarkable fact in the BLS' medical CPI is summarized in Figure 1.86 Since 1927, the first year for which

MCPI data are available, and for each decade since then, measured medical inflation has generally been greater than that

for all goods and services.87 Over the entire 1927-96 time period, the MCPI has risen at an average annual growth rate

(AAGR) of 4.59%, almost half again as large as the 3.24% for the overall CPI.

             Beginning with its January 1998 major revisions, the BLS has regularly published an aggregate medical

care Consumer Price Index (MCPI), as well as price indexes for nine of the thirteen item strata in the MCPI. Separate

MCPIs are also published for two expenditure groups (medical care commodities, and medical care services). The four

major sub-indexes of the MCPI, along with their 1993-95 percentage base period weights within the aggregate MCPI,

are prescription drugs (15.0%); nonprescription drugs and medical supplies (7.6%); professional medical services (also

called physicians' services, although dentists are included, 49.4%); hospital and related services (23.0%); and health

insurance (5.0%).88 Each of these price indexes is based on consumers' out-of-pocket expenditures (OOPs) including

employees' contribution to employment-based insurance, and thereby excludes all payments by governments and a

portion of that from third party insurers. Any health insurance reimbursements for medical services received by a

member of the sampled household are netted out to obtain a net out-of-pocket expenditure.89 Only that portion of third

party insurance paid for out-of-pocket by consumers (and excluding employers' contributions to employee health

insurance) is included within the scope of the MCPI.90


However, in constructing weights for the BLS' MCPI, the OOPs payments for health insurance are in turn distributed

into payments by insurers for medical services, medical commodities, and health insurers' retained earnings.91

Analogous to Eqn. (4) above, for each MCPI component, OOPs plus the consumer-paid health insurance premium

allocation yields a total component weight, which until recently was typically applied to list prices paid by cash-paying

customers. Note that over the last decade, actual transactions prices were frequently considerably less than list prices,

particularly as discounts to managed care organizations became more common.92 To the extent this occurred, over that
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 37 -




time period it is likely that measured MCPIs overstated true price growth. However, particularly more recently, it is

possible that discounts have become smaller and less frequent, in which case use of list prices could understate true price

growth.

                             1. THE ITEM STRUCTURE OF THE MCPI

             The basic unit of the hierarchical CPI involves definitions of the item strata. Identifying and defining item

strata presents considerable difficulties, particularly when markets are undergoing dramatic change during times within

the approximately once-each-decade major CPI revisions.

             From January 1987 through January 1998, for example, the CPI hierarchical structure distinguished

inpatient hospital services as an item stratum separate from outpatient hospital services. Over this same period of time,

cost containment efforts by managed care and other health providers resulted in many surgical procedures being
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 38 -




transformed from inpatient to outpatient hospitalization. By shifting patients from inpatient to outpatient surgeries,

hospitals and insurers were frequently able to cut down on total costs. Moreover, the average length of hospital stays

declined over the 1987-98 time period, as skilled nursing facility days and home health visits were substituted for

hospital days.

             One consequence of this change in place of service was that the case mix severity in both inpatient and

outpatient settings increased, resulting in greater costs for the average case in both settings, even as total inpatient plus

outpatient costs decreased. The mean inpatient severity likely increased, since the less complex and critical surgeries

were shifted to the outpatient venue, leaving only the more critical and complex surgeries as inpatient. The mean

outpatient severity also likely increased over this time, for outpatient surgeries were now being done on a much larger

set of more complex patient cases. Total costs of treatment, taking into account the substitution from inpatient to

outpatient, were lowered as a result.

             It is illuminating to consider price index measurement implications of this cost-containment approach

employed by managed care. Because the BLS treated inpatient and outpatient hospitalizations as distinct item strata,

and because the result of the inpatient to outpatient substitution resulted in greater severity/complexity for both inpatient

and outpatient services, price indexes for each item strata grew substantially, and given fixed weights for these item

strata, the aggregate hospitalization price index also grew, even as total costs were likely to have decreased. Moreover,

the CPI, though not the PPI, priced hospital days. There average severity also grew, due to shorter stays. Although

empirical evidence is not available, we conjecture that over the January 1987 - January 1998 time period, the BLS'

measured CPI inflation for hospitalization considerably overstated true hospital inflation, because it failed to account for

substitution from inpatient to outpatient, and also failed to account for treatments involving greater severity case mix in

each component. This overstatement is consistent with the increased spread of the MCPI over the CPI between 1986

and 1996 (Figure 1) at a time when increased price competition should have decreased the spread.

             The BLS has recognized the problem, and in its major CPI revisions introduced in January 1998 it began

treating the aggregate of hospital inpatient and outpatient services as a single item stratum. It has also shifted to

measuring hospital services by the stay rather than by the day, and and it has classified inpatient and outpatient hospital

services as substratum indexes, similar to the ELIs discussed in Section A above.93 Information is not available,

however, on how linking is implemented when, for example, a shift occurs from inpatient to outpatient surgery. Simple
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 39 -




redefinition will not fully address the problem of inpatient-outpatient substitution, unless a satisfactory linking procedure

is developed and implemented as well.

             A number of other important changes have recently been introduced into the CPI for hospital services, even

before the 1998 major revision. Until at least 1990, for example, in most cases procedures for the MCPI involved

pricing specific input items at list prices, e.g., "chargemaster" fees for x-rays, laboratory tests, and physicians' office

visits rather than at the average actual charge for treatment of, say, a child's forearm fracture to a managed care

organization obtaining a hospital discount.94 According to Cardenas [1996b], since 1993, when redrawing outlet and

item samples, the BLS has attempted to obtain quotes from hospitals for specific payers, thereby seeking to obtain

transactions rather than list prices. Cardenas [1996a, p. 40] reports that "Employing the sample rotation construct as the

vehicle for increasing the number of transaction prices in the CPI, however, has yielded slow progress to date."

According to the 1996 GAO study cited above, only about 15% of the CPI hospital price quotes obtained by the BLS

included discounts.95

             Obtaining transaction rather than list prices is not an easy task, particularly since with price discrimination

and alternative pricing methods currently in the medical marketplace, there are frequently many transaction prices.

Consider, for example, hospital services. Some insurers pay for medical care on a per diem basis -- one price per day to

cover all services provided. Other insurers pay on a DRG basis -- one price per admission, differentiated only by the

severity of the admission. And still other insurers pay on a capitated basis -- one price per patient per year, independent

of the amount of services the patient actually receives. Since the market has not settled on one basis of price,

appropriate price indexes must be able to handle payments using all of these methods. Obtaining the transaction prices

for all three methods will be difficult, particularly since transaction prices are frequently considered highly proprietary

and confidential by insurers. Moreover, since health plans have different bargaining power, the same provider may

negotiate varying per diem rates with alternative health plans. Note that these problems are not unique to the MCPI, but

are relevant for the MPPI as well. Cooperation and joint efforts by the MCPI and MPPI programs in securing price

quotes could be very fruitful.

             Other recent changes implemented by the MCPI for hospitals involve item descriptions. At one extreme,

one can assume zero substitutability among medical care goods and services for treatment of a condition, and simply

take quotes of discrete hospital goods and services. An alternative, discussed above, is to employ DRGs. Although the
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 40 -




BLS apparently employed non-Medicare DRG prices in three states beginning in 1990, two of those states have since

terminated their state-regulated DRG programs. As of September 1992, approximately 6% of the CPI hospital quotes

consisted of DRG descriptions.96 According to Cardenas [1996a, p. 40], use of DRGs is problematic, because "...a DRG

treatment path can be wide-ranging, contingent upon the treating physicians' approach", e.g., coefficients of variation

range from 0.30 to over 1.5, thereby indicating considerable variation in the treatment strategies used to treat a case as

defined by a DRG.97 Currently the BLS is instead considering use of a "package" treatment, consisting of "highly

standardized and tightly defined components and risk factors" for conditions such as appendectomies, tonsillectomies

and cataract surgery. Details on how such treatment packages would be defined and how representativeness would be

ensured have not been released, nor have any data concerning the composition and nature of hospital quotes being

obtained by the BLS MCPI since the major revisions of January 1998.

             Our MCPI discussion to this point has focused on hospital services. We have not seen comparable

literature dealing with MCPIs for physician services, although informal conversations with BLS personnel suggest to us

that issues of item description, list vs. transactions prices, and lack of quality adjustment are similar for physician and

hospital services.

             Like the MPPI, the MCPI has a prescription drug component. Issues discussed earlier in the context of the

MPPI concerning the linking of prices of newly entering generic drugs, just after branded drugs lose patent protection, to

prices of their pioneer antecedents apply here as well.

             The MCPI program implemented changes involving generic drugs earlier than the MPPI. Effective January

1995, procedures involving the MCPI prescription drug treatment of generics changed considerably.98 For branded

drugs in the CPI sample losing patent protection, six months after patent expiration the BLS now follows a procedure

whereby branded and generic versions of the molecule are randomly selected, where the probability of selection is

proportional to the sales of each version of the drug during the sixth month. If a generic substitute is selected, the entire

price difference between the original drug and its generic substitute is treated as a price change. Obviously, if the

branded version is selected, repricing will continue as before. Drugs entering the CPI sample after their patent has

expired would of course not be affected by this new procedure, since during the CPI sample rotation process generic

versions would also have had a chance of being selected. Note that use of a six month window is somewhat

problematic, for in many cases considerable additional diffusion of generics occurs beyond the six months immediately
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 41 -




following patent expiration.99

             Finally, regarding sample sizes for the MCPI and its components, as of December 1996 the total number of

MCPI current price quotes was 7891. This was broken down as follows: prescription drugs, 687; internal and

respiratory over the counter drugs, 354; nonprescription medical equipment and supplies, 315; physicians' services,

1304; dental services, 867; eye care, 298; services by other medical professionals, 251; hospital services, 3399; and

nursing home servaices, 416.100



             2. WEIGHTING ISSUES IN THE CPI AND MCPI

             As noted in Section A above, from January 1987 until January 1998, the item strata weights employed by

the BLS in its CPI program were those based on the 1982-84 CEX; beginning January 1998, the new weights are thosed

based on the 1993-95 CEX. Thus weights used just before the most recent CPI revision were about fifteen years out of

date, and the newly introduced "current" weights were already three to four years out of date at the time of unveiling.

Up-to-date weights are particularly important in the case of medical care, where technological change may result in

substantial shifts across weighting categories. For example, Cutler et al. [1998 a, b] compare the old CPI medical

methodology (pricing the hospital room rate and other hospital inputs with weights held fixed over a long time interval)

with (i) a price index that priced the inputs but reweighted annually, and (ii) a price index that was based on the cost of

treating heart attacks. The quantitative impact on the price index from annual reweighting was greater than the impact

of moving from pricing medical inputs to pricing the cost of treating heart attacks.

             In some goods and services markets characterized by relative tranquility and stability, it is possible that use

of old weights in price index construction would not be problematic. In the health care goods and services markets,

however, the last fifteen years -- indeed, the entire post World War II era -- have been marked by dramatic changes in

the number and quality of products offered and consumed, the identity of the payers (cash vs. third party private or

government payer), and in how and by whom the services are provided (e.g., from inpatient to outpatient hospitalization,

and from fee-for-service to managed care). The pace of both institutional and technological change has been particularly

rapid in the health care sector. Moreover, the role of health care expenditures in the overall consumer budget has

changed considerably, in part because the BLS' measured MCPI has increased much more rapidly than that for the all-

item CPI (6.46% for the MCPI 1986-96, 3.65% for the all-item CPI-U over the same time period).101 We now examine
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 42 -




some of the implications of these changes for CPI and MCPI measurement.

             In the CPI hierarchical system used from January 1987 until January 1998, seven major product categories

were represented, and in the 1998 revisions an eighth was added. In Column (1) of Table 2 we present 1982-84 CEX-

based weights for the seven major product categories when they were originally introduced into the 1987 Revision of the

Consumer Price Index. As is seen there, when the 1987 basket was introduced, the Medical Care major product

category received a weight of 4.80%. Because the BLS' measured price of medical care rose more rapidly than that of

the overall CPI, the implicit budget share consistent with fixed 1982-84 base period quantity weights increased over

time; as is seen in Column (2), by December 1995 the relative importance of medical care

increased to 7.36%. This raises a number of very important issues.

             First, data from other government agencies, such as the Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA),

indicate that national health expenditures as a proportion of GDP are much higher than 7+%; for example, Levit et al.

[1998] report that in 1996, this proportion was 13.6%. Why is the CPI weight for medical care so low?

             One important reason for this difference is that the medical care CPI (MCPI) weight reflects only a portion

of total medical care outlays. Specifically, the MCPI weight incorporates only direct out-of-pocket (OOP) cash outlays,

plus direct household purchases of health insurance (including Medicare Part B), plus employee contributions to health

insurance premiums purchased through work. Significantly, the MCPI excludes employer health insurance premium

contributions, treating them as a business expense; MCPI also excludes Medicare Part A, 75% of Medicare Part B (the

fraction paid from general government revenues), as well as Medicaid outlays. More generally, the MCPI excludes all

government purchased medical services on behalf of its citizens/residents, and weights and prices only those

components paid for out-of-pocket by consumers or from payroll deductions borne by employees.102 Given this

conceptual foundation of the MCPI, it is therefore not surprising that the MCPI weight is much smaller than the share of

national health expenditures in GDP.103

             Another issue is whether the implicit relative importance of the medical care component in the CPI

(column (2) of Table 2) accurately portrayed actual average consumer budget shares in 1995. If the 1982-84 fixed

quantity weights provide a poor approximation to actual quantity weights in, say, 1995, then these implicit relative

importance percentages could be unreliable and inaccurate as well, thereby compromising the accuracy of the measured

CPI and MCPI. Thus it is of interest to compare actual budget shares with implicit relative importance percentages
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 43 -




based on fixed weights.

             Actual average budget share data based on the 1995 CEX, where budget shares are weighted averages over

the various geographical areas comprising the BLS sample, are presented in column (3) of Table 2. As is seen there, the

1995 average budget share for medical care items is 5.21%, which is substantially smaller -- 2.15 percentage points,

about 29% -- than the implicit relative importance of medical care items (7.36%) based on the BLS' fixed 1982-84

quantity weights; alternatively, by 1995 BLS use of the fixed weight index in its CPI resulted in

the implicit relative importance of medical care being about 41% larger (7.36 vs. 5.21%) than was warranted.

             The implicit relative importance of the eight major CPI components in the recently revised CPI, based on

the 1993-95 CEX and updated to December 1997, are given in the final column of Table 2. Interestingly, the new

relative importance of medical care is 5.61%. An implication of this is that because updated data from the 1993-95 CEX

replaced outdated data from the 1982-84 CEX, with the January 1998 revisions the weight given medical care fell 1.75

percentage points from 7.36% to 5.61%, a relative overstatement of 31%.

             This overstatement of the health care relative importance is greater in the 1998 major revision than it was

for the major revision eleven years earlier in 1987. Then, as reported by Ford and Sturm [1988], the corresponding

overstatement in December 1986 was 5.74% vs. 4.66%,104 at 23% still substantial but considerably smaller than the 31%

overstatement in 1998.

             There are at least three reasons why the actual budget shares could diverge so materially from implicit

relative importance based on fixed quantity weights. First, the relative quantity weights could have changed over time,

reflecting non-zero price substitutability inconsistent with the Laspeyres fixed-weight assumption. For example, it is

possible that efforts by managed health care organizations to contain medical expenditures have resulted in physicians

and hospitals performing a smaller number of laboratory tests, scheduling fewer specialist physician visits, and

shortening lengths of hospital stay. Hence it is possible that as a result of growth in managed care and other cost

containment methods, the relative quantities of medical care items for which consumers made out-of-pocket

expenditures has fallen since 1982-84.

             Second, suppose that demand for health care had a zero price elasticity of demand. In such a case, the

divergence would simply reflect overstated medical care price inflation.

             Third, if however the demand price elasticity for medical care were greater than unity (say, particularly for

those components undergoing dramatic but not fully measured quality change), then the implicit relative importance of

these items would be greater than the actual budget share, ceteris paribus.

             Which of these three reasons, or what weighted combination, contributed to the divergence between the
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 45 -




actual 1995 budget shares and implicit relative importance requires additional empirical research. Econometric studies

of demand for health care such as those based on the RAND Health Insurance Experiment report modest but price

inelastic demand; it is worth noting that the experimental design of that study in effect controlled for quality

variations.105 Additional research that focused on price measures incorporating quality change, and then evaluated the

responsiveness of demand to quality changes, would be useful.106

               The divergence between actual budget shares and implicit relative importance can also be examined on a

more disaggregated basis, such as the weights within the overall medical care major grouping, to determine more finely

which components of medical care have been particularly overweighted from 1987 through 1997. Although we have

carried out such an examination, for space reasons we do not report on that in detail here. In brief, the sources of the

aggregate MCPI weight discrepancy are numerous, but the hospital and related services component (implicit relative

importance overstated from 24% to 31%), and to a lesser extent that for professional medical services (understated, 47%

vs. 50%) and prescription drugs (understated, 12% vs. 15%), are particularly large contributors.

               These discrepancies between actual budget shares and implicit relative importance values, resulting from

the use of outdated CEX surveys, suggest that more frequent weighting could considerably strengthen the reliability of

the MCPI. The frequency of such revisions does not necessarily need to be uniform across the entire CPI, but could

involve more frequent updatings in some major product groups such as medical care than in others, e.g., housing. For

the rapidly changing medical care sector, decennial updates of weights with old weights being fifteen years out of date

before the new revision occurs, results in price indexes whose accuracy and reliability can legitimately be called into

question.107

IV.            RELATED RESEARCH ON MEDICAL CARE PRICE INDEXES


               "...the average consumer of medical care is not as interested in the price of a visit or a hospital day as he is
               in the total cost of an episode of illness."

                                                        U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare [1997, p. 13]



               For quite some time now, health economists and government statisticians have made recommendations

concerning directions toward which the pricing of medical care services should move, particularly concerning the

definition of the item or product that is to be priced. For example, already in 1962 Anne Scitovsky proposed
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 46 -




        "...an index which would show changes, not in the costs of such items of medical care such as drugs, physicians'
        visits, and hospital rooms, but in the average costs of the complete treatment of individual illnesses such as, for
        example, pneumonia, appendicitis, or measles."108

In Scitovsky [1967], this approach was implemented on an illustrative basis for five medical conditions. Notably, in the

1950s and 1960s the BLS price indexes appeared to have understated medical price inflation, in large part because

physicians "customary" pricing in an environment of extensive price discrimination began to change as the proportion of

patients covered by insurance increased.109 Hence, the BLS' alleged upwards bias in measuring medical price inflation

has not always been the indictment.

             Shortcomings in the BLS' MCPI approach, and preference for the treatment episode-outcomes adjusted

approach to price measurement, have appeared steadily since 1967; see, for example, the "Measuring Changes in the

Price of Medical Care" chapter in various editions of a well-known health economics textbook by Paul Feldstein

[1979,1983,1988], as well as the Baxter Foundation Prize Address by Newhouse [1989].

             More recently, price indexes for several specific medical treatments, taking outcomes changes into account,

have been constructed, thereby demonstrating again the feasibility and importance of the Scitovsky approach. Using

one data set of hospital claims from a major teaching hospital and another very large data set consisting of Medicare

claims, Cutler, McClellan, Newhouse and Remler [1998a,b], have contrasted input price indexes for the cost of heart

attack treatment that rise by 6.7% over 1983-94, with an outcomes adjusted index that takes into account changing

treatment regimens and a conservative valuation for the extension of life expectancy attributable to new heart attack

treatments; the latter price index increases by only 2.3% per year (in real terms, an annual decrease of 1.1%), implying a

net upward bias of 4.4% per year for an MCPI-like index.

             Similarly, Shapiro and Wilcox [1996] have constructed a price index for cataract surgery, 1969-93, and

find that a CPI-like fixed weight input-based price index increases by a factor of about nine; a preferred alternative price

index incorporating realized reduced levels of hospital services (input changes), but ignoring any improvements in the

quality of medical outcomes, increases by only a factor of three, implying an annual differential of 4.6%.

             A number of other studies, based on retrospective medical claims data, provide additional evidence that

implementation of disease or condition-specific measurement procedures that uses treatment episodes of care as a

measure of output, is in fact feasible; see, for example, other papers presented at this conference by Berndt, Busch and
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 47 -




Frank [1998], Cockburn [1998], Cutler, McClellan, Newhouse and Remler [1998b] and Shapiro, Shapiro and Wilcox

[1998].



V.        A NEW MEDICAL CARE EXPENDITURE PRICE INDEX BASED ON EPISODE TREATMENT COSTS

             One could envision an ideal medical care price index as providing accurate and reliable measures for use in

at least five very important functions: (i) the measurement of quality of life; (ii) the deflation of nominal industry output

for the calculation of real output and productivity growth; (iii) the indexing of health care benefits as a component of

employee compensation; (iv) the indexing of payments by health plans to providers of medical care; and (v) the indexing

of payments in government transfer programs. Undoubtedly, additional purposes can be envisaged. Unfortunately,

these various functions and purposes are very different, and there is no way a single index like the medical CPI (or PPI)

can provide an accurate and reliable basis for such diverse needs. The search for a single price index that meets all these

purposes is a futile one. But these diverse needs are real and important. We recommend that rather than trying to

change dramatically the conceptual foundations and measurement procedures of the MCPI and MPPI in an attempt to

accommodate conflicting needs, the BLS consider constructing and publishing, on an experimental basis, a new price

index that we tentatively call a medical care expenditure price index.

             As we have discussed in considerable detail, the CPI and PPI medical price indexes are very different, they

correspond to distinct index number concepts, and thus the appropriate uses to which they are applied must differ as

well. The CPI is, in concept, a fixed weight approximation to a cost-of-living (COL) index, where the COL index is

defined as follows: What is the minimum change in expenditure necessary to purchase the set of market goods and

services yielding the same standard of living as the set of market-purchased goods and services consumed in the base

period? The manner in which the BLS has implemented this COL definition in the case of the medical care CPI is to

define the scope of the index to apply only to out-of-pocket expenditures. The reasoning is that employer-provided

medical insurance is a non-wage part of compensation; BLS does not believe it to be appropriate to add consumption out

of non-wage compensation into the consumer expenditures that are defined, implicitly, to be relevant to the wage part of

compensation.110

             Nevertheless, even if the CPI is continued to be defined to include only out-of-pocket expenditures, there

are many important purposes for which one needs a price index covering all medical expenditures, no matter who
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 48 -




(consumer, employer-provided health insurance, or government) is the nominal payer. This, for example, would be the

concept of price change that one would want for most policy analytic purposes, such as containing medical care cost

inflation, or examining the impact of new treatment technologies.

             The PPI organizes and presents information by medical care industry, that is, hospitals, physicians' offices,

nursing homes, pharmaceuticals, and so forth. The underlying PPI concept is an industry output price index. This index

is useful for a number of purposes, e.g., comparing hospital price movements with the cost of hospital inputs (though

one of the great weaknesses of the U.S. statistical system is its inadequacy of information on industry input quantities

and input prices). Moreover, the PPI is a price index for domestic industries. It provides, for example, information

about price movements for domestically produced pharmaceuticals at the manufacturer's level. But the PPI is not a price

index for all pharmaceuticals consumed in the U.S. It excludes, for example, imported pharmaceuticals and also,

because of a definitional oddity in the U.S. national accounts, pharmaceutical production in Puerto Rico. Additionally,

the PPI includes pharmaceuticals and medical devices that are produced in the U.S. and sold abroad.

             Thus, just as the CPI does not provide a comprehensive price index for health care to U.S. purchasers,

neither does the PPI provide this information. Even though the CPI and PPI measures are useful on their own terms (and

we are not asserting that these measures are not useful or appropriate ones), there is a great lacuna in medical care price

information. The missing part, regrettably, is probably the part that is most vital for medical care policy analysis,

namely, the U.S. needs a comprehensive medical care price index for expenditures on medical care. Such a medical

care expenditure price index would apply to all purchases of medical care, and it would take into account, as the present

CPI and PPI do not, substitution by buyers or financiers of medical care across providers or industries that produce

medical care. In principle separate medical care expenditure price indexes could be constructed for public and private

sector expenditures, and for the elderly. The medical care expenditure price index would cover all consumption of

medical care goods and services, be the providers/producers domestic or from abroad. And it would, we believe, be

profitably structured around determining the costs of treating an episode of a representative set of illnesses or conditions.

VI.          WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?

             It is striking that a variety of researchers and government statisticians all agree that price measurement of

medical care goods and services is particularly difficult, that current methods of measurement can be improved by

measuring episode treatment costs and taking outcomes into account, and that research in this area should receive a high
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 49 -




priority.

                For example, about six years ago BLS economists Paul Armknecht and Daniel Ginsburg stated, "Although

it will be difficult to develop the methods for pricing total treatment, BLS is planning further research in this area."111

Four years later, Armknecht added:


                "A new dimension needs to be included in the pricing of medical services that includes outcomes, so that if
                cancer treatment results in improved survival rates, this is reflected in the index. This area appears to
                have promise and is one that also needs to be pursued as part of the research agenda in quality
                adjustment."112

The Boskin Commission made similar recommendations, stating that:

                "This new research...opens up the potential for major improvement in our understanding of the economics
            of medical care. This category should receive a substantial component of the CPI's future research investment,
            and we strongly endorse a move in the CPI away from the pricing of health care inputs to an attempt to price
            medical care outcomes...This program should explore measuring the value of time saved by new medical
            procedures and communication devices, the value of life extended and its associated quality..."113

The BLS' response to the Boskin Commission recommendations suggests considerable agreement concerning

measurement problems in the medical care component of the CPI:


            "Although we acknowledge that there have been enormous improvements in medical technology over time, we
            change are difficult to evaluate, involving changes in patient outcomes, such as improved mortality or
            reduction in pain. The BLS is continuing to support and encourage research on this topic...The BLS recognizes
            the importance of the health insurance price movements to consumers as well as to policymakers and will
            continue to search for ways to overcome the obstacles to accurate adjustment for changes in policy
            characteristics."114

                But where do we go from here? In the previous section we put forward a recommendation that the BLS

consider constructing and publishing, on an experimental basis, a medical care expenditure price index. What new

research, and what new related measurement initiatives, appear to offer the most promise if such a new price index is to

be created?

                A number of directions appear promising. First, although most of the public attention in recent years has

focused on the CPI, as we have noted several times in this paper, many measurement issues involving medical care

goods and services are common to the CPI and PPI. A medical care expenditure price index would have elements from

both the CPI and PPI programs. An obvious implication is that the CPI and PPI programs should be encouraged to

expand their joint efforts on designing research and measurement initiatives.
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 50 -




             Second, as has been emphasized by, among others, Triplett [1998a,b], complementary research efforts on

health care outcomes by medical researchers involving cost-effectiveness analyses, as well as the public availability of

large retrospective health claims data bases, now allow the BLS to build on others' research that defines and identifies

episodes of treatment. This research is particularly important were the BLS to initiate a medical care expenditure price

index program. Note that in principle, outcomes research can help somewhat in overcoming the moral hazard problem

underlying the failure of revealed preferences as measures of willingness to pay in medical care markets. Together with

retrospective claims data, the outcomes studies provide a framework for identifying medical care outputs that

incorporate quality change. What Anne Scitovsky proposed in 1962 and illustrated with a small sample of conditions in

1967, and what Health, Education and Welfare Secretary John Gardner requested more generally in 1967, is clearly

possible on a much larger scale today.

             Third, although the usual source of information for output measurement is based on actual market

transactions, use of medical outcomes data to define measures of output implies an adjustment in thinking -- to look

outside of market transactions to consider what medical resources actually do for health.115 A medical care expenditure

price index program should, to as great an extent as is feasible, combine actual transactions data underlying treatment

costs of episode of an illness, with outcomes data from cost-effectiveness and related medical studies.

             Fourth, it is likely that treatment episode price index measurement will need to be done at a very

disaggregated level of detail, for a finite number of representative illnesses or conditions. The extent of medical care

progress, as well as the underlying increases in medical scientific knowledge, have varied considerably across illnesses

and disorders, with spectacular gains in treating conditions such as cataracts, retinal detachment, schizophrenia and

cystic fibrosis, but with apparently less progress for other conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis, Alzheimer's and the

common cold. While the Hicksian aggregation assumption of common proportional price changes over time across a

variety of products may be a useful approximation within a number of other industries, for medical care it is not

plausible. As suggested already in 1969 by Martin Feldstein, for the BLS to obtain useful measures of medical care

output, it would appear to be most useful to obtain a sample of "a representative mix of illnesses".116 Research that helps

identify an appropriate mix of illnesses and their treatments, ones for which outcomes measures and/or published

treatment guidelines are available, and ones for which sample sizes in retrospective claims data bases are sufficiently

large, would seem to be particularly helpful.
PRICE INDEXES FOR MEDICAL CARE GOODS AND SERVICES –PAGE 51 -




             Fifth, the pricing of health insurance remains a difficult issue. As noted above, empirical implementation

needs theoretical foundations on how employers and employees choose health insurance, and on that issue there has not

been much theoretical effort of late. This area seems particularly fruitful for economic theorists, since potentially

complementary data are now becoming available. With funding from the AHCPR, the Census Bureau is now in the

midst of collecting data for the Medical Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS).117 This is not a one-time survey, but instead

involves a panel of 9,500 households, and links the households to the employers, the employers' set of health insurance

plans, and the health care providers. If theoretical foundations can be established, it is possible that this data base could

provide the basis for ongoing hedonic price analyses of health insurance plans.118

             However, in terms of measuring the price of health insurance, the growth of managed care makes

measurement and the interpretation of hedonic price equations more problematic. In most non-medical markets, if price

increases, it is plausible to assume that those consumers rationed out of the market had a willingness to pay that was less

than the now higher price. Although in some cases one might be able to argue that with fee-for-service medical care

rationing was reflective of willingness to pay, with managed care consumers have no way by which to reveal their

willingness to pay at the time services are delivered. The rationing that occurs is instead based on clinical grounds.

Thus the growth of managed care makes it difficult to derive economic welfare implications from the estimation of

hedonic price equations.119 This leads to suggest that in the near future, research on the construction of a medical care

expenditure price index might be fruitfully based on retrospective claims data, although research on the pricing of health

insurance policies is also likely to be important.

   Even here, matters are complex. For many brand name pharmaceuticals in the US (but not in Europe), the price per tablet is the
same regardless of strength. Moreover, in the example here it is implicitly assumed that the consumers' cost for a contraceptive
medication is not fully covered by insurance. Until recently in the US, unlike the case for most medications for which the patient
makes a copayment, for contraceptives consumers have generally borne the entire direct cost of the prescription.
13
   For an exchange of views on this, see Gilbert [1961,1962] and Griliches [1962].
14
   Since the largest cost to receiving medical care is often the patient's time cost, there are substantial incentives to develop
innovations that conserve on time, particularly when the cost of these innovations is covered by insurance.

   For simplicity, time at work is omitted.
17
   The relationship between utility maximization and index numbers relies critically on a number of assumptions. In the present
context, such assumptions might well be that the consumer chooses M, I, K and TM, given Y, PM, PI, PK (which could be zero at
the margin if knowledge is non-rivalrous), E and L, so as to maximize U in each time period. As we point out at various times in
this paper, these assumptions are likely to be particularly untenable in the medical care marketplace.
18
   The issues under discussion here involving measurement of the cost of living are very different from those raised by the Boskin
Commission, who recommended that the BLS move from a Laspeyres price index formula to a superlative index such as the trailing
Tornquist, the latter more closely approximating a much more narrow notion of a cost of living index. See U.S. Senate Finance
Committee [1996], Boskin et al. [1998], Abraham, Greenlees and Moulton [1998] and Persky [1998].
19
   We assume here that dC/dt = UX, and that the marginal price of non-rivalrous additional knowledge is zero.
20
   Pollak [1980,1998] therefore calls these aggregate price indexes "plutocratic", and contrasts them with ones he names
"democratic".

   For example, most consumers do not know the details of who they are allowed to see for cancer care in advance of being
diagnosed with cancer. Indeed, the specific benefits may depend on the severity of the cancer of the person and may change with
new knowledge about cancer treatment.

   Here we focus primarily on the CPI for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U), introduced in 1978 and representative of the buying habits
of about 80% of the US non-institutional population. An alternative index, CPI-W (wage earners and clerical workers only), was
introduced much earlier for use in wage negotiations, and represents but 32% of the US population. The methodology for producing
CPI-U is the same as that for CPI-W.

living' means the amount of money a family spends. If it buys more food and finer clothes, or moves to a roomier home, its cost of
living goes up. That interpretation is so widespread that we think the Bureau's index is misnamed." (Meany Report, p. 18).

   As noted by Catron-Murphy [1996], p. 25, Federal hospitals, such as those associated with the military, Veterans Administration
and the National Institutes of Health are excluded from both the CPI and PPI hospital universe, because there are no measurable
economic transactions between hospital and patient at these Federal hospitals -- many services are rendered free to the patient from a
budget allocated to a Federal entity.

   These findings were essentially anticipated almost thirty years earlier by John Gardner, Secretary of Health, Education and
Welfare. In his Report to the President, Gardner stated "It is difficult to adjust the drug component of the CPI for the rapid changes
in the character of the drugs prescribed. By the time a prescription item is incorporated into the index, its price may have fallen to a
lower level than in previous years." U.S. Department of Health, Education and Welfare [1967], p. 35.

   In both the Griliches-Cockburn and Berndt, Cockburn and Griliches studies, transactions were measured at the point of wholesaler
to drug store, and not at the initial point in the distribution chain, which is the focal point for the PPI.

   The relative growth rates of the published and research PPIs for the pharmaceutical industry, discussed in several earlier
paragraphs, reflect the impacts of incorporating both new generics and new branded products into the sample.
83
   One incentive for Puerto Rican production has been Section 936 of the Internal Revenue Code, which has provided tax benefits to
firms producing in Puerto Rico. It is worth noting that under the omnibus minimum wage bill enacted by the US Congress in 1996,
these tax incentives will be phased out over the next decade. Thus it is possible that the empirical significance of this out of scope
Puerto Rican production will gradually decline. It is also worth noting that active ingredients of pharmaceuticals could be
manufactured in Puerto Rico, shipped to the domestic U.S., and then be encapsulated with inert materials into tablets and capsules in
the U.S. In such a case, the BLS' PPI program would consider it as within the scope of the PPI.

    The appropriateness of this decomposition into employee out-of-pocket vs. employers' contributions depends in part on the
incidence of the income tax, and the extent to which employees are willing to substitute employers' health insurance contributions
for other forms of wage and non-wage compensation. While very important, these issues are beyond the scope of this review. For a

    For an example of ambiguous welfare interpretations of increases in a medical CPI (the treatment of depression), see Berndt,
Busch and Frank [1998] who argue that increases in patient copayments might also reflect reduced moral hazard, and thus an
indeterminate net effect on patient welfare.
