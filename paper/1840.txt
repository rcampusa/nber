     Why   Have Uneruploynent Rates in Canada and the U.S. Diverged?


                                 ABSTRACT



     Throughout the post—war period, U.S. and Canadian unemployent rates
moved in tandem, but this historical link apparently ended in 1982.
During the past three years, Canadian unemployment rates have been some
three percentage points higher than their U.S. analogues, and this gap
shows no sign of diminishing. This paper is an empirical evaluation of
a variety of explanations for this new unemployment gap.
     We first show that the demographic and industrial composition of
the two countries is remarkably similar, so that no simple mechanical
hypothesis explain the basic puzzle. It is also evident that the
increase in Canadian unemployment relative to U.S. unemployment cannot
be fully attributed to output movements. We find that the gap between
actual and predicted Canadian output, based on U.S. output, has fallen
dramatically since 1982 while the unemployment gap has widened. We also
find that unemployment in Canada was 2 to 3 percentage points higher in
1983 and 1984 than predicted by Canadian output.
     We have investigated a variety of hypotheses to explain the slow
growth of employment in Canada after 1982. These hypotheses attribute
the slow growth of employment to rigidities in the labor market that
raise employers' costs and restrict the flow of workers between
sectors. The evidence does not support the notion that the growth in
relative unemployment in Canada is due to differences in the regulation
of the labor market in the two countries. Minimum wage laws and
unemployment benefits are fairly similar in Canada and the U.S. , arid
neither has changed relative to the other in the last decade.
Unionization rates have increased in Canada relative to US. since
1970. Most of this divergence occured before 1980. however, and does
not seem to have created an unemployment gap prior to 1980. Finally,
the hypothesis that differential real wage rates are a major determinant
of relative employment in the U.S. and Canada is soundly rejected by the
data. Real wage rates have been essentially uncorrelated with employ-
ment movements within each country and between the two countries.

I. Introduction


     At the sane time that unemployment has disappeared from public

policy discussions in the U.S., it has become the major focus of

discussion in Europe and elsewhere. It is not hard to explain the dif-

ference in public interest. European unemployment rates are at post—war

highs and seem to be stuck at current levels. The U.S. unemployment

rate is high by post—war standards, but it has declined considerably in

the last four years to the point where there is now clear evidence of

labor shortages in some parts of the country

     Even more remarkable than the comparison of recent U.S. and

European experiences is the comparison of recent U.S. and Canadian

experiences. Throughout the post—war period, U.S. and Canadian

unemployment rates moved in tandem. Figure 1 displays this relationship

graphically by plotting the Canadian unemployment rate on the vertical

axis against the U.S. rate on the horizontal axis.' The historical link

between unemployment rates in the two countries apparently ended in

1982. During the past three years, Canadian unemployment rates have

been some three percentage points higher than their U.S. analogues, and

this gap shows no sign of diminishing.2

     A variety of explanations has been offered for the disparity bet-

ween U.S. and European economic performance in the past decade.3 Many

of these explanations revolve around rigidities in the labor market

attributable to government intervention or other institutional

features.4 It seems apparent that simple structural explanations for

the divergence between U.S. and European labor market performance ought

to be equally useful in explaining the U.S. and Canadian divergence, and

indeed we have heard many of the same explanations offered. Our purpose

in this paper is to examine the relationship between U.S. and Canadian

unemployment for the light it sheds on any of these explanations.

     From a practical viewpoint, a comparison of U.S. and Canadian labor

market indicators is relatively straightforward, since both countries use

the smne methods to measure these indicators.5 A direct comparison of

U.S. and European indicators, on the other hand, is complicated by dif-

ferences in survey instruments and even in the underlying concept of

unemployment.6

     Our goal Is to explore the data for the light they shed on a series

of hypotheses that attribute the divergence In unemployment rates to

structural rigidities in the labor market. Before examining these

hypotheses in detail, however, we examine the extent to which the

unemployment gap between Canada and U.S. is either a secular phenomenon,

or a result of differential business cycle movements in the two

countries. As Figure 1 suggests, we find no evidence of an unemployment

gap prior to 1981. Furthermore, the unemployment gap in 1983 and 1984

is not easily explained by movements in relative output during the

period. While Canadian output recovered from the 1982 recession at a

rate consistent with historical patterns, Canadian employment lagged far

behind, opening up an employment gap that in 1983 and 1984 explained

most of the difference in unemployment rates between Canada and U.S.

     This unprecedented increase in productivity is remarkably similar

to employment and output changes observed in many European countries

during the last decade.7 In the following section of the paper, we
                                  —3--




explore primarily mechanical explanations for the shortfall of Canadian

employment growth. We first explore the extent to which the divergence

in unemployment rates between the U.S. and Canada may be attributed to

changes in the demographic composition of employment. We then consider

the possibility that differences in the industrial composition of the

two nations, coupled with underlying differences in industrial growth

rates, may explain differences in employment growth.

     In the fourth section, we turn to arguments about structural rigi—

dity in the labor market. It is often argued that structural barriers

discourage employment growth: either by preventing the flow of workers

to new jobs; or by raising the costs of hiring new workers. Looking

first at direct government intervention in the labor market, we compare

the unemployment insurance and minimum wage laws in Canada and the U.S.

and how they have changed over the past twn decades. We then examine

the extent of unionization in the two countries and relative changes in

union coverage since 1960. The goal is to explore the possibility that

the labor market may have become more or less encumbered by non—

competitive barriers in either of these two countries.

     In the fifth section of the paper, we examine the post—war history

of real wage movements in the U.S. and Canada, and the correlation bet-

ween relative employment growth and relative wage rates. In some analy-

ses unsustainable rates of real wage growth force down the profitability

of employment and lead to higher unemployment. Direct examination of

profits data is difficult, but it is straightforward to analyze the

course of labor costs between the U.S. and Canada and test this can—
                                     —4—


didate explanation for the divergence in employment rates.

        The conclusionsfrom our structural analysis of the U.S. and

Canadian labor markets are unenlightening. We find no evidence that

minimum wage or unemployment insurance provisions have changed sharply in

Canada relative to the U.S.. In both countries, minimum wages have

declined recently relative to average hourly earnings. Canada and the

U.S. increased the generosity of their unemployment insurance plans in

the early 1970's, and have both recently taken    steps   to reduce

unemployment benefits (broadly defined). The only structural aspect of

the labor market that has changed substantially in Canada relative to the

U.S. is the extent of unionization. This change has occurred gradually

over the past 15 years, however, with relatively little change since

1980.

        Our investigation of wage behavior is similarly unenlightening.

Historically, relative wage growth and relative employment growth bet-

ween Canada and U.S. have been positively correlated. The short run

relationship between wages and employment in each country is likewise

inconsistent with the hypothesis that wage increases prevent employment

growth.     In any case, however, wages in Canada relative to their U.S.
counterparts have fallen dramatically since the mid—1970's with the

depreciation of the Canadian exchange rate. We have been singularly

unsuccessful in documenting structural differences in the U.S. and

Canadian labor markets that can explain the recent divergence in

unemployment rates between the two countries.

II. An Analysis of Recent Movements in Unemployment

     Table 1 presents some basic time series data on the U.S. and

Canadian labor markets.8 At this broad level, the labor markets of the

two countries are very similar, both in terms of labor force par-

ticipation rates and unemployment rates. Labor force participation

rates were lower in Canada in the 1950's but caught up to U.S. rates by

1975. In the late 1970's, Canadian unemployment rates were slightly

higher than those in the U.S. In 1980 and 1981, however, unemployment

rates were about equal in the U.S. and Canada.

     Our analysis is motivated by the sharply higher unemployment rates

in Canada after 1982. Table 2 presents a simple regression analysis of

the problem. In column (1), we present the least squares regression of

the Canadian unemployment rate on the U.S. rate, using data from 1955 to

1981. Over this period Canadian unemployment rates moved more or less

point—for—point with U.S. rates. An examination of the data in Figure 1

suggests that Canadian unemployment rates typically responded to changes

in U.S. rates with a lag. In column (2) of Table 2, we include lagged

Canadian unemployment as an additona1 explanatory variable. The fit of

this simple equation is remarkably good. Typically, a one point

increase in U.S. unemployment rates brings about a one—half point

Lncrease in Canadian rates within the year, and a .9 point increase

within three years. Column (3) shows that, allowing for this partial

adjustment mechanism, there is only a negligible upward trend in

Canadian unemployment rates relative to U.S. rates prior to 1982.

     Column (4) of the Table extends the regression in column (1) to the

post—1982 period, with the addition of an intercept shift. The

regression indicates a 2.8 percent increase in Canadian unemployment

rates after 1981 that is unexplained by contemporaneous U.S. movements.

Allowing for partial adjustment, the conclusion is very similar.9 While

there is no indication of an emerging unemployment gap prior to 1981,

Canadian unemployment rates after 1982 are some 2.5 to 3 percent higher

than expected.

     This simple analysis suggests that the post—1982 unemployment gap

is neither a secular phenomenon, nor a result of the timing relationship

between U.S. and Canadian unemployment. In order to pursue the timing

issue more formally, and also explore the contribution of output demand

to relative unemployment, we estimated a quarterly autoregressive fore-

casting model for the North American economy as a whole, taking as

jointly dependent variables the levels of real GNP (output), employment,
                                       10
and unemployment in U.S. and Canada.          In the data, this model has a

simple recursive structure in which the level of U.S. output is deter-

mined only by its own lagged values. This recursive structure makes it

relatively easy to form forecasts of U.S. employment and unemployment,

and Canadian output, employment, and unemployment, conditUmal on

starting values of each of these variables in 1981 and the sequence of
                                            1 :i
realized U.S. output from 1981 to 1984.            1e can then decompose move-

ments in employment and unemployment in each country, and the

unemployment gap between Canada and the U.S., into components explained

by the movement of U.S. output during 1982—84, and unexplained com-

ponents. Since the "explained components" correspond to conditional
                                  —7—


expectations, the forecast errors should be close to zero if there has

been no structural change in the link between U.S. output and the other

variables. Large and systematic forecast errors indicate a breakdown in

this linkage.

     The average annual prediction errors or "unexplained' components of

U.S. employment and unemployment, and Canadian output, employment, and

unemployment, are presented in Table 3. The unexplained components of

U.S. employment and unemployment are relatively small. In 1984, U.S.

unemployment was approximately one percentage point lower than

expected, conditional on actual U.S. output. About one—half of this

unexpected reduction in U.S. unemployment corresponded to extra

employment. The remainder is attributable to labor force morements.12

     In Canada, on the other hand, the prediction errors are large and

systematic. Canadian real CNP was about 3.5 percent lower than expected

in 1982, controlling for the simultaneous contraction in U.S. output.

Historically, output shocks in the U.S. translate into contemporaneous

Canadian shocks with an elasticity of about one—half. In 1982, the

large external shock to Canadian output was reinforced by a domestic

shock of about the same order of magnitude.13

     During 1983 and 1984, Canadian GNP continued to be lower than pre-

dicted on the basis of U.S. output, but the gap was shrinking. Based on

historical evidence, domestic shocks to Canadian output decay at a rate

of about 70 percent per year, holding constant U.S. output.14 The

post—1982 pattern of prediction errors for Canadian GNP is consistent

with a large domestic shock to GNP in 1982 and relatively small domestic

shocks after that. There is no evidence of an increasing gap in

aggregate demand during 1983 and 1984.

     In the Canadian labor market, however, prediction errors based on

realized U.S. CNP actually increased in magnitude during 1983 and 1984.

Employment was 2.8 percent less than predicted in 1982, 3.5 percent less

in 1983, and 3.9 percent less in 1984. Unemployment was higher than

predicted in all three years, although the loss in employment was larger

than the gain in unemployment in each case, reflecting an unpredicted

contraction of the Canadian labor force.

     Table 4 summarizes   the   decomposition of the Canadian—U.S.

unemployment gap into components attributable to movements in U.S. out-

put, and unexplained components. The Table makes clear that the

unemployment gap is not a result of predictable lags in the response of

the Canadian labor market to the U.S. business cycle.

     The increasing magnitude of the Canadian employment and

unemployment prediction errors In Table 3, together with the declining

output prediction errors, suggest that an output—based explanation of

the unemployment gap is incomplete. To investigate the possibility of a

breakdown of the labor market—output relationship in Canada after 1982,

we performed a second simulation of Canadian employment and

unemployment, conditional on 1981 starting conditions and realized

Canadian GNP. Again, the predictions have the interpretation of con-

ditional expectations, given 1981 conditions and the entire sequence of

Canadian GNP25 The results of the simulations are summarized in Table

expected in 1982, 2.4 percent less than expected in 1983, and 3.3 per-

cent less than expected in 1984. At the same time, unemployment was 1

percent higher than predicted in 1982, 2.2 percent higher in 1983, and

3.4 percent higher in 1984. The gap between employment growth and out-

put growth in Canada, and the corresponding increases in unemployment,

explain most of the unpredicted unemployment in Canada in Table 3 and

most of the unemployment gap between Canada and the U.S. in 1983 and

1984.

        On the basis of this evidence, we conclude that traditional

demand—side determinants of output and employment are not a major source

of the unemploynEnt gap between Canada and the U.S. Output was relati-

vely depressed in Canada in 1982, but has recovered predictably since

then. The unemployment gap, by comparison, widened in 1933 and 1984,

and seems likely to continue in 1985. In the remainder of the paper, we

examine conditions within the U.S. and Canadian labor markets that may

potentially explain the re1ati,e lack of employment growth in Canada.16

      in Canada and U.S.

        In this section we briefly summarize the demographic and industry

structures of the U.S. and Canadian labor markets. Table 6 presents the

shares of various age and sex groups in employment, unemployment and the

labor force in Canada and U.S. The Table also summarizes trends in

these shares during the last two decades, and the shares as of 1983.

    The Table illustrates several points. First, the demographic

structure of these two countries' labor forces is very similar. There

is no evidence that Canadian unemployment rates are higher because of a

greater concentration of high—unemployment groups. Second, a disporpor—

tionate share of unemployment is concentrated among young workers in

both countries. Third, the pooi of employed workers has become relati-

vely older in Canada, The employment shares of 15 to 24 year olds were

below their long run averages in both countries in 1983, but by a wider

margin in Canada. While this may account for an upward trend in rela—

tive productivity in Canada, the changes are too small and too gradual

to explain the rapid increase in Canadian productivity after 1982.

     Table 7 presents the industry composition of employment in Canada

and U.S. and compares five year employment growth rates in the two

countries by industry. Employment shares and growth rates by industry

are fairly similar in the two countries. At this level of aggregation,

there is no indication that Canadian employment is more heavily con-

centrated in slow—growth industries. The two right hand columns of the

Table give the aggregate employment growth rates in Canada and U.S. by

five year intervals. According to these data, Canadian growth rates

were about the same as TJ.S. rates from 1964 to 1969, and from 1979 to

1984, and were significantly higher than U.S. rates over the 10 year

period from 1969 to 1979. By an absolute comparison, then, Canadian

employment growth performed as well as or better than U.S. growth during

the past two decades. An absolute comparison is misleading, however,

because of the higher labor force growth rate in Canada. Equal

employment growth rates ir U.S. and Canada from 1979 to 1984 actually

lead to an increase in relative unemployment of 2.3 percent. The lack

of employment grcMth in Canada in the 1980's is better interpreted as a

relative sFrtfall than an absolute one.

     Our comparison of the demographic and industry structure of U.S.

and Canada leads us to an important conclusion: these structures are

remarkably similar. Consequently, the recent divergence between the

aggregate unemployment rates in the U.S. and Canada cannot be attri-

buted in any simple way to differences in demographic or industrial

structure. It follows that alternative, less mechanical explanations

for the divergence in unemployment rates are worth examining, and we

turn to those next.

IV. Labor Market Rigidities in Canada and U.S.

     The similarity of the industrial and demographic structures of the

Canadian and U.S. labor markets deepens the puzzle of the recent

unemployment divergence between the two countries. One explanation for

the European/U.S. divergence is the widely discussed "Euroscierosis"

hypothesis. According to this hypothesis, employment costs have

increased rapidly in Europe relative to the U.S. as a result of govern-

ment intervention in the labor market, social welfare policies, and

trade union policies. The effects of government and union regulat1ors

on hiring and firing decisions, and social policies that discourage

worker mobility, is said to be unemployment, resulting mainly from the

failure to absorb new labor market entrants.

     This "regulatory rigidity" hypothesis is rarely spelled out in a

way that encourages empirical examination, and we re unaware of any

serious analysis of it. A simple hypothesis, however, is to associate
                                       —12—


sante level of structural or "regulatory" unemployment with the extent of

regulation in each country. If the "regulatory rigidity" hypothesis is

to explain the recent divergence of U.S. and Canadian unemployment

rates, two conditions must be met. First, measures of labor market

rigidity must be roughly similar in the U.S. and Canada throughout the

1960's and 1970's, in order to explain the similarity of unemployment in

the two countries during this period. Second, there must be a sharp

increase In "rigidity"    in   1981 or 1982.

     In   what follows we select three straightforward measures of labor
market regulation for    examination. The first is an index of the minimum

wage rate, which is often alleged to operate as a barrier to the

employment of younger workers. The second is an indication of the

generosity of the unemployment insurance benefit system, which is often

alleged to cause workers to prolong their unemployment spells and to

cause explorers to initiate too many temporary layoffs. The third is

the extent of unionization of the labor force. We are aware that there

are many other rigidities in the labor market, including government and

non—government induced rigidities. Most of these are difficult to

quantify, however, and we leave our attempts to do so to further

research.

    A.      Minimum Wage Regulation

     Table 8 indicates our measures of the statutory minimum wage rate

in the U.S. and Canada arid their levels since 1966. It is conventional

to use the ratio of the minimum wage to some aggregate wage rate as an

index of the effective minimum wage. We have selected average hourly

Notes: 2jMinimum wage rates are taken from Labor Standards in Canada. The weighted relative mini—
          mumwage represents a labor—force weighted average of relative minimum wage rates by pro-
          vince and sex. For each province, the minimum wage is expressed as a fraction of average
          hourly earnings in manufacturing. Minimum wages cover essentially all workers in all
          provinces for the years Ui this table. Data for 1966—1970 was provided by R. Swidinsky.
          Data for 1971—1984 represents author's calculations.

       -"Actual minimum wage data is taken from the Social Security Bulletin Annual Statistical
         Supplement (1983). Coverage data is taken from Minimum Wage and Maximum Hours Standards
         Under the Fair Labor Standards Act (various Issues). Coverage data for 1982, 1983 and
         1984 represent extrapolations. The coverage—weighted minlrm.im wage is the product of the
         coverage ratio and the actual minimum, divided by average hourly earnings of non—
         production workers in manufacturing, excluding overtime.

earnings in manufacturing as a benchmark in each country. Minimum wages

vary by province in Canada, and we have used a labor force weighted

average of provincial relative minimum wage rates to form a national

index. In U.S. there is a uniform federal minimum wage, but coverage of

employment by minimum wage statutes is not universal. Traditionally,

the ratio of the minimum wage to average wages is multiplied by the

fraction of covered employment to obtain an effective minimum. It is

clear from the Table that as conventionally measured, the minimum wage

is typically higher in Canada than in the U.S. Without the coverage

adjustment, however, the relative minimums in the two countries are very

similar. Since 1980 the effective minimum has apparently declined in

both countries by about the same percentage amount. There is no

evidence of an increase in minimum wage regulation in Canada, either in

absolute terms or relative to the U.S.

     B. Unemployment Benefits

     Tables 9a and 9b provide a history of information on unemployment

benefits in U.S. and Canada since 1966. We present three measures of

the generosity of unemployment insurance benefits. The first of these

is the aggregate replacement rate, which measures the ratio of average
                                             17
unemployment benefits to average earnings.        We have calculated both a

gross replacement rate and a net replacement rate that adjusts for th

dLffering tax treatment of benefits in U.S. and Canada. There have been

some changes in relative replacement rates in the past two decades. In

1972, for example, revisions in the Unemployment Insurance Act in Canada

increased benefits dramatically in that country relative to the U.S.

system is the average duration of benefit spells. During the 1970's,

benefit spells in both Canada and U.S. averaged about 15 weeks. The

duration of benefits is highly sensitive to economic coriditions, and

durations were longer in U.S. in 1975 and 1976, and longer in Canada in

1978 and 1979, reflecting the relative strengths of cyclical downturns

in the two countries. In 1980 and 1981, benefit spells were about of

equal length in U.S. and Canada.

     In 1982 and 1983 benefit spells increased in both countries in

response to the downturn in economic activity. The increase was greater

in Canada, although the relative increase is roughly consistent with

historical patterns and the relative increase in unemployment rates in

Canada. Evidence on the duration of benefits does not suggest that the

Canadian unemployment insurance system is significantly more generous

from the U.S. system, or that there was a radical change in either

system in the 1980's.

     A third measure of the generosity of unemployment insurance system

is the ratio of benefit recipients to the number of unemployed workers.

In contrast to the previous two measures, which characterize

unemployment benefits for those workers who actually receive benefits,

the ratio of recipients to unemployed workers summarizes the probability

of obtaining benefits, cridit1onal on becoming unemployed. For both
                                  —15—


Canada and U.S., we calculate the probability of receiving benefits by

dividing the average weekly number of benefit recipients by the average

weekly total of unemployed workers.

     The last columns in Tables 9a and 9b present this number for Canada

and U.S., respectively. The comparison is quite remarkable. In spite

of the fact that coverage of employed workers by the unemployment

insurance system is approximately the same in U.S. and Canada, a given

level of unemployment generates about 3 times as many beneficiaries in

Canada as U.S. Some caution is required in interpreting these numbers,

since the U.S. beneficiary count only includes recipients of state

unemployment insurance benefits. The U.S. also operates unemployment

insurance schemes for veterans, federal workers and railroad workers

outside of the state system. In the 1970's, only 80 percent of average

weekly insured unemployment was covered by state programs. This number

increased to 90 percent in 1978 with revisions in U.S. law.

Nevertheless, eligibility criteria for unemployment insurance are

apparently stricter in U.S., with the result that the average ratio of

benefit recipients to unemployed workers is only about .3 in U.S., com-

pared with about .9 in Canada.

     The time series variation in U.S. benefits per unemployed worker is

pro—cyclical, reflecting cyclical movements in the fraction of

unemployed workers who are eligible for benefits.18 As noted by

Burtless (1983), the fraction of unemployed workecs in U.S. receiving

benefits has fallen in the last 5 years (controlling for business cycle

conditions). A similar decline in the ratio of beneficiaries to
                                  —16—


unemployed workers is apparent in Canada after the 1979 revision to the

unemployment insurance system there. The ratio increased in Canada in

1982, however, so that in 1984 the relative fraction of benefit reci-

pients to unemployed workers in Canada versus U.S. was as high as its

level In 1973.

     The fact that unemployed workers are more likely to receive bene-

fits in Canada as compared to U.S. is an important difference between

the countries, and the only major difference ifl their unemployment

systems that we have found. This difference has existed for at least

the past 20 years, however, and seems incapable of explaining a recent

divergence in unemployment rates. It may nonetheless account for slower

adjustment to cyclical shocks in Canada than U.S. The evidence in the

second section of this paper, however, suggests that the recent

unemployment divergence is not an adjustment phenomenon.

     C. Union Coverage

     Table 10 presents time series information on the extent of union

coverage in the U.S. and Canada. The entries for 1950, 1960, 1964, and

1970 indicate relative stability in union coverage over that period,

with a small decline in U.S. coverage during the 1960's. During   the
1970's, however, union coverage ratios diverged rapidly, with union

coverage increasing some 4 or 5 percentage points in Canada and

decreasing by about the same amount in U.S. After 1980, information on

union coverage in TJ.S. ts irregular. Coverage measures from the Current

Population Survey, which became available in 1973, stopped in 1981, and

then resumed in 1984, are roughly in agreement with coverage ratios

estimated indirectly from union membership. By 1984, these data suggest

that union coverage was twice as high in Canada as U.S.19 While this

is an important difference between the two economies, the gap in union

coverage emerged in the early 1970's, and remained relatively constant

during the 1980's. We conclude that union membership rates by them-

selves cannot explain divergent unemployment rates after 1981.

     Our conclusion from this analysis of minimum wage laws,

unemployment insurance provisions, and union coverage rates is straight-

forward. There is no direct evidence that changes in any of these

institutional features can explain the unemployment gap in Canada after

1981. Each of these features doubtless contributes to the level of

structural unemploynnt in each country. It is difficult to isolate a

dramatic change in any of these features that corresponds to the timing

of the unemployment gap.

V. Wage Rigidity and Employment

     An alternative interpretation of the hypothesis linking the regula-

tion of labor markets to unemployment att:r[hites the causation to wage

rigidity. In this view, economic shocks that require wage decreases to

restore labor market equilibrium are prohibited from working their ay

through the economic system by labor market regulattous. According to

these notions, wage rigidity is the cause of unemployment and

unemploynnt has increased recerttly because of a sequence of economy—

wide shocks.

     It is, of course, diFficult to test this hypothesis directly when

the economic shocks in question are not empirically identified, but two
                                      —18—



different aspects of this hypothesis are testable by using the corn—
parison of wage behavior in the U.S.     and   Canada.     If   it is   relative wage
rigidity   that has cause Canadian employment to grow more slowly than the

Canadian labor force relative to the U.S., then it seems that a com-

parison of the time—series path of wage behavior in the two countries is

called for. Alternatively, the relative wage rigidity explanation for

the divergence in unemployment presumes a causal relationship between an

exogenously deteniiined real wage and the employment level. We also sub-

ject this hypothesis to test in the two countries.

     A. The Path of Real Wage Rates

     Figure 2 portrays the history of the real wage rate in Canada rela-

tive to the U.S. since 1964. The wage series is the ratio of real

average hourly earnings in manufacturing in the two countries adjusted

for the real exchange rate.2° This series provides an indication of

what it costs in U.S. dollars to buy an hour of Canadian labor relative

to the cost of buying an hour of U.S. labor, and is perhaps a useful

measure of movements in relative labor costs to producers. As the

figure indicates, the cost of Canadian labor increased relative to the

cost of U.S. labor continuously until the mid_1970?s. After a sharp

fall in the   relative   cost of Canadian labor in   the   1977—80 period, this

index remained relatively stable at around the value of 1.0 in sub-

sequent periods.

     These data certainly do not provide any evidence that relative wage

rigidity is a major source of the divergence in Canadian and U.S.

unemployment rates. First, there has been no substantial            increase in

the cost of Canadian labor relative to the cost of U.S. labor in the

post—1981 period. Second, the period from 1964 to 1974 that coincided

with higher rates of growth of employment in Canada than in the U.S.

also coincided with continued greater growth in Canadian real wage rates

than in the U.S. Thus, treating exogenous real wage growth as a causal

source of employment changes is entirely contradictory with the facts.

Although the current equality in U.S. and Canadian employment growth is

consistent with the current stabIlIty in the U.S./Canadian wage ratio,

the history of relative wage growih In the two countries in earlier

periods implies a positive, not a negatIve, relation between employment

growth     and wage growth.
         B. Effects of the Real Wage    on Employment

         More direct test of the role of real wages in determining

employment are con t      ained   in Table 11. Columns 1 and 4 of the table

indicate that employment may be well described as a (weekly) damped

second—order autoregressive process in both countries. Innovations in

Canadian employment display somewhat greater variability than in the

U.S. ,    but   the rite ol change of employment is less persistent in Canada

than in the U.S.

         Causality tests of employment by the real wage are reported in row

10 of the Table. There is marginal evidence of caitality from real wage

rates to employment in both U.S. and Canada. The sums of the coef-

ficients on the real wage variables in the regressions reported In

Table 11, however, indicate a positive, but effectively negligible,

long—run relationship between real wage rates and employment in both the

U.S. and Canada.2'     In sum, we find no evidence that real wage rates

have been a factor in employment determination in either the U.S. or

Canada.

       The last column of Table 11 provides a more direct test of whether

movements in the relative wage of Canadian versus U.S. workers have been

a causal factor determining relative employment movements in the two

countries. Here we simply difference the dynamic employment equations

in the two countries and compute the regression of relative employment

on relative real wage rates directly. This specification has the

attractive features that it differences out unobservable error com-

ponents in employment demand that are common to both countries. To the

extent that input prices and productivity shocks are similar between the

two countries, misspecification in the demand equation of one country or

the other is eliminated.

       A test for coefficient equality between lagged U.S. and Canadian

variables   shows that these restrictions are not easily rejected.
Consequently, the differenced employment regression provides a powerful
test of the ro'e of relative wages in the determinatLon of relative
employment. The results are the same as whei :h test are performed for
each   country separately: there is no evidence that relative employment

and relative wage rates are negatively related.

VI. Conclusions

       We began our investigation with the puzzle set out in 'Lgure 1:

Why has the unemployment rate in Canada increased so substantially rela-

tive to the unemployment rate in the U.S.? This question is all the
                                   —21—


 more interesting because, as we have shown, the demographic and

 industrial composition of the two economies are remarkably similar. It

 seems that simple mechanical hypotheses cannot explain the basic puzzle.

      It is also evident, however, that the increase in Canadian

unemployment relative to U.S. unemployment cannot be fully attributed to

output movements. We find that the gap between actual and predicted

Canadian output, based on U.S. output, has fallen dramatically since

1982 while the unemployment gap has widened. We also find that

unemployment in Canada was 2 to 3 percentage points higher in 1983 and

1984 than predicted by Canadian output. Some caution is nevertheless

required in interpreting post—1980 movements in employment and output in

Canada, since the magnitude of the 1982 contraction was unprecedented
                       22
in Canadian history.
     We have investigated a variety of hypotheses to explain the slow

growth of employment in Canada after 1982. These hypotheses attribute

the slow growth of employment to rigidities in the labor market that

raise employers' costs and restrUt the flow of workers between

sectors. The evidence does not support the notion that the growth in

relative unemployment in Canada is due to differences in the regulation

of the labor market in the two countries. Minimum wage laws and

unemployment benefits are fairly similar in Canada and the U.S., and

neither has changed relative to the other in the last decade.

TJriionization rates have increased in Canada relative to U.S. since

1970. st of this divergence occured before 1980, however, and does

not seem to have created an unemployment gap prior to 1980.
                                 —22—


     Finally, the hypothesis that differential real wage rates are a

major determinant of relative employment in the U.S. and Canada is

soundly rejected by the data. In the time—series data, real wage rates

have been essentially uncorrelated with employment movements within each

country and between the two countries.

        'For display purposes, we have superimposed the 45    degree   line on

Figure    1. The slope of a regression line (fit to pre—1982 data) is
 .93.

        2Based on the first 7 months of data, 1985 unemployment rates in U.S.
and Canada are 7.2     percent   and 10.8 percent, respectively.


        3For an academic analysis of these disparities, see Bruno (1985).


        4The current situation stands in dramatic contrast to the 1950's and

1960's. In those years unemployment rates were significantly higher in

the U.S. than in Europe, and many economists apparently concluded that

the happy state of affairs in Europe was to be attributed to the more

interventionist government policies toward the labor market in Europe.


     5Both countries use a rotating monthly household survey to measure

unemployment and employment, and use the same definition of

unemployment.      The establishment surveys in each country, which measure
industry   employment and average hourly earnings, are also very similar.


     6Soine   of   these differences are discussed in Bureau of Labor

StatIstics (1978).


     7See for example


     8Consistent historical labor force statistics are not available for

Canada prior to 1966. We have adjusted 1954—1965 data for com-
parability with the revised labor force survey used after 1975.

      9The steady state impact of the intercept shift in column (6) is

2.6 percentage points.


      10The model was estimated on seasonally adjusted data from 1956 to

1981 with four lags of each dependent variable, quarterly dummy

variables,    a linear trend, and a trend shift variable taking effect in

first quarter 1974.


      11As an Illustration, consider the problem of forming condItIonal

fore casts of a variable y ,       given the actual values of a variable x
from t to t+j , and a recursive forecasting model:
                      xs =ax
                           s—i
                               +u s
                      y    by51 ÷ cx51 + v


Let P denote the least squares projection operator, given the above

information. Then
                                = b P(y51) + cx_1 + P(v)


Since v5       is a forecast error, it is uncorrelated with x               .   Since
                                                                      s—i

y does not Granger cause x ,           v     is also uncorrelated with

Therefore P(v) =      ru    where r is a population regression coef-

ficient. Using the forecast equation for x
                                = b P(y1) + rx + (c_ar)x51


The coefficients of this equation correspond to the coefficients of a

regression of y5 ov         x    and              .   Given a starting value for

y ,   this   equation can be iterated forward in time to obtain the

required conditional forecasts.

        12For convenience, we have defined the unemployment rate as the dif-

ference in logarithms of the labor force and employment. By definition

then, the difference in employment and unemployment represents move-

ments in the labor force.


        13There is reasonable evidence that the 1982 monetary contraction

in Canada was larger than the U.S. contraction. Historical data on

money supplies, interest rates, and the components of GNP are recorded

in appendix Tables Al and A2.


        141n annual data, the logarithm of Canadian real GNP   (Y) has
approxi mately the following time series representation:


                      = .91        —           + .56   ÷
                              Y1       .22Y2
where        is the current innovation (forecast error) in U.S. GNP, and

    represents an orthogonal domestic output shock.


     '5This interpretation follows from the fact that Canadian

nniployment and unemployment do not appear to Granger—cause Canadian

output.


            is worth reiterating that productivity per employed worker (as

measured by GNP and aggregate employment) actually increased sharply in

Canada relative to the U.S. after 1982. Thus "low productivity" is not

an explanation for relatively low employment growth in Canada. Hours

per worker in Canada have not changed substantially since 1981.
                                    —26—


     117The ratio of average benefits to average earnings may   differ   from

the average ratio of benefits to earnings if, for example, low wage

workers are more likely to receive benefits. Presumably, this bias is

about equal to U.S. and Canada.


     '8One factor effecting the ratio of recipients to unemployed

workers is the duration of unemployment spells. Unemployment benefits

are denied for the first tio weeks of an unemployment spell in Canada,

and for an average of about the first week of unemployment in U.S. If

average duration increases, the fraction of potentially eligible

unemployed workers increases. This phenomenon cannot explain higher

beneficiary ratios in Canada as compared to U.S. over the past decade

since unemployment duration (as measured by the mean length of

interrupted spells) is about equal in the two countries, controlling

for cyclical conditions.


     19An examination of unionization rates by Industry in the early

1980's suggests that union coverage rates are higher in Canada in most

industries, including manufacturing (46 percent in Canada versus 36 per-

cent in U.S.) and services and public administration (36 percent in

Canada versus 22 percent in U.S.).


     20The real exchange rate is the ratio of Consumer Price Indexes,

multiplied by the nominal exchange rate.


     21For the U.S., the sum   of   four lagged real wage coefficients is

.08 (with a standard error of .07). For Canada, the sum of four lagged
                                  —27—



real wage coefficients is .0 (with a standard error of .04). The sums

of coefficients are essentially the same vhen four lagged values of con-

sumer prices are also included in the regressions. The finding that

short run age movements are only weakly correlated with employment move-

ments in the U.S. is well known: See Geary and Kennan (1982),

Ashenfelter and Card (1982), and Symons and Layard (1984).

     22
       Annual employment and real GNP   both   fill in 1982 for the first

time in history. By comparison, the 1982 recession in U.S. was the same

order of magnitude as the 1974—75 recession.
